,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - YouTube and Walt Disney Co have cut their ties with influential Swedish social media star PewDiePie after he posted a series of videos deemed anti-Semitic. YouTube said it had canceled the second season of the comedian’s reality show, “Scare PewDiePie,” and taken his channel, which has some 53 million followers, off its premium advertising service. “We’ve decided to cancel the release of ‘Scare PewDiePie’ season 2 and we’re removing the PewDiePie channel from Google Preferred,” a YouTube representative told Hollywood trade publication Variety on Tuesday. Disney’s Maker Studios unit, which owns the  channel, told the Wall Street Journal on Monday that it was severing its ties with PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, after an investigation by the newspaper turned up nine videos featuring Nazi imagery or anti-Semitic jokes. “Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case, and the resulting videos are inappropriate,” a Maker Studios spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal. PewDiePie was among the most followed stars on YouTube, and his videos have been watched collectively more 14 billion times, according to the website. In 2016, he was on Time’s magazine’s list of the world’s 100 most influential people. In a recent stunt, he paid two people in India to hold up a sign that read “death to all Jews” and then responded to it with criticism while terming it a joke. Kjellberg, 27, defended his content in a Tumblr posting over the weekend, saying he did not endorse hate-based groups. “I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary,” he said. “I know my audience understand that, and that is why they come to my channel. “Though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive.” ","

,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years in tech startup Argo AI to help the Detroit automaker reach its goal of producing a self-driving vehicle for commercial ride sharing fleets by 2021, the companies announced on Friday. The investment in Pittsburg-based Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber, will make Ford the company’s largest shareholder. Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said the investment is in line with previous announcements on planned capital expenditures. Argo AI, which focuses on artificial intelligence and robotics, will help build what Ford calls its “virtual driver system” at the heart of the fully autonomous car Ford said last year it would develop by 2021. “With Argo AI’s agility and Ford’s scale we’re combining the benefits of a technology start up with the experience and discipline we have at Ford,” Fields said at a press conference. Once the technology is fully developed for Ford, it could be licensed to other companies, executives said. While Ford will retain a majority of the start-up’s equity, the potential for an equity stake as Argo AI hires 200 more employees will be an advantage in recruiting talent, executives said. “They have the opportunity to run it pretty independently with a board, but because it is a separate company or subsidiary, it has the opportunity to go out and recruit with competitive compensation packages and equity,” Fields said. Until now, Ford’s investments in future transportation technology have been relatively modest, compared with those of General Motors Co and others. One of Ford’s largest such investments in the past year was $75 million to buy a minority stake in Velodyne, a manufacturer of laser-based lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars. Rival GM made a billion-dollar bet a year ago with its acquisition of Silicon Valley self-driving startup Cruise Automation. GM also invested $500 million to buy a 9-percent stake in San Francisco-based ride services firm Lyft, a competitor to Uber. ","

              But a trapeze fall left her a paraplegic.
              Now she's walking again, thanks to this prototype exoskeleton, known as TWIICE.

              ""The first time that I stood up with the exoskeleton was really emotional for me. It was as if I were in a dream.""
              Made by roboticists at Switzerland's EPFL, it weighs just 14 kilograms.
              Two electric motors on each leg allow flexion and extension of hip and knee joints.
              Battery powered, it allows users to walk, turn, and climb steps, by pressing buttons on their crutch handles.
              A full charge lasts three hours.

 ,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Europe’s top utilities are planning to invest tens of billions of euros over the next three years to catch up with the green energy revolution, driving a flurry of takeovers by tech and engineering firms of niche, smart-energy innovators. Upgrading power and gas networks used to be a hardware-based affair as long as steady baseload energy sources, such as coal and gas, accounted for most power generation. But the rise of solar and wind power increased the need for intelligent IT systems that can balance out demand and supply swings while meeting energy and carbon emissions targets. This has led industrial conglomerates and technology companies to seek out small targets to complement their offering to utility clients in the wake of Google’s landmark purchase of smart thermostat maker Nest Labs in 2014. “Everywhere in the supply chain of power there is disruption going on,” said Bruce Jenkyn-Jones, co-head of listed equities at Impax Asset Management, which focuses on investments in environmental markets and resource efficiency. M&A activity is well under way in storage and smart meters, which are key in securing access to customers and, more importantly, their data, to help the utilities tailor their power purchases and save costs. Three major German meter makers — Techem [TECENC.UL], Ista [CHCAPI.UL] and Qundis — are up for sale and deals last year included Fortis buying meter maker ITC for $11.3 billion. France’s Total has snapped up battery maker Saft Groupe for 950 million euros ($1.02 billion), while Oracle took over Opower, a maker of utility software. Other niche players under the spotlight include U.S. smart meter maker Itron, power chip maker Monolithic Power Systems and data networks provider Silver Spring Networks, investment banking and industry sources said. Itron, which makes more than a third of sales in Europe, declined to comment, as did Silver Spring Networks. Monolithic Power was not immediately available for comment. Consolidation has been driven by big power firms in Europe — including Italy’s Enel and Germany’s Innogy. Together, major European utilities will spend at least 40 billion euros by 2020 to upgrade their networks, according to ongoing investment plans, including replacing old cables, buying new smart meters and putting new IT in place. The spending spree follows a decade of crisis, during which rival renewable capacity pushed many of their coal- and gas-fired power plants out of the market. They have taken tens of billions of writedowns on their conventional generation assets and are now refocusing on renewable energy and getting the most out of regulated grids. Bernstein reckons Engie and EDF from France, Gas Natural and Iberdrola from Spain, and Enel have on average increased their annual network investments by more than a fifth to a total of 14.3 billion euros. “Utilities will keep spending on networks and industrials and tech groups will keep making selective deals to address this,” a senior banking source said. Goldman Sachs reckons power firms will stump up a total of 62 billion euros by 2025 to digitalize their grids, attracting players from numerous sectors. “There needs to be a consolidation so that customers will have access to a broader set of solutions,” said Thomas Guennegues, senior equity analyst at Swiss boutique investment firm RobecoSAM. In Europe, big conglomerates, including ABB and Siemens are so far seen as the leading integrated providers of smart grid technology and hardware, simply because they already cover a wide range of sectors, including IT. “Sometimes it is hard to draw the line between IT and industrials. A company like Siemens is a bit of both,” Frederic Fayolle, senior fund manager at Deutsche Asset Management, said. General Electric in November bought Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io to expand its platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants to databases and analytical software. Utilities, however, are likely to stay out of the game. “I doubt that a utility can compete with Siemens, GE, nor with Google and Apple,” said Oskar Tijs, senior investment analyst at NN Investment Partners. “On the grid side, the utilities will be mostly clients of technology companies.” ($1 = 0.9357 euros) ","

 ,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"ROME (Reuters) - Facebook must do much more to stamp out hate speech on its site, the president of Italy’s lower house of parliament said, warning that rising abuse on various social media was being fueled by fake news. Laura Boldrini, herself often the focus of sexist insults and online threats, complained to Facebook managers in November about hate speech on the social network and put forward several proposals on ways to deal with the problem. “Two months after our meeting, they have done nothing. They have not even written to me about what I said. Good manners would have expected at least a reply,” Boldrini told Reuters in a gilded, art-filled room in the parliament building. She said she would write an open letter to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week reiterating her call for a more effective and timely policing of his site. “His platform risks becoming home to dangerous predators ... the company has to take responsibility for this,” she said. In a statement, Facebook said it was committed to battling hate speech and fake news, and was working closely with various institutions in Italy to deal with cyber bullying. Facebook, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Microsoft agreed last May to an EU code of conduct to tackle online hate speech,  pledging to review the majority of valid requests for removal of illegal abuse within 24 hours in Europe. However, in a report released in December, the European Commission said only 40 percent of hate speech was being reviewed within 24 hours, with wide variations from country to country. In Italy, just four percent of hate posts were being removed within a day, the report said. Boldrini, who is the third most senior official in Italy behind only the president and the president of the upper house Senate, says she is regularly deluged with abuse and in November published a selection of the offending comments. “Boldrini, you are a handicapped whore,” says one. “Why has no one killed this terrorist,” says another. Despite flagging such insults to senior Facebook managers, many still remained on her homepage, she said. One of her requests was for Facebook to open a full office in Italy to deal with its 28 million users in the country. At present, Italian complaints are handled at the company’s European headquarters in Ireland, but Boldrini said the firm had not told her how many of its employees there spoke Italian. Boldrini, a former spokesperson for the United Nations Refugee Agency, said many of those who abused her on Facebook had been spurred on by malicious, fake news articles about her. These included stories about her saying migrants should get housing before locals, that Italian women should wear the veil or that her long-dead sister was making money from migration. “Fake news and hate go together. It is not being done as a joke. They are looking to discredit their adversaries. It is short-circuiting democracy,” she said. Boldrini last week launched a campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of false information, saying they raised a threat to ordinary people - such as lies spread deliberately about vaccinations for children or health scares. “Fake news is harming people and spreading hate. Hate is poisoning the well,” she said. ","

 ,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish music streaming service Spotify will move its U.S headquarters and more than double its workforce in the country by next year, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday. Spotify, one of Europe’s most highly valued venture-backed startups, which is reportedly considering a potential U.S. stock market listing, has not yet shown a profit as it spends to grow internationally. The firm will move its New York office to the World Trade Center from the Midtown South area of Manhattan, adding more than 1,000 new jobs while retaining 832, the governor said in a statement. He added Spotify, which has about 2,000 employees, will get up to $11 million in rent reduction from Empire State Development. The firm, founded in 2006, has the music streaming industry’s biggest paid subscriber base, with 40 million users paying to listen. But the majority still tune in for free with commercial breaks. Alphabet’s Google Music, YouTube and Apple Music compete with Spotify to attract users prepared to pay for music, as does Pandora Media Inc and rapper Jay Z’s Tidal. Spotify, based on a funding round in 2015 had a value of over $8 billion, reported an operating loss of 184.5 million euros ($195.5 million) in 2015, up from 165.1 million in 2014.

 ,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"Supported by The wind industry crossed an important threshold in the United States last year, exceeding the generating capacity of hydroelectric power for the first time, according to the main industry trade group, the American Wind Energy Association. The nation’s fleet of dams has long stood as the top renewable energy source, but there has been little market interest in building more big hydroelectric generating stations. In the meantime, wind has rapidly expanded — more than tripling in capacity since 2008 — with many more installations on the way. The comparison here is limited, measuring the maximum amount of power that generating stations are rated to produce — a threshold few, if any, ever meet. According to the Energy Information Administration, conventional hydroelectric generating capacity stood at 78,956 megawatts in 2015, while wind, the industry group says, reached 82,183 megawatts last year, about enough to run 24 million average American homes. (The hydroelectric figure does not include pumped storage, in which water pumped to an elevated reservoir can be released through a turbine to generate electricity when needed.) But hydroelectric power could still lead in terms of actual production: According to the Energy Information Administration’s most recent annual electric power report, hydroelectric edged out wind in terms of power sent to the grid by roughly 30 percent in 2015, though both forms trailed fossil fuels and nuclear power by wide margins. Any power plant’s potential output can be diminished by a number of factors, including market conditions that render its electricity uneconomical, shutdowns to fix or maintain equipment, orders to curtail unneeded production from system operators and fuel shortages. This is particularly the case for renewable energy sources, whose fuel depends on ever-shifting weather patterns to keep clouds from shading the sun, fill rivers with water and make the winds blow. Among generators that do not primarily rely on fossil fuels, nuclear plants are the most efficient — they ran at 92.3 percent of their capacity in 2015 — followed by hydroelectric at 35.8 percent that year and wind at 32.2 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration. (Those figures reflect the energy actually generated as a percentage of what a plant could have produced at full, continuous operation during the same period.) Technological advances in wind design, including taller turbines with longer blades that can harvest energy from a greater variety of winds, are leading to increased efficiency. According to the Department of Energy, projects built in 2014, for instance, ran at 41.2 percent of their capacity the next year. The main fuel driving the robust spread of wind farms across the country — with a dense cluster sweeping up from Texas through the Great Plains — has been a combination of federal tax incentives and state mandates requiring utilities to buy renewable energy as part of their strategies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to stem climate change. The federal tax incentive favored by the industry, the production tax credit, was worth 2.3 cents a kilowatt-hour of electricity sent to the grid by projects that began construction in 2015 and 2016, but it is scheduled to phase out by the end of 2019. (In 2015, the average home consumed about 900 kilowatt-hours of electricity a month.) As long as that schedule remains, industry executives say, they should be able to meet their goal of supplying 10 percent of the nation’s electricity by 2020, more than twice the share they accounted for in 2015. There is, of course, no guarantee that Congress will maintain the tax credit as planned, or that other potential changes to the tax system won’t make the economics of wind less favorable. Although the new administration appears far less focused on making carbon dioxide reductions a priority in its energy policy, wind executives say their industry can help reach some of President Trump’s other goals. Those include building new infrastructure — like, say, transmission lines to carry wind power from where it’s made to where it’s needed — and bolstering manufacturing and creating jobs, especially in rural areas. According to the Department of Energy, the wind industry now employs almost 102,000 workers, up 32 percent from 2015, while the Department of Labor projects wind service technician as the nation’s fastest-growing occupation over the next decade.

 ,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"Feb 9 (Reuters) - Wind energy has surpassed hydropower as the biggest source of renewable electricity in the United States following the sector’s second-biggest quarter ever for new installations, a wind industry trade group said on Thursday. Wind installations totaled 82,183 megawatts at the end of 2016, enough to power 24 million homes, the American Wind Energy Association said in its fourth-quarter market report. By comparison, U.S. hydroelectric capacity stands at about 80,000 megawatts, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. Wind installations soared to 6,478 MW in the fourth quarter, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all of last year’s wind installations. The fourth quarter was the industry’s largest for installed capacity since the fourth quarter of 2012. The 8,303 MW added for the year represented more than $13.8 billion in investment. Just three turbine makers - General Electric Co, Vestas Wind Systems A/S and Siemens AG — accounted for up to 95 percent of the U.S. turbine market in 2016. Texas has more than 20 MW of installed wind capacity, or nearly a quarter of the market. Iowa is the second-biggest wind state, and Oklahoma overtook California for third place at the end of 2016. The first offshore wind project in the United States also came online in the fourth quarter, the 30 MW Block Island wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. More than 10,000 MW of wind is under construction in the United States, about half of which is in Texas. New Mexico’s wind industry is growing rapidly, with 1,300 MW under construction. Once completed, those projects will double the size of New Mexico’s installed wind capacity. Corporations and others outside the utility industry have become major purchasers of wind energy, accounting for 39 percent of capacity contracted in 2016. Projects for Google, Amazon and General Motors were completed in the fourth quarter.   (Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Dan Grebler) ","

 ,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"Advertising sales, which accounts for half of the company’s total revenue, fell 2.8 percent to $1.80 billion partially due to fewer NFL Thursday night football games this quarter as well as lower-than-expected ratings for those games. On a call with analysts Wednesday, CBS Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves said that CBS was in talks with the NFL about new formats to speed up games to help with ratings, but he said CBS would not cut ads. “If there are ways to do advertising in different ways, we are looking at that,” Moonves said. Moonves emphasized he still views NFL as “the premier property in all of media.” CBS, which is home to popular shows such as “NCIS” and “The Big Bang Theory,” has been facing a slowdown in its advertising revenue as advertisers shift more dollars from TV to online. To address this, the New York-based broadcaster, which also owns cable network Showtime, is focused on shifting its revenue stream from advertising to streaming video providers as more viewers watch their favorites shows online. CBS said it is on track to exceed its goal of having 8 million subscribers for its online streaming video service, All Access, and its online streaming Showtime service by 2020. Overall, the company said advertising benefited in the quarter from political spending at local television stations in the wake of U.S. presidential elections late last year. The company is very close to renewing its hit, “The Big Bang Theory” for another two years, Moonves said on a post-earnings call. The company earned $1.11 per share on an adjusted basis, beating estimates of $1.10 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue fell 2 percent to $3.52 billion.

A Bloomberg report this morning states that Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei, which uses Google's Android operating system for its phones, is developing its own voice-activated AI assistant. According to the report, Huawei's AI assistant, which will use local languages in China for communication, is targeted at the Chinese market and is intended to compete with the likes of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) Siri and Amazon.com, Inc.'s (AMZN) Alexa. This is the second such announcement after Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd (SSNLF), which also uses Google's mobile operating system in its phones, announced its own digital assistant last year. (See also: Samsung Acquires AI Assistant Built By Siri's Creator.) Together, Huawei and Samsung control a sizeable portion of the smartphone market.

(See also: Alexa, Who Won CES This Year?) Google launched Google Assistant with its Pixel phones last October. The assistant underpins the company's AI strategy, which consists of installing Google Assistant across multiple brands and smart devices – from smart speakers to wearable tech to mobile phones. The Pixel phone's recent ""Actions by Google"" feature enables users to control third-party applications, such as Netflix, Inc.'s (NFLX) movie streaming app, through voice commands. (See also: Google Sold 1 Million Pixel Phones Last Quarter.) There are several reasons why smartphone manufacturers are wary of installing Google's AI assistant on their phones. Some of them are regulatory. For example, Google is not allowed to operate its services in China. Thus, smartphone manufacturers are concerned that installing Google Assistant would result in an incomplete user experience for Chinese users. Other issues are related to control of the Android ecosystem. Unlike Amazon, Google has refused to release its assistant as a standalone app that can be pre-installed. According to reports, the AI assistant could enable the company to exert greater control over the Android ecosystem. Currently, the operating system has branched out in multiple directions because smartphone manufacturers have customized it to suit their ends and the vision for their phones. (See also: Can Google Assistant Become the Company's Next Search Engine?)

Michelle Castillo,02162017,CNBC,02092017,"Google's project to create balloon-based global Internet access is hovering closer to reality. Project Loon, an effort from Google's X ""moonshot"" development program, is a network of balloons that will provide high speed Internet access to remote areas of the globe. Today, the company announced its algorithms can now tell groups of balloons to hover in one area where Internet is needed, Google's ""Captain of Moonshots"" Astro Teller wrote in a post on Medium on Thursday. The Project Loon team was able to launch its balloons from Puerto Rico and direct them towards Peru, where they stayed for as long as three months. Initially, the company planned to create rings of balloons around the world that would move to regions that needed access. The new hover process can move balloons in a matter of weeks instead of months. Though more testing needs to be done - and there's still no news on when Project Loon will officially be in use -  this method is more cost effective and less work to manage. Google credited the improvement to machine learning -- a set of techniques by which computer programs crunch huge amounts of data in order to improve efficiency. Google has portrayed itself as a leader in the field, with CEO Sundar Pichai pointing to rapid improvements in areas like language translation. Google isn't alone in wanting to provide Internet around the world. Facebook's Aquila is a solar-powered plane that hopes do the same, but it suffered a ""structural failure"" when landing during its inaugural flight. ",Google X boasts big improvement in Project Loon
Anita Balakrishnan,02162017,CNBC,02092017,"The car project at Google-parent Alphabet paid some workers so much that they built a nest egg and ditched the company, according to a Bloomberg report. Some long-time staffers were paid so much that eventually they ""didn't need the job security anymore,"" people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg in a report published Monday. The sometimes multimillion-dollar paychecks were part of an ""unusual compensation system"" that started in 2010 and included performance-based compensation, bonuses and equity, Bloomberg reported. Some even called the payouts ""F-you money,"" Bloomberg reported. Google declined to comment on the report to CNBC. The self-driving car project, now called Waymo, has since gotten a more uniform pay structure, a source told Bloomberg. Over the past year, Alphabet has trimmed some of the ""other bets,"" leading some analysts to question the company on whether it was shedding its key talent in the process.

Ari Levy,02162017,CNBC,02092017,"If you want to see why Snap's costs are so high, look to the clouds. Snap said in an updated IPO filing on Thursday that, on top of its previously disclosed deal to spend $400 million a year on Google's cloud services, the company is spending $1 billion over the next five years with Amazon Web Services. Snap broke out the spending per year with AWS, revealing that in 2017 it will spend $50 million on AWS, with the amount rising over time. Still, that means Snap's cloud hosting costs this year will total $450 million, or about $45 million more than the company generated in revenue in all of 2016. The AWS deal is ""for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations,"" Snap said. In other words, the company can't be entirely dependent on Google to quickly deliver videos and photos while also handling data storage. Cloud services have been instrumental in enabling young companies like Snap to get off the ground and grow rapidly without needing to bulk up on expensive servers, storage arrays and networking gear. But renting all that equipment gets costly for 158 million daily active users. So Snap also dropped this line in its update: ""In the future, we may invest in building our own infrastructure to better serve our customers."" ","Snap cloud bill for AWS, Google cloud higher than 2016 revenue"
Harriet Taylor,02162017,CNBC,02092017,"Humans should spend more time worrying about other humans rather than obsessing about AI powered robots turning evil, said Eric Schmidt,  executive chairman of Google parent company Alphabet. ""One of my friends Andy McAfee says that the humans will revolt before the computers do,"" he said. McAfee is a scientist at MIT. Schmidt added, ""there's so much else going on that we should worry about ourselves. My personal view.""  The comments came at the RSA Conference in San Francisco Wednesday night. Other tech luminaries, like Elon Musk, have expressed concern that AI could eventually surpass human intelligence, then turn on us and destroy us. For instance, Musk recently said that it was ""critical to the future of humanity"" that we use AI to augment rather than replace human abilities. But Schmidt thinks this apocalyptic scenario is more suited for science-fiction movies than real life. ""That, by the way, is a movie, OK? That's a movie, it's not true. Can we start over? It's a movie. It has not occurred yet, we're still here,"" he said. ""And, more importantly, the scenario has an enormous number of assumptions."" When it comes to artificial intelligence, the most interesting advancements are being made in computer vision - now better than human vision in many instances - which has huge impacts on healthcare and transportation, he said.

Anita Balakrishnan,02162017,CNBC,02092017,"Technology has entered a new era where the most powerful companies will continue to make gains more and more quickly — and most founders and investors don't fully understand the implications, according to Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator's parent company. Altman wrote a letter on Tuesday warning young companies to tread carefully when trying to compete with the regulatory advantages and unbeatable scale of tech's dominant brands. Instead of trying to be the next Facebook or Apple, founders must strike where those companies are weak, Altman said. Here's what Altman wrote to start-up founders that envision themselves as the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg: Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have powerful advantages that are still not fully understood by most founders and investors. I expect that they will continue to do a lot of things well, have significant data and computation advantages, be able to attract a large percentage of the most talented engineers, and aggressively buy companies that get off to promising starts. This trend is unlikely to reverse without antitrust action, and I suggest people carefully consider its implications for startups. There will of course be areas where these companies are naturally weaker, and these are good areas to start companies. With Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all near record high stock prices, their total market capitalization of about $2.5 trillion accounts for about 13 percent of the S&P 500, according to Factset. Y Combinator, a program that mentors and invests in start-ups, has backed companies like Reddit and Dropbox. Altman's annual letter showed that Y Combinator's portfolio is on track to surpass a $100 billion total valuation. In the letter, Altman also said that he would teach a new free online course with advice for start-ups.

Kathleen Elkins,02162017,CNBC,02092017,"After graduating from the University of Chicago, Grant of Millennial Money found himself unemployed, living at home with his parents, and with a bank account balance of $2.26. ""That was a huge wake-up call for me,"" the now 31-year-old, who goes by his first name exclusively, tells CNBC. ""I remember thinking, 'I never want to feel like this again in my life.' I took a screenshot of my bank account as motivation and made it my personal goal to have $1 million in assets in five years."" He landed a digital marketing job that paid $50,000 a year, but ""quickly realized this just wasn't going to be enough money. I wasn't going to be able to get ahead making this and saving 5% to 10% of my income."" Grant's solution was to start a side hustle building websites. ""The first website I built was a $300 one for a law firm,"" he tells CNBC. ""That law firm ended up recommending me to another law firm, and in six months, I went from charging $300 per engagement to $5,000."" Within a year, he sold his first $100,000 project and decided to quit his full-time job to focus on growing his consulting business. Five years after taking the screenshot of his $2.26 balance, Grant hit seven-figures. In a post on his blog, Grant, who now lives in Chicago with his wife, outlines the five steps he took that helped him turn $2.26 into $1 million. ""I can't guarantee that you will have the same results, but if you follow even just a few of these steps, you are likely going to be much better off financially than you are today,"" he writes. 1. Get paid what you're worth ""The number one thing that will dictate your future earning potential and get you to $1 million the fastest is how much money you are being paid today,"" Grant writes. ""Unfortunately, you probably aren't being paid what you are worth."" The simplest way to boost your earning potential is to ask for a raise. Grant recommends looking at the salary range for someone with your level of experience in your industry, which will help you understand what you're worth. Then take that information to your boss and emphasize what you bring to the company. Remember, ""it doesn't hurt to ask,"" he tells CNBC. ""A lot of people are ultimately afraid that people are going to say no, and so they undervalue themselves and they undervalue their services."" 2. Save a ton of money … and put it to work ""In order to build wealth you need to be making as much money as possible on your money,"" Grant writes. ""Because you can only make so much money at any career, investing is truly the key to wealth."" During his five-year journey to seven figures, Grant saved 50% of his income. Today, despite his financial success, he still focuses on living simply and sets aside 40% to 50%. The key, Grant says, is to make things automatic: ""Talk to your HR company and have them start depositing at least 20% of your income directly into an investment account before you even see it. This is 20% of your income AFTER contributing to your 401(k). I have mine automatically deposited directly into my Vanguard investment account and the money then gets automatically invested into a mixture of index funds."" 3. Develop multiple streams of income After you've maximized your earning potential and are saving a good chunk of your salary, focus on increasing your revenue streams, by finding a part-time job, starting a side hustle or establishing passive income. ""If your goal to build wealth you need to master the side hustle and make money other ways than just your full-time job,"" Grant writes. ""This can really be anything, including driving for Uber, consulting, or building websites on the side."" Once you start making money from your side gig, invest 100% of the profits, says Grant: ""Once you find a great side gig, you will be tempted to spend that money in your everyday life as your bank account grows — but I strongly recommend you think of your side hustle as a key to building wealth (over the long term) instead of just being rich today."" 4. Invest in what you know While Grant is a big believer in simple index fund investing, he allocates 20% of his investment capital towards individual companies like Apple, Amazon and Google. If you're going to invest in individual companies, go with what's familiar, he says: ""Look at the products you use and consume every day; then research the fundamentals of those companies so you can learn more about their investment potential."" It's a strategy that investing legend Warren Buffett lives by. The billionaire only invests in companies that are within his ""circle of competence,"" a concept he first described in his 1996 Shareholder Letter. Simply put, stick to what you know. ""Defining what your game is — where you're going to have an edge — is enormously important,"" Buffett says. Once you've done that, buy and hold. 5. Monitor your net worth ""I look at my net worth every day when I wake up in the morning and have my morning coffee,"" Grant writes. ""There are few greater motivations than seeing this number rise over time. No matter where you start from. I have been tracking my net worth for the past five years and my first balance was $2.26."" He monitors his net worth using Mint.com, which allows you to link all of your financial accounts and displays your assets and liabilities. (Personal Capital does something similar.) Plus, it tracks your spending. ""At the end of the each year I take a deeper dive into this data and track what I have spent the past year on everything so I can work to improve my spending,"" he writes. If bad habits are holding you back, don't fret.

Ari Levy,02162017,CNBC,02092017,"At next Sunday's NBA All-Star game in New Orleans, the first-place Golden State Warriors will make up a quarter of the Western Conference's roster, with head coach Steve Kerr running the show. The Warriors, following a record-breaking campaign in 2015-2016, are winning a staggering 84 percent of their games this season, thanks in part to the free agent addition of four-time NBA scoring leader Kevin Durant to an already stacked starting lineup. Life in the Bay Area is good, in sports as well as in business. And judging by how immersed the Warriors are in technology, the two are hardly disconnected. In fact, there's a distinct symbiosis between the remarkable three-year run of the Warriors and the region's booming tech industry, which now includes three of the world's six most valuable companies— Apple, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. In January, the Warriors broke ground on the new Chase Center in San Francisco — right next door to the future home of ride-hailing giant Uber. As they've turned from perennial losers to feared juggernaut, the Warriors have also become a test bed for cutting-edge technology on and off the court. Software runs throughout the organization, whether for improving shot selection, optimizing recovery from injuries or communicating with fans. ""I like to tell people I work in the world's coolest start-up,"" Kirk Lacob, the 28-year-old assistant general manager of the Warriors and son of majority owner Joe Lacob, told CNBC in an interview at the organization's headquarters in Oakland, California. The elder Lacob is a veteran venture capitalist from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. When he bought the team in the summer of 2010, he joined forces with entertainment mogul Peter Guber and formed an ownership group replete with big money techies, including YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley and venture investors Mark Stevens, Bob Kagle, and Chamath Palihapitiya. This means the Warriors are one phone call away from any executive in Silicon Valley—and the same is mostly true in reverse. Athos, a developer of smart apparel that contains sensors to monitor conditioning, counts Palihapitiya as a co-founder and principal investor. That relationship led to an intro to Joe Lacob, who invested himself 2014. Thanks to these connections, Kirk Lacob began evaluating the company's technology for the Warriors at the prototyping stage, before Athos had much of anything available for trialing. ""I couldn't even let Kirk or any of the players try it,"" said Jake Waxenberg, director of brand strategy at Athos in Redwood City, California. ""We had one pair of shorts with wires in it."" Athos is now being used for the Warriors NBA Development League team in Santa Cruz, where Kirk's younger brother Kent is general manager. Kirk said he looks to Santa Cruz as a testing ground for technologies that aren't proven out enough for the NBA team. Second Spectrum's technology is already there. The company's software uses cameras to collect data from every player move, shot and pass, so teams can analyze with deep granularity everything that's happening during the game. Is Steph Curry adding too much arc to his shot? What happens when Curry and Draymond Green use the pick-and-roll against certain defenders? The Warriors signed on for the 2014-2015 season, the year they won their first NBA title in 40 years. Stevens, a former venture capitalist from Sequoia and a member of the Warriors' ownership group, invested in the technology when the founders were coming out of the University of Southern California, where Stevens previously donated $22 million to start an innovation center. Rajiv Maheswaran, Second Spectrum's co-founder and CEO, said that when he first went to meet the Warriors at the practice facility in Oakland to show off the technology, the whole management team seemingly showed up. ""We've had intros to lots of teams, but the Warriors are the only ones who brought everyone of significance to the first meeting,"" he said. ""They signed us up and then won the championship. I'm sure that has everything to do with us,"" he joked. Second Spectrum now works with 22 NBA teams, though the Warriors were one of the first. The Warriors certainly can't attribute all — or even most — of their success to technology. Curry was already a Warrior before the new ownership team took over, and the outperformance of Klay Thompson and Green relative to their positions in the 2011 and 2012 drafts, is more the result of talent, scouting and good luck. But would Durant have left Oklahoma City, where he'd played since 2008, without the allure of Silicon Valley? Athletes are all looking for lives outside of basketball. Curry started a social media platform called Slyce last year, and defensive star Andre Iguodala has invested in start-ups with names like Maven, Walker & Company and TeeSpring. Former Warriors big man Jermaine O'Neal is an investor in Athos. When the Warriors made their pitch to Durant at the beginning of July, they used a virtual reality presentation (on a Samsung Gear VR headset) to show him a day in the life of the Warriors. ""I told him, you sign with us, any of this stuff is your playground,"" Kirk Lacob said. ""Make your decision based on basketball and your own happiness, but understand this is a positive externality when you're here."" Durant's presence and team-leading 25.7 points a game has brought added enthusiasm and intrigue to a team that's now sold out over 200 straight home games. Durant returns to Oklahoma City on Saturday night as the Warriors face off against the Thunder and All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook. Even with fans plenty engaged, the Warriors aren't sitting still. This week, the company rolled out a partnership with a San Francisco-based start-up called Feed.fm to provide additional interviews, analysis and even music from the players' playlists. Fans can access the service called Warriors Sound from the team's website. ""We work closely with the team to figure out what music works best around their marketing efforts,"" said Feed.fm founder and CEO Jeff Yasuda, who's been working in digital music for over a decade. ""Music is a huge part of the culture of the NBA and the culture of the Warriors."" Zoom CEO Eric Yuan was so excited to get the Warriors to use his company's video-conferencing software, he's been willing to foot the bill. Last year, Zoom signed a three-year deal with the Warriors, giving the team video technology to communicate with fans through online question-and-answer forums and for business meetings. In exchange for its technology and services, as well as Zoom conferencing rooms in the arena and a healthy chunk of change, Zoom gets some serious branding. Yuan said during almost every home game, he gets a text message from a customer or two with a picture of Zoom's logo from the scoreboard, or on a digital sign somewhere in the arena. That kind of marketing helps him close deals faster, because it gives prospective customers a sudden shot of confidence, he said. ""It actually speeds up sales cycles,"" said Yuan, whose company just raised $100 million from Stevens' old firm Sequoia. The Warriors won't always be the best team in the league -- that's just the reality of sports. But right now, there's a virtuous cycle that could seemingly last a while. A core of young, immensely talented players lures emerging tech companies who want their products in the hands of the Warriors and are willing to provide sweetheart deals to make it happen. Add to that, an ownership group filled with techies — and immediate proximity to the world's greatest innovation hub — and you have the top free agents wanting to join the fun. In Kirk Lacob's words: ""We're trying to better stack the deck for ourselves so that we can continue to put a great product on the floor."" ","Golden State Warriors, Silicon Valley tech industry enjoy close ties"

Anita Balakrishnan,02162017,CNBC,02092017,"Silicon Valley's pro-immigration salvo is as much about emotion as it is about tech talent, Geoff Yang, co-founder and partner at Redpoint Ventures, told CNBC on Friday. ""There's the dollars and cents and the numbers piece of it, but there's also the emotional, philosophical piece of it, because the spirit and culture of Silicon Valley is like a Horatio Alger story on steroids — where anyone can come from anywhere and achieve anything,"" Yang told ""Squawk Box.""  ""At least that's what people like to believe, the ethos."" Yang said that rag-to-riches myths in the technology industry are part of what is driving the nearly unified front against President Donald Trump's recent executive order restricting travel for people from seven majority-Muslim countries. Nearly 130 technology companies have filed an amicus brief opposing the ban, which has been temporarily halted by courts. Industry leaders like Google's Eric Schmidt have also supported skilled immigration reform, which more directly affects the bottom line of technology companies. ""Having some of the brightest people come from all over the world to come study and eventually work in the United States is a plus,"" Yang said. ""If anything, I think there's a talent shortage in Silicon Valley. ... If there's really good talent, we will try to find a way to take advantage of it and bring them into our companies."" Still, Yang said, there are a lot of positive feelings around politics at Pebble Beach in California, where CEOs from around the country are gathered for AT&T's annual pro-am golf tournament. ""It feels pretty good,"" Yang said. ""Certainly the president's growth policies and the optimism and the euphoria around a new economy is definitely felt out here."" Yang's comments come amid regulatory scrutiny of big telecom mergers, like a deal between AT&T and Time Warner that has been skewered by PresidentTrump, but considered favorably by his FCC pick. Yang is a board member of AT&T, which in October agreed to purchase Time Warner, streamlining the delivery of content like CNN and HBO to its wireless phone and broadband customers. As the distinction between traditional and digital fades, content and delivery companies will want to be tightly integrated, Yang said. ""People are going to view content on every piece of glass,"" Yang said. ""They'll view it on their mobile device, they'll view it on their tablet, they'll view it on their TV."" Redpoint was also an investor in digital companies like TiVo, Myspace and Tastemade. ""The demise of traditional television is a little overexaggerated in terms of the timing,"" Yang said.

It didn't take long for Google's biggest cloud customer to split its allegiances. Just a week after Snap (NYSE:SNAP) announced it signed a $2 billion five-year contract with the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company, it signed a $1 billion contract with Google's biggest cloud competitor -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Snap will continue to use Google Cloud for the core Snapchat functionality. The Amazon Web Services contract is for ""redundant infrastructure support of our business operations,"" according to Snap's amended S-1 filing. The new filing also revealed Snap has been using Amazon for nearly a year, so not much will change in the near term. But the way Snap's contract is structured with Amazon, it could be spending nearly as much on AWS five years from now as it is on Google Cloud. It's worth taking a closer look at Snap's cloud contracts. Image Source: Snap. Year Amazon spending Google spending 2017 $50 million $400 million* 2018 $125 million $400 million* 2019 $200 million $400 million* 2020 $275 million $400 million* 2021 $350 million $400 million Source: Snap S-1. *Snap has the option to defer up to 15% of the amount to the subsequent year. Snap uses Google for most of its heavy lifting today. That might change in five years. While Amazon just provides redundancy for Snapchat to ensure the app doesn't suffer significant downtime right now, it could grow into a much bigger partner for Snap. That's evident by the ramp in minimum obligations. Google still has a big advantage over Amazon. Snap built Snapchat on Google's Cloud Platform. Transition to another cloud provider ""would be difficult to implement, and may cause us to incur significant time and expense,"" it said in its S-1. What's more, Snap built Snapchat using the tools available on Google,"" some of which do not have an alternative in the market,"" according to its prospectus. But if Snap wants to expand to China, where Google doesn't operate, it'll have to rework things on another cloud provider, anyway. Considering the growing size of Snap's cloud spending, Amazon may be able to offer tools comparable to what it uses on Google to help facilitate a transition. Google's cloud business is minuscule in comparison to Amazon's. Snap's $400 million per year contract very likely made it Google's biggest cloud customer, and now Amazon's going to steal away a good chunk of its business. That doesn't mean much for Amazon -- its cloud business brought in $12 billion last year -- but it means a whole lot to Google. Snap is now committing $3 billion to cloud services over the next five years. That's a lot for a company with only $405 million in annual revenue, even one growing as quickly as Snap. At some point, it would make more sense for Snap to build out its own infrastructure like other popular internet services. Building infrastructure is capital intensive, but once it's built, the company would no longer be as reliant on third parties to support its flagship app. With Snap locked into contracts for the next five years, it's unlikely we'll see it go that way anytime soon, which means continued pressure on its gross margin. Last year, Snap's cost of revenue exceeded sales. The bulk of its cost of revenue was attributed to its cloud infrastructure expenses, which climbed $192 million last year. As such, Snap posted a negative gross margin, which is crazy for a company that primarily produces software. By 2021, Snap will be paying at least $750 million for cloud services. That will make it one of the largest cloud-computing customers in the world. With that much committed to Google and Amazon, Snap better get to work on growing its revenue. ","
      
    Google's Biggest Cloud Customer Just Signed a $1 Billion Deal With Amazon -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Evan Niu, CFA",02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Earlier today, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) filed its first amended S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Companies often modify their initial registration statements leading up to their IPOs, prior to issuing a formal prospectus. Prospective investors already knew that Snap is a big spender at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, which it relies on for its cloud infrastructure needs. Snap is unique in its continued use of third-party infrastructure vendors at the scale at which it is operating; most companies invest in their own infrastructure once they grow to a point where it's warranted. To a lesser extent, Snap also purchases infrastructure services from Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. Image source: Getty Images. In the amended filing, Snap provided some additional detail on its relationship with the e-commerce giant. To be clear, Google Cloud is still Snap's main flame, but it never hurts to have backup. In fact, contingency planning is absolutely critical when your entire service relies on third-party infrastructure partners, and this is the role that AWS will play. The deal was inked just yesterday, which is what's triggering the S-1 amendment. In last week's version, Snap said: ""We are currently negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations."" That line was replaced in this week's version with: ""We have also committed to spend $1 billion with Amazon Web Services over the next five years for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations."" Snap says an existing agreement with AWS that was originally entered into in March 2016 was amended on Feb. 8, 2017. That $1 billion commitment will slowly ramp up, starting with $50 million in spending this year. That's a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the $12.2 billion in sales that AWS did in 2016. Snap is on the hook to spend $350 million with AWS in 2021. In contrast, the agreement with Google Cloud that was finalized on Jan. 30, 2017 calls for a flat $400 million per year for five years, with a little bit of leeway in shifting spending to subsequent years (up to 15% in each of the first four years). Data source: Snapchat amended S-1. Chart by author. Combined with its $2 billion commitment with Google Cloud, we're looking at $3 billion pledged between Google Cloud and AWS over the next five years. Snap's cloud strategy of relying entirely on third-party partners is risky for many operational reasons, but that's an awful lot of financial pressure for the start-up. In 2016, cost of revenue exceeded revenue, resulting in a negative gross profit of nearly $50 million, and infrastructure costs are the largest component of cost of revenue. Snap only recently rolled out its automated ad sales API in October, which exited beta just a couple weeks ago. The company will now need to ramp ad sales faster than its infrastructure spending commitments if it hopes to generate gross profit in the years ahead. And we haven't even started talking about operating expenses yet, which totaled $473 million last year. Hopefully, that API works pretty darn well. ","
      
    Snap, Inc. Is Also Spending $1 Billion With Amazon AWS -- The Motley Fool

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) announced on Friday that it is acquiring a majority stake in artificial-intelligence start-up Argo AI for $1 billion, to be paid over five years. Argo AI is a new company, founded late last year by CEO Bryan Salesky and COO Peter Rander. Both are big names in self-driving circles: Salesky was the head of hardware at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo unit (formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project); Rander was a top engineer in Uber Technologies' autonomous-vehicle division. Both were previously at the robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where they worked on artificial-intelligence (AI) technology. The plan for Argo AI is to use the founders' expertise in AI to develop autonomous-vehicle software. The company is headquartered in Pittsburgh. It's small now, but it expects to have more than 200 employees by the end of 2017. Argo COO Peter Rander (left), Ford CEO Mark Fields, Argo CEO Brian Salesky, and Ford CTO Raj Nair. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Ford said that Argo AI ""is bringing together some of the most experienced roboticists and engineers working in autonomy from inside and outside of Ford."" An existing Ford team that has been working on what Ford calls its ""virtual driver system,"" the brain of an autonomous vehicle, will become part of Argo AI. While Ford will continue to develop its self-driving hardware in-house, it appears that Argo AI will be responsible for much of the software development. That software could be licensed to other companies, CEO Mark Fields said, and it's possible that Argo AI will go public at some point. ""The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago,"" Fields said. ""As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future."" Ford will hold a majority stake in the new company. Fields wouldn't say exactly what Ford's ownership percentage will be, but he did say that it was gauged to leave plenty of room to provide equity compensation to new employees. Ford's global product chief and CTO, Raj Nair, and group vice president of global strategy, John Casesa, will hold two of the five seats on Argo AI's board. Salesky and Rander will hold two more, and the fifth will go to an independent director to be named later. Investors, take note: Fields said that Argo AI's spending and results will be consolidated into Ford's automotive financial results, primarily in the North America region. Here's how I'm thinking about this deal: Ford just hired two rock stars in AI and autonomous vehicles, put them in charge of its self-driving software team, and structured the whole thing to give the team members -- and very importantly, future hires, in a field in which the competition for talent is fierce -- the upside of a start-up with lower risk, because Ford's investment has essentially capitalized the company and Ford will be its first customer. It's an intriguing idea; it could turn out to be a brilliant one. During a conference call for analysts and media, Salesky emphasized that the structure of what he called the ""collaboration"" between Argo AI and Ford would help recruiting: New hires (and Ford's existing virtual-driver team) will go to work for a start-up with significant potential upside, not (directly, at least) for giant Ford. And while it's a start-up, Ford's involvement means that new hires can be assured that Argo AI has both solid funding and a major customer. The combination of relatively low risk with high potential upside should make for a potent recruiting tool in a field where the competition for talent has been extremely fierce. For Ford, this is a way to bring some deep AI expertise into its self-driving development project, structured in a way that will help boost its recruiting efforts going forward. Nair said that he doesn't expect the deal to ""accelerate"" Ford's effort -- he stuck by the previously announced 2021 deadline for Ford's first mass-produced self-driving vehicle. But there's a clear advantage to putting the team under the leadership of Salesky and Rander, in a company that offers the upside of a start-up with less risk than most. We'll have to wait to learn more about the structure of the deal to evaluate it fully, but right now it looks like Ford has taken an intriguing step ahead. ","
      
    Why Ford Is Spending $1 Billion on a Tiny Self-Driving Start-Up -- The Motley Fool

Maxx Chatsko,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Consumer lawn and garden specialist The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) delivered total returns of 53% in 2016, which handily beat gains of 14% by the S&P 500. While the stock's performance last year pushed five-year gains to 129% for investors, the forces that have driven shares higher in recent years aren't going to fade away anytime soon. There's a case to be made that the company may not have hit its full stride yet. Despite the incredible run-up, investors may want to consider that The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company stock is actually still cheap. Why? Simply put, the ability to continue growing profits and delivering value to shareholders for the foreseeable future bodes well for a continuation of the stock's upward trend. Image source: Getty Images. The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company stock's awesome performance last year was completely warranted. Revenue only grew 4% in fiscal 2016 -- which ended in September -- compared to the prior-year period, but that was considered a solid showing given headwinds in the highly seasonal industry. It turned out to be all investors needed. Combined with recently completed restructuring efforts and asset divestitures, modest revenue growth pushed full-year earnings per share (EPS) to $4.15 -- absolutely crushing EPS of $2.27 achieved in the prior-year period. Better yet, the improvement was completely sustainable and is still shy of management's long-term goals. Consider several encouraging trends in profitability: Metric 2016 2015 Percentage Change Gross profit $995.4 million $908.0 million 10% Operating income $459.3 million $262.1 million 75% Operating income, percentage of revenue 16.2% 9.6% N/A Adjusted EPS, continuing operations $4.15 $2.27 83% Source: The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. Management has a long-term goal for operating income to represent 18% of total sales. Had that occurred in fiscal 2016, operating income would have registered at $510.5 million, or an increase of 11%. But it gets better: The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company has raised the bar for operating profits and revenue. Put another way, that means operating income growth will outpace revenue growth for the next several years in order to chase down the 18% target set by the company's brass. Indeed, fiscal 2017 guidance calls for adjusted EPS between $4.10 and $4.30 and sales growth of 6% to 7%. That range allows for the possibility that the bottom line will shrink this year, although investors should be encouraged by a strong fiscal first-quarter 2017. Metric First Quarter 2017 First Quarter 2016 Percentage Change Revenue $246.8 million $194.5 million 27% Gross profit $44.2 million $16.7 million 165% Operating loss ($70.9 million) ($97.7 million) N/A Adjusted EPS, continuing operations ($1.08) ($1.30) N/A Source: The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. Consider that The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company stock now trades at 21 times trailing earnings, which just so happens to total $4.29 per share -- essentially the high end of this year's guidance range. That's just below the stock's five-year average trailing earnings ratio of 24, but it also only accounts for financial performance from fiscal 2017. Given the fact that first-quarter 2017 results were powered higher by recent acquisitions -- including multiple seasonality-proof hydroponics companies -- management may be underestimating the strength of the newest parts of its business. Investors should be encouraged by the early success yielded by the company's multi-year restructuring initiative. The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company is now better positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities, make strategic acquisitions to bolster future earnings, and extract more profits from each dollar of revenue. That makes the stock look pretty cheap relative to its future earnings potential. Therefore, despite solid gains last year, the stock has the potential to continue rising from current levels.

    The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company Stock Gained 53% in 2016, but It Still Looks Cheap -- The Motley Fool

Maurie Backman,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Millions of Americans rely on their Social Security benefits to cover some or all of their living costs in retirement. And while the program has been a fixture of American life since 1935, in recent years, there's been talk that Social Security was going bankrupt -- and going away. In fact, in a 2016 Transamerica survey, 77% of workers expressed concern that Social Security is in danger of completely running out of money by the time they're ready to retire. But while it's true that the program is set to encounter some funding problems in the not-so-distant future, it's not facing complete insolvency. If you're worried about Social Security going bankrupt, here's a quick fact check that will help you separate myth from reality. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In order to see why so many people think that Social Security is in danger, we first need to understand how the program works. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. Current workers are taxed on their earnings up to a certain dollar amount, which can change from year to year. In 2017, for example, workers will pay Social Security taxes on their first $127,200 of earnings. This tax revenue is then used to fund payments to current beneficiaries. Whatever is left over is ""deposited"" into a Trust Fund. (More on that later.) Thus, when you pay into Social Security, you're not funding your own personal retirement account. Rather, the taxes you pay are pooled with the rest so that today's recipients can collect benefits. When it's your turn to retire, future workers' taxes will be used to fund your benefit payments. The problem, however, is that in recent years, more Americans have been retiring from the workforce than entering it. Furthermore, Americans' life expectancies have been increasing, which means that those who are getting benefits will probably collect them for longer. The result? The amount of incoming Social Security tax revenue won't suffice to cover outgoing benefit payments. In fact, it's estimated that by 2034, the ratio of workers paying taxes to support Social Security beneficiaries will decline from 3:1 to 2:1. For many years, there was more money coming into Social Security than there was going out, and thus the program's Trust Funds were born. These serve a key purpose: When incoming tax revenue isn't enough to fully cover benefits, the Trust Funds can be tapped to bridge the gap. The problem, however, is that since 2010, Social Security has been paying out more money than it's been collecting via taxes, and starting in 2019, Social Security will start relying on its Trust Funds to keep up with benefits. But the Trust Funds only have so much money, and come 2034, unless Congress acts to change matters, they're likely to be completely depleted. Once that happens, an estimated 88 million Social Security recipients could face as much as a 21% reduction in benefits. For the average retiree, that equates to roughly $5,360 of lost benefits annually in today's dollars. Ouch. If you're already receiving Social Security benefits, here's some good news: You shouldn't have to worry about that reduction for a good 17 years. But if you're a current worker worried about the future of Social Security, there's a solid basis for concern. After all, a 21% benefits cut could be catastrophic for low-income recipients who rely on Social Security to provide the bulk of their retirement income. At the same time, let's keep things in perspective. Social Security isn't going away. Even in the worst-case scenario, under which lawmakers do nothing to increase its revenues or otherwise trim its outlays, the program is expected to have sufficient income to cover its benefit payments at 79% of previous levels. Furthermore, we don't what sort of legislation might be approved to get the program's numbers back in balance. For example, a series of $200-a-month contributions will grow into almost $227,000 over 30 years if your investments generate an average annual 7% return, which is below the stock market's average. Increase that monthly contribution to $400, and you'll be looking at $453,000 in 30 years' time. Social Security is indeed here to stay, but rather than worrying about its future, you're far better off focusing your energy on setting aside money and making smart investment choices. This way, that government benefit will serve as more of a bonus and less of a lifeline when it's your turn to collect it. ","

"Todd Campbell, Rich Smith, and Tim Brugger",02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Sometimes mergers are necessary for survival, and at other times, they simply just make good old-fashioned sense. In either case, investors lucky enough to own stocks that do get bought out can turn a nice profit. We reached out to our contributors, and asked them to tell us what stocks they think could get bought. They settled on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), and Merrimack Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MACK). Read on to learn if these companies are worth owning in your portfolio. IMAGE SOURCE: TWITTER. Second only to Facebook in internet mindshare, Twitter is the stock success story that never quite made it. Twitter went public more than three years ago at $26 per share, and almost immediately doubled in price before investors began to notice a ""giant sucking sound,"" which ultimately pulled down Twitter to its current price of $18.50. You can blame Twitter's failure on any number of things: a lack of profits, single-digit revenue growth, or zero growth in its user base (as of last quarter). At the same time, with 320 million monthly visitors to the site, Twitter remains a force to be reckoned with on the internet, and will only grow more important as President Trump uses it as his social-media trumpet. Sooner or later, one of those guys is going to buy Twitter. I'm betting on sooner. Tim Brugger (GoPro): Now that the Karma drone is back, at least in limited quantities in the U.S. (for now), some pundits have suggested that GoPro's future relies on consumers getting back on board now that its battery-latch issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, it's not quite as simple as that. As founder and CEO Nicholas Woodman noted in GoPro's recently announced fourth-quarter and 2016 annual results, its HERO5 Black camera was the best-selling digital ""imaging device"" in the country, along with select international markets, last quarter. And GoPro's mobile efforts, which include its Quik app, are picking up steam. But the primary concern remains: GoPro simply doesn't have the product diversification it needs to weather an unexpected storm. Woodman warned investors to not expect much in GoPro's fourth quarter, and the reason behind his trying to mute expectations is why GoPro is begging for a buyout. The problems started with the aforementioned Karma being recalled ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season, along with some manufacturing hiccups. When one product miscue causes the poor results GoPro announced on Feb. 2, on the heels of an equally disappointing third quarter -- in which its revenue of $540.6 million was woefully short of the $574.5 million expected -- it's a scary proposition. Todd Campbell (Merrimack Pharmaceuticals): Instead of buying Merrimack Pharmaceuticals lock, stock, and barrel, Ipsen (NASDAQOTH:IPSEY) bought Merrimack's only FDA-approved drug. Ipsen's apparent unwillingness to acquire Merrimack outright casts doubt that any suitor will emerge for the company, especially now that it's sold its only commercial drug. But an acquisition is still possible. Weighed down by a heavy debt load and commercialization expenses associated with its pancreatic cancer drug Onivyde, Merrimack announced a massive layoff last fall. The layoff gave the company some wiggle room, but it wasn't enough, so the board cut a deal to sell Onivyde to Ipsen for $575 million up front, plus promises of up to $450 million in milestone payments. The company plans to return $200 million of the up-front money to investors as a special dividend, and plans to retire $175 million in long-term debt. Management will also invest $125 million of the windfall back into its clinical-stage drug pipeline. This deal gives Merrimack Pharmaceuticals a cash runway that stretches into 2019; hopefully, that will be enough time for management to prove that the remaining drugs in its pipeline are worthwhile. Those drugs include MM-121, which is being evaluated in non-small cell lung cancer, MM-141, which is being studied in metastatic pancreatic cancer, and MM-310, a preclinical drug that's expected to enter phase 1 trials this year. Undeniably, the company will be in better financial shape than it's been in years, once this deal closes. But trial uncertainty and ongoing expenses could make Merrimack Pharmaceuticals open to entertaining offers from a suitor. If not, it might at least be willing to cozy up with a deep-pocketed biopharma on one or more of its remaining drugs. ","
      
    3 Stocks Begging for a Buyout -- The Motley Fool

Todd Campbell,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Marijuana legalization is sparking interest in marijuana stocks, so if you're interested in how to profit from cannabis, you're not alone. Ultimately, there are likely to be more losing marijuana stocks than winning marijuana stocks, but nevertheless, the opportunity associated with fast-growing marijuana markets is undeniably interesting. According to GreenWave Advisors, LLC, the U.S. marijuana market could be worth tens of billions of dollars in five years, and these five states could offer the biggest payoff. Read on to learn just how big the marijuana market may be in California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Michigan in 2021. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. California became the first state to approve medical marijuana in 1996, and today, 28 states have legalized medical marijuana, including Arkansas, Florida, and North Dakota, which passed medical cannabis ballot initiatives last November. The recreational-marijuana movement hasn't won as much support (yet) as medical marijuana, but approvals in Colorado and Washington in 2012 have been followed by green lights in Alaska, Oregon, California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada. Polls show that support for pro-pot laws is growing, and that suggests people in even more states will vote on marijuana laws in the future. According to Gallup, Americans have never been more in favor of legalizing marijuana than they are now, and approval rates for medical marijuana are even higher: In 2015, a CBS News poll found that 84% of Americans want to see medical marijuana become legal nationwide. Buoyed by widespread support, marijuana advocates are already preparing to make their case for passing recreational-marijuana laws in Oklahoma, Missouri, and Texas. It's anyone's guess if efforts in those states will succeed, but one thing is clear: states that have passed pro-pot laws are bringing in significant revenue from marijuana licenses, fees, and taxes. For instance, Colorado's marijuana sales exceeded $1 billion last year, and that resulted in $200 million in tax revenue that's being spent on education. Colorado's a marijuana success story, but GreenWave Advisors' Matt Karnes thinks Colorado will only rank as the nation's fourth-largest market in a few years. The following chart shows the five states that Karnes believes will be the biggest marijuana markets in 2021, with California topping the list: Data source: GreenWave Advisors, LLC. Chart by author. It makes sense that California ranks highest because it's home to the country's biggest state population, it just legalized recreational marijuana, and its mature medical-marijuana market means it's got the infrastructure in place for the recreational market to hit the ground running. California's Emerald Triangle is the country's largest marijuana-producing region, and roughly 1,000 medical-marijuana dispensaries are already open for business statewide. In 2015, Arcview Group estimates that California's $2.7 billion in medical-marijuana sales accounted for 62% of all medical-marijuana sales in the U.S. Karnes of GreenWave Advisors thinks that by leveraging existing production and dispensaries, California's market could be worth $7.7 billion in 2021. Washington's marijuana market will be much smaller than California's, but its marijuana market is growing quickly, and that could make it the second-biggest market in five years. In April, Washington reported that sales of marijuana products, including edibles, extracts, and marijuana for inhalation, totaled $119 million.  At that rate, Washington should have no trouble reaching Karnes' $1.9 billion sales forecast in 2021. Although a relative newcomer to marijuana legalization, Pennsylvania could also become a major market soon. Medical marijuana got a green light in the state last year, and it could be one of the next states to consider recreational marijuana. Hundreds of applicants competed for 12 grower-processor medical-marijuana permits in Pennsylvania. If that's any indication, then recreational marijuana laws could pass, putting this market on its way to $1.8 billion in sales in 2021. Colorado and Michigan round out the top states for marijuana companies to target. Karnes expects Colorado's market to reach $1.7 billion in 2021, and if Michigan passes recreational marijuana in 2018, then its market could total $1.3 billion in 2021. In 2008, 63% of Michigan voters passed medical marijuana, and that market now serves more than 200,000 patients. While pro-pot advocates fell shy of getting recreational marijuana on Michigan's ballot last year, marijuana advocates are hard at work on getting recreational marijuana on the ballot next year. Sales in these five states could propel the U.S. marijuana market to $30 billion in 2021, according to GreenWave Advisors, and if marijuana secures national approval, Cowen & Co. estimates sales could soar to $50 billion by 2026. Obviously, there's a lot of money up for grabs. At first, most of that money is likely to go to small and mid-size private companies, rather than publicly traded companies. So far, most publicly traded marijuana stocks are trading via the unregulated over-the-counter market, or pink sheets. Listing on that market allows companies to avoid the strict listing requirements of major stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, and as a result, investors in over-the-counter stocks run the very real risk of falling victim to fraud. A better approach might be to focus on Canadian marijuana stocks like Canopy Growth (TSX:WEED) (NYSE:CGC) and Aphria (NASDAQOTH:APHQF). Both companies generate millions of dollars per quarter in revenue, and each is a major player in Canada's national medical-marijuana market. If Canada follows through on plans to create a national market for recreational marijuana, these two companies could be winners. Recently, Canopy Growth acquired competitor Mettrum to solidify its position as Canada's largest medical-marijuana company. Also, it raised 60 million Canadian dollars via a stock offering in December to finance its expansion plans and conduct market research. Canopy Growth's Tweed is one of Canada's most popular brands, and a partnership with Snoop Dogg on Leafs by Snoop could offer intriguing expansion opportunities in recreational marijuana markets. It's also exporting medical marijuana globally, beginning with Germany and Brazil. Another way to play the marijuana market is to buy shares in drugmakers developing medicine derived from marijuana's unique chemical compounds, cannabinoids. The biggest of these drugmakers is GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH), a $3 billion-market-cap company researching medicines based on cannabidiol (CBD), for epilepsy and other indications. Management reported results from three large scientifically controlled trials last year that show that its CBD drug, Epidiolex, can reduce monthly seizures in patients with rare forms of childhood epilepsy. GW Pharmaceuticals plans to file for approval of Epidiolex by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year, and if it's approved, then it could become available throughout the U.S. next year. Another cannabis-drug maker to watch is Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings (NASDAQ:CRBP). Its research isn't as far along as GW Pharmaceuticals' is, but Corbus Pharmaceuticals is making progress. The company is evaluating an oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug called Resunab that may help patients with systemic sclerosis (or scleroderma, a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease) and cystic fibrosis. Recently, management reported mid-stage trial results in systemic sclerosis, and results in cystic fibrosis should be available soon. While those marijuana stocks could be winners, they're all incredibly risky, and that means they aren't suitable for most investors. Instead, it may be best to focus on other profit-friendly investments that might not be as risky, at least until these companies get a bit more profit under their belts. ","
      
    Top 5 States for Marijuana Stocks -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. According to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) latest SEC filing, Warren Buffett and company had an active fourth quarter in 2016. After sitting on a company record $85 billion cash hoard at the end of the third quarter, and having said that Berkshire spent $12 billion on common stocks in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, investors have been wondering what Berkshire has been up to. Here's the answer. While we don't necessarily know the reasoning behind Berkshire's latest investments, or whether they were initiated by Warren Buffett himself or one of his trusted stock pickers, we do know what changed in Berkshire's portfolio during the fourth quarter. Here are the most notable buys: Image Source: Getty Images. 1. Apple -- Berkshire already owned Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), although the company's $2 billion stake wasn't a large amount by Berkshire's standards. During the fourth quarter, Berkshire's Apple stake nearly quadrupled to about 57 million shares, which represent more than 1% of all the outstanding Apple stock. It's interesting to note that Buffett's stock-pickers were the ones who initiated the Apple investment, but given the size of the increase, the latest Apple addition could have come from Buffett himself. This investment did not surprise me at all. I've written before how Apple still represented a compelling bargain at the price levels it was trading for during the fourth quarter, and that Berkshire should take advantage. Well, apparently, management agreed. 2. Airlines -- Berkshire surprised many investors when it revealed its third-quarter 2016 investments in several airline stocks. After all, Buffett has spoken out against airline stocks as investments several times in his career, During the third quarter, Berkshire invested in American Airlines, Delta, and United Continental, and increased its stake in all three during the fourth quarter. At the same time the initial airline stakes were revealed, Buffett also said he made an investment in Southwest Airlines. He didn't specify the amount at the time, but we now know it's a stake worth more than $2 billion. 3. Monsanto -- Berkshire revealed a new stake in Monsanto, of about 8 million shares valued at about $872 million. Monsanto currently trades for about $109 per share, and the company plans to sell itself to Bayer for $128 per share. If the deal goes through, Buffett stands to make a quick profit, but the market doesn't seem convinced at this point. 4. Sirius XM -- The final major change was the addition of a nearly 167 million-share position in satellite radio operator Sirius XM. Granted, because of the company's $4.80 share price as of this writing, this stake translates into a relatively small (for Berkshire) $800 million investment. 1. Wal-Mart -- Buffett has been gradually trimming his Wal-Mart stake for some time, but he sold a substantial number of his remaining shares. Berkshire's investment in the retail giant has been cut from about 13 million shares to 1.4 million. As I've mentioned, we don't know the reasoning, but my guess is that the success of online retailers like Amazon has changed the competitive landscape in a way Buffett doesn't like. 2. Verizon -- Berkshire sold nearly all of its 15 million shares of Verizon during the quarter. Since Berkshire also unloaded its AT&T stake earlier in 2016, this didn't come as a huge surprise. 3. Kinder Morgan -- Buffett bought about 20 million shares of Kinder Morgan in early 2016, and sold his entire position during the fourth quarter. Kinder Morgan has nearly doubled from its early 2016 lows, so this could be a matter of the valuation simply not looking attractive to Buffett anymore. 4. Deere -- Just like Kinder Morgan, Deere has rallied sharply, up by about 43% over the past year alone. So, while we don't know for sure, this sale could potentially be due to a valuation issue as well. You shouldn't necessarily follow Buffett's moves. For one thing, by the time we hear about what Buffett is doing, it can be a completely different market. Since the fourth quarter ended, the S&P has risen by more than 4%, and some of the stocks Buffett has bought have risen even higher than that. Apple, for example, has risen by nearly 17% since the end of 2016, and Apple was trading even cheaper for much of the quarter. While I don't necessarily think Apple is too expensive to buy right now, it's fair to say that Buffett and company likely got a far better deal on their Apple shares than investors could get now. ^SPX data by YCharts ","

The dream of every investor is to purchase the next Apple or Johnson & Johnson as a small-cap stock and watch it bloom into one of the leading companies within its industry. But companies that have the ability and opportunity to grow their valuations from the millions into megacap territory are quite rare. Furthermore, even when investors find one of these profit powerhouses, they often have a hard time sitting still for the long period of time required to let their investment thesis fully pan out. Information is now constantly at our fingertips, and with the rise of the internet and trading algorithms, holding time frames have seemingly been on the decline for years. Image source: Getty Images. However, there are a select few companies that have turned modest nest eggs into veritable treasure chests over the past 30 years or so. Had you invested $10,000 in any of the following three companies in May 1986, you'd have at least $3.68 million today. Best of all, one of them is a company I can almost guarantee you've never heard of before. If I asked for a show of hands to see how many investors had heard of Balchem (NASDAQ:BCPC) before, chances are, not too many hands would be raised. Balchem, which is still just a midcap company today even after its 36,784% romp higher, provides animal nutrition products, food flavorings, and specialty ingredients to the industrial and pharmaceutical industry.

A staff engineer at Balchem realized that choline salts could also stabilize clay deposits. That eventually opened a new revenue channel for the company, as fracking for oil and gas requires the stabilization of clay deposits. Interestingly, though, fracking didn't become a major technology in the energy sector until years after the engineer's discovery. These innovative pursuits have expanded Balchem's product portfolio organically, allowing it to wildly outpace the S&P 500. Today, Balchem looks to be fairly valued, if not a bit pricey; but I guess that's to be expected after a nearly 37,000% run! Valued at 31 times next year's estimated profit per share, Balchem would have to produce a major surge in animal and human nutrition and health sales to reasonably support a higher valuation. Innovation was also the driving force for Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), which has delivered nearly 51,000% gains since May 1986. Monster's claim to fame are its energy drinks, which have only grown in popularity over the years with young adults. Over the past 12 months, Monster has generated nearly $3 billion in revenue, practically all of which was tied to its namesake brand of energy drinks. By comparison, in 2006, it generated only $606 million in full-year sales. This isn't to say the company hasn't had its hiccups. In 2012, Monster was the subject of a Food and Drug Administration investigation into the deaths of five people who'd consumed its energy drinks, which quelled sales for a short period. However, as you can clearly see based on its latest sales numbers, those health safety issues have been put in the rear view mirror. Image source: Monster Energy. In recent years, Monster's biggest catalyst has been a partnership with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Under the agreement, Coca-Cola agreed to contribute its energy drink portfolio to Monster, and Monster in turn sent its non-energy product portfolio to Coca-Cola. The deal also allowed Coca-Cola to take a 16.7% equity investment in Monster Beverage, giving it access to the fast-growing energy drink market. Finally, distribution agreements between the two companies were amended, and since 2014 Monster's gross margin has leaped from 54.4% to 62.8% on a trailing 12-month basis. The result was a better-than-doubling of its net income over the past three years for Monster. Monster Beverage isn't cheap after its run higher -- its shares now sell for 30 times forward earnings -- but unlike Balchem, it has the potential for double-digit percentage sales and profit growth for years to come. Though I'd expect the gains to be substantially more modest, Monster remains an intriguing investment opportunity. Last, but not least, we have the operating system kingpin, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has generated a better than 64,600% return over the past 30 years and change. It's certainly not hard to understand why Microsoft has been so dominant. Despite numerous efforts during the emergence of desktop and laptop computers to unseat it as the dominant operating system provider, Microsoft dug in and ceded very little, if any, market share. Today, Microsoft's Windows OS is so dominant in the PC market, it's almost frightening. Image source: Microsoft. According to NetMarketShare.com, as of January 2017, Windows 7 and Windows 10 combined accounted for 72.5% of all desktop operating systems. Group the less-popular XP, 8.1, 8, Vista, and NT together, and they kick in nearly another 19%. That gives Microsoft a desktop OS market share of about 91.5%, and as you might have surmised -- correctly -- a lot of pricing power comes with a veritable monopoly on desktop operating systems. But Microsoft hasn't been without its faults. Its Achilles' heel, perhaps, has been its acquisitions; its big purchases have included some notable duds throughout the years. For example, Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia's handset business and aQuantive were both disasters. Its $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype has netted the network a lot of customer usage, but very little in the way of financial benefits. Nonetheless, Microsoft remains a dominant force in PC operating systems, is regularly generating $23 billion to $26 billion in annual free cash flow thanks to its substantial operating margin, and recently acquired LinkedIn, which will hopefully open new channels of revenue for the company. With annual EPS growth throughout the remainder of the decade forecast to be roughly 10%, Microsoft may still offer modest upside to patient investors. ","
      
    3 Stocks That Turned $10,000 Into at Least $3.68 Million -- The Motley Fool

  "
Chris Neiger,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The technology sector isn't always the best place for investment stability, nor are new technology trends ever much of a safe investment. But it doesn't have to be this way. The Internet of Things (IoT) is ushering in a massive wave of technological changes -- nearly 50 billion things will be connected to the IoT by 2020 -- and there are three companies at the forefront of this $7 trillion market that should remain steady, long-term investments: Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Image source: Getty Images. Verizon is stalwart dividend stock that has plenty of long-term potential in the IoT. The company already dominates the wireless network space despite cutthroat competition from AT&T and T-Mobile, and it's only getting stronger. Verizon is making early investments in 5G networks that should give the company an edge over its competitors in the IoT network space, much like the company's early push into 4G kept it ahead of the competition. Verizon calls 5G the ""foundation for creating more internet-connected devices"" and says that it will use the network to bring traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters, and other city systems online. Over the next few months, the company plans on rolling out commercial 5G field tests in a few locations. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said at an investor conference in December that he believes the company is two to three years ahead of the competition for 5G because of its early tests and the company's recent purchase of the fiber-optic network company XO Communications. 5G will allow new types of faster-than-ever device connections, and Verizon's early mover advantage could pay off down the road. Cisco is a perfect example of a company that will plug away in its respective field without offering investors much drama -- and at the same time provide a nice 3.3% dividend yield to boot. Cisco has been talking about the IoT for quite some time, but one of biggest moves came early last year when the company announced it was buying Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion. Jasper is a cloud-based IoT service platform that allows enterprise and service customers to ""launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale."" In short, Jasper allows companies to bring nearly any device online (think cars or jet engines) and then manage those connections through its proprietary software. Jasper brings with it 3,500 enterprise customers from around the world that have devices running on 27 service providers. And Cisco said that it will be able to add to Jasper's services with its own enterprise Wi-Fi, IoT security solutions, and advanced analytics. With Jasper, Cisco transitions further into the the software-as-a-service (SaaS) market that brings recurring revenue, and allows the company to rely a little less on the traditionally cyclical hardware market. Alphabet and its subsidiaries have been extremely aggressive in the IoT space, and given the company's massive market size and its quarterly revenues north of  $26 billion, this is certainly a company investors don't need to babysit. Most of Alphabet's IoT opportunities stem from Google, which is already a leader in the connected home space with Google Home and Nest Labs. By having a slew of IoT devices for the home, along with an embedded smart assistant in Google Home, the company is helping to lead the way in IoT home connections. But one of Alphabet's biggest IoT pushes right now comes from a company called Waymo, which was recently spun out of Google. Waymo is the product of years of research and real-world testing of self-driving cars and Google is looking to the company to now stand on its own and start generating revenue. Waymo has partnered with Fiat Chrysler to bring 100 self-driving minivans to to the roadways to begin testing an autonomous driving service. The company is likely still years away from bringing in any significant revenue for Google, but it's clear that under Alphabet's umbrella self-driving tech is a big part of the company's IoT plans. On top of that, other companies under Alphabet are exploring IoT possibilities, like using nanoparticles to find diseases in the bloodstream, by pairing them to wearable tech devices. Investors looking for steady companies shouldn't overlook the massive opportunities that the IoT has to offer. Nearly 50 billion things will be connecting the internet in just a few years and the IoT market has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. The three stocks above are all big tech names that are tapping into the IoT's potential in their own way, offering investors growth opportunities on top of stable existing businesses. ","

Daniel Halper,02162017,MarketWatch,02092017,"Published: Feb 16, 2017 10:16 a.m. ET By President Trump, in an all-out feud with the country’s intelligence community over persistent leaks, will begin a major review of the spy agencies, according to a report. Trump is set to tap a billionaire financier, Stephen Feinberg, to lead the review, which has been met by “fierce resistance” by the intelligence agencies, The New York Times reported. The selection of Feinberg, co-founder of hedge fund Cerberus Capital Management and a member of the president’s economic advisory council, signals the president’s attempt to keep the review process within the White House. Details of the review – its scope and timeline – have not yet been determined. The findings of any White House review would give Trump ammo should he seek full-scale change to the way intelligence agencies operate. Trump this week blasted the nation’s intelligence community over leaked phone conversations former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had with a Russian ambassador over US sanctions. “From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked; it’s criminal action. It’s a criminal act, and it’s been going on for a long time before me, but now it’s really going on,” Trump said during his joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. He also called the intelligence leaks “Very un-American!” in a Wednesday tweet. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Flynn was forced out over an “eroding level of trust” after he “misled the vice president and others” regarding his pre-inauguration phone conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

The stock ticked 2% lower in premarket trade Thursday following a downgrade to neutral from outperform at Wedbush Securities, which encouraged clients to hold shares after Wednesday’s post-earnings rally. Nevertheless, the stock spike follows a 2% increase in fourth-quarter sales reported Wednesday morning, reflecting a boost in demand tied to the holiday shopping season. Groupon’s revenue was nearly $935 million, topping the Wall Street consensus estimate of $913 million. While net losses widened to $50.2 million, adjusted earnings per share of seven cents topped the three cents analysts on average had been expecting. Groupon benefited from its purchase of rival LivingSocial during the quarter, despite the fact that investors initially shunned the deal, evidenced by a selloff in Groupon shares of as much as 9% after the deal was announced in after-hours trade on Oct. 26. In a year-end securities filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Groupon said it bought LivingSocial for “no consideration,” which means it paid virtually nothing for a top rival that once was valued around $6 billion. In that same filing, Groupon touted an increase in active users for the full year, partially due to LivingSocial. Groupon had 52.7 million active users at the end of the fiscal year, compared with 48.9 million in the year-earlier period. That includes roughly 1 million incremental active customers from the LivingSocial acquisition. Despite the strong quarter, Groupon still has to face a number of challenges, including declining international revenues. Overseas sales fell to 26.3% of total revenue in 2016, compared with 27.8% and 31.6% in the two years prior. Other major risks include competition. In its 10K filing with the SEC, Groupon said it expects to “increasingly compete against other large internet and technology-based businesses that have launched initiative which are directly competitive” to its core business. The average analyst rating on the stock is the equivalent to hold, while the average 12-month price target is $4.74, according to FactSet.

Trey Williams,02162017,MarketWatch,02092017,"Published: Feb 12, 2017 12:59 p.m. ET Marijuana sales grew 30% in 2016 and are expected to reach $20.2 billion by 2021 according to market research By The state of Colorado pulled in nearly $200 million in tax revenue last year thanks to its $1.3 billion in marijuana revenue. The Colorado Department of Revenue announced Thursday the state’s revenue had pushed past $1 billion. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, along with Washington state, and this was its third year of regulated sales. In its first year revenue hit $699.2 million, followed by $996.2 million the second year. Check out: Marijuana industry is bracing for a renewed push toward legalization in 2017 “This money is just the tip of the iceberg. Hopefully this will be a wake-up call for the 42 states that still choose to force marijuana sales into the criminal market and forego millions of dollars in tax revenue,” said Mason Tvert, the Marijuana Policy Project’s Denver-based communications director, in a statement. “The state received nearly $200 million in marijuana tax revenue, whereas just a decade ago it was receiving zero.” Overall, U.S. marijuana sales grew 30% in 2016, according to data from Arcview Market Research. And using research from cannabis business intelligence and market research firm BDS Analytics, Arcview forecasts cannabis sales will grow at a compound rate of 25%, from $6.7 billion in 2016 to $20.2 billion by 2021. The industry is on edge, however, because of the uncertainty about how President Donald Trump and a Jeff Sessions-led Justice Department will approach regulation and enforcement. Also read: Jeff Sessions says if Americans don’t want him to enforce marijuana laws, they should change them Tvert says Colorado is an example of how legal recreational marijuana can work. “Marijuana is now being sold in licensed businesses, rather than out on the street,” Tvert said. “It is being properly tested, packaged and labeled and it is only being sold to adults who show proof of age.

Quentin Fottrell,02162017,MarketWatch,02092017,"Published: Feb 13, 2017 7:38 p.m. ET Streaming is now 47% of all U.S. music industry revenue By Prince had reason to party like it’s 1999. That’s the year music sales peaked. For recording artists, it’s been downhill from there as most fans pay $10 a month for music streaming services. It’s no surprise, therefore, that the bulk of Prince’s catalogue was made available to stream on Sunday for the first time in 18 months, and Warner Bros. announced two new Prince albums would be released in June. Prince, who died last year, had pulled his songs and albums from streaming services. But even he could not halt the demand for streaming. At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sunday evening, Chance the Rapper won best new artist, the first winner without selling a physical product, showcasing the rise in and importance of digital downloads. His mixtape, “Coloring Book,” which won best rap album, is exclusively available on Apple Inc.’s

                                   streaming service Apple Music, and still isn’t available for download on iTunes. But Chance the Rapper knew his music would go further streaming. Last year, on-demand audio streaming share surpassed total digital sales for the first time. Streaming is now 47% of all U.S. music industry revenue, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). “Coloring Book,” became the first streaming-only album to surpass 500,000 streams and, since its debut last May, it has stayed on the Billboard 200 chart. This surge in streaming has at least helped bring growth back to the industry, according to David Bakula, senior vice president of music industry insight at Nielsen, powered by a 60% increase in on-demand streaming: “The landscape is evolving even more quickly than we have seen with other format shifts,” he said in a statement. In 2015, there were $7 billion in music sales, a far cry from the $20.7 billion sales in 1999 when U.S. music sales peaked, the RIAA found. Per capita music spending (including live concerts) for the average consumer was $152 in 2015 (with millennials aged 18 to 34 spending an average of $163 per year), according to market research group Nielsen SoundScan. Nielsen didn’t have comparable data for 1999, but given the RIAA reported decline for overall sales, most Americans were spending roughly 77% more in 1999 on albums and singles alone. In 2017, many music fans may simply stick to their Spotify or Apple Music subscription of $10 per month (or $100 per year), while live concerts have become increasingly lucrative for major music stars. Americans spent $18.2 billion on compact disc albums in 1999, $316 million on CD singles and $1.5 billion on cassette tapes, according to data from the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents music labels including Atlantic, Capital, RCA, Warner Bros., Columbia and Motown. Digital downloads were zero in 1999. However, by 2015 CD album sales plummeted to $1.52 billion, CD singles fell to $1.5 million and cassettes fell to zero. The biggest purchases came nowhere near the $18 billion in CD sales of 1999: single downloads were $1.2 billion, album downloads were just $1 billion and paid streaming music subscriptions were $1.2 billion. Don’t miss: Who inherits your iTunes library? Paid subscriptions for streaming services first arrived in 2005, with annual sales of $181 million, and only took a decade to hit the $1 billion mark. Why? People can listen to all the music they want in one month by subscribing to a streaming service for the price of an album. Instead of paying $20 for an album with 10 songs, music fans are paying $10 a month for access to millions of songs. Spotify offers free streaming music (with ads) and charges $10 a month for ad-free listening; Apple Music costs $9.99 per month, or $14.99 per month for a family subscription for up to six people (which requires iCloud Family Sharing). Both have catalogs of over 30 million songs. Other services include Pandora

The explosion in streaming was fast, but not unexpected. In 2014, Apple’s $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics, the headphone- and speaker-maker and music-streaming company, happened as many experts predicted a future without digital music downloads. Downloading music files, they said, had become too cumbersome, restrictive and expensive compared with the surge and ease of streaming services. Digital music downloads fell for the first time ever at some point during 2013, and have been continuing their slide every year since then, according to the latest data from Nielsen SoundScan. That, for some, was the day the download died. Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox. Subscribe to MarketWatch's free Personal Finance Daily newsletter.

Natalie O'Neill,02162017,MarketWatch,02092017,"Published: Feb 15, 2017 1:32 p.m. ET Winning the jackpot at the age of 17 made her life ‘10 times worse’ By The youngest person ever to win the lottery in Britain wants to sue the jackpot honchos who made her wealthy because the money “ruined her life,” according to a report. Jane Park, 21 — who won $1.25 million playing Euromillions at age 17 — says she was too young to cope with the sudden flood of wealth, according to the newspaper the Mirror. “At times it feels like winning the lottery has ruined my life. I thought it would make it 10 times better, but it’s made it 10 times worse,” she moaned to the paper. “I wish I had no money most days. I say to myself, ‘My life would be so much easier if I hadn’t won,’ ” she said. She’s sick of shopping, misses hustling for a paycheck and has struggled to find a boyfriend who isn’t using her, she said. Before Park won the lottery in 2013, she worked as an administrative assistant for $10 an hour and lived in a modest apartment with her mother in the Scottish capital Edinburgh, she said. Now, she owns a flashy purple Range Rover and two residential properties and has traveled the globe with the lottery cash, she said. But the lavish lifestyle has only made her feel “empty” inside, she said. “People look at me and think, ‘I wish I had her lifestyle, I wish I had her money.’ But they don’t realize the extent of my stress. I have material things, but apart from that my life is empty,” she said. “What,” she said she has wondered, “is my purpose in life?” Instead of turning to God or therapy, she’s demanding a lawyer. Park plans to file a lawsuit against the U.K.’s National Lottery, claiming it shouldn’t allow kids under 18 to play, she told the paper. “You can’t give a 17-year-old that amount of money,” she said.“I think 18 should be the minimum age for winning the ­lottery, at the least. The current age of 16 is far too young.” Park has also used her lottery winnings to pay for plastic surgery, designer shoes and extravagant nights of clubbing, she said. “It’s scary how ­different my life is from my friends’. When they say they’re stressed about money ,they mean their wages are [bad],” she said. “There’s no one in the same boat as me, no one who really understands. I feel like I’m a 40-year-old.” A spokesman for the British lottery operator, Camelot Group, said the company gave Park financial advice and hooked her up with other young lottery winners for support. The minimum legal age for lottery players should be up to the government, the spokesman said. This report previously appeared at NYPost.com.

The algorithm, known as Secure Hash Algorithm 1 or SHA-1, is currently used to verify the integrity of digital files and signatures that secure credit card transactions as well as Git open-source software repositories. Researchers were able to demonstrate a “collision attack” using two different PDF files with the same SHA-1 fingerprint, but with different visible content, according to a paper published by Amsterdam-based Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica. “Moving forward, it’s more urgent than ever for security practitioners to migrate to safer cryptographic hashes such as SHA-256 and SHA-3,” according to a post by the collaborators on Google’s security blog.

The Global Allocation Fund holds hundreds of stocks and also invests in bonds. Global Allocation held about $443 million in Alphabet C-class shares, as of Oct. 31, down from $550 million the prior quarter, according to regulatory filings. The fund has held the stock since October 2015, according to Morningstar Inc. Alphabet did not respond to requests for comment. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, declined to comment. “Our enthusiasm for U.S. stocks is tempered by elevated valuations, a lack of fiscal policy specifics, and uncertainty regarding future U.S. trade policy,” the fund’s managers wrote in a summary covering their January trades. “We reduced the fund’s exposure to select technology stocks, including U.S.-based companies that generate a significant portion of revenues from non-U.S. dollar sources.” Alphabet earned 53 percent of its revenue outside of the United States last year, according to its earnings statements. The value was reduced by the U.S. dollar’s strength against the British pound, euro and other currencies. U.S. President Donald Trump has touted a series of trade and tax reforms to boost domestic growth, some of which could also push up the U.S. dollar. A Republican proposal to reform taxes that would levy a 20 percent tax on imports and exclude export revenue from taxable income has been circulating. Trump has said he would announce his own tax plan in coming weeks. ","

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus will draw a line under two decades of M&A dealmaking and frenetic orders on Wednesday as it reports its first results since the European aerospace and defense group unified under its dominant planemaking arm last month. The sense of Airbus entering a new era is palpable, with the complex reorganization set in motion by the swallowing of parent Airbus Group (formerly EADS), by the subsidiary it was created to oversee, coinciding with waning demand from airlines. The company is expected to report a 7 percent drop in full-year core earnings and confirm that orders for new planes this year will drop below the number of jets it delivers for only the second time in 14 years. Mounting legal problems, uncertainty over two major programs and a changing of the guard among senior management also blur the outlook for Europe’s largest aerospace company. EADS was created in 2000 from multiple mergers to form a civil and defense giant, incorporating the older Airbus, and later became Airbus Group. After failing to buy BAE Systems in 2012, defense ambitions dimmed and the era of shareholder-led consolidation is now drawing to a close, with Airbus Group absorbed by its Airbus planemaking subsidiary. The technical completion of the internal merger is due to take place later this year. In a careful reshuffle, Tom Enders keeps overall leadership but can only achieve this by resuming his former post as head of the planemaker “Airbus SAS” — until now merely a division. That means Fabrice Bregier has had to abandon the civil business’s separate CEO privileges to became chief operating officer of the wider group as a powerful No.2 — a delicate move in a company with a long history of see-sawing job moves. How that balance works in the coming months is seen as key to avoiding a resumption of political in-fighting that could prove a worrying distraction as the company prepares for a number of high-profile departures over the next 1-2 years. Group strategy chief Marwan Lahoud, 50, announced plans to step down this month and commercial sales chief John Leahy, 66, has already scheduled his retirement in 2018, though some believe he could step down before the end of this year. Two top executives credited with improving industrial performance — operations head Tom Williams and programs chief Didier Evrard — are also nearing retirement, though Airbus says that any changes will be gradual. Taken collectively, however, the looming changes suggest that the relentless drive for market share under Leahy, and M&A under Lahoud, have peaked. “It is a move away from the traditional managers, cheerleaders and engineers towards the bottom line-focused crowd,” said Teal Group consultant Richard Aboulafia. The internal overhaul also brings a shift in power from heavyweight engineers to a new breed of managers. Convinced that digital technology will alter the way aircraft are made, Enders recently hired 36-year-old ex-Google executive Paul Eremenko as chief technology officer. The appointment has raised questions among some Airbus watchers over how long engineering chief Charles Champion will stay at the company. Champion could not be reached for comment. Company tensions have also been inflamed by a UK investigation into the use of middlemen to sell jets, people close to the matter say. Legal exposure widened when Austria instigated legal action against Airbus last week, alleging fraud related to a fighter jet order in 2003. Airbus denied the allegations. Also consuming attention are concerns about the delayed A400M military aircraft and questions over the future of the A380 superjumbo. On the positive side, analysts say that Airbus can look forward to a boost from a strong dollar as hedges unwind.

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to close loopholes multinational corporations use to skip taxation on dividends, part of a drive to stop them from parking profits where they pay the least tax. The new rules, due to go into effect in 2020, should help the EU recoup revenues from companies that cut their tax bills by declaring profits in countries with low or no taxation. Tax-saving schemes used by Apple, Amazon, Google, Starbucks and other companies - all legal under current laws - have raised public pressure for EU-wide rules to close these loopholes. “We have reached a general approach,” Finance Minister Edward Scicluna of Malta, which holds the current six-month rotating EU presidency, said after the deal was reached. He called it a “bold step” to reduce these tax differentials, known in EU jargon as hybrid mismatches. “The agreement reached today will ensure that hybrid mismatches of all types cannot be used to avoid tax in the EU, even where the arrangements involve third countries,” the EU Commission said in a statement. The deal postponed application of the new rules by one year to January 2020 because some countries noted possible negative consequences on competitiveness if changes were too quick. In some limited cases, the new rules will apply from 2022. Last December, the finance ministers failed to agree on the issue after some of them said a proposal by the then Slovak presidency and backed by Britain would water down the plan.. In a bid to quell multinationals’ concerns, Scicluna said there would be new proposals in coming months to make sure that corporations will not pay double taxes under the new system. Ministers also found a compromise on the criteria to define a tax haven. Attempts to have a common EU list of “non-cooperative jurisdictions” have so far failed as several EU countries preferred to maintain their own, often empty, listing. But the idea of setting up a common list has gained traction after several revelations of massive tax avoidance in countries such as Panama or the Bahamas. EU sanctions could be imposed on countries on the list. Ministers agreed that countries that apply zero tax rates will not automatically be considered a tax haven, but they will be subject to checks against other criteria, such as their level of cooperation with the EU on tax matters or the existence of off-shore structures in their jurisdictions. “It’s welcome that the EU now accepts that a zero percentage tax rate is potentially harmful,” said the anti-poverty charity Oxfam. But without a blanket ban on zero tax rates, it added, “Oxfam is worried that the likes of Bermuda and Bahamas might slip through the net”. The list should be finalised by the end of this year. So far, letters have been sent to 92 countries, including the United States, to start a screening of practices that could be seen as facilitating tax avoidance. ","

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Snap Inc takes to the road in London on Monday to promote its initial public offering with a daring proposition: that it can build hot-selling hardware gadgets and ad-friendly software features fast enough to stay one step ahead of Facebook. No longer just a purveyor of a smartphone app for disappearing messages, Snap has hired hundreds of hardware engineers, built a secretive product development lab and scoured the landscape for acquisitions as it pursues its newly stated ambition to be “a camera company.” These efforts, which are aimed at developing hardware and so-called augmented reality technologies, are central to the strategy of a company that is seeking a valuation of up to $22 billion in its early March IPO despite heavy losses and the specter of stiff competition for advertising dollars with a far-larger Facebook. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2kXZxA7) It is a big gamble and the odds against Snap are long. More broadly, creating new products and features that have mass-market appeal and cannot be readily mimicked is a huge challenge, analysts say. “It’s worrisome,” said Paul Meeks, chief investment officer at Sloy, Dahl & Holst, which manages more than $1 billion in assets. “Snapchat is going to have to continue to be really innovative and distinctive. It’s going to be very tough to trump Facebook.” Snap declined to comment for this story. Snap first signaled its new focus with the September reveal of Spectacles, funky sunglasses with an embedded video camera for posting to the Snapchat app. The company spent $184 million on research and development last year, nearly half its revenue. Augmented reality, which refers to computer-generated images overlaid on real surroundings and viewed through a smartphone or special glasses, is a big part of the plan. Snap’s “lenses” image-overlay feature has been a hit, and gives Snap an advertising format that’s unique, at least for now. “If you’re going to make the bet longer-term on Snap, you are betting they are going to come up with innovative products that Facebook can’t copy,” said Nabil Elsheshai, senior equity analyst at Thrivent Financial, who is considering whether to recommend that his firm buy Snap’s IPO. Facebook-owned Instagram last year rolled out a feature called Stories, modeled after Snapchat’s feature by the same name. Snapchat had about 100 million fewer downloads than Instagram in 2016, according to market research firm App Annie. Snap had 158 million daily active users in the fourth quarter, up just 3 percent from the previous quarter, compared to 14 percent growth during the same period in 2015, according to Snap’s IPO filing. New gadgets that offer more ways to interact with Snapchat could help attract new users and get existing users to spend more time on the app. “Ultimately, that’s what advertisers are going to be looking at,” said Douglas Melsheimer, managing director at investment bank and consulting firm Bulger Partners. Snap, along with Facebook and host of online rivals ranging from Google to BuzzFeed, is capitalizing on the shift of video advertising dollars from traditional television to the internet. Snap’s IPO filing reads “as if all the hard things in front of them that they have to do are already done,” said Rett Wallace, cofounder and chief executive at Triton Research. But, he said, that’s not the case. “How will they hold up against all the guys you don’t want to be fighting against in the world - Facebook, Google and Apple?” Hardware is part of the answer. Snap has recruited hardware experts from Apple, Alphabet Inc’s Google, Nest and Motorola, according to an analysis of LinkedIn profiles. One former employee described ample resources and support from management for the hand-picked hardware teams. Last spring, Snap set out to hire up to 300 hardware, augmented reality and virtual reality specialists in a single month, according to another former employee. It also set up Snap Labs, a group dedicated to working on secretive projects. Its members have reviewed acquisition targets in areas including wearable cameras, facial recognition and 3D scanning technology, according to people close to the discussions. Spectacles itself came from Snap’s acquisition of startup Vergence Labs in 2014. The sunglasses surprised even Snap’s earliest investors, who say hardware was not in Snap’s initial pitch to them. “It was a disappearing messaging product, and that’s it,” said Jeremy Liew, a partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, who made the initial venture investment into Snap. Like most Snap backers he lauded the Spectacles rollout. Snap has acquired at least 10 startups since 2014 according to firms tracking such deals, and M&A deal makers say Snap is one of the most active shoppers they have heard from. Snap’s R&D investment as a percentage of revenue is far higher than what Facebook or Twitter were spending before they went public. One result of that investment has been a wave of patent filings - about 46 total, according to research firm CB Insights. They include eye-wear patents for Spectacles, as well as patents for photo and video-capture devices, and object and facial recognition, which is key to developing augmented reality technology. One former employee said Snap is working to figure out ways to turn the warehouse of data it collects from Memories, a feature for users to save photos on Snap’s server, into augmented reality or facial recognition applications. Spectacles “opens the doors for augmented reality,” Elsheshai said. “That’s a different direction for the company than just adding more social media capabilities.” The quirky popularity of Spectacles further endears users to Snapchat, he said, but doubted that such niche products can propel the user growth Snap needs in the long term. The greatest impediment to Snap’s innovation efforts, however, may be its hefty losses: the company lost $515 million last year on $404 million in sales. Revenue from Spectacles. was “not material,” according to Snap’s IPO filing. Snap, like Amazon.com, is expecting public investors to allow the company to lose money for years on the promise that more investment in innovation will pay off later. “They are going to have to get the Amazon pass - investors that don’t care in the short run,” Elsheshai said.

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European lawmakers called on Thursday for EU-wide legislation to regulate the rise of robots, including an ethical framework for their development and deployment and the establishment of liability for the actions of robots including self-driving cars. But they rejected a proposal to impose a so-called robot tax on owners to fund support for or retraining of workers put out of a job by robots. The resolution is a recommendation to the bloc’s executive, the European Commission, which the Commission is not obliged to follow but must give reasons if it chooses not to. “The EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries,” the parliament said in a statement. The decision to reject the robot tax was hailed by the robotics industry, which says it would stunt innovation. “The IFR believes that the idea to introduce a robot tax would have had a very negative impact on competitiveness and employment,” said the Frankfurt-based International Federation of Robotics. The IFR and others argue that automation and the use of robots create new jobs by increasing productivity, and point to a correlation between robot density and employment in advanced industrial nations, for example in the German car industry. Global shipments of industrial robots rose 15 percent in 2015, according to the latest statistics from the IFR, and were worth a total of about $46 billion. Demand for service robots for medical, domestic and personal use is also on the rise. The parliamentary resolution on the amended report was passed by 396 votes to 123, with 85 abstentions. The report’s author, MEP Mady Delvaux, said she was disappointed that lawmakers “refused to take account of possible negative consequences on the job market”. “They rejected an open-minded and forward-looking debate and thus disregarded the concerns of our citizens,” she said.

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"Facing yet another cash crunch, Tesla will likely be forced to head to Wall Street for more capital, analysts said. Shares tumbled 5.8 percent on Thursday, their biggest intraday percentage fall in eight months. Musk told investors after the company released its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday that the upcoming Model 3 sedan, the $35,000 mass-market vehicle on which the company’s future profitability hinges, requires no additional outside funding as it readies for production this year. “But we get very close to the edge,” Musk said. “So we’re considering a number of options but I think it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce risk.” Tesla had $3.39 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2016, but most of that comes from a May stock offering, cash from its SolarCity acquisition and nearly $1 billion in draws on its credit facilities. The company spent $448 million in cash on operating activities in the fourth quarter. Tesla’s warning of an expected $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in the first half of 2017 for the Model 3 leaves potentially less than a $1 billion cushion for Tesla, at a time of “high levels of execution risk,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. Analysts estimated the company will seek $1 billion to $2.5 billion in capital in the near term. Tesla, which has had negative cash flow since 2014 and has posted a quarterly profit only twice since going public, has repeatedly gone to Wall Street for fresh capital. “The automotive business is an extremely capital intensive business and we keep seeing companies who are thinking of getting into it underestimate that,” said Autotrader senior analyst Michelle Krebs, citing moves by Apple Inc and Alphabet’s Google to back off aggressive forays into the sector. Individual model launches for established car companies do not carry the same hazards as for Tesla because the risk is less concentrated. “No single launch is a ‘bet the company’ launch” for established automakers, said Michigan-based auto manufacturing consultant Michael Tracy, citing larger capital reserves. “If you’re Tesla, every time you’re stepping up to the plate, financially it’s extremely risky.” Additionally, Musk’s need for speed in getting the Model 3 in the hands of approximately 373,000 reservation holders after volume production begins in September means he “has to ramp up faster than any other automaker would want to do,” Tracy said.

Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG) yesterday announced a breakthrough for Project Loon, its plan for providing internet access to remote regions of the world through hot air balloons. The Mountain View, Calif., company said refinements of existing technology have enabled it to cut back on the number of balloons it requires to provide internet access to a specific region. In addition, the use of artificial intelligence software has enabled the balloons to chart their own course and remain in place to ""dance on the winds in small loops"" above the region to provide internet access. The previous model for Project Loon had balloons flying around the globe and replacing each other in set paths. (See also: 3 Predictions for Alphabet Inc. in 2016.) A Bloomberg report, however, cast a different light on the news. ""Rather than building a worldwide network, the team will now launch a small number of balloons into particular regions that need internet access,"" the report states. In an interview on Bloomberg television, Tom Giles, team leader at Bloomberg, said that this was more proof of ""Ruthless Ruth"" – a reference to the company's CFO Ruth Porat, who has instilled cost discipline into the company's moonshots.

According to Giles, the service ""cut some limited deals"" with governments around the world.

Some of them are regulatory. For example, Google is not allowed to operate its services in China. Thus, smartphone manufacturers are concerned that installing Google Assistant would result in an incomplete user experience for Chinese users. Other issues are related to control of the Android ecosystem. Unlike Amazon, Google has refused to release its assistant as a standalone app that can be pre-installed. According to reports, the AI assistant could enable the company to exert greater control over the Android ecosystem. Currently, the operating system has branched out in multiple directions because smartphone manufacturers have customized it to suit their ends and the vision for their phones. (See also: Can Google Assistant Become the Company's Next Search Engine?)

Well-known investor Fred Wilson stated as much in his 2017 forecast, when he wrote that “investors and entrepreneurs will concede that Google and Facebook have won and everyone else has lost.” This also means that the ecosystem for digital advertising services will coalesce around the two companies. While Google dominates search advertising, Facebook has found its metier in social. Twitter Inc. (TWTR), which competes for ad dollars with the two services, is trying to reinvent itself as a video streaming service but has found the going tough, so far. However, their dominance comes with trade-offs for both companies. For example, Google's Cost Per Click has trended downward in recent quarters and Facebook's Average Revenue Per User has declined. This leaves space for innovative companies to emerge as competitors. Snap Inc. has emerged as a serious contender to Facebook for social advertising. The company’s Snapchat service, which boasts 130 million Daily Active Users (DAU), is more popular with teens as compared to the Menlo Park-based company’s social network.

Okerstrom said that Expedia’s relationship with Google is “very instructive” and that it’s “never been stronger.” However, he noted that with Google shrinking free traffic, and deciding to monetize about half or the entire first page of searches instead, Expedia is going to suffer to some extent over the long haul. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi just about confirmed this in the most recent earnings call when he said Google’s monetization initiatives is limiting the travel company’s aspiration to widen its audience reach at its HomeAway segment. This is also making Expedia spend more money with Google.

Okerstrom also touted Europe as a “huge opportunity” for Expedia, assuring investors that the company will be more active on the continent this year.

Over 43% of its daily active users came from developed markets in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Global opportunities like China may be too large to ignore. But is the world's most populous country beyond reach for Snap Inc.? Today Snap Inc. kicked off its road show presentation, where investors will have the chance to ask CEO Evan Spiegel and his team how the company plans to expand in the future, according to the schedule posted by Business Insider. The disappearing messaging company is expected to price its shares on March 1 and IPO the next day. In addition to competing with Facebook, Snap acknowledged in its S-1 filing that its product will be facing threats from international rivals. The Chinese internet giant Tencent, for example, has already formed a loyal user base in China’s social media space. Its QQ app appeals to a young demographic and allows them to take selfie pictures and videos that will self-distruct after a short period of time, just like Snapchat. The QQ platform has 877 million monthly active users in China (or 73 million daily active users), compared to Snapchat's 161 million globally. As the Wall Street Journal puts it, Tencent’s QQ is the “closest thing to Snapchat in China.” QQ is not the only messaging app that offers a Snap-like disappearing photo function. Facebook (FB) rolled out Instagram Stories in August last year for users to share videos that will disappear after 24 hours. It’s not hard to find a twin version of many U.S. apps currently blocked in China. For instance, Baidu (BIDU​) is considered the Chinese equivalent of Google. Renren.com (RENN​) or the WeChat Moments page runs like Facebook and Weibo is like Twitter. There are other reasons Snap could have a hard time entering China. The Google infrastructure behind the Snapchat app will hamper its potential to expand “in a manner acceptable to the Chinese government,” says in its S-1 filing. Even if Snap is approved to operate in China, local services already dominate the market, leaving almost no room for foreign players to compete. The experience of Uber is a case in point. The ride-sharing app was never banned in China, but failed to survive local competition. Like most social media companies, Snap relies almost entirely on advertising to drive revenue, via full screen video ads or sponsored geofilters. The U.S., where Snap is based, generated the highest advertising spending globally at $255 billion in 2016 and is expanding at 14% in the next four years, data from IDC show in the Snap filing. China came second at $86 billion in 2016 but is growing at 27%, almost twice as fast as the U.S. Global companies eye the Chinese market for its fast-growing economy, rising middle class and consumer spending power.

In a short period, innovative technologies have helped the so-called shadow banking system steal a march on traditional lenders, especially in financing small business and startups. Meanwhile, fintech innovators have begun to rely increasingly on non-bank sources for financing. These are powerful trends, but investors would do well to heed the words of the world’s new literary Nobel laureate: “The wheel is still in spin.”  Banks now seem poised to reassert themselves into the area, on their own and in partnership with non-bank lenders. This latest change will likely open opportunities for fintech even faster than before. Data are striking. Updates of a September 2015 study by researchers at the Chicago and Philadelphia Federal Reserve banks reveal that non-bank lenders of all sorts have risen from obscurity about a decade ago to originating some $200 billion of all outstanding small business and startup loans. Though banks still originate some $350 billion of such loans, this is a loss of market share at a prodigious pace. Smaller community banks, once overwhelmingly dominant in the area, have suffered the most. Their share of small business lending has dropped from 77 percent of the total at the turn of the last century to some 43 percent recently, while lending to startups has dropped from fully 82 percent of the total to a mere 29 percent. Such a sudden rise for non-bank lenders from next to nothing to nearly a fifth of the entire market surely constitutes a revolution. It speaks to the radical nature of this change that most of today’s dominant non-bank lenders did not exist a decade ago. Several factors are responsible for this turn of events. One is the decision among bankers to pull back from risk, especially in real estate and small business lending.  It is easy enough to understand why. The 2008-09 financial crisis bankrupted many small and large banks and would have done more damage were it not for support from the federal government and the Federal Reserve. If that experience were not enough to instill timidity into bankers, regulatory behavior since the crisis, especially the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, has made it expensive for them to take risk by insisting that they hold greater amounts of capital to back such loans. These regulatory restrictions are too much to ask for from smaller community banks. Even though larger institutions, those designated “too big to fail,” must hold greater capital reserves and meet more comprehensive reporting requirements than smaller banks, the implicit government guarantee against failure has given them a comparative advantage that more than compensates. It is noteworthy in this regard that about a fifth of the nation’s community banks have closed their doors since the law was passed. Meanwhile, the low interest rate environment fostered by the Fed has further dissuaded banks from lending. By lowering short-term interest rates, policy makers have reduced financing costs at depository institutions to nearly zero. Though longer-term bond yields on U.S. treasuries and other high-quality securities have dropped with declining short-term interest rates, they have not fallen nearly so far. On average during this time, the rate gap between short-term deposits and 10-year treasuries, for instance, has, according to Federal Reserve Board data, averaged about 200 basis points. This situation has given banks, large and small, an attractive arbitrage with which to turn a profit without having to take either lending risk or incur the disapproval of regulators. A more exciting story emerges from the non-banking side of the loan market. These lenders would no doubt have filled the financing gap left by the banks in one way or another but fintech has given them tremendous competitive advantages. To be sure, non-bank lenders use a bewildering array of business models including some act that as a kind of facilitator for peer-to-peer lending. Lending clubs, which started in this way, have since broadened sources of their own financing, sometimes from banks, and have begun to make comparatively large unsecured business loans. Some so-called “balance sheet lenders” raise funds through private equity and debt financing in capital markets and then actually keep the loans they originate on their balance sheets. Many of these are associated with so-called “payment processors” for internet-based transactions, such as PayPal and Google Wallet. For all this variety, all these non-bank lenders count on fintech innovations to make their lending arrangements more appealing to the ultimate borrowers, many of which are, of course, the fintech startups themselves. Though the list of specific fintech applications might seem infinite, fundamentally these lenders draw strength from powers in data collection, manipulation, and analysis so that they can develop a more complete picture of the borrower than was previously possible, allowing them to go ahead confidently with loans that would seem too risky in another context. This approach has benefited startups, specially those that could never have passed muster under traditional credit tests. Facility with data has allowed fintech innovators to transfer funds flexibly to find sources of financing and get around state usury laws, both of which have enabled them to gratify borrowers who otherwise would have faced rejection, though they have often done so at steep rates. When working with payment processors, tech-driven non-banks can reduce risk in still another way by arranging to have repayments come through automatic deductions from incoming receipts. The whole package makes the entire process easier for both borrower as well as lender and more likely to end in success. At once, it relieves much of the burden of applying for the loan, shortens the application to response time and, critically, allows the lender to make more flexible trade-offs between interest rates, loan covenants, and lending limits. That helps the lender to control its risk all while fashioning a deal that has more appeal to the borrower. But now the lending environment is changing yet again. For one, the Fed is raising rates. As its policy, as it inevitably will, narrows the gap between what it costs deposit-taking institutions to fund themselves and what they can get on high-quality bond purchases, banks surely will again begin to tolerate the risk needed to get higher-paying loans. Meanwhile, community banks, seeing the advantages of their non-bank competitors, have begun to work with them instead of against them. The developing links has potential to benefit for both players. The community banks, of course, will get access to financial technologies they could not otherwise develop for themselves, enabling them to qualify a prospective lender more quickly and more thoroughly than previously. Cooperation will also enable them to serve customers they could not in the past. Instead of the outright rejections, they will gain the ability to refer a questionable borrower to an affiliated non-bank lender.  At the same time, the non-bank lender gains by broadening its field for marketing and acquiring a way to offer customers loan support and other essential banking services that these notoriously staff-short firms could not in the past. Three things are apparent as this scenario unfolds. First, non-banking lenders will remain a force in the market for financing small business generally and startups in particular. Second, though the differences between non-bank and bank lenders, especially community banks, seem to blur, the business models that non-bank interlopers have developed and their effective use of fintech will clearly have a place in tomorrow’s environment. Third, the move toward cooperative ventures seems set to give greater innovative scope to fintech, by creating demands for them to apply their skills to still more areas of banking and finance.

The drawings of the 3-D sensors contained Alphabet's trade secrets, the lawsuit claims. The suit also alleges that a former Google employee ""downloaded more than 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary files shortly before his resignation."" The engineer,  Anthony Levandowski,  took ""extraordinary efforts to raid Waymo's design server and then conceal his activities,"" the suit alleges.

The voluntary agreement was brokered by the U.K. Intellectual Property Office (IPO), the government department that deals with patents and copyright issues, who called it a ""landmark"" deal. Search engines, in particular Google, have clashed in recent times with organizations that represent rights holders about how best to tackle pirated content. Even Google's YouTube has come under fire from the music industry over copyright in the past. ""Consumers are increasingly heading online for music, films, e-books, and a wide variety of other content. It is essential that they are presented with links to legitimate websites and services, not provided with links to pirate sites,"" Jo Johnson, U.K. minister of state for universities, science, research and innovation, said in a press release on Monday. The BPI (British Phonographic Industry), which represents the U.K.'s recorded music industry, and the Motion Picture Association are also part of the agreement.

Project Loon, an effort from Google's X ""moonshot"" development program, is a network of balloons that will provide high speed Internet access to remote areas of the globe. Today, the company announced its algorithms can now tell groups of balloons to hover in one area where Internet is needed, Google's ""Captain of Moonshots"" Astro Teller wrote in a post on Medium on Thursday. The Project Loon team was able to launch its balloons from Puerto Rico and direct them towards Peru, where they stayed for as long as three months. Initially, the company planned to create rings of balloons around the world that would move to regions that needed access. The new hover process can move balloons in a matter of weeks instead of months. Though more testing needs to be done - and there's still no news on when Project Loon will officially be in use -  this method is more cost effective and less work to manage.

Anita Balakrishnan,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"Google is expanding a carpool service in the U.S. and Latin America through its Waze app in the next several months, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The service, which allows commuters to pick up and drop off extra passengers along their route for a small fee, is often cheaper than ride-hailing apps Uber or Lyft, the Journal reported. But during the pilot programs in Israel and San Francisco, rides needed to be arranged hours in advance, and sometimes, no drivers accepted a request, according to the Journal. Waze is best known for its mapping app that crowd-sources traffic delays like accidents and construction. Unlike a ride-hailing app, drivers for Waze could not use the app as a full-time income, and the company doesn't currently take a cut of the drivers' pay, according to the Journal.

Leslie Picker,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"A fast-growing internet startup with a ""visionary"" founder goes public and offers negligible rights to the shareholders buying billions of dollars worth of stock. We've seen this movie before. There are many comparisons to be made between Facebook and Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat. A key one for investors: the tradeoffs in buying shares of a new technology company without having a say in how it's run. Snap is offering 200 million shares in its initial public offering, all of them non-voting. It is the first time a company has attempted to go public with non-voting stock, although Facebook and Google both subsequently issued non-voting shares. In effect, the non-voting shares are similar to the dual-class share structures that are more common among tech IPOs. Dual-class structures are designed to make it difficult or impossible for non-founder shareholders to generate a majority vote, which is needed to make certain changes at the company, such as replacing the CEO. Non-voting shares go one step farther — investors simply do not get a vote. But how much does corporate governance truly impact the performance at a company? The results are mixed and often reliant upon the person who is wielding control. Every founder, including Evan Spiegel of Snapchat, wants investors to think they are the next Mark Zuckerberg and therefore deserve more control. Investors who bought stock in Facebook five years ago would have more than tripled their investment today. Same with Google — which went public with multiple classes of shares in 2004 and has given investors returns of nearly 2000 percent since then. (Neither Google founder was chief executive at the time of its IPO, but they were both heavily involved.) But there are certainly red flags. Zynga, Groupon and GoPro offered multiple classes of shares to their investors and are each down at least 60 percent from their IPOs. That said, several tech companies that have gone public with a single class of shares have also suffered. Twitter is trading about 37 percent below its 2013 IPO price, while Etsy is down 19 percent since its IPO in 2015. Many studies tend to favor the single class of stock regardless. Controlled companies — or those that give certain insiders more power than others — tend to underperform non-controlled companies over time, according to a 2016  study by the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute and Institutional Shareholder Services. In other words, the returns of Facebook and Google may be exceptions rather than the rule when it comes to dual-class shares. Investors are trying to discern whether Snap falls into the Facebook bucket -- or the one with Zynga. Some investors are worried that Snap could be starting a dangerous precedent with its non-voting shares. The Council of Institutional Investors wrote a letter Feb. 3 to Mr. Spiegel, the founder, his co-founder Robert Murphy and Michael Lynton, the Chairman. ""We strongly urge Snap to reconsider the proposed structure, and instead go to market with a single-class voting structure, which overall is associated with stronger long-term performance and mechanism for accountability to owners,"" said Kenneth A. Bartsch, the executive director for CII. Other investors, though, are bullish on the prospects for Snap and do not care about voting rights. ""I know this is a contrarian view, but I fully support the Snap founders having complete control,"" said Jeremy Abelson, a portfolio manager with Irving Investors. ""There's no reason for them to go through the dance of allocating different voting classes; they want control, they deserve control and they have proven they can execute with control."" A representative for Snap declined to comment on its governance structure, due to the company's quiet period restricting public commentary ahead of the IPO.

Anita Balakrishnan,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"Technology has entered a new era where the most powerful companies will continue to make gains more and more quickly — and most founders and investors don't fully understand the implications, according to Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator's parent company. Altman wrote a letter on Tuesday warning young companies to tread carefully when trying to compete with the regulatory advantages and unbeatable scale of tech's dominant brands. Instead of trying to be the next Facebook or Apple, founders must strike where those companies are weak, Altman said. Here's what Altman wrote to start-up founders that envision themselves as the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg: Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have powerful advantages that are still not fully understood by most founders and investors. I expect that they will continue to do a lot of things well, have significant data and computation advantages, be able to attract a large percentage of the most talented engineers, and aggressively buy companies that get off to promising starts. This trend is unlikely to reverse without antitrust action, and I suggest people carefully consider its implications for startups. There will of course be areas where these companies are naturally weaker, and these are good areas to start companies. With Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all near record high stock prices, their total market capitalization of about $2.5 trillion accounts for about 13 percent of the S&P 500, according to Factset. Y Combinator, a program that mentors and invests in start-ups, has backed companies like Reddit and Dropbox. Altman's annual letter showed that Y Combinator's portfolio is on track to surpass a $100 billion total valuation. In the letter, Altman also said that he would teach a new free online course with advice for start-ups.

Arjun Kharpal,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"It's 2067 and robots have wiped out millions of jobs, AI is rampant, and unemployment is on the rise. Technology companies and CEOs have become public enemy number one. This portrayal of the future is one tech executives are keen to avoid and has driven a growing chorus to support the idea of a universal basic income (UBI). ""There is going to be backlash when it comes to jobs,"" Sayantan Ghosal, an economics professor at the University of Glasgow who has written about UBI, told CNBC by phone. U.S. technology firms have been investing heavily in research and development of AI. Tesla with driverless cars, Amazon with workerless shops, and the likes of Google developing smarter-than-human software. Even Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, recently stated that he was ""surprised"" by the pace of AI developments. Basic income 'necessary' Over the past few months, major technology executives have come out in support of a UBI. In an interview with CNBC in November, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk backed the idea. ""There is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation,"" Musk said. He reiterated his thoughts last week at the World Government Summit in Dubai, in which he said a UBI would be ""necessary"". Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, warned of AI creating ""digital refugees"". At the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos in January, Benioff said there was ""no clear path forward"" on how to deal with the job displacement that will occur. Other tech executives talked up the industry's responsibility. ""We should do our very best to train people for the jobs of the future,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at Davos. Tech firms could be in 'firing line' Experts say that the tech industry is growing more aware of its role in driving future automation and displacement, and companies don't want to be at the heart of any backlash from workers. ""That is a factor. The concern that suddenly public enemy number one will be robots and they (tech firms) will be in the firing line,"" Guy Standing, professorial research associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies, told CNBC by phone. ""But I think the sort of people I am meeting in the industry are more worried about the grotesque inequality and political backlash against that."" Standing is also a co-founder of the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN), a non-governmental organisation that promotes the policy. He is currently advising Y Combinator, a large U.S. start-up accelerator, on its basic income experiment. The firm is looking into a basic income experiment in Oakland. How a basic income project might work in the future is unclear and the technology industry is still not sure. One idea is for governments to pay everyone a monthly sum. Experts say it will not disincentivize workers because it will provide a bare minimum of living. Instead, workers will still want to get a higher standard of living by working. But any policy will be tough to fund. ""If you think of a basic income as providing a kind of floor to the standard of living for most people, then it will far exceed current benefit expenditure,"" Ghosal said. 'Robot tax' One way for governments to pay for a UBI is through a sovereign wealth fund, where they take a small two to three percent equity stake in all the publicly listed companies in the country and earn money in that way. Another idea that CEOs are slowly turning towards, is the taxing of ""super profits"", according to Standing. The academic told CNBC that a major technology CEO he spoke to said that he was convinced the industry would need to start making ""concessions"" in the form of taxing more profits. Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently floated the idea of a ""robot tax"" as a way for governments to get more money in the future. ""If a human worker does $50,000 of work in a factory, that income is taxed,"" Gates said in a recent interview with Quartz. ""If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you'd think we'd tax the robot at a similar level."" Academics like Standing and Ghosal say that like previous technological revolutions, workers are likely to be displaced, then retrain and get back into work. UBI would still let people work, but would give them some support as they find new skills. ""Universal basic income will provide a cushion and will allow people to rework and allow them to move and take advantage of new opportunities elsewhere,"" Ghosal said.

Kathleen Elkins,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"After graduating from the University of Chicago, Grant of Millennial Money found himself unemployed, living at home with his parents, and with a bank account balance of $2.26. ""That was a huge wake-up call for me,"" the now 31-year-old, who goes by his first name exclusively, tells CNBC. ""I remember thinking, 'I never want to feel like this again in my life.' I took a screenshot of my bank account as motivation and made it my personal goal to have $1 million in assets in five years."" He landed a digital marketing job that paid $50,000 a year, but ""quickly realized this just wasn't going to be enough money. I wasn't going to be able to get ahead making this and saving 5% to 10% of my income."" Grant's solution was to start a side hustle building websites. ""The first website I built was a $300 one for a law firm,"" he tells CNBC. ""That law firm ended up recommending me to another law firm, and in six months, I went from charging $300 per engagement to $5,000."" Within a year, he sold his first $100,000 project and decided to quit his full-time job to focus on growing his consulting business. Five years after taking the screenshot of his $2.26 balance, Grant hit seven-figures. In a post on his blog, Grant, who now lives in Chicago with his wife, outlines the five steps he took that helped him turn $2.26 into $1 million. ""I can't guarantee that you will have the same results, but if you follow even just a few of these steps, you are likely going to be much better off financially than you are today,"" he writes. 1. Get paid what you're worth ""The number one thing that will dictate your future earning potential and get you to $1 million the fastest is how much money you are being paid today,"" Grant writes. ""Unfortunately, you probably aren't being paid what you are worth."" The simplest way to boost your earning potential is to ask for a raise. Grant recommends looking at the salary range for someone with your level of experience in your industry, which will help you understand what you're worth. Then take that information to your boss and emphasize what you bring to the company. Remember, ""it doesn't hurt to ask,"" he tells CNBC. ""A lot of people are ultimately afraid that people are going to say no, and so they undervalue themselves and they undervalue their services."" 2. Save a ton of money … and put it to work ""In order to build wealth you need to be making as much money as possible on your money,"" Grant writes. ""Because you can only make so much money at any career, investing is truly the key to wealth."" During his five-year journey to seven figures, Grant saved 50% of his income. Today, despite his financial success, he still focuses on living simply and sets aside 40% to 50%. The key, Grant says, is to make things automatic: ""Talk to your HR company and have them start depositing at least 20% of your income directly into an investment account before you even see it. This is 20% of your income AFTER contributing to your 401(k). I have mine automatically deposited directly into my Vanguard investment account and the money then gets automatically invested into a mixture of index funds."" 3. Develop multiple streams of income After you've maximized your earning potential and are saving a good chunk of your salary, focus on increasing your revenue streams, by finding a part-time job, starting a side hustle or establishing passive income. ""If your goal to build wealth you need to master the side hustle and make money other ways than just your full-time job,"" Grant writes. ""This can really be anything, including driving for Uber, consulting, or building websites on the side."" Once you start making money from your side gig, invest 100% of the profits, says Grant: ""Once you find a great side gig, you will be tempted to spend that money in your everyday life as your bank account grows — but I strongly recommend you think of your side hustle as a key to building wealth (over the long term) instead of just being rich today."" 4. Invest in what you know While Grant is a big believer in simple index fund investing, he allocates 20% of his investment capital towards individual companies like Apple, Amazon and Google. If you're going to invest in individual companies, go with what's familiar, he says: ""Look at the products you use and consume every day; then research the fundamentals of those companies so you can learn more about their investment potential."" It's a strategy that investing legend Warren Buffett lives by. The billionaire only invests in companies that are within his ""circle of competence,"" a concept he first described in his 1996 Shareholder Letter. Simply put, stick to what you know. ""Defining what your game is — where you're going to have an edge — is enormously important,"" Buffett says. Once you've done that, buy and hold. 5. Monitor your net worth ""I look at my net worth every day when I wake up in the morning and have my morning coffee,"" Grant writes. ""There are few greater motivations than seeing this number rise over time. No matter where you start from. I have been tracking my net worth for the past five years and my first balance was $2.26."" He monitors his net worth using Mint.com, which allows you to link all of your financial accounts and displays your assets and liabilities. (Personal Capital does something similar.) Plus, it tracks your spending. ""At the end of the each year I take a deeper dive into this data and track what I have spent the past year on everything so I can work to improve my spending,"" he writes. If bad habits are holding you back, don't fret.

Only 46 weeks remain for one of five lucky companies to claim a $20 million prize -- and the first one to arrive on the Moon gets it. For the past 18 months, I've kept you up to date on the looming Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, a $40 million effort (recently increased from $30 million) -- sponsored by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and organized by Peter Diamandis' nonprofit XPRIZE organization -- to encourage private development of the Moon. But it's only now, this year, that the clock really starts ticking. At some time within the next 10 and a half months, one company must succeed in achieving XPRIZE's three key stated requirements -- or forfeit its chance to win the $20 million purse for placing first. Sometime in 2017, someone will land on the Moon. Bet on it. Image source: Getty Images. Still up for grabs is the grand prize -- $20 million for being the first team to successfully land on the Moon, travel at least 500 meters from the landing site, and transmit two high-definition ""Mooncasts"" back to Earth. The second team to complete all three missions will receive $5 million, and then there are up to $17 million in additional prizes for accomplishing various add-on missions (e.g., conducting a Mooncast from the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, or 17 landing sites, keeping a rover alive and functioning for at least two days, or finding water on the Moon). But to win any share at all of this loot, someone has to land on the Moon -- and someone has to be first. Who will the winner be? I've already introduced you to two of the leading contenders: Both these rivals have set launch dates vaguely in the ""late 2017"" range, ensuring this race will go down to the wire. As for the other participants, last month, XPRIZE announced the remaining three finalists ready to take a shot at the Moon. These include: Curiously, both Indus and Hakuto will ride the same PSLV rocket to the Moon, and land their rovers on the same lander. This could make it difficult deciding which one lands ""first"" and gets the big $20 million prize. But seeing as they have to land on the Moon successfully before they encounter this dilemma, figuring out who arrived first will be a nice problem to have once they get there. Indus and Hakuto plan to launch their XPRIZE mission on Dec. 28, 2017. First and foremost, the point will be earning bragging rights for accomplishing something no nongovernmental agency -- not even SpaceX -- has ever done before: landing a spacecraft on the Moon. And as we saw when privately held Scaled Composites won the Ansari XPRIZE back in 2004 -- and was later bought out by Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), which had previously owned only a minority stake -- just placing first in an XPRIZE competition could make a company more attractive to would-be acquirers. And by Dec. 31, 2017, we should know who that will be. ","

If you combined hedge fund investor David Tepper's net worth with mine, you'd have around $11 billion. Of course, Tepper is a multibillionaire ranked as one of the wealthiest people in the U.S. Let's just say his contribution to our combined net worth is a bit more than mine. Tepper and I think alike about at least one thing, though: Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). His Appaloosa Management hedge fund bought shares of Pfizer in the fourth quarter. I bought the pharmaceutical stock more recently (without any knowledge of the Appaloosa purchase, by the way). Why did Appaloosa buy Pfizer? You'll have to ask Tepper. But I can tell you why I did. Image source: Getty Images. There's just something about a company sending me money for doing absolutely nothing that I really like. Pfizer will send me money every quarter while I don't do a thing to help it grow. I'm talking about the company's dividend, of course. Pfizer has what I consider to be one of the best dividends around. Its yield currently stands just shy of 4%. That's higher than what most stocks offer. But could that high yield be in jeopardy? After all, Pfizer is spending more than it currently earns in profits to fund the dividend. I definitely wanted to make sure that this money for nothing wouldn't dwindle down to nothing before buying the stock. To find out if the dividend could be at risk, I checked out Pfizer's financial reports. Thankfully, the company's cash flow is quite strong. There really shouldn't be any problems with Pfizer continuing to pay out its dividend at current levels. I also listened to Pfizer's chief financial officer, Frank D'Amelio, speak at the J. P. Morgan Healthcare Conference held in January. He said that the dividend will continue to be ""an important part to our investing thesis."" It was great to hear that Pfizer remains committed to its dividend. D'Amelio also pointed out that the company will keep share repurchases as a priority. Stock buybacks are kind of like an invisible dividend that helps make existing shares worth more. During 2016, Pfizer returned $12.3 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As much as I like a solid dividend and stock buybacks, though, they're not enough for me. I also want a decent chance that the stock will climb in value. Pfizer's odds on that front look pretty good, in my view. To be sure, Pfizer faces some challenges. Sales for its legacy established products, including Lipitor and Premarin, are falling. So are sales for products that either recently lost patent exclusivity or will do so in the near future. Several of Pfizer's blockbuster drugs are also losing ground. A key concern is that sales for the company's biggest revenue generator, its Prevnar 13 vaccine, slipped 8% in 2016. Despite all of this, though, Pfizer shouldn't be in dire straits in the future. It has a wildly successful cancer drug with Ibrance. Sales for autoimmune disease drug Xeljanz are soaring. Smoking cessation aid Chantrix is growing revenue at a solid pace. Pfizer has also strengthened its lineup through acquisitions. It picked up eczema drug Eucrisa with the buyout of Anacor last year. The company brought prostate cancer drug Xtandi with its acquisition of Medivation. Both of these drugs should be multibillion-dollar products for Pfizer in the years to come. I also like Pfizer's pipeline. The company expects to have around five approvals in 2017 and another five or so in 2018. Pfizer should report results from 15 pivotal clinical studies over the next couple of years as well. Wall Street analysts think Pfizer will grow its earnings by an average of around 6.5% over the next five years. That seems realistic to me with the company's impressive new drugs and promising pipeline. Combined with its dividend, this growth rate should produce a nice total return from owning the stock. Tepper's hedge fund invested $156 million in Pfizer. My stake is a little smaller than that. (OK, it's a lot smaller than that.) However, I suspect that Tepper is as confident as I am that our investments will pay off over the long run. Pfizer is a great stock for billionaires and for those of us who aren't billionaires yet.

    A Billionaire Recently Bought Pfizer Stock -- and So Did I -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Virtual reality (VR) is forecast to become a $162 billion market by 2020, and the opportunities for investors to benefit are growing. Nearly every major technology company is pursuing VR, or at least looking into it, and some are spending billions in order to make it the next popular computing platform. So, how can individual investors benefit from all of this? Start with these three tips. Image source: Getty Images. You're probably hearing a lot about VR headsets these days. Oculus released its long-awaited Rift headset last year; Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) purchased the company more than two years ago for $2 billion. Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation VR headset launched back in October, giving PS4 users the ability to play and view VR content on their consoles. And Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently launched its new mobile VR headset, called the Daydream View. The company also just hired a key VR headset designer away from HTC, which makes the popular HTC Vive headset. But don't focus on any of that. VR headsets and other hardware are clearly an important part of this market, but the real gains will come from software and services. Tom Mainelli, vice president of devices and AR/VR at IDC, said last year that ""... what people can do with that hardware will depend upon the applications and services that power it."" According to IDC, hardware sales will account for more than half of VR and augmented reality (AR) revenues through 2020, but that it's software and services that have the real long-term potential. ""AR/VR software revenues will also get off to a quick start, growing more than 200% year over year in 2016, but will quickly be overtaken by services revenues in the middle years of the forecast, as logistics and manufacturing demand enterprise-class support,"" Mainelli said. In the technology sector, it's often the players that start out the biggest that win in the end, and virtual reality will likely be the same. That's why it's important to look at what Facebook, Alphabet, and Sony are doing in the space. Facebook's long-term goal isn't to just sell high-end VR headsets, but rather to create the next widely adopted computing platform. His long-term goal for AR and VR is to create an entirely new computing platform. ""So I do think a new computing platform always emerges every 10 or 15 years. VR is currently the most promising candidate,"" he said. While Facebook is looking ahead to the next computing platform, Alphabet is busy focusing on how it can gain from the mobile VR market. The company recently debuted its Daydream platform for Android users to find VR videos and apps. The importance of this VR hub can't be overstated. Smaller companies may be making VR content, but Alphabet's Google has built one of the only places where all of this content can live, and be easily found. As mobile VR takes off, Daydream will likely be the place where users go to get their content. Think of it like a Google Play store for VR. And while Facebook and Alphabet are busy building out platforms, don't forget Sony's potential to make itself a powerhouse in the VR gaming market. The company already working with more than 230 developers and publishers to create 160 PlayStation VR software titles. Sony's Game and Network Services is the company's second-most profitable business, and the company has said the VR ""offers great future potential"" for the segment. Honestly, the payoff for VR investors will likely take some time to materialize. That's because while the market is growing fast, VR represents only a small portion of revenues -- if any -- for many of the companies involved in the space right now. Facebook said its investments in VR weren't material to the company's 2016 financials, and Zuckerberg has stated several times that VR probably won't truly take off for another five to 10 years. But that shouldn't be a deterrent for investors. Virtual reality has the potential to transform how people access information, view content, and interact with each other. If it does become the next big computing platform, then taking a long-term approach to the will be the wise course. Investors should heed this advice Zuckerberg gave last year: ""We are betting that virtual reality is going to be an important technology. I am pretty confident about this. And now is the time to invest."" ","
      
    3 Virtual Reality Stock Investing Tips That Will Pay Off Long Term -- The Motley Fool

If you want to understand LendingClub (NYSE:LC), one of the first things you need to grasp is where the money to finances its marketplace loans comes from. It's tempting to think that LendingClub's main business is to match small mom-and-pop investors who are looking to earn a little extra yield on their savings with small-time borrowers who want to consolidate their credit card debt or student loans. But this is an outdated assumption about LendingClub's business model. Image source: Getty Images. Of the three types of investors that finance loans in its marketplace, the standard retail investor is far and away the least important. You can get a sense for this by looking at the flow of funds through LendingClub's three investment channels: the issuance of member payment dependent notes, the sale of trust certificates, and the sale of whole loans to qualified investors. Since LendingClub's inception, only 19% of the loans originated in its marketplace have come from member payment dependent notes, which is how the typical retail investor invests on LendingClub. The second largest category consists of the sale of trust certificates to accredited investors (high net worth individuals) and other types of qualified purchasers. This adds up to 29% of LendingClub's total originations. ""Certificate investors typically seek to invest larger amounts as compared to the average note investors and often desire a more 'hands off' approach to investing,"" states LendingClub's most recent 10-K. The third and largest category, accounting for 52% of total originations, consists of whole loan sales to institutional investors, such as banks, hedge funds, and others who seek to hold the actual loans on their balance sheets. ""To meet this need, we sell entire standard or custom program loans to these investors through purchase agreements,"" explains the company. ""Upon the sale of the loan, the investor owns all right, title and interest in the loan."" LendingClub's business model is becoming increasingly dependent on the third sources of funds in particular. In the latest quarter, a full two-thirds of its loans were originated for investors in the final category -- that is, purchasers of whole loans. Data source: LendingClub. Chart by author. All of this matters because the investors in the third channel are the most sophisticated. Unlike small retail investors, who may or may not have a good understanding of LendingClub's fundamental strengths and weaknesses, large institutional investors track these things closely, ready to pull their funds from LendingClub's marketplace at the first sign of trouble. This in fact is exactly what happened to LendingClub last year, after a number of questionable practices surfaced leading to the resignation of the online lender's CEO. As the company explains in its latest quarterly regulatory filing: As a result of the circumstances relating to our board review into certain private loan sales to a single institutional investor in contravention of its requirements and other matters, and the resignation of our former CEO, a number of investors that account for, in the aggregate, a significant amount of investment capital on the platform, have paused their investments in loans through the platform. While many of these investors have returned, many have invested at reduced levels, and it is possible that some investors may not resume investing through our platform. As a result, we may use a greater amount of our own capital, compared to past experience, to invest in loans. The fact that investors ""paused their investments in loans"" cuts to the heart of LendingClub's business model. As the company goes on to explain: ""Failure to attract investor capital on reasonable terms may result in the Company having to use additional capital to invest in loans or reduce origination volume."" Many of these investors have since come back into the fold, but that won't always be the case. The next time LendingClub runs into trouble, these investors may decide to remain on the sidelines. In short, while it's tempting to think that the risk of owning LendingClub's stock is decreasing as its track record lengthens, the company's growing reliance on a small number of large, sophisticated institutional investors to fund its marketplace lending platform suggests otherwise.

Generally, when you receive income outside of your usual paycheck, you'll also get a tax form summarizing your earnings. This form is known as a 1099, and it comes in a number of varieties. There's the 1099-MISC, which, as the name implies, is used to report miscellaneous income. There's also the 1099-INT, which reports interest income, the 1099-DIV, which lists dividend income, and the 1099-C, which covers canceled debt, among others. Any time you receive a 1099, you're required to report that income on your tax return. But what happens if you didn't receive a 1099 form that you were expecting to get? Believe it or not, 1099s go missing more often than you'd think. Sometimes, they get lost in the mail. Other times, they're simply not issued when they should be. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. If you're wondering how to get a 1099 you never received, the answer is to reach out to the would-be issuer and request one. But do you need to take this step? Actually, no. It's a question many taxpayers find themselves asking: Why didn't I get my 1099 form? There are a number of reasons you might be missing a form. Sometimes, companies are late in issuing them, and they do occasionally get lost. But if you're expecting a 1099 for income from a company you did business with, you should know that you probably won't get a form if your earnings totaled $600 or less. However, you're still required to report that income to the IRS, even in the absence of official documentation. Missing a 1099 is only a problem if you don't have your own records, and therefore don't know how much income to report. Unlike a W-2, which you're required to include with your taxes, 1099 forms don't get filed along with your return. So as long as you know what amount to report, there's no issue with not having the actual form. That said, even if you think you have perfect records, you may want to reach out to the issuer to follow up on a missing form. The reason? Companies and entities are required to file 1099s with the IRS. If your copy somehow goes missing but the IRS gets its copy, and the amount listed on that form doesn't match your records, your return could get flagged for an audit. Of course, some people will tell you that, if you're missing a 1099 and know what to report, you should leave it alone rather than risk having a payor issue a potentially erroneous form. But if you're able to get in touch with the issuer and confirm the amount to be listed on your form, there's no harm in getting an official record. While filing your taxes without a 1099 in hand generally isn't a problem, there is one exception, and that's the 1099-R, which lists distributions from pensions, annuities, and retirement accounts. You should receive a 1099-R if you collected at least $10 in distributions over the course of the tax year. And if you had income tax taken out of those payments upfront, you'll need to include that 1099-R on your return to show what was withheld. Otherwise, there's no actual need to go through the legwork of following up with your issuer. ","

According to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) latest SEC filing, Warren Buffett and company had an active fourth quarter in 2016. After sitting on a company record $85 billion cash hoard at the end of the third quarter, and having said that Berkshire spent $12 billion on common stocks in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, investors have been wondering what Berkshire has been up to. Here's the answer. While we don't necessarily know the reasoning behind Berkshire's latest investments, or whether they were initiated by Warren Buffett himself or one of his trusted stock pickers, we do know what changed in Berkshire's portfolio during the fourth quarter. Here are the most notable buys: Image Source: Getty Images. 1. Apple -- Berkshire already owned Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), although the company's $2 billion stake wasn't a large amount by Berkshire's standards. During the fourth quarter, Berkshire's Apple stake nearly quadrupled to about 57 million shares, which represent more than 1% of all the outstanding Apple stock. It's interesting to note that Buffett's stock-pickers were the ones who initiated the Apple investment, but given the size of the increase, the latest Apple addition could have come from Buffett himself. This investment did not surprise me at all. I've written before how Apple still represented a compelling bargain at the price levels it was trading for during the fourth quarter, and that Berkshire should take advantage. Well, apparently, management agreed. 2. Airlines -- Berkshire surprised many investors when it revealed its third-quarter 2016 investments in several airline stocks. After all, Buffett has spoken out against airline stocks as investments several times in his career, During the third quarter, Berkshire invested in American Airlines, Delta, and United Continental, and increased its stake in all three during the fourth quarter. At the same time the initial airline stakes were revealed, Buffett also said he made an investment in Southwest Airlines. He didn't specify the amount at the time, but we now know it's a stake worth more than $2 billion. 3. Monsanto -- Berkshire revealed a new stake in Monsanto, of about 8 million shares valued at about $872 million. Monsanto currently trades for about $109 per share, and the company plans to sell itself to Bayer for $128 per share. If the deal goes through, Buffett stands to make a quick profit, but the market doesn't seem convinced at this point. 4. Sirius XM -- The final major change was the addition of a nearly 167 million-share position in satellite radio operator Sirius XM. Granted, because of the company's $4.80 share price as of this writing, this stake translates into a relatively small (for Berkshire) $800 million investment. 1. Wal-Mart -- Buffett has been gradually trimming his Wal-Mart stake for some time, but he sold a substantial number of his remaining shares. Berkshire's investment in the retail giant has been cut from about 13 million shares to 1.4 million. As I've mentioned, we don't know the reasoning, but my guess is that the success of online retailers like Amazon has changed the competitive landscape in a way Buffett doesn't like. 2. Verizon -- Berkshire sold nearly all of its 15 million shares of Verizon during the quarter. Since Berkshire also unloaded its AT&T stake earlier in 2016, this didn't come as a huge surprise. 3. Kinder Morgan -- Buffett bought about 20 million shares of Kinder Morgan in early 2016, and sold his entire position during the fourth quarter. Kinder Morgan has nearly doubled from its early 2016 lows, so this could be a matter of the valuation simply not looking attractive to Buffett anymore. 4. Deere -- Just like Kinder Morgan, Deere has rallied sharply, up by about 43% over the past year alone. So, while we don't know for sure, this sale could potentially be due to a valuation issue as well. You shouldn't necessarily follow Buffett's moves. For one thing, by the time we hear about what Buffett is doing, it can be a completely different market. Since the fourth quarter ended, the S&P has risen by more than 4%, and some of the stocks Buffett has bought have risen even higher than that. Apple, for example, has risen by nearly 17% since the end of 2016, and Apple was trading even cheaper for much of the quarter. While I don't necessarily think Apple is too expensive to buy right now, it's fair to say that Buffett and company likely got a far better deal on their Apple shares than investors could get now. ^SPX data by YCharts ","

Shares of Gastar Exploration (NYSEMKT:GST) soared on Friday and were up 12% by 2:30 p.m. EST thanks to a financing agreement with funds managed by Ares Management (NYSE:ARES). Ares agreed to provide Gastar Exploration with $425 million in new funding, which includes a $250 million secured term loan due in 2022, $125 million in secured convertible notes due in 2022, and it will purchase $50 million in common stock. That capital will enable Gastar to fully repay the $70.4 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility and redeem all of its $325 million in senior secured notes that mature next May. As a result, the company can turn its attention away from strengthening its balance sheet and toward growing its compelling position in the STACK play of Oklahoma. Image source: Getty Images. Ares Management has provided similar financing to another downtrodden oil and gas producer in the past. Last year it provided $350 million in term loan funding to Clayton Williams Energy (NYSE:CWEI), which gave it the cash to pay off its credit facility and finance new wells. Ares also received warrants in that deal allowing it to buy the stock at $22 per share, and it would go on to buy another $150 million in Clayton Williams Energy's stock for $29.70 per share in a follow-on transaction a few months later. Those transactions would pay off handsomely for both Ares and Clayton Williams after the company agreed to sell itself to Noble Energy (NYSE:NBL) for $2.7 billion. Under the terms of that deal, Noble Energy would assume Ares' debt and pay investors about $139 per share in cash and stock. That marked quite the payday for Ares, which, at the time, owned 35% of Clayton William's stock. Gastar Exploration was able to get the financing it needed to ease its balance sheet burden so it can get back to drilling. Better yet, it got that funding from an investor with an excellent track record of helping beaten-down oil and gas producers. Investors clearly hope that Ares has the Midas touch and can do for Gastar what it did for Clayton Williams. ","

In the not too distant future, 5G networks will bring faster speeds, less latency, and more coverage to wireless consumers across the United States. 5G is shorthand for the fifth generation of mobile networks. It will be the next wireless standard implemented beyond the current 4G protocol most American wireless consumers enjoy today. The benefits will be immense and immediately recognizable. Data rates for 5G are expected to be 10 times faster than 4G and LTE systems, with download speeds as fast as 10Gbps (gigabits per second). 5G will connect the internet of things at speeds 10 times faster than 4G. Image source: Verizon Communications Inc. For a little perspective of how significant this upgrade is, consider this example provided by Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS) CEO Liam Griffin: With the 3G system, it took one day to download a full-length HD movie. This same file on a 4G network could be downloaded in minutes. On a 5G network, it would be a matter of seconds before the same movie was downloaded. Of course, a great deal of work remains to be completed before this new technology becomes reality, but much progress has already been made. Last July, the FCC passed a series of rules that laid the foundation for the advancement of 5G in the United States. These rules gave the telecom networks and tech giants the framework needed to experiment with the available spectrum to see what works best. Since the nationwide 5G network is a coming reality, investors would do well to consider which companies might stand to benefit the most in this massive shift in mobile networks. Here are three companies that are leaders in their respective markets and that are especially optimistic about their opportunities as 5G implementation moves closer. Collectively, they cover a wide variety of sectors and industries, and some might be more obvious than others. But together, this telecom giant, semiconductor manufacturer, and specialty glass maker might represent some of the best investments in the race to 5G. Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) is committed to being the first telecommunication company to deploy a 5G network. In the company's 2016 second-quarter conference call, CEO Lowell McAdams stated he learned from Verizon's experience with 4G LTE that ""being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities."" Image source: Verizon Communications Inc. Beyond the obvious benefits of being the first to upgrade its network, 5G would also substantially lower Verizon's Fios costs. Fios by Verizon is the company's effort to bring the advantages of fiber optics straight to the end consumer. In the same conference call, McAdams stated: I think of 5G initially as, in effect, Wireless fiber, which is Wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With Wireless fiber, the so called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure. With the premium pricing inherent to being the first to deploy a 5G network coupled with serious cost-saving benefits, the real question becomes whether Verizon will actually be the first to deploy a 5G network. On that front, CFO Matthew Ellis had encouraging news for investors during the company's most recently reported conference call: 5G wireless technology is a focus for us. We are now launching about 10 precommercial pilots across the country with multiple use cases, including dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. Our goal is to test the 5G fixed wireless technology in different environments in order to successfully operationalize 5G products for a commercial launch. Skyworks Solutions manufactures analog semiconductor products that enable smartphones, IOT devices, wearables, smart home devices, and a host of other products to connect to Wi-Fi or wireless networks. While mostly known as an iPhone supplier, the company is beginning to grow beyond Apple. CEO Liam Griffin is certainly excited about the company's prospects for growth related to 5G. In Skyworks' 2017 first-quarter conference call, Griffin stated the company's expertise, scale, and customer relationships were positioning Skyworks for ""5G leadership."" Later, Griffin added, ""5G represents a massive growth opportunity for our industry and certainly for Skyworks."" Why the sudden optimism? Precise filtering is increasingly important in wireless communications. Among the feathers in Skyworks' cap is they are one of the largest manufacturers of TC-SAW filters, which stands for temperature-compensated-surface acoustic wave filters. This is a quality, low-cost alternative to the more expensive BAW (bulk acoustic wave) filters, which some of Skyworks' competitors make. Traditionally, SAW filters work well on lower frequencies, but not higher ones. However, certain technical design choices (TDD v. FDD, if you're a networking geek) in the evolving 5G standard might open the door for Skyworks' cheaper filters to work at higher frequencies as well. This positions Skyworks to capture more market share in 5G-capable connected devices than previously would have been possible. Upon the news that Skyworks Solutions could play a larger part in 5G devices, shares spiked and are up more than 18% year to date. SWKS data by YCharts. It has been almost 50 years since Corning Inc (NYSE:GLW) invented the first low-loss optical fiber that could transmit data as light. Since that historic day in 1970, optical fiber has become the backbone of network infrastructure. While Corning is probably best known for outfitting LCD televisions with glass screens, its second-largest division is still manufacturing optical fiber. In Corning's most recently reported quarter, earnings from its optical communications segment were up a dazzling 85% year over year. The higher profitability was driven by improved manufacturing costs and the selling of their ""solution products"" in this area. Image source: Getty Images. In the conference call, CFO Tony Tripeny said the company expected strong growth in this division to continue, projecting for ""at least 25%"" growth in the current quarter. Tripeny also stated Corning was prepared to ""leverage the strong growth opportunities"" it sees in the telecom market as the industry leaders looked to invest in ""next generations and network capabilities"". It is no coincidence that Corning's stock price has skyrocketed the past year as this division has grown. A year ago, Corning's shares traded for about $18. Currently, shares are trading around $26.75, highs the stock price hasn't seen since before the Great Recession. ","

The hardest thing that satellite communications specialist Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM) has to deal with is the complexity of making upgrades to its service. Traditional wireless networks can simply drive a truck to land-based service points to make changes, but Iridium has to rely on rocket launches to get new satellites into orbit. After some delays, Iridium has finally moved forward with its NEXT system schedule, and coming into Thursday's fourth-quarter financial report, Iridium investors were curious for news on how the progress with the launches might affect its outlook. The satellite specialist's results were solid if uninspiring, but it reiterated its guidance going forward. Let's take a closer look at Iridium Communications to see how it did and what it believes is coming in 2017 and beyond. Image source: Iridium Communications. Iridium Communications' fourth-quarter results largely reflected the fact that the company has a lot riding on its NEXT system upgrade. Revenue was up just 1% to $107.4 million, which was roughly in line with what most investors had expected to see from the company. Iridium reversed a year-ago loss with net income of $24.1 million, and that worked out to earnings of $0.19 per share. That was $0.01 less than the consensus forecast but up 35% from adjusted earnings per share in 2015's fourth quarter. Looking more closely at the report, Iridium largely appeared to tread water in anticipation of its satellite launches. Total billable subscribers climbed to 850,000, up 9% from a year ago and up by 12,000 in the past three months. Gains in the government segment again provided outpaced subscriber growth of 17%, with the new subscribers skewed toward the machine-to-machine data services that Iridium offers. Commercial subscription counts rose 8% to 766,000, with machine-to-machine also dominating the increase there. Still, Iridium faces challenges in some of its business areas. Total commercial revenue was up just 1%, and voice and data services saw a 2% decrease in its top line. Government services revenue climbed at a sluggish 4% pace, and declines in subscriber equipment sales and commercial engineering and support revenue offset some gains on the government engineering side of the business. Average revenue per user for the commercial voice and data business fell $1 to $41 during the quarter, and airtime usage continued to fall from year-ago levels. CEO Matt Desch was nevertheless happy with the company's overall results for the year. Desch pointed to ""an increase in revenue from our government business and growth in personal tracking as well as leading heavy-equipment manufacturers."" In the CEO's eyes, those ""expanding relationships underscore Iridium's strong market position in the burgeoning market for real-time Internet of Things solutions."" Yet the truly important thing that Iridium investors are focused on is Iridium NEXT. The company said that it successfully launched its first 10 NEXT satellites in January and reported that the first satellite is actively carrying live communications traffic. By mid-April, Iridium expects eight of the 10 initial satellite launches to be in service, and the other two will drift into a different orbital plane for testing and eventual deployment. Iridium's guidance largely stayed stable. The company expects service revenue growth of 3% to 5% in 2017, working out to operational pre-tax operating earnings of $255 million to $265 million. That represents slower growth than the company anticipated for 2016, but it reflects the fact that NEXT won't be fully complete until 2018. In its long-range outlook, Iridium still sees service revenue of $440 million to $465 million for 2019. Iridium investors seemed pleased with the results, and the stock climbed more than 3% at the market's open following the announcement. Looking forward, the key for Iridium will be for subsequent launches to go off without a hitch so that it can get NEXT operational as quickly as possible. Further delays could result in more disappointment if Iridium has to push back its plans again. ","

Dan Caplinger,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM) has demonstrated an ability to take advantage of international resources for programming and information technology services. The company's focus on using professionals in Eastern Europe gives it a competitive advantage over some of its competitors, and EPAM has used the strategy to produce growing results for a long time. Coming into Thursday's fourth-quarter financial report, EPAM investors wanted to see further signs that the company would be able to keep producing attractive levels of growth. EPAM didn't manage to satisfy investors entirely, but its outlook for 2017 was quite strong. Let's look more closely at EPAM Systems to see how it did and what it sees ahead. Image source: EPAM Systems. EPAM Systems' fourth-quarter results continued the company's string of quarters with solid growth. Revenue climbed almost 21% to $313.5 million, which was slightly higher than the 20% growth rate most investors were looking to see. Adjusted net income climbed 10% to $51.5 million, and that resulted in adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share. That was up from 2015's fourth quarter, although it fell short of the consensus forecast among investors by $0.01 per share. Taking a closer look at the report, EPAM's geographical focus continued to show signs of negative impacts from currency considerations. The company said sales gains would have been more than two percentage points higher for the quarter in constant currency terms, and for the full year, currency impacts cost the company 2.5 percentage points in additional revenue growth. EPAM's hiring pace continued to be strong. Headcount rose to nearly 22,400 by the end of 2016, up by more than 650 employees in the past three months, and having risen by 22% compared to the end of 2015. In particular, delivery professionals approached the 20,000 mark, also rising more than a fifth over the past 12 months. However, EPAM saw some pressure on the cost front that ate into its profit growth. Overall costs of revenue climbed by a quarter, causing gross margin to fall below 37%, a drop of more than two percentage points. However, controlling overhead expenses helped minimize the hit to operating margin, which fell just a fraction of a percentage point. CEO Arkadiy Dobkin was happy about the company's performance. ""2016 was a milestone year for EPAM,"" Dobkin said, and ""we tripled revenues since our IPO, closing at over $1 billion."" The CEO also noted that it has worked hard to broaden its service offerings in order to compete more effectively in the marketplace for IT services. EPAM has high hopes for the coming year. In Dobkin's words, ""Our continued evolution in extending our Engineering DNA into a full spectrum of services for digital business has positioned EPAM as a new breed of service provider, keeping us relevant to clients navigating dynamic market demands."" In particular, EPAM's guidance was optimistic. For the first quarter, the company expects revenue of at least $315 million, which would represent a 19% growth rate from year-ago levels, and adjusted earnings of at least $0.72 per share is also roughly in line with what investors expect. Meanwhile, for the full 2017 year, EPAM's projections included sales growth of at least 20%, and adjusted earnings of $3.38 per share or more for 2017 stands to look quite favorable compared to the current consensus forecast among those following the stock. EPAM Systems investors were pleased with the report, and the stock climbed nearly 4% in morning trading following the announcement. With so much demand for IT services, EPAM has a golden opportunity to capitalize on the chance to broaden its customer base and use its competitive advantages as effectively as possible looking forward.

The growth of Waze’s carpool service puts Alphabet Inc.’s Google more directly in competition with Uber Technologies Inc., the startup that pioneered the ride-sharing industry, growing to a juggernaut with a $68 billion valuation. Google and Uber were once allies, but they are increasingly becoming rivals in areas such as mapping and self-driving cars. Still, Waze’s service differs from those of Uber and its smaller rival, Lyft Inc., which are effectively on-demand taxi services, with many drivers making it their main job. Waze instead wants to persuade regular drivers using its navigation app to pick up people who are heading in the same direction. An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

Business leaders want to be able to plan and operate without worrying about unwelcome surprises. Corporations rely on the rule of law to enforce contracts and create a level playing field. Corporate leaders, of course, act in the interests of their shareholders. So what then can sufficiently  spur CEOs and other business leaders to join forces against Trump? One possible motivator is that Fortune 500 firms are predominantly based in “blue” states and cities, and many executives may well be a product of their environment. Indeed, technology leaders often have personal values and political philosophies at odds with Trump. For instance, libertarian-minded corporate leaders could push back if the Trump administration seeks access to private emails and corporate databases. Free-trading CEO believers could push back if their global supply chains are damaged by Trump’s trade moves. A lack of confidence in the executive branch could spur CEOs to use their considerable clout so that Congress stands up to Trump, and to influence Trump himself. In this way, Corporate America could become a de-facto fourth branch of the U.S. political system — a solid check on presidential power. Corporate leaders, with their focus on profits, jobs, and the rule of law, can play an important role in enabling the U.S. to continue as a functioning constitutional democracy that is open for business. Any movement seeking to hold the Trump administration accountable should include corporate leaders in its ranks.

Andrew Boyd,02232017,MarketWatch,02162017,"Published: Feb 23, 2017 11:20 a.m. ET Soon, wearable health devices may be able to diagnose illnesses By Wearing a fitness tracking device could earn you cash from your health insurance company. At first, this sounds lucrative for the people who participate, and good for the companies, who want healthier insurance customers. But it’s not quite so simple. Under the program, people who have certain health-insurance coverage plans with UnitedHealthcare can elect to wear a Fitbit  activity tracker and share their data with the insurance company. The data would be analyzed by Qualcomm Life, a company that processes medical data from wireless sensors for doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. Depending on how active participants are, as measured by the Fitbit, they could earn as much as $1,500 toward health-care services each year. Interest in wearable fitness trackers is booming. More than half of people who already own one believe their devices will help them increase their life expectancy by 10 years — even though it’s impossible to actually know that because the clinical trials necessary would take at least a decade. Adding free money to the mix only makes the devices seem more attractive. Before we celebrate this new partnership, though, it’s important to consider potential costs to the patients. We aren't far from days when wearable health devices will be able to diagnose illnesses. While this is not legal now, if Obamacare were repealed, as Republicans have vowed to do, corporate partnerships like this one with UnitedHealthcare

                                   could pave the way for insurance companies to use fitness tracker data to deny coverage or hike up rates for consumers. There are positive elements to pairing wearable fitness trackers with health data. An existing flu treatment medication works best when administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. But it’s difficult to catch the flu so quickly. A Fitbit could make that much easier. If the device measures a sudden decrease in the number of steps the person takes per day, plus perhaps an elevated resting heart rate, that could signal the presence of a virus. If an insurance company has access to those data, it could send a message to the patient. If the person really was feeling poorly (rather than just having decided to watch TV all day or gotten snowed in), she could be directed to go to her doctor or an urgent care clinic. The person could see a health professional quickly, get an effective treatment and be on the mend sooner — thanks to her Fitbit data. This ability will only increase in the future. There are more than 20 clinical trials using Fitbits underway, studying the role of activity in treating pediatric obesity and cystic fibrosis, and even how it can boost chemotherapy’s effectiveness and speed in recovery from surgery. As those studies are published in the coming years, researchers and doctors will get even better at identifying signals of specific diseases in wearable devices’ data. Similar efforts include one to detect influenza with a portable heart-rate monitor. Other researchers are analyzing voice and speech patterns to reveal neurological disorders and other diseases — and are using calls to a health-insurance company as a data source.

                                   , which has offered a $10 million prize to the team who can develop a specific type of multifunction medical device. Without involving a health-care worker or facility, the device must be able to accurately diagnose 13 health conditions, including pneumonia and diabetes. It must also be able to capture in real time five vital signs, such as heart rate and breathing rate, and process the data locally. The global competition is down to finalists; the winner will be announced early this year. That could bring wearables’ insights to doctors — and insurance companies — much sooner than we might think. Wearables’ data can definitely be used to help patients. But it could also be used to harm them, particularly in light of recent political developments. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act (also called Obamacare), insurance companies were barred from denying coverage to customers who had pre-existing medical conditions at the time they signed up for insurance. If that rule is lifted by Republicans in Congress, insurers might look to wearable devices for evidence they could use to refuse to pay for patients’ health care. This development would have enormous consequences. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as many as half of all Americans have some sort of condition that could be used to exclude them from coverage, such as asthma, cancer or mental illness. Might insurance companies ask prospective customers for their Fitbit data, in addition to — or even in lieu of — a physical exam or laboratory tests? If that provision of Obamacare were repealed, could insurance companies set rates based on what those data show — or deny coverage entirely? Car-insurance companies are already using similar methods. Some insurers provide their customers with devices to install in their cars, measuring drivers’ behavior and calculating the risk involved — and the rate they pay for coverage. At the moment, the algorithms connecting activity tracker data and health conditions are still under development. But the biggest thing UnitedHealthcare would need is a large data set of customer Fitbit measurements, so it can link them to insurance claims. Its new cash-for-data program will begin to assemble that information. As insurance customers signed up to use a Fitbit and get some extra cash for sharing their data, United would be able to match their Fitbit measurements with any health conditions identified in their medical records. Over time, the company could build up enough information from, say, people with asthma and people without it to be able to tell asthma patients apart by looking just at their data. The company could do this for other common diseases, too, or even adapt the algorithms from the contestants in the Qualcomm competition. It’s unclear what the company would do with what it learned. But one possibility is that when evaluating a prospective customer, the company could look at his data and know all about any pre-existing conditions. That might mean a person doesn’t get insurance, or has to pay more for coverage. The financial power of the health-insurance industry is enormous. Not only are there many large companies, but they have the ability to determine whether a sick person gets well or doesn’t — and whether the cost is ruinous or merely expensive. Would people feel able to object if insurance companies required customers to wear fitness trackers or other monitoring devices? Would new patients provide access to past data a Fitbit collected? Could an insurance company consider it fraud if a user didn’t wear the device? If used — and regulated — well, the devices can help individual patients change their daily habits to become healthier, saving insurance companies money, and passing some of those savings along to customers. Alternatively, the devices could provide justification for denying coverage to the inactive or unhealthy, or boosting their insurance rates. Consumers should not assume their insurance companies will use their data only to improve patient care. With millions of dollars on the line, insurers will be sorely tempted. With the legal landscape around pre-existing conditions in flux, people should think twice before signing up.

Daniel Halper,02232017,MarketWatch,02162017,"Published: Feb 16, 2017 10:16 a.m. ET By President Trump, in an all-out feud with the country’s intelligence community over persistent leaks, will begin a major review of the spy agencies, according to a report. Trump is set to tap a billionaire financier, Stephen Feinberg, to lead the review, which has been met by “fierce resistance” by the intelligence agencies, The New York Times reported. The selection of Feinberg, co-founder of hedge fund Cerberus Capital Management and a member of the president’s economic advisory council, signals the president’s attempt to keep the review process within the White House. Details of the review – its scope and timeline – have not yet been determined. The findings of any White House review would give Trump ammo should he seek full-scale change to the way intelligence agencies operate. Trump this week blasted the nation’s intelligence community over leaked phone conversations former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had with a Russian ambassador over US sanctions. “From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked; it’s criminal action. It’s a criminal act, and it’s been going on for a long time before me, but now it’s really going on,” Trump said during his joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. He also called the intelligence leaks “Very un-American!” in a Wednesday tweet. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Flynn was forced out over an “eroding level of trust” after he “misled the vice president and others” regarding his pre-inauguration phone conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. During the transition period, Trump compared intel agencies to Nazis. “Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ‘leak’ into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?” he said on Twitter. This article originally appeared on NYPost.com. ",Trump taps Cerberus’s Feinberg to lead intelligence review  - MarketWatch

Jennifer Booton,02232017,MarketWatch,02162017,"Published: Feb 16, 2017 8:26 a.m. ET Groupon stock spikes 23% higher as acquisition of rival boosts user numbers, holiday performance beats expectations By Shares of Groupon Inc. skyrocketed more than 23% on Wednesday after the daily-deals company said it paid virtually nothing for former rival LivingSocial and increased sales and earnings well beyond expectations. The stock notched its fifth-largest percentage gain ever, sending its shares to a closing price of $4.64, their highest point since October 26, 2016. Despite Groupon’s

                                   , rising 13.5% in the past three months compared with 7.6% for the index. The stock ticked 2% lower in premarket trade Thursday following a downgrade to neutral from outperform at Wedbush Securities, which encouraged clients to hold shares after Wednesday’s post-earnings rally. Nevertheless, the stock spike follows a 2% increase in fourth-quarter sales reported Wednesday morning, reflecting a boost in demand tied to the holiday shopping season. Groupon’s revenue was nearly $935 million, topping the Wall Street consensus estimate of $913 million. While net losses widened to $50.2 million, adjusted earnings per share of seven cents topped the three cents analysts on average had been expecting. Groupon benefited from its purchase of rival LivingSocial during the quarter, despite the fact that investors initially shunned the deal, evidenced by a selloff in Groupon shares of as much as 9% after the deal was announced in after-hours trade on Oct. 26. In a year-end securities filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Groupon said it bought LivingSocial for “no consideration,” which means it paid virtually nothing for a top rival that once was valued around $6 billion. In that same filing, Groupon touted an increase in active users for the full year, partially due to LivingSocial. Groupon had 52.7 million active users at the end of the fiscal year, compared with 48.9 million in the year-earlier period. That includes roughly 1 million incremental active customers from the LivingSocial acquisition. Despite the strong quarter, Groupon still has to face a number of challenges, including declining international revenues. Overseas sales fell to 26.3% of total revenue in 2016, compared with 27.8% and 31.6% in the two years prior. Other major risks include competition. In its 10K filing with the SEC, Groupon said it expects to “increasingly compete against other large internet and technology-based businesses that have launched initiative which are directly competitive” to its core business. The average analyst rating on the stock is the equivalent to hold, while the average 12-month price target is $4.74, according to FactSet.

And it announced during its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday that it has completed the $250 million sale of its Union Square Men’s building in San Francisco. Macy’s reported a fourth-quarter sales decline to $8.52 billion from $8.87 billion last year, and missed the FactSet consensus of $8.62 billion. Same-store sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis fell 2.1% for the quarter, compared with a FactSet estimate for a 2.5% decline. Executives said digital sales experienced double-digit growth during the quarter. Macy’s shares are down 0.3% in Wednesday trading. See also: Macy’s profit tops views despite falling sales Lundgren, who will be handing over the CEO title to Macy’s president Jeff Gennette on March 23, 2017, took time to remind everyone during the Tuesday call that stores are “how the large majority of Americans shop.” “Ninety percent of what we sell at Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s is still sold in a physical store,” said Lundgren, according to a FactSet transcript of the earnings call. “That’s for all product sales, including apparel, shoes, beauty, handbags, jewelry, home furnishings, all the things we carry… Lots of people don’t believe that or understand that, but I just wanted to point that out.” So confident is Lundgren in the value of stores, he believes that if “the department store did not exist today, there’d be a group of smart people sitting in Silicon Valley inventing the department store today, because it will serve a purpose,” he said. About 8% to 9% of all U.S. retail sales are online, according to an October 2016 Moody’s note, though e-commerce sales is outpacing retail growth. Department stores are expected to generate about 35% to 40% of their sales from e-commerce over the coming decade, up from about 20% today, Moody’s said in a Feb. 9 note.

To do so, they must shrink the infrastructure associated with their bricks-and-mortar footprints and redeploy that savings to technology if they hope to keep up with rapidly-evolving customer expectations.” Susquehanna Financial Group analysts don’t think Macy’s stores are as valuable as Lundgren does. “We believe hundreds of Macy’s current locations, perhaps even half their store base, have an alternate best use that would far exceed the value of being used as a department store,” they said in a Tuesday note.

Heading toward 2025, they expect that percentage to rise to 40%. “Macy’s will work hard to test new formats such as their clearance and off-price strategy as well as the key initiatives such as increasing the availability of exclusive merchandise,” the note said. “Our concern is that department stores are not just wrestling with a cyclical issue, but more significantly, we believe it is a secular issue.” During the call, Lundgren spoke of the shifts happening in retail as a regular occurrence, saying that in his 14 years at the helm of Macy’s and six years as CEO of Neiman Marcus, there were setbacks “that seem to happen every five-to-seven years in our industry.” Susquehanna rates Macy’s shares neutral with a $31 price target. Cowen & Co. said it is “confident that Macy’s management doesn’t have its head in the sand” since it’s focusing on its real estate and issues with its promotional strategy.

Brett Arends,02232017,MarketWatch,02162017,"Published: Feb 23, 2017 10:09 a.m. ET Brett Arends predicts Milo Yiannopoulos will end up with another book contract — and gain in the longer term By If liberals and others think they just squelched right-wing attention-seeker Milo Yiannopoulos for good, they should think again. Yes, the stunning three-day cyber-lynching that culminated in Tuesday’s news conference has cost him his speaking gig at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, his Simon & Schuster book deal, and his role at Breitbart, the silly far-right website that reads as if it were written in crayon. But so what? Short-term pain will lead to long-term gain. Yiannopoulos is one of the least pleasant or sympathetic characters in political discourse. Still, as long as he plays his cards right, he will emerge as the winner from this. The losers will be his opponents. Why? First, he’s now more famous than ever. A week ago, even after the Berkeley riot against his speaking engagement, he was an obscure fringe figure. Now everyone knows his name. In the modern cyberworld, all that really matters is name recognition. Infamy is as valuable as fame. If Kim Kardashian can add to her brand value by flashing her butt on the internet, all old-fashioned standards are finito. Second, he’ll get another book contract. Actually, he could just self-publish his manuscript through something like Amazon’s Createspace service. Marketing won’t be a problem — least of all now — and he’d pocket a much higher percentage of the cover price than he was going to get before. But even if he doesn’t go down that road, there are plenty of other book publishers who will snap him up. Third, he’ll probably keep a lot of his original advance anyway. It’s been reported, but not confirmed, that Simon & Schuster had agreed to an advance of $250,000. The publishing firm hasn’t responded to queries. But it’s dollars to doughnuts it’s already paid Yiannopoulos some of the money. And if he sues, it may have a hard time withholding the rest. This looks like breach of contract. And an independent publishing expert tells me he doubts Yiannopoulos’ contract included the kind of “reputation clause” that might have protected the company. So he could end up with two advances, not one. LOL, as they say. Fourth, he’ll sell many more copies of his book than before. Far-right nuts are a dedicated and passionate group of paranoiacs. They are convinced they are being oppressed by a shadowy and sinister conspiracy of “elites,” “liberals,” “globalists,” Jews and so on (the latest term is “the Deep State”). To these people, Yiannopoulos is now a cause célèbre: His lynching by the Illuminati makes him even more heroic. Fifth, this “scandal” and this wave of outrage will die down. One of the features of mass hysteria in the age of the internet is that although it can erupt out of nowhere, it also fades pretty quickly too. People who can get enraged over a YouTube clip are also quick to forget. Next month they’ll be enraged about something else. Sixth, this gives him an excuse to dump Breitbart. It’s one thing to be a far-right trash website and a purveyor of drivel. But now that Breitbart has supplied the president’s senior adviser, the joke has passed its tell-by date. Yiannopoulos is better off growing up a bit and becoming, say, the next Ann Coulter. Seventh: Oh yes, and finally... in this case he’s actually in the right. No, I’m not defending what he said. (Spare me the outrage, please.) But I certainly defend his right to say it. Those of us who were never sexually abused as children probably ought to think twice, or even thrice, before we lecture those who were. Yiannopoulos chooses to deal with the abuse he suffered through humor, flamboyance, and provocation. Does an abuse survivor not have that right? Seriously? I took most of his remarks as tongue in cheek anyway. While most of us support maintaining the sexual age of consent at 16 or 18, it’s also hard to say any discussion of the topic must be forbidden, when it was 14 in Canada until a decade ago and it is 14 in some European countries, including Germany, today. We had better stop all public performances too of Romeo & Juliet, whose heroine “hath not seen the change of fourteen years.” Yiannopoulos’ biggest mistake in this entire affair was apologizing. It’s almost never a good idea: It demoralized your friends, and emboldens your enemies. It is a paradox that Yiannopoulos, who was embraced by CPAC and Simon & Schuster despite all the genuinely awful things he’s said before, should have been rejected over this. But he will be back.

Caroline Baum,02232017,MarketWatch,02162017,"Published: Feb 22, 2017 12:00 p.m. ET Lowering rates after the bubble bursts is easy, but raising rates to avert a bubble is hard By Back in the old days, when the ratio of Federal Reserve talk to action was low, the central bank would adopt a “bias” in its policy directive, indicating the likely direction of the next move in interest rates. The Fed’s bias was said to be “symmetric,” an oxymoron, when the Fed was neutral about its next move, and “asymmetric” if it were leaning toward either tightening or easing. The idea of a different kind of asymmetry in Fed policy has been gnawing at me for a long time, coming into clearer focus after the Fed slashed the funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25% in December 2008 in response to the financial crisis. That’s when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke started to focus on the asset side of the balance sheet — what the Fed was buying — instead of the liability side: the size of the monetary base. Bernanke would explain in speeches and op-eds that the Fed’s purchases of long-term Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities lowered their yields, forcing investors to chase higher returns offered by stocks, corporate bonds and other riskier assets. Lower mortgage and corporate bond rates make it cheaper for homeowners to borrow and businesses to invest, Bernanke said. Higher stock prices produce a wealth effect, encouraging consumers to spend more. Every time Bernanke talked about the so-called portfolio-balance channel through which monetary policy operates, it sounded as if the Fed were in the investment-advisory business. The idea that Grams and Gramps, living off their retirement savings, should restructure their portfolios in favor of junk bonds seemed ill-advised. Financial conditions replaced money as the be-all and end-all of Fed policy. Economists inside and outside the Fed indulged their fascination with mathematical models and churned out a variety of financial conditions indexes. The Chicago Fed’s National Financial Conditions Index, for example, is “a weighted average of 105 measures of financial activity, each expressed relative to their sample averages and scaled by their sample standard deviations.” An alternative index, the adjusted NFCI (ANFCI), “isolates a component of financial conditions uncorrelated with economic conditions to provide an update on financial conditions relative to current economic conditions.” Got it. Eyeballing the graph of the NFCI, what one can say with some degree of certainty is that financial conditions tighten during recessions. The Chicago Fed even admits its index is a coincident indicator. As it turns out, an NFCI subindex tracking household and nonfinancial business leverage ratios does provide an early warning sign of financial stress. Which makes one wonder why it is such a well-kept secret in the financial world. Back to our story line. By its words and deeds, the Fed is encouraging risk-taking. Yet when anyone criticizes the Fed for inflating asset bubbles, economists balk. “The Fed can’t identify a bubble in advance,” the cries go out. No, it can’t. No one is suggesting that an official sitting behind a desk in Washington put his finger to the wind and determine when “signs of froth” have morphed into a full-blown bubble. But if the Fed is encouraging risk-taking with its rock-bottom interest rates and $4.5 trillion balance sheet, largely composed of Treasuries and MBS, shouldn’t it be concerned about excessive risk-taking? Surely there are metrics that could help determine when debt and asset prices have gotten completely out of line. In 2003, economists William White and Claudio Borio of the Bank for International Settlements presented a paper at the Kansas City Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium on the risks posed by rising household debt and property prices. The reception was less than enthusiastic. White and Borio were early in warning of the threat. They were also correct. Over the years, White, who is currently chairman of the Economic Development and Review Committee at the OECD in Paris, has focused on the need for a metric, or rule, to help central bankers assess when credit and asset prices have gotten so out of balance as to pose a threat to the financial system. The 2008 financial crisis put to rest the notion that central bankers can always clean up the mess after a bubble bursts. In a 2009 working paper, “Should Monetary Policy ‘Clean or ‘Lean’?” White argued in favor “pre-emptive tightening” — leaning against the expansionary credit cycle — instead of “pre-emptive easing” to deal with the aftereffects. Following the 2008 financial crisis, there was considerable interest in exploring ways to prevent a recurrence. Bernanke hinted that he was looking at the role played by both interest rates and regulation in fostering asset bubbles. With time, the impulse for using interest rates faded. The standard counter arguments — monetary policy is a blunt instrument; it can’t pop an asset bubble without hurting the economy — overwhelmed any interest in exploring something new. The Fed settled on enhanced “macro-prudential regulation” as the best preventative medicine. Economists devote a good deal of effort to creating a reliable monetary-policy rule. Why not focus some of that energy on developing a guidepost, at minimum, to gauge when excessive credit creation and inflated asset prices are creating a systemic risk? Central bankers thought they had found the Promised Land after decades of low and stable inflation. They called it the “Great Moderation.” Economic growth was strong, inflation was low, and inflation expectations had been tamed. Back-to-back bubbles — in tech stocks and in residential real estate — challenged the thinking that low inflation alone would produce economic growth and financial stability. Higher capital standards will shift the cost of the clean-up from taxpayers to lenders. But regulation remains an imperfect solution, primarily because no one can anticipate, or regulate, the next bubble. In a world of evolving financial instruments and proliferating non-bank lenders, it is surprising to see central bankers put their faith in regulation yet again. They might sleep better at night if they had another mechanism to warn of the rising seas — before the levees are actually breached.

Those of us in middle age have felt the pace of our lives speed up as we’ve gotten older. But it wasn’t until I recently recorded my mother during her 94th birthday celebration that I appreciated just how concentrated the pace of change has been for someone in her 10th decade. “Everything changed so fast. But it was recently, not when I was young,” Mom said. “Everything from computers to printers to iPads. All that technology happened very fast, too much at once.” Those words echoed a book I just read by Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman: “Thank You For Being Late: An Optimist’s Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations.” Technology is just one of three accelerations Friedman says we’re experiencing (the others: globalization and climate change). He and I talked in his Washington, D.C. office about the forces reshaping the world — especially the workplace — and what people in their 50s and 60s can do about them. Highlights: Question: You pose a question in your book: Are things just getting too damned fast? I know how my 94-year-old mother would answer it. How about you? Thomas Friedman: Yes, they are.

And it’s moving to three to five years. If you think of new technology as moving up in steps — mainframes to desktop to laptop to hand-held — with each one of those steps, you get a set of technologies, they diffuse, they scale and they give birth to the next one. The new capabilities keep coming. We can store more stuff, we can compute more stuff faster and we can send it down pipes faster. When you put it all together, it’s staggering what’s going on in the change of the pace of change.

You quote a Congressman from Minnesota who said that over the last 50 years, if you were an average worker, you needed “a plan to fail.” When and why did that change? Two things happened. When you think of the average worker in the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, what was the golden era of productivity, there was so much blue-collar labor because of America’s industrial explosion after the war and because everyone else was still flat on their back because of the war. And you had a lot of white-collar work. My uncle worked at a bank as a loan officer in Minneapolis with just a high-school diploma. And that’s why you needed ‘a plan to fail’ to get out of the way of that updraft. Then during the ‘80s, ‘90s and early aughts, globalization began to kick in and the pace of technology started to kick in. And the combination of the two posed a challenge for a lot of these workers. But we took care of them with home mortgages, so they were able to ride up the value of their home. And we had a big credit expansion; people could charge things much more efficiently on their VISA

You had a leap up to a new platform — automation and software — that really started to rapidly devour white-collar and blue-collar lower-skilled work. And then the next year, the great recession ate people’s mortgages. There was a group of people whose home and job were fundamentally threatened at the same time, the two things that were keeping them in the middle class. I think there were a lot of Trump voters caught in that pincer movement. It explains the level of anger and the sense that the game was rigged.

                                   as among the most innovative in preparing its workers for the future. There’s a new social contract at AT&T. It’s very simple. You can be a lifelong worker at AT&T now, but only if you’re a lifelong learner. That’s the only way. You have to invent, reinvent and renew your job. When I graduated from college, I got to find a job. My daughters really had to invent a job. They’ll have to advance, retool and reinvent themselves so many more times than I did originally. So much more is on you. The government can help you with a safety net, but it can’t make you go to school. How does AT&T incentivize employees to become lifelong learners? Their deal is you need to take the degrees AT&T has designed with Udacity [an online university] in order to upgrade your skills and acquire the skills you’ll need for the AT&T of the future, which is now much more of a technology company and less about climbing up telephone poles. If you do that, they’ll give you first crack when new jobs open. They won’t go outside. AT&T’s deal is we’ll give you the courses, we’ll even pay your tuition — up to $8,000 a year and $30,000 over your lifetime at the company — but you have to take the courses on your own time. If you’re ready to do the learning, they’re ready to do the hiring. But if you’re not, they have a nice severance package. You’re not going to work there any longer. That kind of social contract is coming to the rest of the country. And so you have to have more grit, persistence and self-motivation. A lot of people don’t have that. Lifelong learning is great advice for someone just starting out. What about the boomers? Is there a way for them to leverage their experience and reorient themselves for these seismic shifts in the workplace? I always think there is. At a talk last night in Washington, a woman came to the microphone who started a global trade company called Linkages. She said: ‘I am the epitome of what you call diverse, adaptive, inclusive, entrepreneurial and resilient.’ She looked close to my age, 63. She sure wasn’t a millennial. The great thing about this system is it’s open. If you want to start a company like she did, no one is going to stand over you and urge you. You’ve got to take ownership yourself. This really is an age of ownership. Where ownership exists, good things happen. People are self-propelled. I can’t coast here at the New York Times. I’m running as fast as I always did. What advice can you share with younger boomers in their 50s and older boomers closer to retirement? When you’re at an intersection like this one of rapid accelerations, there are only two ways to survive. You have to be really open, so you get the signals first. And you want your skills to always be moving ahead. Be open and be moving up. Do those two things and good things will happen. Your friend’s quote, ‘When you press the pause button on a machine, it stops, but when you press the pause button on human beings, they start,’ is a call to get off our devices and take time to reflect, rethink and reimagine. But with a culture tethered to devices, isn’t that easier said than done? I can only speak for myself. I’m not sitting there watching Twitter.

I’m a fairly disconnected person who operates in a kind of old-fashioned way and I do that deliberately because drinking from this digital fire hose is too much for me. I’m just not interested in hearing what everyone is saying about each other or for that matter, about me. If you write me a paper letter, I’ll answer it. Other than that, I’m trying to slow down and get across that it’s all the stuff that is old and slow that you cannot download — that’s the stuff that matters most. The subtitle of the book is ‘An optimist’s guide to thriving in the age of accelerations.’ Given these huge forces, all occurring simultaneously, how easy is it to be an optimist? There are troubled communities such as the south side of Chicago, but there are also many thriving ones. And I prefer to focus on those and try to understand why they’re thriving. And then what is it we can scale? That’s really why I went back to Minnesota [where he grew up]. There’s enormous innovation there and that’s the message I wanted to convey: that if you look at the country from the bottom up, you can be very optimistic and very inspired.

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google announced on Sunday that it will bring its digital assistant to smartphones running the latest versions of its Android operating system, vastly expanding its reach. The Google Assistant was limited to the technology company’s own products when it was released last fall, but it has steadily been expanding to a broader range of devices. Smartphones running Android accounted for 85 percent of the global market last year, according to tech research firm IDC, compared to 15 percent for Apple Inc’s iOS. The Google Assistant will roll out this week to English speakers in the United States with phones running Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the company said. English speakers in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom will gain access to the assistant next, followed by German speakers in Germany, and the company is working on support for additional languages. Voice-powered digital assistants have been largely a novelty for consumers since Apple’s Siri introduced the technology to the masses in 2011. But many in the industry believe the technology will soon become one of the main ways users interact with devices, and Apple, Google and Amazon.com Inc are racing to present their assistants to as many people as possible. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for the Google Assistant, wrote in a blog post published on Sunday. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant.” Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co announced products featuring Amazon’s Alexa assistant at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this year, leading some analysts to conclude the online retailer had gained an early lead over Google. What is more, Android manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] announced it would support Alexa, highlighting the cost of Google’s decision to feature the assistant on its own hardware before opening it up to partners, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “Clearly Google needs to move forward because their battle in the future is not going to be over the operating system, it’s going to be about assistant platforms,” said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Google cannot trust that its assistant will be the default on all devices in the Android ecosystem. Leading manufacturer Samsung Electronics has announced plans for an assistant, and other companies are reportedly working on the technology. “Some big manufacturers have decided to go their own way,” Dawson said. “But a lot of manufacturers simply can’t afford to develop their own.” ","

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] has asked a senior executive to leave the company for failing to disclose a sexual harassment allegation stemming from his tenure at Alphabet Inc’s Google, an Uber spokeswoman said on Monday. The move comes as the ride services company is investigating allegations of sexual harassment in its own organization. Earlier this month, a female former engineer at Uber said in a widely read blog post that managers and human resources officers at the company had not punished her manager after she reported his unwanted sexual advances, and even threatened her with a poor performance review. The allegations, by Susan Fowler, highlighted the long-standing problem of gender discrimination in the technology industry. Uber last week hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct a review of the claims, and Chief Executive Travis Kalanick called the allegations by Fowler “abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in”. Kalanick on Monday asked Senior Vice President of Engineering Amit Singhal to resign after technology news website Recode informed Uber of the previous sexual harassment  allegation, the Uber spokeswoman said. Recode was the first to report Singhal’s departure on Monday. Singhal, who was hired in January, did not disclose the allegations when Uber hired him, nor were they revealed by reference checks, the Uber spokeswoman said. Singhal did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. In a statement to Recode he denied the allegation of harassment but acknowledged a dispute with Google. “Harassment is unacceptable in any setting. I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior,” Singhal wrote to Recode. “In my 20-year career, I’ve never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own.” Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Singhal led Google’s search division, the financial powerhouse of Alphabet. He left Google about a year ago after 15 years at the company, saying he planned to focus on philanthropy. He announced his plan to join Uber in January, saying he would work closely with Kalanick on the company’s self-driving car program. The Uber spokeswoman said the company did not believe its hiring process was flawed, but rather it was an issue with Singhal’s failure to disclose the matter. ","

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A bug in its software left hundreds of thousands of webpages hosted by Cloudflare Inc leaking encrypted personal data, but there was no sign yet the leak had been exploited by hackers, the Internet security firm said on Friday. Cloudflare hosts six million websites, spreading them across the Internet to put them closer to customers while at the same time reducing their exposure to the so-called Distributed Denial of Service attacks that might knock them offline. The data leak was attributable to a bug in the firm’s software that had been sending chunks of unrelated data to users’ browsers when they visited a webpage hosted by Cloudflare, according to Google researchers. Cloudflare Chief Technology Officer John Graham-Cumming said the problem had been fixed quickly and most of the exposed data removed from the caches of search engines like Alphabet’s Google. “We’ve seen absolutely no evidence that this has been exploited,” he told Reuters by phone. “It’s very unlikely that someone has got this information.” The leakage may have been active from Sept. 22, but the period most affected was from Feb. 13 until it was discovered on Feb. 18. At its height earlier this month, Graham-Cumming said, about 120,000 webpages were leaking information every day. Some of this data included “private messages from major dating sites, full messages from a well-known chat service, online password manager data, frames from adult video sites, hotel bookings” as well as cookies, passwords and software keys, Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy, who discovered the bug, wrote in a forum on Feb. 19. Ormandy also wrote on Twitter that data from ridesharing service Uber [UBER.UL] and cloud password company 1Password had been leaking. Uber declined to comment, while AgileBits, the maker of 1Password, denied in a blog post on Thursday that any personal data had been compromised. Graham-Cumming said it was difficult to say which of Cloudflare’s six million websites had been affected. He said that Google and Cloudflare had been working together to remove any sensitive data from the store of webpages that search engines like Google collect when they index the web. He said that process was not yet complete, which is why some researchers were still finding data if they knew where to look. Some security researchers have said the problem is more serious than Cloudflare has described. Jonathan Sublett of internet security company Shield Maiden said in a blog post that anyone who accessed sites that used Cloudflare “should consider their data public and work towards securing their accounts”. Graham-Cumming said it was difficult to say which of their customers were affected. “There will be a debate about how serious this is,” he said. “We do not know of anybody who has had a security problem as a result of this.” ","

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"Waymo accused Uber and Otto, acquired by the ride services company in August, with stealing confidential information on Waymo’s Lidar sensor technology to help speed its own efforts in autonomous technology. “Uber’s LiDAR technology is actually Waymo’s LiDAR technology,” said Waymo’s complaint in the Northern District of California. Uber said it took “the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully.” Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position on or near the road, is a crucial component of autonomous driving systems. Previous systems have been prohibitively expensive and Waymo sought to design one over 90 percent cheaper, making its Lidar technology among the company’s “most valuable assets,” Waymo said. Waymo is seeking an unspecified amount of damages and a court order preventing Uber from using its proprietary information. Otto launched with much fanfare in May, due in part to the high profile of one of its co-founders, Anthony Levandowski, who had been an executive on Google’s self-driving project. Uber acquired the company in August for what Waymo said in the lawsuit was $680 million. Waymo said that before Levandowski’s resignation in January 2016 from Google, whose self-driving unit was renamed Waymo in December, he downloaded over 14,000 confidential files, including Lidar circuit board designs, thereby allowing Uber and Otto to fast-track its self-driving technology. Waymo accused Levandowski of attempting to “erase any forensic fingerprints” via a reformat of his laptop. “While Waymo developed its custom LiDAR systems with sustained effort over many years, defendants leveraged stolen information to shortcut the process and purportedly build a comparable LiDAR system in only nine months,” the complaint said. Waymo’s lawsuit said it learned of this use of trade secrets and patent infringement after it was inadvertently copied on an email from a component vendor that included a design of Uber’s Lidar circuit board, which bore a “striking resemblance” to Waymo’s design. Waymo noted that Google devoted over seven years to self-driving cars and said Uber’s forays into the technology through a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University had stalled by early 2016. ","

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A company now owned by Uber last year quietly bought a small firm specializing in sensor technology used in autonomous vehicles, giving the ride services company a patent in the technology and possibly a defense against a trade secrets theft lawsuit filed against it by rival Alphabet Inc. The chief executive of little-known Tyto Lidar LLC said in a May 2016 post on LinkedIn that the company had been sold, at the same time as he and three other executives joined Otto, according to their profiles on the online business network. Official U.S. patent data shows Otto acquired Tyto technology at the same time. Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded by former Alphabet employees, was bought by Uber in August. The unpublicized acquisition may become a factor in the high-stakes legal fight between Uber and Alphabet, the parent of Google, as the two Silicon Valley companies aggressively develop self-driving technology, widely seen as the future of private road transport in the United States. Equally, it may end up being a footnote in the complex litigation, which could take years to unfold. Alphabet’s autonomous car unit Waymo sued Uber and Otto last week, alleging that former employee Anthony Levandowski, who left Waymo to set up Otto, downloaded and stole more than 14,000 confidential files, including details on light detection and ranging sensor technology, known as Lidar, a crucial element in most self-driving car systems. It claimed that without those Waymo designs, Uber could not have developed its technology as fast as it says. An Uber spokesperson declined to comment on Tyto, citing the pending litigation, but called Waymo’s lawsuit “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” Waymo declined to comment on Tyto. In its lawsuit, Waymo said that by mid-2016, Uber was “more than five years behind in the race to develop vehicle automation technology suitable for the mass market,” yet it built a Lidar system comparable to Waymo’s “in only nine months”. However, the acquisition of Tyto means that at least two executives with long experience in Lidar – one as early as 2009, according to his LinkedIn profile - transferred to Otto and then Uber. Both had previously worked at Velodyne, another Silicon Valley Lidar pioneer, according to LinkedIn. Tyto also came to Otto with a patent for a Lidar scanner that was filed in 2013 and has since been reassigned to Uber, according to the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office website. Eric Goldman, an intellectual property (IP) law professor at Silicon Valley’s Santa Clara University School of Law, said the Tyto acquisition and its patent “could help rebut” Waymo’s suggestion that Uber scaled up too quickly to have its own Lidar technology. Trade secret plaintiffs commonly make circumstantial cases, such as Waymo implying that Uber could not have developed its own technology as fast as it purported to do, Goldman said. “That prong of their arguments could be rebutted,” Goldman said. He cautioned, however, that Tyto’s expertise and patent “may be irrelevant” if Waymo can prove its central allegation: that Levandowski downloaded confidential trade secrets before leaving the company to form Otto - and that Uber exploited this stolen information to design a Lidar circuit board with a “striking resemblance” to Waymo’s. In an interview with Forbes in October that was published on Tuesday, Levandowski said Uber did not steal trade secrets from Google. “We did not steal any Google IP,” he told the magazine. Waymo says its patented Lidar technology is among its most valuable assets because it had successfully managed to reduce the price of the sensor by 90 percent. All Lidar makers are seeking to reduce cost and size. Promotional material for Tyto from a 2015 trade conference said Tyto’s technology “enables lower cost, lighter weight and smaller size Lidar sensors.” ","

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"BARCELONA, Spain (Reuters) - Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica announced a new strategy on Sunday promising to give customers back control of their own data with the help of a new digital personal assistant. The so-called “fourth platform” comes after Telefonica faced questions about its growth strategy last year following a dividend cut and asset disposals to repay debt. The new app, named “Aura”, was developed using Microsoft’s artificial-intelligence expertise. It allows users to decide whether or not to share insights generated by their data with third parties such as Facebook or Google. It can also answer questions about Telefonica services, create and track a request or manage access to the customer’s wifi router. “It’s a new way of empowering customers,” Chief Executive Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete told a news conference ahead of the Mobile World Congress annual telecoms fair in Barcelona. “We are offering that the network belongs to them.” Aura can be used as a phone app and also interacts with Amazon’s smart speaker, Echo. It is due to be launched in markets including Spain, Britain and Germany in the coming 12 months, Telefonica said. Pallete said the company’s “fourth platform” was the result of years of infrastructure and technology investments totaling 48 billion euros ($51 billion) over the past five years to transform the business into a digital platform. Telefonica described the fourth platform as the company’s brain, sitting on top of physical assets - its network, its IT systems - and finally its products and services. “Now people can no longer call us a dumb pipe,” Pallete told reporters after the presentation. Details on how Telefonica will make money from the new service were not disclosed. The company said the main objective was to retain existing customers through a better experience. “Telefonica will need to convince consumers it can add value and is not just providing a vehicle to sell them more services,” said Martin Garner, senior analyst at CCS Insight. “It will also need to earn momentum with developers in what is rapidly becoming a crowded field.” The fourth platform is the latest illustration of telecom companies diversifying away from commoditized core connectivity services into added-value media or internet services. U.S.-based Verizon was the first to make a bold move into digital with its $4.4 billion acquisition of internet firm AOL two years ago. Since then, rival AT&T has followed a different but adjacent route, aiming to become a TV and content company by acquiring DirecTV for $67 billion and Time Warner for another $110 billion. Russian and emerging-market operator Vimpelcom has also committed to breaking away from the old telco model to remake itself as a tech player in messaging apps. ","

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court has thrown out a jury verdict that had originally required Apple Inc to pay $533 million to Smartflash LLC, a technology developer and licenser that claimed Apple’s iTunes software infringed its data storage patents. The trial judge vacated the large damages award a few months after a Texas federal jury imposed it in February 2015, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said on Wednesday the judge should have ruled Smartflash’s patents invalid and set aside the verdict entirely. A unanimous three-judge appeals panel said Smartflash’s patents were too “abstract” and did not go far enough in describing an actual invention to warrant protection. The decision likely ends a case that had attracted wide attention when the verdict was rendered but had gone against the  plaintiff ever since. Neither Smartflash nor Apple could be immediately reached for comment. Smartflash was founded in 2000 by inventor Patrick Racz, who obtained several patents on a system for storing data like songs, videos and games and accessing that data through electronic payments systems. Racz was unable to commercialize the technology and Smartflash sells no products of its own. The company sued Apple in May 2013. Smartflash’s complaint alleged that Racz has discussed his ideas in 2000 with a technologist who later became a senior director at Apple. Smartflash filed its lawsuit against Apple in the Eastern District of Texas, a venue popular with patent owners. Smartflash also brought a similar case in the same court against Samsung Electronics Co, which remains pending. It later filed additional cases against Google and Amazon. U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap refused to set aside the jury’s findings that Apple infringed Smartflash’s patents, but he ordered a retrial on damages, saying he did not properly instruct the jury on the question of how much to award. Apple appealed to the Federal Circuit, which is designated to hear patent cases. The tech giant also joined Samsung in challenging the validity of Smartflash’s patents before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which invalidated as too abstract the three Smartflash patents the jury found Apple infringed. Smartflash appealed that ruling to the Federal Circuit, which could have ended the case by affirming the patent office’s determination. It instead ended the case by ruling Gilstrap should have found Smartflash’s patents invalid himself. ","

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has launched a new program to help students build capabilities into its voice-controlled assistant Alexa, the company told Reuters, the latest move by a technology firm to nurture ideas and talent in artificial intelligence research. The e-commerce company said it is paying for a year-long doctoral fellowship at four universities for an undisclosed sum. Working with professors, the Alexa Fund Fellows will help students tackle complex technology problems in class on Alexa, like how to convert text to speech or process conversation. Amazon, Alphabet Inc’s Google and others are locked in a race to develop and monetize artificial intelligence. Unlike some rivals, Amazon has made it easy for third-party developers to create skills for Alexa so it can get better faster - a tactic it now is extending to the classroom. The fellowship may also help Amazon recruit sought-after engineers whose studies will make them more familiar with Alexa than with other voice-controlled assistants. The schools in the program are Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins, the University of Southern California and Canada’s University of Waterloo. “We want Alexa to be a great sandbox” for students, said Doug Booms, vice president of worldwide corporate development at Amazon, in an interview on Wednesday. He added that the fellowship’s goal is to excite the next generation of scholars about natural language understanding and other voice technologies, not to produce research for Amazon. Under the program, students’ projects remain their own intellectual property. At the University of Waterloo, students are improving Alexa’s interaction with air conditioners so it understands requests to cool a room to its normal temperature, without requiring the user to specify a number in Celsius, said Fakhri Karray, a professor of electrical and computer engineering who is overseeing the work. Securing close ties to university talent and research has become an urgent priority for many tech firms. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in 2015 took 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s robotics center in-house to work on self-driving cars and other projects. Microsoft Corp has awarded fellowships to doctoral researchers in different areas of computer science, like artificial intelligence, for years. Amazon itself created the Alexa Prize competition among universities to push forward conversational artificial intelligence, with a $100,000 stipend for each sponsored team. The money for the new fellowship comes from the Alexa Fund, an investment by Amazon of up to $100 million to advance voice technology. ","

(TGT) shareholders. Shares of the $33 billion retailer are down as much as 12% today after disappointing Wall Street’s earnings expectations. Do I believe today’s Target blow up story? I do. It was written in the cosmos. (See also: Target Shares Hurt by Gloomy Outlook.) Yesterday, I wrote that Wall Street isn’t nearly bearish enough on Target. The way we saw it, Target CEO Brian Cornell had one of three options heading into earnings today. To his credit, Cornell chose option 1, disappointing Wall Street and announcing $1 billion in operating margin to ensure the company is “clearly and competitively priced every day.” At the company’s analyst meeting, Cornell said, ""We're investing in stores, we're investing in our supply chain and in digital. We're investing to win share not surrender it."" In other words, the company has finally acknowledged that it’s falling behind. On that, I’ll give Cornell a golf clap. But come on already. Put the money where your mouth is. The underlying reality: Target is falling way behind its peers. The company needs to do a whole lot more. To stem the bleeding to competitors, the company proposed increasing selling, general & administrative expenses (SG&A) by $500 million in 2017 and boosting capital expenditure by $500 million. According to our math, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN​) each add at least $2.5 billion. #NotEnoughCornell. Cornell will continue to lay out how ""it’s investing for the new world of consumer shopping behavior."" Thanks! But how do you make up for the fact that your two biggest competitors started doing this 10 years ago? In the chart below, we show the gap that’s opening up between Target and Wal-Mart traffic – adjusting for how much gross margin each of them is flexing to get people in the door. As you can see Target’s traffic is declining and Wal-Mart’s is on the rise. As the company grapples with this reality, it will have to spend a lot more money to close the gap between competitors. Today’s spending plan and earnings guide down is not nearly enough. This is Google versus Yahoo all over again. Google, much like Wal-Mart and Amazon, continues to step on the spending accelerator. Meanwhile, the Targets and Yahoos of the world get left in the dust. Can Yahoo ever catch up to Google? Not without a significant investment in its business, taking capital expenditure and SG&A up 10-fold over the next three years. The situation is almost as dire for Target today. None of this should come as a surprise to Target shareholders. The company has been falling woefully behind the eight ball for some time now. Last September, I compiled a list of Retail CEOs who could be fired in 2017. The common thread stitching each of these companies together was their underinvestment at a critical juncture for their businesses. Target’s Cornell topped the list. To be sure, the capital spending boost announced today probably buys Cornell another year of job security. But when he gets fired, the company will likely have to backstop the increased capital spending with a dividend cut. If I’m right, today’s 12% decline is only the beginning. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000}

According to Andrew House, CEO of Sony Corporation's (SNE) Interactive Entertainment unit, the company has sold 915,000 Playstation VR headsets since they were launched in October last year. In an interview with the New York Times, House said that customers were ""lining up outside stores when they know that stock (of its VR headsets) is being replenished"" in Japan, one of the largest markets for its Playstation gaming consoles.

Its headsets, which have to be connected to powerful computers to operate, have premium pricing and boast content partnerships with major Hollywood studios.

(TWTR), which has been reeling from a decline in users and slow revenue growth, got slammed in a blog post on Stratechery.com that argued that the social network has stagnated when it comes to product development, which will have a negative impact on the company’s prospects over the long term. According to Ben Thompson, the author and operator of Stratchery.com, Twitter has been, and will always be, handicapped by its initial idea, which transformed the way people around the globe connect and communicate. Even President Donald Trump is an avid user of the platform, calling out the media and making policy statements. But a great first idea resulted in Twitter stagnating when it comes to innovating, says Thompson. “I think this actually gets to the problem with Twitter: the initial concept was so good, and so perfectly fit such a large market, that they never needed to go through the process of achieving product market fit. It just happened, and they’ve been riding that match for going on eight years,” wrote Thompson. “The problem, though, was that by skipping over the wrenching process of finding a market, Twitter still has no idea what their market actually is, and how they might expand it. Twitter is the company-equivalent of a lottery winner who never actually learns how to make money, and now they are starting to pay the price.” Thompson went on to argue that Twitter has been selling the same service it launched in 2006—live commentary, live connections and live conversations—with the only new product ideas mimicking the old way media and television workers. What’s more, Thomson says its “the worst sort of product thinking: simply doing what was done before, but digitally.”  (See also: Weibo on Track to Surpass Twitter In Users.) At the same time that Twitter is lacking on the innovative front, competitor Facebook Inc. (FB) is surging thanks to its embracing mobile and its conclusion that advertisements are way more effective when they show up in users’ news feeds. “In-feed advertisements—just like Google’s search advertisements—are uniquely enabled by the Internet; it should come as no surprise that said uniqueness is strongly correlated with actually making money from advertising,” wroteThompson. But is Twitter evolving? Thompson thinks not, pointing out that Twitter’s strategy with the recent Oscars telecast was to simply live-stream the awards show, similar to how it live-streamed NFL games and the presidential debates leading up to lection. “Twitter’s goal of owning ‘live’ could mean so much more: how might the product evolve if Twitter had the sort of product mindset found at companies like Amazon, Netflix, or Airbnb?” wrote Thomson. The new blog comes on the heels of a dismal fourth quarter for Twitter. For the three months ended in December, Twitter reported adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share on revenue of $717 million, which beat Wall Street's expectations for earnings per share of 12 cents but missed revenue forecasts of $740.14 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Aside from missing on the top line, this amounts to less than 1% revenue growth, and even the beat on the bottom line translates to flat growth year over year. Twitter's revenue was hurt by weak advertising sales, totaling just $638 million, marking a slight year-over-year decline. ",Report: Twitter Lacks Innovation | Investopedia
Arjun Kharpal,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"Amazon's Alexa may have stolen the show at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this year, but it's Google Assistant that is in the limelight now. At the Mobile World Congress, one of the biggest industry conferences in the world, device makers launched a number of smartphones that come with Google Assistant already installed. Google Assistant is the search giant's artificial intelligence-powered voice assistant to rival Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana. It was introduced last year to replace Google Now, and was originally only available on the company's Pixel smartphones, its smart home speaker called Google Home, and via its chat app Allo. But on Monday, Google said it is beginning to roll out Assistant to all phones running its Android operating system version 6.0 or newer. Google Assistant was introduced on LG's new G6 smartphone and the HMD Global Nokia devices at MWC. The U.S. technology giant's move comes after Amazon continues to aggressively push Alexa onto new devices. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa would be integrated with LG refrigerators and even Ford cars. But it began to step on Google's feet when Amazon announced that Alexa would be on the Huawei Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S., which runs Android. ""It is little surprise Google has come out with all guns blazing at MWC. It must be reeling from the decision to include Amazon's Alexa on the Mate 9 when it was announced,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by email on Tuesday. ""Amazon has taken an early lead with Alexa and Google needs to exploit the enormous reach of Android smartphones to rapidly get the Google Assistant into the hands of consumers before they get wedded to the Alexa ecosystem."" Nearly 9 of every 10 smartphones globally run Android, giving Google a huge consumer base to start off with. ""I think in general, whether this is rolling out to lots of devices or not, we now have user feedback, it will help us improve the product,"" Gummi Hafsteinsson, product management director at Google, told CNBC in an interview at MWC on Tuesday. ""The engagement is more important to that than anything else. We get both positive and negative feedback and use that to make the product better. Hopefully, we will see the product get better faster."" Voice assistants could play a key role in how we interact with the increasingly internet-connected devices in the future. The number of internet-connected devices is set to hit 46 billion in 2021, an increase of 200 percent from 2016. Many of these may not have traditional screen-based interfaces and so voice assistants could be a way of interacting. But Google Assistant could also drive users to many of the company's services including Maps, the core search function, and YouTube. In a recent earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the feature needs to be thought about as a part of a user's overall search journey. This will lock people into Google's ecosystem of services. ""I would encourage you to think about it as, from a user's standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of the total journey they are on. So when we think about something like the Google Assistant we think about it as an ongoing conversation with our users across different contexts,"" Pichai said.

Levandowski left Google to launch a self-driving truck company called Otto, which went own to be acquired by Uber. ""We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully,"" an Uber spokeswoman told CNBC. It all comes at a tough time for ride-hailing technology company Uber, which is facing fallout amid complaints about its company culture. The two companies once had close ties.  Alphabet's venture capital arm invested in Uber, according to Crunchbase, and Alphabet executive David Drummond once sat on Uber's board. But Drummond stepped down in August  ""given the overlap between the two companies,"" amid reports that Drummond had been shut out of board meetings. Uber revealed it had bought Otto that same month. ""Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company,"" Alphabet said in a statement. ","Alphabet's car company, Waymo sues Uber"
Michelle Castillo,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"YouTube is giving viewers a way to tune in live to their favorite shows, without a cable or satellite subscription. The company announced a live and on-demand streaming TV service called ""YouTubeTV"" on Tuesday. The subscription, which will cost $35 a month for a family plan of up to six accounts, is expected to launch in the next few months in the U.S. Currently there are no plans for international service. Subscribers will have access to up to 40 networks, as well as YouTube creator content like original content from subscription service YouTube Red. Channels include all broadcast channels and cable channels like USA, FX, Freeform, ESPN, Fox Sports and NBC Sports. Users can add Showtime and soccer programming for an additional fee. ""There's no question that millennials love great TV content, but what we've seen is they don't want to watch it in the traditional setting,""  said YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki at a press event. The over-the-top service will let people watch on any device. Users can also record as many programs as they want. Some content with restrictions, like NFL games, may be blocked on mobile but will be available on TV and on desktop. People will be able to stream to their TVs using Chromecast when the service launches, with additional devices to be added in the future. In addition, Google Home and Google Cast will allow people to speak to their TVs to control their TV experience in the near future. (The voice search functions failed during the demo on Tuesday, proving more work needs to be done.) Google and its network partners will have the ability to sell ads for an additional revenue stream. The news comes at a time when more Americans are open to cutting the cord. A study from research firm GfK said a quarter of American homes don't subscribe to a pay TV service, with 6 percent only using the internet to watch their favorite shows on a TV using a device like Apple TV or Roku. A recent U.S Energy Information Administration survey shows 2.3 televisions were used in American homes in 2015, down from an average of 2.6 televisions per household in 2009. The number of homes with three or more TVs declined, while the number of homes without a TV grew. Google will have competition in the space. Hulu is planning is own over-the-top service this year, with CBS, Fox and Disney -- including ESPN -- among the networks which have signed on. ",YouTube announces cable-free TV subscription
Anita Balakrishnan,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"The amount of video that YouTube users around the world watch each day is now almost as much as all U.S. TV watching combined, the company said on Monday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. The amount of video footage viewed on YouTube is growing and passed 1 billion hours a day, YouTube said in a blog post. Nielsen data shows the 1.25 billion hours of TV watched and recorded in America each day is shrinking, the Journal reported. The viewership numbers on YouTube mark a 10-fold increase since 2012, the company told the Journal, and compare to 116 million hours streamed on Netflix and 100 million hours streamed on Facebook. YouTube's viewership is a key metric for analysts that cover Alphabet's stock, as it is one of the few big streams of money that is not disclosed in Google's earnings. The Journal reports that it generated $4 billion in revenue and broke even in 2014, citing anonymous sources familiar with the division's finances.

Johana Bhuiyan,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"A series of bills introduced in at least four U.S. states — Georgia, Maryland, Illinois and Tennessee — would restrict the deployment of autonomous car technology on public roads to automakers — that is, companies that make cars. As written, the bills — modeled after the SAVE Act,  Michigan's pioneering self-driving car regulations— would only allow a network of self-driving cars to operate on public roads if the cars are owned by an automaker. The draft bill being considered in Tennessee, for instance, says: ""Only motor vehicle manufacturers are eligible to participate in a SAVE project, and each motor vehicle manufacturer is responsible for the safe operation of its participating fleet."" This suggests companies like Uber or Alphabet — which owns Waymo, previously known as the Google car project — may not be able to roll out their own self-driving cars in these states. Both companies are developing self-driving car technology, but neither manufactures vehicles. These bills mirror what was originally proposed in Michigan — home to the U.S. auto industry — where there are now  comprehensive laws on the testing and deployment of self-driving cars. But when later passed, the Michigan law included new language that allows companies like Uber and Google to launch ride-hail networks of autonomous cars, as long as they either work with an automaker or get their prototype approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. So far, the bills being proposed in these four states don't include that language. More from Recode: Who's behind these restrictions? According to an  AP report, General Motors, the Detroit-based car company, urged lawmakers to propose these rules. Illinois state Rep. Mike Zalewski told AP that he proposed the bill after speaking to GM. So did Maryland state Sen. William Ferguson. GM lobbyist Harry Lightsey denied to the AP that lawmakers were proposing these restrictive laws at their request, but said the automaker supports them, because ""public acceptance of the technology is going to be very critical."" GM did not immediately respond to Recode's request for comment. But David Strickland, the general counsel for the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets — an organization representing Ford, Uber, Lyft and Volvo — and former head of NHTSA, voiced his opposition to these bills. ""It is our view that, if a state does choose to take legislative or regulatory action with respect to AVs, such action should be premised on removing impediments to the safe testing or deployment of such vehicles and preserving a pro-competitive and level playing field,"" Strickland wrote. ""We recommend that states concentrate on revising existing laws and regulations to comprehend autonomous vehicles."" It's not clear whether these rules will pass as-is, or if pressure from companies like Waymo and Uber will lead to compromises.

Arjun Kharpal,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"Amazon is the biggest threat to Google in search, while Snapchat could be the ""third force"" in the digital ad market behind the Alphabet-owned company and Facebook, Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of the world's largest ad firm, WPP, said Wednesday. Sorrell said that the amount spent on Google compared with the others shows how effective a platform it is to advertise on, but Amazon could pose a real challenge. ""The threat to Google in my view, is Amazon. It's Amazon and search on Amazon that is potentially the biggest threat. The threat to Facebook, however, is from Snap,"" Sorrell said during a CNBC-hosted fireside chat at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. ""Amazon's tentacles are spreading rapidly into all areas."" The WPP chief did not expand on what strategy he thinks Amazon could take to challenge Google. But the U.S. e-commerce giant essentially hosts a massive online shop where people search for all kinds of items. This could be monetized through some way. It is also leading the market for smart speakers with the Amazon Echo which has its voice assistant Alexa built in. Users can ask Alexa questions. This is another form of search. On behalf of clients, WPP spent just under $5 billion on Google advertising in 2016, an increase from the $4 billion the year before. The global ad company also spent $1.7 billion on Facebook and $90 million on Snapchat. Sorrell said Google and Facebook represent 75 percent of spend on digital, and this needs to change and become more balanced. WPP's spend on Google could go up to $6 billion this year, while on Facebook it could hit $2.5 billion, Sorrell said, adding that Snap is still ""relatively insignificant"" in terms of spend on the platform. It could become a strong third, however. ""I think it's a defining moment in that it could well be the third force,"" Sorrell said, adding that ""Snap … is definitely a potential third force."" The CEO said that one issue with Facebook is that the results from advertising on the social network are not always clear. ""The reason that Google has been successful … is that the results are very clear. Facebook is a little bit more woolly. I have always referred to Facebook as a brand mechanism as a way of building brands, rather than necessarily being about effective sales generation in the short term,"" Sorrell said. Facebook has been fighting back against Snapchat by copying many of the ephemeral messaging app's features across all the services it owns, including WhatsApp and Instagram. Snap is also gearing up to go public, likely on Thursday. Given the kickback from Facebook, Sorrell had some advice for Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on how to stay relevant. ""The biggest key thing that I think Evan and his colleagues have got to demonstrate is return on investment. The number of clients say to me because of disruption … we have to make sure that the return on our media investment is considerable,"" Sorrell said.

Harriet Taylor,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"On Super Bowl Sunday, some 48 million Americans ordered takeout or delivery, and a big slice of the pie was pizza. Engineers at Alphabet's Google celebrated the big day at the company's Mountain View, California, campus in true Silicon Valley fashion: with robot-made pizzas. ""What the Google crew tells us is that they love our pizza because it's far more nutritious than typical delivery pizza, and it tastes really good,"" said Zume Pizza co-CEO Julia Collins. ""They have been incredibly supportive, and we have done several events for them."" Zume Pizza (No. 1 on CNBC's Upstart 25 list), which is delivery-only, is replacing human chefs with robots, slashing labor costs in half and reinvesting those savings into higher-quality ingredients to carve out a portion of the $40 billion annual U.S. pizza business. Zume employs 76 workers, split equally between delivery, kitchen and engineering staff. That's far fewer employees than the average pizza chain, but they get full benefits, education subsidies and shares in the business. The company — which made its first hire on Sept. 8, 2015 — has never had an employee quit, which is unusual in the restaurant business, said Collins. ""We're a co-bot situation,"" said Collins. ""There are humans and robots collaborating to make better food, to make more fulfilling jobs and to make a more stable working environment for the folks that are working with us."" The Super Bowl was Zume's biggest night since launching in June 2015. The company made and delivered more than 350 pizzas — triple its usual Sunday average, said Collins. The Google Super Bowl party Zume catered was hosted by a group of African-American Googlers, said Collins. ""They invited us, which was really neat, because as an African-American co-CEO, it's really nice to be part of that community and to be serving pizza,"" she said. Zume's co-bot workforce provides a model for what the future of many industries might look like: Within five years robots and so-called intelligent agents will eliminate many positions in customer service, trucking and taxi services, amounting to 6 percent of U.S. jobs, according to a September Forrester report. For Americans afraid of that future, Collins has this message: ""Since the Industrial Revolution, the American workforce has learned to adapt with the advent of new technology, so as a country, as a people, we know how to do this."" Within Zume's kitchen, the repetitive tasks have been automated first. For example, there are three bots for squirting and spreading tomato sauce on pies, and a bot similar to ones used on a car assembly line to place those pies in an 800-degree oven hundreds of times a day. ""That's a highly repetitive task and one that can be dangerous for human beings, so integrating robots into that makes a lot of sense,"" said Collins. The company will always need humans for food preparation, recipe development, taste tests and to improve their pizzas based on customer feedback, said Collins. Zume's robots are manufactured by global manufacturing company ABB — whose robots are typically used in large manufacturing settings — and integrated with the help of Silicon Valley software company L2F. ""We have co-developed the entire pizza production process that is robot-enabled,"" said Collins. ""The individual pieces of equipment come from these large global manufacturers, but the integration of those robots within our ecosystem is something that we have designed and that we actually have the intellectual property on."" The bots cost between $25,000 and $35,000 each, but the investment will quickly pay off, said Collins. Other restaurants and food-delivery services are ripe for robot disruption, she said. ""That cost is a lot lower, as you can imagine, than the salary of a human being with benefits,"" she said. ""I think you would be hard-pressed to find any food type that wouldn't benefit from this kind of intelligent automation that we're using."" Yum Brands' Pizza Hut and Domino's, along with Papa Johns and Little Caesars, dominate the U.S. pizza industry and have also been experimenting with robots. Pizza Hut has deployed robots in selected restaurants in Asia, and Domino's has introduced pizza-delivery droids in New Zealand. Once the Zume pizzas are assembled and partly cooked at headquarters, they're loaded into a specially designed ""Baked in the Back"" delivery van, each equipped with 56 ovens to finish the cooking en route to customers, plus refrigeration to store additional 112 pies. The trucks can be topped up by vans carrying more pizzas so they never have to return to the depot. By crunching all the data about customer orders, Zume knows which pizzas its customers want before they even place an order. The company — which sold its first pizza on April 1, 2016 — closed a series A funding round and raised $23 million in December 2016 at a $50 million post-money valuation, according to Pitchbook. Collins hopes to be able to service the entire Bay Area from its one central facility — with 44 trucks and supporting delivery vehicles — by the end of 2018. Over time they will expand to Los Angeles and take the service nationwide. Collins is one of nine female co-founders of start-ups named to the Upstart 25 list. That said, Collins' fellow women alumni from Stanford Business School have had a harder time raising venture capital funding than their male counterparts, she said. ""As more and more funds bring on additional female partners, I think we'll see that balance change a little bit, but it's something that we all have to be conscious about, that we have to keep talking about, and that we all have to really keep working on,"" she said.

Arjun Kharpal,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"LG unveiled the LG G6 smartphone on Sunday, a flagship device the struggling electronics giant hopes can put it back into a position where it can challenge the likes of Apple and fierce rival Samsung. Key features include: The launch of the LG G6 comes after the previous flagship, the G5 released last year, failed to boost performance of the mobile division. The G5 was a ""modular"" smartphone, meaning parts of the device could be replaced and accessories could be added. Nonetheless, losses in the South Korean firm's mobile division continue to widen.

Arjun Kharpal,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"Walk around any phone store or browse online, and you'll find rows of similar looking rectangular shaped smartphones. Compared to some of the crazy designs pioneered by Nokia, Ericsson and the rest in the early days of mobiles, things look pretty tame now. It's also an age when sub-$200 smartphones are powerful enough for most people and even flagship phones from the likes of Apple and Samsung don't look radically different from their predecessors. My musings come ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona which kicks off this week. It's usually the place for the latest cutting edge smartphones, but this year looks flat. Samsung has delayed their next device – the Galaxy S8 – after the exploding Note 7 saga, and rumors and leaks so far have not suggested anything surprising. Though the Nokia 3310 could be making a return. Has the mobile phone world run out of ideas? It's easy to dismiss smartphone innovation as dead. In fact, one in two people think the smartphone itself will be obsolete within five years, according to an Ericsson survey of 100,000 people globally, released at the end of 2015. Yes, smartphones will be dead in five years but not in the sense of being wiped out. Instead, innovation will come from new areas, not hardware, and the way we interact with devices will change. Smartphones as we know them today will be dead. Right now, we use the phones to send messages, make calls, browse the web and watch things. That's still going to be the case but the real innovation in the future is going to come from software and a large part of that is about making our devices smarter and more personal. The move is underway and artificial intelligence (AI) assistants such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant will be at the heart of that. More than one in four people (21.6 percent) use voice search on their devices at least once a day, while 26.7 percent use it at least once a week, according to a survey of 2,000 U.S. mobile phone users done in January by website consultancy firm HigherVisibility. Nearly 29 percent never use a voice assistant. But the potential here could be huge. The biggest advantage is that it's easier to use voice than type. But for technology giants like Amazon, Google and Apple, it's also a chance to learn more about the user, and offer intelligent, smart recommendations and results. Voice is also the best way for us to interact with the billions of internet connected items that are forecast to come online in the next few years, from fridges to new wearables. Google, Apple and Amazon, could potentially be on these devices in the form of voice assistants. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this year, Amazon stole the show, with its voice assistant Alexa, which was integrated with many devices. We might find a rise of devices like the Amazon Echo speaker or Google Home as well as new wearables, home robots and nearly every other device in cities and houses connected to the internet. But this does not make the smartphone obsolete like many have predicted. The smartphone will still be at the center of people's lives, it may just have a new role. Innovation in smartphones will come in areas where it can play a role in the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), and that's still very much in the center. Don't be surprised if in five years if your smartphones look the same, but all of a sudden you're talking to them a lot more, and they are able to control more of your internet-connected lives.

Saheli Roy Choudhury,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"A consortium of Japanese banks is planning to use distributed ledger technology — better known as blockchain — from a Google-backed fintech start-up to make domestic and international payments. This follows a successful implementation of a pilot program, where the 47-member consortium used technology from blockchain start-up Ripple for a cloud-based payments platform called RC Cloud. The platform allows member banks to do real-time money transfers in Japan as well as make cross-border payments at a significantly lower cost. ""The objective of the consortium is to make domestic and cross-border payment efficient by taking advantage of the latest distributed ledger technology available in the world,"" Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple's director of joint venture partnership, told CNBC. The consortium was launched in October and represents over 30 percent of all banks in Japan, according to Yoshikawa . Members include AEON Bank,  Nomura Trust and Banking, Resona Bank and Mizuho. Many small banks that process low volumes of payments have to rely on their larger peers to clear the transactions because of a high fixed annual cost for membership at the clearing houses. As a result, they have little control over the fees they are charged per transaction, making it expensive and unprofitable. ""Existing infrastructure favor high-volume processors,"" Dilip Rao, managing director for Asia Pacific at Ripple, told CNBC. ""(They) get the cheapest price."" This is where blockchain — which is the basis for Ripple's technology — comes in. It records and stores all of the transactions online securely on a peer-to-peer network, which eliminates the need to have an intermediary bank or a central hub to do the clearing and settlement. ""With distributed ledger technology, it doesn't matter because the little guy can speak to another little guy and it's just as cheap if they did 10,000 transactions or two,"" Rao said. According to analysis done by Ripple, looking at retail remittances and corporate payments, distributed ledger technology has the potential to bring down transaction costs by 60 and 50 percent, respectively. Yoshikawa said she expects 10 to 20 more banks to join the consortium this year, which will bring the total number of members to between 50 and 60 — about 40 percent of all Japanese banks. The commercial phase of RC Cloud is expected to start in the fall of this year. While Japan's adoption of technology is diverse — from smartphones to smart cars — its banking system has traditionally been conservative in adopting new technologies and systems. But in a bid to become a key fintech player in the region, Japanese authorities and banks are taking note of blockchain. The Bank of Japan has talked about exploring distributed ledger technology and its potential uses. Last year, the central bank announced a joint research project on blockchain with the European Central Bank. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, a member of the global blockchain consortium R3 and one of Japan's largest financial institutions, is looking to develop its own digital currency, MUFG Coin, for potential, large-scale commercialization and to serve small-scale retail bank customers. Rao said Japan was very different to the rest of the world when it came to new developments in fintech like blockchain. ""They have had a lot of interest in bitcoin, blockchain and is more aware of crypto-currencies."" ",Japanese banks plan to adopt Ripple's blockchain tech for payments

IMAX envisions a communal virtual reality experience that friends would enjoy together, which would be available at multiplexes and shopping malls, as well as popular tourist destinations. Late last year, the company announced that it, and a number of its partners, had completed the first round of funding -- which amounted to $50 million -- to create 25 pieces of content over the next three years. This technology may be in the early stages, but it is ramping up fast. A report by Goldman Sachs estimates that virtual reality -- and its kissing cousin augmented reality -- could become an $80 billion industry by 2025.

On its most recent conference call, IMAX said: The core requirements of launching a location-based VR experience line up nicely with our company's core skill sets. We have studio and film maker relationships on the content side; capture mechanisms for new content; relationships with exhibitors and real estate developers for potential VR sites; and a brand that is synonymous with immersive experiences. IMAX has tied the disparate parts of the virtual reality experience together in a nice neat package.

There's a battle going on in outer space, for control of the Earth imaging market. Yesterday morning, we learned that DigitalGlobe (NYSE:DGI) has sold itself to Canadian space-tech specialist MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates for a purchase price of $2.4 billion -- and not a moment too soon. DigitalGlobe, if you recall, is the American satellite-imaging company that itself bought one-time Motley Fool recommendation GeoEye a few years ago. How hi-res is a high-resolution snapshot from space? Here's one that Planet Labs' now-acquired Terra Bella satellites recently snapped of the U.S. Air Force's Davis-Monthan airplane ""boneyard"" of decommissioned military aircraft. Image source: Terra Bella. DigitalGlobe is one of the biggest names in satellite-based, highly detailed Earth imaging. The company operates a constellation of five satellites capable of snapping photographs from orbit at resolutions as minute as 30 centimeters per pixel.  DigitalGlobe calls its constellation ""the best in the world"" and ""the largest constellation in the industry,"" and that's at least half right. Problem is, it's also half wrong. DigitalGlobe may dominate the market for highly detailed Earth imaging. But over at upstart Planet Labs (also known simply as ""Planet""), one of the leaders of the ""new space"" industry is rapidly overtaking DigitalGlobe in breadth of coverage. As we discussed last month, Planet had for some time been discussing acquiring Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) satellite imaging business, Terra Bella. The purchase price remains a mystery -- but the deal itself is apparently now a ""go."" On Feb. 3, Planet confirmed that it will indeed acquire Terra Bella from Alphabet, along with its fleet of seven high-resolution (capable of sub-meter resolutions) satellites. Then, last week, Planet announced the launch of 88 new ""Dove"" medium-resolution (three to five meters per pixel) satellites, more than doubling the size of its medium-res constellation to 144 birds in orbit. Planet made history here in a couple of ways. First, its deployment was part of an Indian government PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) launch that sent 16 other satellites, in addition to Planet's, into space. At 104 satellites total, the mission that carried Planet's Doves was the largest-ever satellite deployment made from a single rocket. More important, Planet says that its 144 Doves in orbit, plus five RapidEye satellites acquired from BlackBridge in 2015, give it a constellation of 149 satellites in orbit today. Feel free to mentally add seven more to that number once the Terra Bella acquisition is finalized, if you like. But already, Planet's mixed bag of 149 satellites gives it ""the largest private satellite constellation in history."" This is significant not only because it gives Planet bragging rights. By more than doubling its satellite constellation, Planet says it now has the ability to ""image all of Earth's landmass every day."" Alone among satellite operators, Planet can now take a snapshot of every square foot of Earth's solid surface once per day, every day of the year. It's difficult to guess what advances will flow from access to such data. Better weather forecasting, certainly. A clearer view of the progression of global warming, its effects and its causes, very likely. But we can also anticipate Planet generating better data on traffic patterns on highways, at ports, and along shipping routes; on the spread of residential development that could guide brick-and-mortar retailers on where to place their next big-box stores; and in countless other ways. The future is looking awfully bright for Planet Labs. And it's getting brighter every day, one Dove at a time. Look! Up in the sky! This time it really is a bird -- in fact, a whole lot of Planet Labs' Flock 3p Doves. Image source: Planet Labs. ","

Here's a quick rundown as to why they picked retail bank U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), solar panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), and water utility American Water Works (NYSE:AWK). Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (U.S. Bancorp): One of the best-managed banks in the country, U.S. Bancorp has been left out of the post-election bank stock boom. That's no fault of its own, though. After provisions for losses, U.S. Bancorp enjoys a roughly 50-50 split of interest income and fee income, making its earnings less sensitive to rate increases like other banks that have seen their share prices surge. I think investors are undervaluing the downside protection afforded by diversified sources of fee income, and overvaluing the potential for higher rates to fuel bank profits. In effect, investors are placing too much importance on what makes banks great over the short term rather than what makes them great over the long haul. U.S. Bancorp's historical underwriting performance tells the tale of its conservative culture. At the depths of the financial crisis, net charge-offs peaked at 2.17% of average loans in 2010. Though it may seem unremarkable on an absolute basis, consider that ""retail loans"" made up 33% of its loan book at the time, a majority of which were clustered in credit cards and home equity loans that ravaged banks across the country. U.S. Bancorp can play offense, too. Its deposit franchise gives it pricing power to hold down its cost of deposits, which recently averaged just 0.28%. On the asset side of the equation, its commercial loan portfolio should generate incremental income from rate increases. On a recent conference call, a bank executive pointed out that its commercial customers were using an average of 25% of their credit lines. One would expect that faster economic growth could bring higher balances, higher benchmark interest rates, and more interest income. U.S. Bancorp has everything investors could want in a bank to hold for years at a time. This past year is a great example of an industry downturn. The industry is still growing, but it hit a patch of slower growth recently that brought down prices for new panels and utility-scale projects. However, the industry is expected to pick back up again in earnest as renewable sources such as solar have moved so far down the cost curve that they are now competitive with fossil fuel power plants even without subsidies. As technology improves, costs will continue to decline, and solar will be able to take a larger market share and expand margins. Keep in mind, global electricity demand over the next 25 years will require that we build 8 times the current generation capacity in the U.S. This gives First Solar an immense growth runway over the next decade, and it is one of the best-positioned panel manufacturers and utility-scale power developers out there to reap rewards from this opportunity. The company has one of the most pristine balance sheets in the business, its low-cost, thin-film solar panel design is rapidly improving its efficiency metrics, and it is one of the only companies in the business whose returns on invested capital have outpaced its cost of capital -- which is essential for a company to grow and create wealth over time. The solar industry still very much looks like the wild west of energy, with new entrants rising and falling quickly, but First Solar is looking like the company that has the potential to turn this fast-growing market into one that really generates long-term returns for investors. Beth McKenna (American Water Works): I believe American Water Works -- the largest publicly traded water and wastewater utility in the United States -- is as close as it gets to a sure-thing 2025 winning stock. Moreover, I believe it has a good shot at significantly outperforming the market over the next nearly nine years -- through the end of 2025 -- just as it has done in the nearly-nine years since going public: Data by YCharts. Since its April 2008 IPO, American Water's total return of 376% has crushed the S&P 500's return of 108% and pulverized the returns of popular stocks IBM and General Electric. Moreover, it's also beat the 212% return of Google parent Alphabet over this period -- and in April 2008, this tech stock was less than four years off of its hot IPO. These stats should help dispel the widespread belief that all utility stocks are stodgy slow-growers. Moreover, American Water's return leaves underwater the solid 172% return of its closest peer, Aqua America, while also significantly beating the 158% return of the largest electric utility on the S&P 500, NextEra Energy. I'm confident American Water's winning streak will continue over the long term. The company supplies the most essential product in the world, and it's the largest and most geographically diverse player in its industry. These latter attributes provide it with greater resources and opportunities than its peers to more efficiently expand its regulated business by acquisitions. The water industry in the U.S. is extremely fragmented, which means the potential acquisition pool (pun intended) is a very large one. ","
      
    Potential Stock Market Winners of 2025 -- The Motley Fool

Harsh Chauhan,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image Source: Waymo Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been crushing its rivals in self-driving cars, according to the latest data from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Alphabet's driverless car division -- Waymo -- reported the lowest disengagement rate among all the companies testing self-driving cars on California roads last year, meaning there were fewer times when the autonomous driving system had to be shut down. The California DMV defines disengagement as either a failure of autonomous technology or the requirement of human intervention to switch off the autonomous mode. A lower disengagement rate indicates that Waymo's driverless cars have become better at driving themselves. In fact, according to this data, Waymo is not just better than the rest; it is beating its rivals by a huge margin as its cars had a meager disengagement rate of 0.20 per 1,000 autonomous miles. This is down from the 0.80 disengagement rate in 2015. This seems even more impressive in light of the fact that Waymo vehicles covered longer distances than rivals and, as Techcnrunch reports, Waymo's autonomous vehicles and their engineers are set to err on the side of caution when deciding to disengage. Manufacturer Autonomous miles driven in 2016 Disengagements Disengagement per 1,000 miles BMW 638 1 1.6 Waymo 635,868 124 0.2 Ford 590 3 5.1 Nissan 4,099 28 6.8 Mercedes-Benz 673 183 271.9 Tesla 550 183 332.7 Data Source: California DMV A low disengagement rate and more miles driven indicate that Alphabet's moonshot self-driving technology is the most successful on California roads. More importantly, the lower disengagement rate has been accomplished mostly in suburban and city driving conditions. Waymo, therefore, seems to be closer than any other company to launching its self-driving project commercially. This is not surprising as Alphabet (then Google) began working on driverless cars in 2009 and has the first-mover advantage. Since then, its autonomous cars have driven over 2 million miles, with most of the driving taking place on city streets. Additionally, Waymo clocked 1 billion miles on the simulator last year. The amount of time and effort put in by Alphabet's Waymo into the self-driving car project has placed it way ahead of the curve in autonomous driving. This might eventually turn Waymo's driverless rivals into potential clients if they are unable to replicate the success of its driverless tech. Waymo calls itself a self-driving technology company, not a car company. It currently uses a Lexus vehicle and a prototype of its own to test its driverless technology, while it is also plans to add 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the fleet. Image Source: Waymo It is less likely that Alphabet will manufacture cars of its own as it seems to have charted out a different go-to-market strategy. In January, Waymo announced that it will start manufacturing sensors used in driverless cars in-house to integrate its hardware and software development. This integration should give Waymo a cost advantage and lead to stronger adoption of its driverless technology. In fact, Waymo has reduced the cost to build a Lidar sensor -- the most crucial part of a driverless car as it uses lasers to generate maps of the car's surroundings -- by 90%. The price of a Lidar sensor was $75,000 in 2009, but it costs just $7,500 now. The integration of hardware and software under a single roof will allow Waymo to deliver seamless self-driving performance to potential customers as it is developing its sensors in association with machine learning experts. As automakers can get turnkey self-driving solutions under a single roof, they will start turning to Waymo to power their self-driving cars. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) is the first such example. In May last year, Fiat Chrysler and Alphabet's Waymo struck a deal to develop 100 self-driving cars based on the Pacifica Hybrid minivan. This was Waymo's first deal with an automaker to supply its driverless technology. Last month, it was reported that both companies are going to double down on their efforts as Alphabet could add another 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the Waymo fleet this year. A Bloomberg report says Alphabet is in talks with Fiat Chrysler to start a ride-sharing service with the minivans. If that's true, it would indicate that Waymo is finally taking steps to monetize its driverless technology. Honda (NYSE:HMC), meanwhile, could be Waymo's next partner. Both companies were in negotiations last December to put Waymo's technology into Honda's vehicles. A partnership could alter Honda's approach to developing its own driverless cars. The Japanese automaker initially wanted to get its self-driving cars onto highways by 2020, but Waymo could help it go a few steps further by adding city and suburban driving capabilities. A Honda press release says: Honda previously announced its intention to put production vehicles with automated driving capabilities on highways sometime around 2020 related to its goal of a collision-free society. In addition to these on-going efforts, this technical collaboration with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market. These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies. The latest California data clearly indicate that Alphabet's Waymo has a far better driverless technology than any of its rivals. Waymo is using this to its advantage by partnering with automakers and showing them the strengths of its self-driving technology. This strategy of advertising its superiority in this space is a smart one as it can help Waymo win over potential clients, making it a key player in the driverless car supply chain. ","

The stock market is, for lack of a better word, imperfect. While we as investors would love for things to be entirely rational (for example, earnings growth translating into orderly stock-buying and the subsequent appreciation of stock valuations), that's not always what happens. A number of factors, including emotions and even X factors that can't be foreseen ahead of time, can influence stock valuations. Sometimes these ancillary factors can push stock valuations exceptionally low, which presents an intriguing buying opportunity for Wall Street and investors. On the other side of the coin, emotions and X factors can also push stock valuations into the stratosphere, well beyond the point where any rational fundamental theorist would dare go. At any given time, there are almost always going to be a few stocks that fall into the latter category of being ludicrously overvalued. Three companies that'll have fundamental investors saying ""No thanks!"" Image source: Getty Images. Though valuation is an entirely arbitrary process for each investor, the following three companies stand out for their frightening valuations compared to what they bring to the table. It may not be a popular opinion, but one stock I'd crown as overvalued -- ludicrously so -- is electric-vehicle and solar-panel-installation company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). What I will give Tesla is this: It's the first car company in decades to really build itself from the ground up and disrupt Detroit's big three automakers. The demand for Tesla's Model S and X, as well as initial orders for its cheaper Model 3 sedan, have been phenomenal and demonstrate the desire of Americans to own cleaner vehicles. But what looks to be a good idea on paper has yet to translate into profits. Just days ago Tesla reported a 79% increase in automotive fourth-quarter revenue, but it still delivered an adjusted net loss of $106.6 million. Sure, that was a 60% narrower adjusted net loss from the prior-year quarter, but it's still a loss. In fact, the company burned through more than $448 million in cash flow during Q4 as it continued to ramp up the Gigafactory in preparation for the Model 3. Tesla ended the year with $3.39 billion in cash and cash equivalents, but has plans to spend $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2017. In other words, yet another cash raise may be in order. The Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla Inc. Tesla's solar business -- it acquired SolarCity less than two months ago -- also languished. Tesla reported 201 MW of solar installation in Q4, which was almost 100 MW lower than what SolarCity had previously guided for. It's no secret that solar has been weak, but these figures are exceptionally weak. A simple comparison of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Tesla really shows how out in left field Tesla's valuation is at the moment. In 2016, General Motors sold nearly 10 million vehicles and generated nearly $9.12 billion in profit. In fact, it's currently valued at roughly six times its trailing 12-month earnings. By comparison, Tesla produced only around 90,000 vehicles and is losing money hand over fist, and its $41 billion valuation implies a market value of almost $500,000 per car! GM's $56 billion valuation and annual production of 10 million implies a valuation of approximately $5,600 per car produced. That difference is insane. Even with the two companies having very different business models, I don't see why any fundamental investors in their right minds would choose Tesla over GM. Just because a stock has a small-cap valuation doesn't mean it can't still be ludicrously overvalued. Next on the list is highly volatile developmental-stage mining company Northern Dynasty Minerals (NYSEMKT:NAK). In recent months, Northern Dynasty Minerals' shares have caught fire with the expectation that the Trump administration would ease rules set in place by the Environment Protection Agency, possibly allowing the company to be permitted for the Pebble Project in Alaska. In theory, Pebble has enough assets in the ground to keep a mining company busy for upwards of 100 years. Gold and silver prices are also up nicely over the past two months. Image source: Getty Images. Unfortunately, Northern Dynasty's dream of development seems to be more of a fairy tale. One of the bigger issues with Pebble is that the inferred assets in the ground are spread out. While abundant, many of these assets just haven't appeared to be economically feasible to recover. What's more, Northern Dynasty has already spent hundreds of millions just to get to the point where it's trying to determine if there are economically viable areas to mine in Pebble. Don't believe me? Here's a direct statement from the company's third-quarter report: The Group's continuing operations and underlying value and recoverability of the amount shown for the Group's mineral property interests, is entirely dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable mineral reserves. Making matters worse, Northern Dynasty Minerals has nowhere near the capitalization required to develop Pebble into a commercially viable operation (assuming recovery is even economically feasible). At the end of the third quarter, the company had less than $6 million in cash and cash equivalents left, although it did generate more than $32 million from a secondary offering in January 2017. Even so, this is laughably far off from the years and billions of dollars it would seemingly take to get Pebble up to commercial production. Having been previously abandoned before by companies with pocketbooks that were far deeper than Northern Dynasty Minerals', Pebble is likely a dead duck, and Northern Dynasty's stock is potentially worthless. Finally, even though it's not even officially public yet, Snapchat parent Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) gets my vote for being ludicrously overvalued. Image source: Snap Inc. What's more, companies like Facebook have alternative revenue channels. Snap only began generating revenue from advertising two years ago, so it's entirely reliant on ads to generate its sales. Of course, the coup de grace for Snap is that in spite of $404.5 million in sales, it wound up losing $514.6 million in 2016. This harks back to the dot-com bubble days, when companies simply spent every ounce of capital they had and assumed the economy and internet growth would buffer their risk-taking. At some point Wall Street is going to again shun companies that can't turn a profit (ahem, Tesla!), and I certainly wouldn't want any part of Snap when that day comes. ","
      
    It's Official: These Are the 3 Most Ludicrously Overvalued Stocks on the Market -- The Motley Fool

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."" -- Yogi Berra Every year, the stock market either advances, declines, or stays flat. It's never clear beforehand which direction these indexes, or the stocks that comprise them, will move; the reasons for their price swings only make sense in retrospect. But that truth doesn't stop people from making aggressive predictions attempting to identify the Next Big Thing or to call a coming crash or boom. Here are a few classic examples of some smart market watchers getting burned by their stock calls. Whitney Tilson has used his value investing approach to produce awesome returns for himself and his investors over the years. Yet his tendency to bash ""expensive"" companies with high price-to-earnings ratios has also burned the hedge fund giant -- big time. For example, back in 2004, Tilson made a bold prediction. Writing for The Motley Fool at the time, he said the soon-to-be-public Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) (a.k.a. Google) would almost certainly flame out as a business. ""I'd wager that odds are at least 90% that its profit margins and growth rate will be materially lower five years from now,"" he argued. Tilson got even more specific, saying that McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) would make a much better bet given its far lower valuation. ""I believe that it is virtually certain that Google's stock will be highly disappointing to investors foolish enough to participate in its overhyped offering -- you can hold me to that,"" he concluded. GOOGL Market Cap data by YCharts. So how did that prediction pan out? Since 2005, Alphabet shares are up roughly 16 times, compared to less than a 400% return for the fast food titan. The search engine giant produced nearly $20 billion of net income last year, versus McDonald's $4.5 billion. Today, Alphabet is worth almost six times McDonald's in the eyes of the market. Image source: Getty Images. Grove disagreed. The idea of a communicating device that people carried around with them is ""a pipe dream driven by greed,"" he said. Ironically, the article lists a few predictions about the technology that proved prescient. These personal communicators might handle emails, use GPS to map directions, and even allow someone to ""order pizza using a combination of custom electronic forms and wireless fax."" Today, the smartphone industry is massive, with Apple accounting for nearly 150 million iPhone sales in the past year. These devices helped spur over $24 billion of complementary service-based revenue, which demonstrates that, if anything, investors weren't being greedy enough about the potential for smartphones to find a huge market. Glassman's timing couldn't have been worse. The Dow hit 14,000 the year his book published before plummeting to a 15-year low of 7,000 in 2009. A roaring rally has pushed the blue-chip index back to new highs recently, but today it's still 42% below the mark he believed the Dow would achieve over a decade ago. ^DJI data by YCharts. To his credit, Glassman has taken a hard look at how his prediction could have been so far off the mark. He identified two major factors that he and his co-author missed: earnings growth and the attitude of investors as reflected in the price-to-earnings multiples they are willing to pay for stocks. Neither trend went in the direction they had targeted. These failed forecasts illustrate how overconfidence can prove fatal to your portfolio while predictions about economic trends are rarely more than a distraction from the business of accumulating stock market returns. Bold predictions are compelling because they attract debate and can pay big dividends if proven correct. But no one knows which direction stocks or markets will move over the short term. That's why investors are better off simply buying a diverse group of solid stocks and holding on to the shares for years (or decades) while allowing the power of compound returns to do all of the hard work.

In addition to the great regulatory news, ViewRay also provided investors with an early look at highlights from its fourth quarter and full year: Given the good news and positive financial updates, it is easy to understand why shares are skyrocketing today. While there's no doubt that this approval will make ViewRay far more competitive in the marketplace, investors should remember that this company still faces some steep competition from the likes of Varian Medical Systems and Accuray. Both of these competitors are much bigger than ViewRay and have access to far greater resources, which might make it hard for the company to compete successfully. After all, these machines cost millions of dollars to install, so ViewRay might have a hard time convincing hospitals to bypass the more established players and buy from it instead. Still, the MRIdian system's ability to allow oncologists to make therapy adjustments in real time could prove to be enough of a game-changing innovation to convince even reluctant customers to sign up in droves. That makes ViewRay a stock that risk-loving investors might want to keep an eye on. ","

If you want to understand LendingClub (NYSE:LC), one of the first things you need to grasp is where the money to finances its marketplace loans comes from. It's tempting to think that LendingClub's main business is to match small mom-and-pop investors who are looking to earn a little extra yield on their savings with small-time borrowers who want to consolidate their credit card debt or student loans. But this is an outdated assumption about LendingClub's business model. Image source: Getty Images. Of the three types of investors that finance loans in its marketplace, the standard retail investor is far and away the least important. You can get a sense for this by looking at the flow of funds through LendingClub's three investment channels: the issuance of member payment dependent notes, the sale of trust certificates, and the sale of whole loans to qualified investors. Since LendingClub's inception, only 19% of the loans originated in its marketplace have come from member payment dependent notes, which is how the typical retail investor invests on LendingClub. The second largest category consists of the sale of trust certificates to accredited investors (high net worth individuals) and other types of qualified purchasers. This adds up to 29% of LendingClub's total originations. ""Certificate investors typically seek to invest larger amounts as compared to the average note investors and often desire a more 'hands off' approach to investing,"" states LendingClub's most recent 10-K. The third and largest category, accounting for 52% of total originations, consists of whole loan sales to institutional investors, such as banks, hedge funds, and others who seek to hold the actual loans on their balance sheets. ""To meet this need, we sell entire standard or custom program loans to these investors through purchase agreements,"" explains the company. ""Upon the sale of the loan, the investor owns all right, title and interest in the loan."" LendingClub's business model is becoming increasingly dependent on the third sources of funds in particular. In the latest quarter, a full two-thirds of its loans were originated for investors in the final category -- that is, purchasers of whole loans. Data source: LendingClub. Chart by author. All of this matters because the investors in the third channel are the most sophisticated. Unlike small retail investors, who may or may not have a good understanding of LendingClub's fundamental strengths and weaknesses, large institutional investors track these things closely, ready to pull their funds from LendingClub's marketplace at the first sign of trouble. This in fact is exactly what happened to LendingClub last year, after a number of questionable practices surfaced leading to the resignation of the online lender's CEO. As the company explains in its latest quarterly regulatory filing: As a result of the circumstances relating to our board review into certain private loan sales to a single institutional investor in contravention of its requirements and other matters, and the resignation of our former CEO, a number of investors that account for, in the aggregate, a significant amount of investment capital on the platform, have paused their investments in loans through the platform. While many of these investors have returned, many have invested at reduced levels, and it is possible that some investors may not resume investing through our platform. As a result, we may use a greater amount of our own capital, compared to past experience, to invest in loans. The fact that investors ""paused their investments in loans"" cuts to the heart of LendingClub's business model. As the company goes on to explain: ""Failure to attract investor capital on reasonable terms may result in the Company having to use additional capital to invest in loans or reduce origination volume."" Many of these investors have since come back into the fold, but that won't always be the case. The next time LendingClub runs into trouble, these investors may decide to remain on the sidelines. In short, while it's tempting to think that the risk of owning LendingClub's stock is decreasing as its track record lengthens, the company's growing reliance on a small number of large, sophisticated institutional investors to fund its marketplace lending platform suggests otherwise.

Generally, when you receive income outside of your usual paycheck, you'll also get a tax form summarizing your earnings. This form is known as a 1099, and it comes in a number of varieties. There's the 1099-MISC, which, as the name implies, is used to report miscellaneous income. There's also the 1099-INT, which reports interest income, the 1099-DIV, which lists dividend income, and the 1099-C, which covers canceled debt, among others. Any time you receive a 1099, you're required to report that income on your tax return. But what happens if you didn't receive a 1099 form that you were expecting to get? Believe it or not, 1099s go missing more often than you'd think. Sometimes, they get lost in the mail. Other times, they're simply not issued when they should be. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. If you're wondering how to get a 1099 you never received, the answer is to reach out to the would-be issuer and request one. But do you need to take this step? Actually, no. It's a question many taxpayers find themselves asking: Why didn't I get my 1099 form? There are a number of reasons you might be missing a form. Sometimes, companies are late in issuing them, and they do occasionally get lost. But if you're expecting a 1099 for income from a company you did business with, you should know that you probably won't get a form if your earnings totaled $600 or less. However, you're still required to report that income to the IRS, even in the absence of official documentation. Missing a 1099 is only a problem if you don't have your own records, and therefore don't know how much income to report. Unlike a W-2, which you're required to include with your taxes, 1099 forms don't get filed along with your return. So as long as you know what amount to report, there's no issue with not having the actual form. That said, even if you think you have perfect records, you may want to reach out to the issuer to follow up on a missing form. The reason? Companies and entities are required to file 1099s with the IRS. If your copy somehow goes missing but the IRS gets its copy, and the amount listed on that form doesn't match your records, your return could get flagged for an audit. Of course, some people will tell you that, if you're missing a 1099 and know what to report, you should leave it alone rather than risk having a payor issue a potentially erroneous form. But if you're able to get in touch with the issuer and confirm the amount to be listed on your form, there's no harm in getting an official record. While filing your taxes without a 1099 in hand generally isn't a problem, there is one exception, and that's the 1099-R, which lists distributions from pensions, annuities, and retirement accounts. You should receive a 1099-R if you collected at least $10 in distributions over the course of the tax year. And if you had income tax taken out of those payments upfront, you'll need to include that 1099-R on your return to show what was withheld. Otherwise, there's no actual need to go through the legwork of following up with your issuer. ","

Shares or Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) fell as much as 17% on Wednesday following the company's fourth-quarter earnings release. At the time of this writing, shares of the online marketplace for creative goods are down about 14%. While Etsy's revenue of $110.2 million, up 25.4% year over year, was both higher than management's own guidance and higher than a consensus analyst estimate for revenue of $107.8 million, Etsy missed expectations on two marks: earnings per share (EPS) and revenue guidance. Image source: Getty Images. Etsy's fourth-quarter loss widened to $0.19 per share, down from a loss of $0.04 per share in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, were expecting Etsy to report a profit of $0.02 per share for the quarter. The wider loss was driven by rapid year-over-year growth in the company's operating expenses, which increased to represent 63.3% of revenue, up from 56.1% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Management said the increase was primarily due to ""an increase in employee-related expenses related to our acquisition of Blackbird Technologies and marketing expenses related to our brand campaign."" Looking forward, Etsy guided for year-over-year revenue growth in the range of 20% to 22% in 2017. On average, analysts expected 2017 revenue to increase 23%. Etsy management is optimistic about the company's potential in 2017 and beyond.

YouTube surpassed the figure, which is far larger than previously reported, late last year. It represents a 10-fold increase since 2012, YouTube said, when it started building algorithms that tap user data to give each user personalized video lineups designed to keep them watching longer.

Andrew Boyd,03022017,MarketWatch,02232017,"Published: Feb 23, 2017 11:20 a.m. ET Soon, wearable health devices may be able to diagnose illnesses By Wearing a fitness tracking device could earn you cash from your health insurance company. At first, this sounds lucrative for the people who participate, and good for the companies, who want healthier insurance customers. But it’s not quite so simple. Under the program, people who have certain health-insurance coverage plans with UnitedHealthcare can elect to wear a Fitbit  activity tracker and share their data with the insurance company. The data would be analyzed by Qualcomm Life, a company that processes medical data from wireless sensors for doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. Depending on how active participants are, as measured by the Fitbit, they could earn as much as $1,500 toward health-care services each year. Interest in wearable fitness trackers is booming. More than half of people who already own one believe their devices will help them increase their life expectancy by 10 years — even though it’s impossible to actually know that because the clinical trials necessary would take at least a decade. Adding free money to the mix only makes the devices seem more attractive. Before we celebrate this new partnership, though, it’s important to consider potential costs to the patients. We aren't far from days when wearable health devices will be able to diagnose illnesses. While this is not legal now, if Obamacare were repealed, as Republicans have vowed to do, corporate partnerships like this one with UnitedHealthcare

                                   could pave the way for insurance companies to use fitness tracker data to deny coverage or hike up rates for consumers. There are positive elements to pairing wearable fitness trackers with health data. An existing flu treatment medication works best when administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. But it’s difficult to catch the flu so quickly. A Fitbit could make that much easier. If the device measures a sudden decrease in the number of steps the person takes per day, plus perhaps an elevated resting heart rate, that could signal the presence of a virus. If an insurance company has access to those data, it could send a message to the patient. If the person really was feeling poorly (rather than just having decided to watch TV all day or gotten snowed in), she could be directed to go to her doctor or an urgent care clinic. The person could see a health professional quickly, get an effective treatment and be on the mend sooner — thanks to her Fitbit data. This ability will only increase in the future. There are more than 20 clinical trials using Fitbits underway, studying the role of activity in treating pediatric obesity and cystic fibrosis, and even how it can boost chemotherapy’s effectiveness and speed in recovery from surgery. As those studies are published in the coming years, researchers and doctors will get even better at identifying signals of specific diseases in wearable devices’ data. Similar efforts include one to detect influenza with a portable heart-rate monitor. Other researchers are analyzing voice and speech patterns to reveal neurological disorders and other diseases — and are using calls to a health-insurance company as a data source. Even eye-tracking software could measure cognitive understanding, which could identify signs of dementia. Detecting symptoms earlier through Fitbit data could allow faster, more effective treatment. The biggest push, though, is coming from Qualcomm

Without involving a health-care worker or facility, the device must be able to accurately diagnose 13 health conditions, including pneumonia and diabetes. It must also be able to capture in real time five vital signs, such as heart rate and breathing rate, and process the data locally. The global competition is down to finalists; the winner will be announced early this year. That could bring wearables’ insights to doctors — and insurance companies — much sooner than we might think. Wearables’ data can definitely be used to help patients. But it could also be used to harm them, particularly in light of recent political developments. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act (also called Obamacare), insurance companies were barred from denying coverage to customers who had pre-existing medical conditions at the time they signed up for insurance. If that rule is lifted by Republicans in Congress, insurers might look to wearable devices for evidence they could use to refuse to pay for patients’ health care. This development would have enormous consequences. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as many as half of all Americans have some sort of condition that could be used to exclude them from coverage, such as asthma, cancer or mental illness. Might insurance companies ask prospective customers for their Fitbit data, in addition to — or even in lieu of — a physical exam or laboratory tests? If that provision of Obamacare were repealed, could insurance companies set rates based on what those data show — or deny coverage entirely? Car-insurance companies are already using similar methods. Some insurers provide their customers with devices to install in their cars, measuring drivers’ behavior and calculating the risk involved — and the rate they pay for coverage. At the moment, the algorithms connecting activity tracker data and health conditions are still under development. But the biggest thing UnitedHealthcare would need is a large data set of customer Fitbit measurements, so it can link them to insurance claims. Its new cash-for-data program will begin to assemble that information. As insurance customers signed up to use a Fitbit and get some extra cash for sharing their data, United would be able to match their Fitbit measurements with any health conditions identified in their medical records. Over time, the company could build up enough information from, say, people with asthma and people without it to be able to tell asthma patients apart by looking just at their data. The company could do this for other common diseases, too, or even adapt the algorithms from the contestants in the Qualcomm competition. It’s unclear what the company would do with what it learned. But one possibility is that when evaluating a prospective customer, the company could look at his data and know all about any pre-existing conditions. That might mean a person doesn’t get insurance, or has to pay more for coverage. The financial power of the health-insurance industry is enormous. Not only are there many large companies, but they have the ability to determine whether a sick person gets well or doesn’t — and whether the cost is ruinous or merely expensive. Would people feel able to object if insurance companies required customers to wear fitness trackers or other monitoring devices? Would new patients provide access to past data a Fitbit collected? Could an insurance company consider it fraud if a user didn’t wear the device? If used — and regulated — well, the devices can help individual patients change their daily habits to become healthier, saving insurance companies money, and passing some of those savings along to customers. Alternatively, the devices could provide justification for denying coverage to the inactive or unhealthy, or boosting their insurance rates. Consumers should not assume their insurance companies will use their data only to improve patient care. With millions of dollars on the line, insurers will be sorely tempted. With the legal landscape around pre-existing conditions in flux, people should think twice before signing up.

Roberts added, though, that a dual-class stock structure “can set off a red flag to a potential investor or hire that the founder already thinks he or she is Mark Zuckerberg.” Indeed, Spiegel has been alternately compared with Zuckerberg, Apple Inc.

Like all three, he dropped out of college, but in Spiegel’s case it was Stanford University, not Harvard or Reed College. Like Gates, Spiegel is the son of a lawyer, but grew up in the swanky Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. Like Zuckerberg, Spiegel had a major falling out with another co-founder and settled a lawsuit over his role in the founding of Snap. Zuckerberg’s snide instant messages about how he decided to found Facebook would end up in a deposition and were played out in the movie “The Social Network.” Spiegel made graphic and derogatory comments about partying and women in an email while he was in a Stanford fraternity, for which he would later apologize. See also: The two views of Snap — an app that has peaked or a platform set to blossom? But anecdotes do not make the executive. Just because Spiegel has some similarities to previously successful young founders-turned-executives does not mean he will turn out to be an industry legend, or that he can be trusted to always make the correct decision for the life of his company. “This is where you are just betting on the kid,” said Triton’s Wallace. “Does the kid have it? And who is going to deliver the scaled ad platform that they must build to sell ads against this large network of engaged teenagers?” In other words, does Snap have enough “adult supervision” or executives in leading positions with far more experience than Spiegel and Murphy to keep it on its current growth trajectory and turn its hefty losses around? The two founded the company while they were Stanford students, along with Reggie Brown, and created an ephemeral image-messaging app initially called Picaboo in 2011. It was relaunched two months later as Snapchat. Both Google and Facebook addressed that issue long before going public. In Google’s case, the internet search startup named Silicon Valley veteran Eric Schmidt as CEO, while Page was named president of products and Brin was named president of technology, three years before its IPO in August 2004. Facebook hired Sheryl Sandberg away from Google, where she had been president of online sales and operations, as chief operating officer four years before its IPO in May 2012. “Having Eric Schmidt in place at Google was a very important part of the IPO story at the time. You had the seasoned veteran with Silicon Valley chops installed with the brilliant young founders and the troika made decisions together,” Wallace said. “It also showed Larry and Sergey’s self-awareness that they were willing to accept help. Even the singular founding genius Steve Jobs at one point went out and found himself a boss, but obviously with different results. We shall see which of these analogies, if any, is applicable.” See also: How Snap stacks up against Facebook and Twitter Snap’s executive team and board does include an interesting mix of media, finance and tech experience, but there is not one executive position that seems equivalent to a president or COO role. Chairman Michael Lynton was, until very recently, the CEO of Sony Entertainment Inc., a Sony Corp.

Another high-profile executive is Imran Khan, who has been Snap’s chief strategy officer since 2015, after more than a decade on Wall Street.

                                   before joining Snap in 2013. Steven Horowitz, vice president of engineering, joined from Google’s former Motorola Mobility business, right after it was sold to Lenovo in early 2015, and also has worked at a range of other tech giants. The company’s road show video was released on Friday and initially features the two founders, especially the charismatic Spiegel, talking about what Snapchat is and how with it, the camera has become the primary input for the smartphone. Khan is the third Snap executive to be featured, talking about its innovation engine, followed by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Vallero, who notes that Snap is in its second phrase of monetization, having only started selling ads in mid-2015. “We believe profitability, which is our third phase, is expected to follow,” Vallero says in the video. Spiegel doesn’t seem to believe those executives are serving that COO function, though. In 2015, at the Re/code conference, he was asked in an interview about management turnover at the time, and if he was looking for a partner such as Zuckerberg found in Sandberg, to join him at Snap. Spiegel said, “I have a great partner named Bobby, who started the business with me.” Reuters reported, according to sources, that no investors asked executives about the corporate governance issues during a big roadshow meeting Tuesday with over 400 investors in New York. Spiegel also reportedly brushed aside concerns about Snapchat’s slowing growth. Read also: The math Snapchat doesn’t want you to see Beyond supreme voting power, Spiegel is also receiving quite a reward just for getting his company to Wall Street. At the closing of the IPO, Spiegel will be granted a CEO stock award equivalent to 3% of the company’s shares. The restricted stock award “will vest immediately on the closing of this offering” and “shares will be delivered to our CEO quarterly over the next three years beginning in the third full quarter following the IPO.” The company recently sent an email to employees that they too will be able to sell their shares 150 days after the offering, according to The Information, which was not noted in the company’s latest S-1. Just as many are divided in their views on Snap, investors may initially be divided on Spiegel. Is he a spoiled child of privilege who will make an initial fistful of money in the IPO, while investors with no votes are left holding the bag? Or is he a visionary building a major new messaging platform, with a possible future in augmented reality, among other things? “A cynic would say they are almost anticipating unhappy shareholders, as they have made unprecedented efforts to remove the levers uppity shareholders pull to express themselves,” Wallace of Triton said. “If they thought it was going to be a rough ride, they have prepared themselves very well to ride it out.” IPO investors in Snap will not be as well-equipped as Spiegel, and should think long and hard about whether they are willing to bet their money on him.

Quentin Fottrell,03022017,MarketWatch,02232017,"Published: Mar 2, 2017 4:59 p.m. ET Take a deep breath when you come face-to-face with the company head By The chief executive of Uber gets into an Uber… It sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, but that’s what happened to Travis Kalanick, the chief executive and co-founder of Uber Technologies Inc. He took an Uber with friends on Feb. 5 and got into a shouting match with the driver over his company’s policies. The argument was captured on the dash cam of Uber driver Fawzi Kamel in San Francisco. In it, Kamel complains about how Uber’s lower fares have hurt his income. “I lost money — $7,000 — because of you,” Kamel said. “I’m bankrupt because of you.” Kalanick shot back: “Bulls—! …Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own s—.” On Tuesday evening, Kalanick apologized for his behavior and said he needed to “grow up.” (You can view the video here.) Clearly, there are no winners in this particular situation, but it raises an important question: What do you do if you have complaints about your company and you find yourself face-to-face with your boss in a café, elevator or even an Uber? “We should all have an elevator speech ready for our executives or our boss,” says Tim Sackett, president of HRU Technical Resources, an information technology and engineering staffing firm in Lansing, Mich. But the employee should have a statement or question that requires an answer. Or, even better, an idea. “Have you ever thought of…?” It should be an idea or question that can be answered fairly, yet in a way that positions you as someone who wants to be a part of the solution. “That answer will set you up for future success,” he says. Don’t miss: ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ tackled workplace sexual harassment And if you see a big problem in the company, whether it’s one of policy or culture, tell the truth. Remember that scene in “Working Girl” where Melanie Griffith’s character (Tess) proves that she came up with the idea for a company merger? She took her moment and, in this context at least, gave her character Tess her Hollywood ending. Before that, of course, she crashed a society wedding and pitched the idea to the head of a fictional company. (Not to be recommended.) Real life is rarely so simple, but there’s a lesson in that confident and opportunistic approach, says Steve Langerud, workplace consultant and principal of Steve Langerud & Associates in Grinnell, Iowa. “Be clear, factual and solution-oriented,” he says. And brief. There may be less than a minute before one of you has to go. “If you had the CEO in an elevator use a simple structure to think about what you would start, stop, and continue doing to help the organization succeed.” It could be explaining a big idea, as Tess did in the movie, or it could be a valuable piece of advice, framed as a compliment rather than a criticism. “The Uber employee was right to share his experience. Bosses want to be successful and improve. Hearing from employees and customers downstream from decisions is critical to tweaking performance. This was a great opportunity for Uber that went south.” Also read:  From the Oscars to the Oval Office, tweeting and texting at work is catching flak “All CEOs want to hear what’s really going on in their companies, because they mostly get watered down, filtered versions from those who report to them directly,” Sackett says. “If we know this, the Uber driver might have gained favor and more time if he would have said, ‘I have some feedback I would really like to share with you directly on my experience as a driver.’” And if the conversation goes well, Sackett says, you could finish up with, “Can you give me a way to connect with you at a time when you’re ready to talk business?” Of course, having a conversation when either party is in a relaxed social setting or at the end of a long night may not be appropriate. “Employees should have a voice and I admire employees who have the courage to speak up,” says New York-based work place expert and digital marketer Piera Palazzolo. “However, if you want to have a fruitful exchange, you shouldn’t start by accusing someone. You immediately put the person on the defensive and they might stop listening. Now, while the driver embarrassed the CEO, I’m not sure he got his real message across.” Either way, she says, don’t wait until tomorrow to say what you want to say. Make the most of that moment, whether you’re in an Uber or standing by the water cooler. “Speaking out is always a good idea,” Palazzolo says. “But how you do it is key.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

We endorse companies that are doing amazing things like curing cancer, providing clean water, which operate with the highest level of integrity, and which are blessings to their consumers and employees,” said Robert Netzly, chief executive officer of Inspire Investment. The fund doesn’t invest in companies that fail to meet its moral criteria, including ones in the alcohol, gambling, or pornography sectors. It also excludes companies that are supporters of Planned Parenthood and which “advance” same-sex marriage approval. “We’re meeting a demand from investors with conservative values, and one of the things they want to support is traditional marriage,” Netzly said. “Our investors don’t want to be involved with gay marriage.” Religious investing has a long history on Wall Street, with a number of mutual-fund providers offering Christian or Islamic products that adhere to the particulars of those faiths. Shariah-compliant funds for Muslim investors, for example, don’t invest in banks because the religion forbids charging interest.

David Redmon,03022017,MarketWatch,02232017,"Published: Feb 28, 2017 8:13 a.m. ET Why the majority of lead in New Orleans soil is located directly alongside Mardi Gras parade routes By Shiny, colorful bead necklaces, also known as “throws,” are now synonymous with Mardi Gras. Even if you’ve never been to the Carnival celebrations, you probably know the typical scene that plays out on New Orleans’ Bourbon Street every year: Revelers line up along the parade route to collect beads tossed from floats. Many try to collect as many as possible, and some drunken revelers will even expose themselves in exchange for the plastic trinkets. But the celebratory atmosphere couldn’t be more different from the grim factories in the Fujian province of China, where teenage girls work around the clock making and stringing together the green, purple and gold beads. I’ve spent several years researching the circulation of these plastic beads, and their life doesn’t begin and end that one week in New Orleans. Beneath the sheen of the beads is a story that’s far more complex — one that takes place in the Middle East, China and the United States, and is symptomatic of a consumer culture built on waste, exploitation and toxic chemicals. The Mardi Gras bead originates in Middle Eastern oil fields. There, under the protection of military forces, companies mine the oil and petroleum, before transforming them into polystyrene and polyethelene — the main ingredients in all plastics. The plastic is then shipped to China to be fashioned into necklaces — to factories where American companies are able to take advantage of inexpensive labor, lax workplace regulations and a lack of environmental oversight. I traveled to several Mardi Gras bead factories in China to witness the working conditions firsthand. There, I met numerous teenagers, many of whom agreed to participate in the making of my documentary, “Mardi Gras: Made in China.” Among them was 15-year-old Qui Bia. When I interviewed her, she sat next to a three-foot-high pile of beads, staring at a coworker who sat across from her. I asked her what she was thinking about. “Nothing — just how I can work faster than her to make more money,” she replied, pointing to the young woman across from her. “What is there to think about? I just do the same thing over and over again.” I then asked her how many necklaces she was expected to make each day. “The quota is 200, but I can only make close to 100. If I make a mistake, then the boss will fine me. It’s important to concentrate because I don’t want to get fined.” At that point the manager assured me, “They work hard. Our rules are in place so they can make more money. Otherwise, they won’t work as fast.” It seemed as if the bead workers were treated as mules, with the forces of the market their masters. In America, the necklaces appear innocent enough, and Mardi Gras revelers seem to love them; in fact, 25 million pounds get distributed each year. Yet they pose a danger to people and the environment. In the 1970s, an environmental scientist named Dr. Howard Mielke was directly involved in the legal efforts to phase out lead in gasoline. Today, at Tulane University’s Department of Pharmacology, he researches the links between lead, the environment and skin absorption in New Orleans. Howard mapped the levels of lead in various parts of the city, and discovered that the majority of lead in the soil is located directly alongside the Mardi Gras parade routes, where krewes (the revelers who ride on the floats) toss plastic beads into the crowds. Howard’s concern is the collective impact of the beads thrown each carnival season, which translates to almost 4,000 pounds of lead hitting the streets. “If children pick up the beads, they will become exposed to a fine dusting of lead,” Howard told me. “Beads obviously attract people, and they’re designed to be touched, coveted.” And then there are the beads that don’t get taken home. By the time Mardi Gras is over, thousands of shiny necklaces litter the streets, and partiers have collectively produced roughly 150 tons of waste — a concoction of puke, toxins and trash. Independent research on beads collected from New Orleans parades has found toxic levels of lead, bromine, arsenic, phthalate plasticizers, halogens, cadmium, chromium, mercury and chlorine on and inside the beads. It’s estimated that up to 920,000 pounds of mixed chlorinated and brominated flame retardants were in the beads. How did we get to the point where 25 million pounds of toxic beads get dumped on a city’s streets every year? Sure, Mardi Gras is a celebration ingrained in New Orleans’ culture. But plastic beads weren’t always a part of Mardi Gras; they were introduced only in the late 1970s. From a sociological perspective, leisure, consumption and desire all interact to create a complex ecology of social behavior. During the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, self-expression became the rage, with more and more people using their bodies to experience or communicate pleasure. Revelers in New Orleans started flashing each other in return for Mardi Gras beads at the same time the free love movement became popular in the U.S. The culture of consumption and ethos of self-expression merged perfectly with the production of cheap plastic in China, which was used to manufacture disposable commodities. Americans could now instantly (and cheaply) express themselves, discard the objects and later replace them with new ones. When looking at the entire story — from the Middle East, to China, to New Orleans — a new picture comes into focus: a cycle of environmental degradation, worker exploitation and irreparable health consequences. No one is spared; the child on the streets of New Orleans innocently sucking on his new necklace and young factory workers like Qui Bia are both exposed to the same neurotoxic chemicals. How can this cycle be broken? Is there any way out? In recent years, a company called Zombeads has created throws with organic, biodegradable ingredients, some of which are designed and manufactured locally in Louisiana. That’s one step in the right direction. What about going a step further and rewarding the factories that make these beads with tax breaks and federal and state subsidies, which would give them incentives to sustain operations, hire more people, pay them fair living wages, all while limiting environmental degradation? A scenario like this could reduce the rates of cancers caused by styrene, significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and help create local manufacturing jobs in Louisiana. Unfortunately, as Dr. Mielke explained to me, many are either unaware — or refuse to admit — that there’s a problem that needs to be dealt with. “It’s part of the waste culture we have where materials pass briefly through our lives and then are dumped some place,” he said. In other words: out of sight, out of mind. So why do so many of us eagerly participate in waste culture without care or concern? Dr. Mielke sees a parallel in the fantasy told to the Chinese factory worker and the fantasy of the American consumer: “The people in China are told these beads are valuable and given to important Americans, that beads are given to royalty. And of course [this narrative] all evaporates when you realize, ‘Oh yes, there’s royalty in Mardi Gras parades, there’s kings and queens, but it’s made up and it’s fictitious.’ Yet we carry on with these crazy events that we know are harmful.” In other words, most people, it seems, would rather retreat into the power of myth and fantasy than confront the consequences of hard truth.

Brian Cullinan, one of two PwC partners holding envelopes with the names of Oscar winners, tweeted “Best Actress Emma Stone backstage! #PWC” along with a photo of the actress at 9:05 p.m. Pacific time. That was approximately three minutes before Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked on stage to present the award for best picture.

Distracted? #Oscars pic.twitter.com/4eSwD4XXKg Cullinan gave Beatty the envelope that was supposed to contain the name of the best-picture winner, people close to the production said. In reality, however, Beatty was given a duplicate copy of the envelope containing Stone’s name as best actress. As a result, Dunaway mistakenly named “La La Land,” in which Ms. Stone starred, as best picture. Cullinan deleted the tweet, apparently on Monday morning; The Wall Street Journal has seen copies of the tweet, including a version publicly accessible on Google’s servers.

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google is making progress in taking on cloud computing leaders Amazon.com Incand Microsoft Corp, executives said on Wednesday, as the search engine company stakes more of its future on the cloud as a new source of growth. At a conference in San Francisco, Google cloud computing chief Diane Greene ticked off a host of new clients, including HSBC, Colgate, Verizon and eBay. The company also announced it had acquired Kaggle, a popular platform for data scientists that could boost Google’s edge in the crowded field of artificial intelligence. Despite the announcements, analysts said Google remains a distant third in the market for cloud computing, the increasingly popular practice of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data. “The big challenge Google faces is that, for all the names it announced today, it’s still miles behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of scale,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “It has a long way to go, and a few more client announcements aren’t going to close the gap.” Those at the event were more impressed with Google’s growing prowess in artificial intelligence (AI), long a strength of the company. The audience cheered when Google announced that it would release software tools to identify objects in videos using AI. Kaggle, which will keep operating as an independent brand, reflects Google’s interest in marketplaces for data, said Fei-Fei Li, Google Cloud’s chief scientist of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Kaggle allows companies and researchers to post data and uses crowdsourcing competitions among experts to produce usable models. “What Kaggle has contributed to the community is the democratization of data,” she said. While analysts expressed caution about Google as a competitor in cloud computing, company executives insisted they are making brisk progress in the market. Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt cited the recent initial public offering of Snap, a Google Cloud client, to illustrate the power of the company’s services. “We put $30 billion into this platform,” he said. “I know because I approved it. It’s real.” Greene said the company has been successful closing deals, hinting many more client announcements are in the offing. “Already we are winning more than half our deals,” she said. ","

Web companies such as Google and Facebook face increased scrutiny over how and where they store location and search history data from users of smartphones and mail accounts. “The consumer council Taenk would like the Data Protection Agency to assess whether Google’s indefinite data collection complies with consumer’s basic right to privacy,” the watchdog stated in the report seen by Reuters. “We have become aware of the fact that Google today has 9-10 years of data on users with a Google account,” the report stated. In July last year Google changed its data storage practices to comply with requests by Italy’s privacy regulator. Google had to make it clear how users’ data was used and guarantee its deletion within a specified time frame. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters. ","

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s venture arm has invested in Currencycloud, a UK startup that provides technology to enable businesses to provide cross-border payments services to their customers. GV, formerly Google Ventures, participated in a $25 million investment round in Currencycloud alongside existing investors Notion Capital Ltd, Sapphire Ventures LLC, Japanese technology company Rakuten Inc and venture capital firm Anthemis Group, the payments company said on Thursday. The cash injection, which brings the total raised by Currencycloud to $61 million, will be used to support the company’s global expansion plans, the company said. “We just opened up in the U.S. and that requires a lot more development,” said Mike Laven, Currencycloud’s chief executive officer. “We are also seeing tremendous interest from Asia broadly.” Launched in 2012 Currencycloud’s platform allows companies ranging from banks to popular payments startups to offer international payments services without having to set up complex and costly cross-border infrastructure. Clients include Swedish payments business Klarna Inc, lender Standard Bank Group, foreign exchange company Travelex Ltd [TRVLXP.UL] and startups Azimo and Revolut. Around $25 billion has been sent through the company’s infrastructure to more than 200 countries to date. Laven said Google was attracted to Currencycloud because it saw it as a company that provided computer developers tools to add cross-border payment functionality to their services. “Google looked at us as a tool that is used in globalizing domestic businesses,” Laven said. Currencycloud’s funding round comes following a drop in venture capital investments in UK financial technology startups in 2016, as the country’s decision in June to leave the European Union raised concerns on the prospects of local businesses. UK-based fintech companies raised $783 million from venture capitalists last year, down 33.7 percent from 2015, according to a report by trade group Innovate Finance.  Funding of US fintech startups also dropped by 12.7 percent to $6.2 billion, according to the Innovate Finance Report. Laven said the company saw business drop in the months following the Brexit referendum, but that it has been “business as usual” since September.  The company was prepared to seek a license to operate in the EU were that to become necessary after the UK formally leaves the bloc, Laven added. ","

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around – and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google’s venture capital arm. Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation. Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success. On paper, the firm’s initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion. But now Alphabet Inc, Google’s corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims. The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport. Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other. Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV’s investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm’s own investors. “Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber’s admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities. “We have reviewed Waymo’s claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court,” Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. “In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.” A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment. Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map. Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction. With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber’s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said. They finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google’s senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board. A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone’s recent book “The Upstarts,” seemed to bode well for the relationship. But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company’s ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google’s mapping team, the person said. Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said. The friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania. It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said. “Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly,” said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights. The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board. Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview. Uber’s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber. Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet’s lawsuit. In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet. In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto’s - and later Uber’s - version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position. Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations. The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship. All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured. “It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, ‘Hope it goes well,’” one of the sources said. ","

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon’s Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri’s original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that. “Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants,” said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. “The only way to leapfrog today’s limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them.” (Story corrects “language model” in paragraph 10 to “acoustic model”.)

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"KOLKATA, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It’s not easy giving directions when you live in a slum. All his life, Dipak Roy had identified his home as the one on the corner, down the third by-lane, near the hospital on the main road in the Panchanantala slum in Kolkata. Then a year ago, that changed. Roy received something he had always thought impossible: an address, which has helped his family access social benefits and open a bank account, previously out of reach. “I did not think I would have an address as long as I lived here,” he said, gesturing to the tiny homes all around. “Having this address has made so many things possible, like receiving our mail at home and opening a bank account,” said Roy, a student, showing his bank passbook. About a third of India’s 1.25 billion population lives in cities, with numbers rising every year as tens of thousands of people leave villages to seek better prospects. Many end up in overcrowded slums lacking basic amenities. Up to 37 million households - a quarter of India’s urban population - live in informal housing including slums due to a critical shortage of affordable housing, according to a recent report from social consultancy FSG. Panchanantala is a warren of more than 2,300 one-room brick homes and shops, sat under tin roofs and crammed with stoves, trunks and furniture. There is not much to distinguish one tenement from the next, except for a narrow, blue-colored laminated strip with a jumble of letters and numbers on every door frame. These are so-called geo postal codes generated by technology from Addressing the Unaddressed, a Dublin-based non-profit organization working in Kolkata’s slums to give people addresses. About 16,000 dwellings in nine slums in the city have so far got the codes. An estimated 1.4 million slum dwellers in 350,000 homes in Kolkata will receive geo codes by 2026, said Alex Pigot, chief executive of Addressing the Unaddressed. “With GPS and Google Maps, anyone can identify the geo-coordinates of any place on the planet,” said Pigot, who developed the GO Code system for urban slums and rural areas where conventional addresses do not apply. “Giving people an address is relatively simple and inexpensive. Yet it makes a big difference to the lives of slum dwellers, as they can better identify themselves and are more easily able to access services,” he said. Pigot set up his mapping system in response to a United Nations initiative in 2009 aiming to give addresses to everyone living in shanty towns. Since working in Kolkata, Pigot has been approached by more Indian cities, as well as by African nations. It has been a group effort to get the system in place. Pigot, along with Tina Roche, chief of the philanthropic Community Foundation of Ireland, traveled to India in 2012 to assess the need for addresses. With the Hope Foundation, which works to protect children, they then created a system for Kolkata’s Chetla slum, giving each home a nine-digit unique ID. They convinced bank officials to recognize the codes as a legitimate postal address. They trained postmen how to deliver mail to a code, and won the right to use it to access benefits. About 250 homes can be coded every week, at a cost of 150 rupees ($2.25) each, said Pigot, who is working with Google on adding the slum lanes to its maps. “At first, many residents were concerned that getting a code would make them more vulnerable to eviction since authorities could now find them easily,” said Geeta Venkadakrishnan, director of the Hope Foundation in Kolkata. “But once they saw how it would help them get identification documents and open bank accounts, they were convinced of its benefits,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Having addresses has also helped officials identify the needs in a slum, including healthcare and education. “City officials tend to resist any effort that legitimizes slums dwellings, as they see them as encroachments,” said Vinod Kumar Rao at SPARC, a Mumbai non-profit. “For slum dwellers though, particularly new slums where there are no services, an address makes dwellings legitimate and helps ensure access to services.” Slum dwellers battle the threat of eviction every day. In Kolkata, after several botched attempts to relocate slum dwellers to the city’s fringes, social workers prevailed upon authorities to improve registered slums. A registered slum is one where residents have proof of ownership or secure tenure. For that, they need identification documents - hard to get without an address. After Chetla was geo coded, social workers lobbied with city officials to register the slum. Panchanantala was also registered after the geo coding, said Venkadakrishnan. “But the first step is identity - which is difficult to prove when you don’t have an address. Once you have an identity, then you are a legal resident. No one can question your right to be there,” she said. For residents including Roy and Gouri Poilaan - who moved to Panchanantala when she got married four years ago, and got her identification documents after the geo coding - that is key. “All over the world, slum dwellers are in constant conflict with authorities,” Pigot said. “Our work in Kolkata shows that by empowering slum dwellers by mapping and giving postal addresses, slum upgrading can occur successfully, and without the use of displacement or violence.” ($1 = 66.7593 Indian rupees) ","

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has launched a new program to help students build capabilities into its voice-controlled assistant Alexa, the company told Reuters, the latest move by a technology firm to nurture ideas and talent in artificial intelligence research. The e-commerce company said it is paying for a year-long doctoral fellowship at four universities for an undisclosed sum. Working with professors, the Alexa Fund Fellows will help students tackle complex technology problems in class on Alexa, like how to convert text to speech or process conversation. Amazon, Alphabet Inc’s Google and others are locked in a race to develop and monetize artificial intelligence. Unlike some rivals, Amazon has made it easy for third-party developers to create skills for Alexa so it can get better faster - a tactic it now is extending to the classroom. The fellowship may also help Amazon recruit sought-after engineers whose studies will make them more familiar with Alexa than with other voice-controlled assistants. The schools in the program are Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins, the University of Southern California and Canada’s University of Waterloo. “We want Alexa to be a great sandbox” for students, said Doug Booms, vice president of worldwide corporate development at Amazon, in an interview on Wednesday. He added that the fellowship’s goal is to excite the next generation of scholars about natural language understanding and other voice technologies, not to produce research for Amazon. Under the program, students’ projects remain their own intellectual property. At the University of Waterloo, students are improving Alexa’s interaction with air conditioners so it understands requests to cool a room to its normal temperature, without requiring the user to specify a number in Celsius, said Fakhri Karray, a professor of electrical and computer engineering who is overseeing the work. Securing close ties to university talent and research has become an urgent priority for many tech firms. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in 2015 took 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s robotics center in-house to work on self-driving cars and other projects. Microsoft Corp has awarded fellowships to doctoral researchers in different areas of computer science, like artificial intelligence, for years. Amazon itself created the Alexa Prize competition among universities to push forward conversational artificial intelligence, with a $100,000 stipend for each sponsored team. The money for the new fellowship comes from the Alexa Fund, an investment by Amazon of up to $100 million to advance voice technology. ","

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Individuals cannot demand that personal data be erased from company records in an official register, the European Union’s top court ruled on Thursday, limiting the “right to be forgotten”. The case, brought by Italy, related to businessman Salvatore Manni who won compensation from the Lecce Chamber of Commerce because it was clear from its records that he had led a company that went bankrupt in 1992 and was wound up in 2005. Manni said this was the reason why properties at a tourist complex, built by another company he headed, had failed to sell. Individuals’ so-called right to be forgotten has become an increasing demand as growing amounts of personal data are held by corporations and government agencies. In May 2014, the EU court ruled that people could ask search engines, such as Google or Microsoft’s Bing, to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from the web results produced from searches for people’s names. In Thursday’s ruling the European Court of Justice said that company registers needed to be public to ensure legal certainty and to protect the interests of third parties. Company registers only contained a limited amount of personal information and, as executives in companies should disclose their identity and functions, it said. This did not constitute too severe an interference in their private lives and personal data. However, the court said there might be specific situations in which access to personal data in company registers could be limited, such as a long period after a company’s dissolution. But this should be determined on a case-by-case basis. ","

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"(Reuters) - Conde Nast is joining with Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal and Vox Media to package their digital inventory for sale to advertisers, the companies announced Thursday. Digital advertising giants like Alphabet’s Google and Facebook Inc are gobbling up a lion’s share of digital ad dollars, and eMarketer forecasts the two companies will make up 60 percent of the U.S. digital ad market this year. That has forced media companies that previously competed for ad dollars to work together to offer advertisers larger scale than each would be able to their own. Conde Nast’s properties include major U.S. publishers like GQ, Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. The three companies claim to reach more than 200 million consumers and 99 percent of millennials, according to January data from comScore. This new ad product with Conde Nast adds video advertising, as well as the publisher’s data offering, called Spire, which combines digital behavioral data with online and offline purchase data that is designed to help advertisers better tailor their campaigns for individual people. “Our goal always is to deliver for our marketing partners scalable, high quality advertising experiences aligned with the targeted data they need to reach consumers in a uniquely trusted environment,” said Linda Yaccarino, NBCU’s chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships, in a statement. The move comes at the start of the time of year known as  the annual upfront marketplace, between March-May, when many major U.S. media companies sell the bulk of their ad inventory for the next year. Though upfronts have traditionally been focused more on television advertising, the rise in digital viewing has forced media companies to come to the ad market with a more holistic approach and sell TV and digital inventory together. Last year, NBCU and Vox came to the market with their own ad product called Concert, which allowed brands to purchase digital display advertising inventory across both companies’ properties. NBCU invested $200 million in Vox in 2015, one of a flurry of investments into digital companies by the Comcast Corp unit, which has put $400 million into BuzzFeed and most recently invested $500 million as part of Snap Inc’s initial public offering last week.

This news was followed by a sudden resignation of the company's head of growth and product over the weekend. (See also: Google's Self-Driving Car Division Sues Uber.) On Friday, the New York Times published an explosive report revealing that Uber had used secret software to evade detection from government authorities in cities where it didn't have permission to operate. The software, which was called Greyball, helped the company identify enforcement authorities keeping track of its service. In each new city that Uber moved to and where it locked horns with authorities, the Greyball software helped it continue business per usual, even as government authorities thought operations had ceased there. The company even appointed a manager to oversee the Violation of Terms Of Service (VTOS) program, as it was referred to internally. (See also: The Story of Uber.) In a statement to the New York Times, Uber did not deny the program's existence. However, the company cast the program in a different light, claiming that the VTOS program ""denies ride requests to users who are violating our terms of service – whether that's people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret 'stings' meant to entrap drivers.""

But a great first idea resulted in Twitter stagnating when it comes to innovating, says Thompson. “I think this actually gets to the problem with Twitter: the initial concept was so good, and so perfectly fit such a large market, that they never needed to go through the process of achieving product market fit. It just happened, and they’ve been riding that match for going on eight years,” wrote Thompson. “The problem, though, was that by skipping over the wrenching process of finding a market, Twitter still has no idea what their market actually is, and how they might expand it. Twitter is the company-equivalent of a lottery winner who never actually learns how to make money, and now they are starting to pay the price.” Thompson went on to argue that Twitter has been selling the same service it launched in 2006—live commentary, live connections and live conversations—with the only new product ideas mimicking the old way media and television workers. What’s more, Thomson says its “the worst sort of product thinking: simply doing what was done before, but digitally.”  (See also: Weibo on Track to Surpass Twitter In Users.) At the same time that Twitter is lacking on the innovative front, competitor Facebook Inc. (FB) is surging thanks to its embracing mobile and its conclusion that advertisements are way more effective when they show up in users’ news feeds. “In-feed advertisements—just like Google’s search advertisements—are uniquely enabled by the Internet; it should come as no surprise that said uniqueness is strongly correlated with actually making money from advertising,” wroteThompson. But is Twitter evolving? Thompson thinks not, pointing out that Twitter’s strategy with the recent Oscars telecast was to simply live-stream the awards show, similar to how it live-streamed NFL games and the presidential debates leading up to lection. “Twitter’s goal of owning ‘live’ could mean so much more: how might the product evolve if Twitter had the sort of product mindset found at companies like Amazon, Netflix, or Airbnb?” wrote Thomson. The new blog comes on the heels of a dismal fourth quarter for Twitter. For the three months ended in December, Twitter reported adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share on revenue of $717 million, which beat Wall Street's expectations for earnings per share of 12 cents but missed revenue forecasts of $740.14 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Aside from missing on the top line, this amounts to less than 1% revenue growth, and even the beat on the bottom line translates to flat growth year over year. Twitter's revenue was hurt by weak advertising sales, totaling just $638 million, marking a slight year-over-year decline. ",Report: Twitter Lacks Innovation | Investopedia
Shoshanna Delventhal,03092017,Investopedia,03022017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Ever since his film debut in “The Hangover,” possibilities seemed endless for heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson. The Brooklyn-born celebrity has served jail time and filed for bankruptcy despite having receiving more than $300 million during his boxing career. Tyson, ranked No. 1 in the ESPN list of “The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History” has now thrown his support behind trading software company Trade12. The fintech​ platform quotes Iron Mike on their website: “When you fight, you have to know what and who to trust! Same goes for life, same goes for trade.” Trade12, which touts itself as an international brokerage brand, boasts a “fast, simple and safe” alternative to traditional trading platforms. Aside from offering a “feature-rich and accessible trading platforms and technologies,” Trade12 says it can help clients with “free trading education through video tutorials, daily market updates, learning materials and other interactive features.” Tyson, know for his controversial behavior both inside and outside the ring, may be the perfect representative for a forex​ broker alleged by many to be a scam operation. Sky Sports deemed Tyson as “the scariest boxer ever” and “perhaps the most ferocious fighter to step into a professional ring.” Many are finding Tyson’s support of the platform as just another reason to steer clear of the firm. The trading platform, owned and operated by Exo Capital Markets Limited and Global Fin Services Ltd. recently received a warning from Canadian securities regulator the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC), reports Leap Rate. The BCSC has added the MT4 forex broker it to its Investment Caution List. According to the BCSC, Trade12 indicates it is based out of Estonia, and offers an online forex, gold, silver, oil and stock index futures trading platform. A recent article by New Zealand-based Newshub titled “The Mike Tyson-linked company behind your weird calls from Canada” reported a spike in calls from various Toronto-based numbers from Trade12, the Tyson-backed “online trading company” that claims to have a long list of international clients including many New Zealanders and Australians. The news source said many of those contacted said their caller knew detailed personal information about them, while many received “follow-up” emails sent to their personal email addresses. With a quick Google search, one comes across polarized reviews either praising the platform or warning that the operation is a scam. Whether or not Trade12 is the real deal, and how the platform managed to score a celebrity endorsement from “The Baddest Man on the Planet,” is still up in the air.

Matt Rosoff,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"Google is holding a big conference called Google Cloud Next to celebrate and promote its cloud computing efforts this week in San Francisco. The company claimed more than 10,000 people showed up to hear the latest about its cloud platform, which has emerged as the No. 3 in the space after Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the cloud is an ""extraordinarily big bet"" for the company. Eric Schmidt, who was Google's CEO and is now the chairman of parent company Alphabet, said: ""We're here for real, you're here for real, this is an incredibly serious mission. It's something I wanted to do since I joined the company 17 years ago."" The event is also a bit of a coming-out party for Diane Greene, who is a legitimate big deal in the world of enterprise computing. She was a co-founder and the first CEO of VMware, the company that popularized a technology known as virtualization in the early 2000s. (Basically, virtualization lets you use software to run multiple computing instances on one piece of hardware, and is a foundation of cloud computing.) Greene joined Google's board in 2012, and was named the head of its cloud business in November 2015. So it was a little surprising that the company did not have any huge news to announce in its opening keynote on Wednesday, which stretched over two hours. Probably the biggest deal was a partnership with SAP to run that company's HANA database -- SAP's answer to Oracle's in-memory databases, and a big bet for the company for the last five years or so -- in Google's cloud. What's really going on here? Is Google serious about the cloud or not? Alphabet investors should keep in mind that Google's cloud business is a tiny part of Alphabet's overall business. In 2016, Google's ""other"" revenues amounted to $10.1 billion, or 11.2 percent of Alphabet's total. (This is different from the Alphabet ""Other Bets"" revenue, which includes businesses like fiber-optic internet access and self-driving car technology.) In its financial filing, Google breaks down those ""other"" revenues as: Google Cloud is No. 4 on the list (although that doesn't necessarily mean it's No. 4 in revenue or importance). Overall, the segment grew revenues 40 percent from the previous year. That's a lot faster than Alphabet's overall revenue growth of 20 percent. So, there's definite upside. But some perspective is still due. Google has been selling enterprise offerings, first for productivity, and more recently for infrastructure, since 2006. And yet 88.8 percent of Google's business still comes from internet advertising, with the bulk of that almost certainly coming from search advertising. (Google does not break out search ad revenues separately.) That core business is still growing at a very impressive rate, and has great profit margins. So why invest in a complicated business that goes up against some of the biggest and most cash-rich names in technology, both old -- like Microsoft, IBM and Oracle -- and new, like Amazon? For a cynical take, one might turn to investor Peter Thiel's comments at CERAWeek by IHS Markit, an energy industry conference, on Tuesday night. Thiel -- who is a board member and early investor in Facebook, one of Alphabet's fiercest competitors -- noted that he only wants to invest in monopolies. Then he talked about a hypothetical search company in Silicon Valley: If you have a monopoly, you will tell people you are in a super-competitive business. And if you are in a super-competitive business, you will tell people that you have a monopoly of sorts. So for example, if you have a search company in Silicon Valley that I will not name, if you were to go around to CEOs saying, 'We have a bigger share of the market and higher profit margins than Microsoft ever had in the 1990s,' you wouldn't do that...You don't even talk about search. You say, 'We are a technology company with an enormous space called technology, and we're competing with Apple on smartphones, and we're competing on self-driving cars, and there's competition in everything we're doing except this one thing called search, and we never talk about that.'"" A slightly less cynical take: Investing billions in cloud computing might not make sense on a stand-alone basis, but if Alphabet is already investing billions in data center technology for its actual business, why not try and leverage some that technology into a whole new area as well, by selling it to other businesses? It's a low-risk bet. And a lot of companies are buying -- Snap, for instance, says it will spend $400 million a year on Google's cloud for the next five years. Just don't expect Alphabet to give a clear definition of ""success"" in cloud, or a clear timeline for that success, to anybody outside the company. ",Peter Thiel: Why Google never talks about search
Arjun Kharpal,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"Amazon's Alexa may have stolen the show at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this year, but it's Google Assistant that is in the limelight now. At the Mobile World Congress, one of the biggest industry conferences in the world, device makers launched a number of smartphones that come with Google Assistant already installed. Google Assistant is the search giant's artificial intelligence-powered voice assistant to rival Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana. It was introduced last year to replace Google Now, and was originally only available on the company's Pixel smartphones, its smart home speaker called Google Home, and via its chat app Allo. But on Monday, Google said it is beginning to roll out Assistant to all phones running its Android operating system version 6.0 or newer. Google Assistant was introduced on LG's new G6 smartphone and the HMD Global Nokia devices at MWC. The U.S. technology giant's move comes after Amazon continues to aggressively push Alexa onto new devices. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa would be integrated with LG refrigerators and even Ford cars. But it began to step on Google's feet when Amazon announced that Alexa would be on the Huawei Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S., which runs Android. ""It is little surprise Google has come out with all guns blazing at MWC. It must be reeling from the decision to include Amazon's Alexa on the Mate 9 when it was announced,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by email on Tuesday. ""Amazon has taken an early lead with Alexa and Google needs to exploit the enormous reach of Android smartphones to rapidly get the Google Assistant into the hands of consumers before they get wedded to the Alexa ecosystem."" Nearly 9 of every 10 smartphones globally run Android, giving Google a huge consumer base to start off with. ""I think in general, whether this is rolling out to lots of devices or not, we now have user feedback, it will help us improve the product,"" Gummi Hafsteinsson, product management director at Google, told CNBC in an interview at MWC on Tuesday. ""The engagement is more important to that than anything else. We get both positive and negative feedback and use that to make the product better. Hopefully, we will see the product get better faster."" Voice assistants could play a key role in how we interact with the increasingly internet-connected devices in the future. The number of internet-connected devices is set to hit 46 billion in 2021, an increase of 200 percent from 2016. Many of these may not have traditional screen-based interfaces and so voice assistants could be a way of interacting. But Google Assistant could also drive users to many of the company's services including Maps, the core search function, and YouTube. In a recent earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the feature needs to be thought about as a part of a user's overall search journey. This will lock people into Google's ecosystem of services. ""I would encourage you to think about it as, from a user's standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of the total journey they are on. So when we think about something like the Google Assistant we think about it as an ongoing conversation with our users across different contexts,"" Pichai said.

Marguerite Ward,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"Peter Roper became an executive at Google in part by repeatedly asking himself one question: ""What skill set can I develop to enhance my career?"" Before becoming head of mobile brand strategy at the search giant in 2014, Roper made a point to prioritize new job opportunities not by the salary or location, but by the skills he would acquire. It's a strategy that set him up for success. Roper, who spoke with CNBC at the Millennial 20/20 conference on March 1, held several jobs in advertising, sales and technology — including director of ad revenue strategy for music start-up Songza, which Google later acquired. While his job at Songza was markedly different from the one he would later land at Google, the unique combination of skills he gained made him the perfect candidate for his next role. ""The reality is we're all going to switch jobs a lot of times during our life and you have to have a longer term plan,"" Roper says.

Silvia Amaro,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"Despite Snap still in its relative infancy, the CEO of the world's largest advertising agency has told CNBC the tech company has entered a fierce race for revenue against major rivals like Google and Facebook. ""If you look at the competitive reaction, if you look at Facebook's reaction in terms of copying or imitating a lot of the features that Snapchat has, that's indicative of the issues that Facebook faces in relation to Snap and its growth,"" Martin Sorrell, the chief executive officer of WPP said Friday. He added that whereas Google's direct competitor is more Amazon, Facebook's is now Snap - the parent company for social media platform Snapchat. ""So you have a search war developing between Amazon and Google and you have a social media war, if I can put it that way, or market share war between Facebook and Snap,"" Sorrell said. Snap had its initial public offering debut on Thursday and saw its stock rise more than 40 percent, pushing it well above the $17 a share it priced its IPO. However, when looking at digital advertising, Facebook and Google are the two big names in the market. Sorrell explained that out of the $75 billion that his company spends on media bookings, about $90 million went into Snap. Snap's revenues in 2016 were reportedly around $400 million with Sorrell suggesting the company was targeting about $1.25 billion for this year. ""We'll see how far they go, that pales into relative insignificance to Google,"" he said. ""Google and Facebook dominate digital advertising. They own about 75 percent of the market. And they get about 100 percent of incremental spend at the moment,"" Sorrell noted. ""What our clients want and what our agencies and indeed our competitors' agencies want is more competition in the market place,"" he told CNBC.

 ,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"Contractors likely breached security and handed over documents describing the Central Intelligence Agency's use of hacking tools to anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Two officials speaking on condition of anonymity said intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of the breach, which led to WikiLeaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website on Tuesday. According to the documents, CIA hackers could get into Apple iPhones, devices running Google's Android software and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. The White House said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was ""extremely concerned"" about the CIA security breach that led to the WikiLeaks release. ""Anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law,"" spokesman Sean Spicer said. The two officials told Reuters they believed the published documents about CIA hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic. One of the officials with knowledge of the investigation said companies that are contractors for the CIA have been checking to see which of their employees had access to the material that WikiLeaks published, and then going over their computer logs, emails and other communications for any evidence of who might be responsible. On Tuesday in a press release, WikiLeaks itself said the CIA had ""lost control"" of an archive of hacking methods and it appeared to have been circulated ""among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive."" The CIA, which is the United States' civilian foreign intelligence service, declined to comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents. The agency said in a statement that its mission was to collect foreign intelligence abroad ""to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries"" and to be ""innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad."" The CIA is legally prohibited from surveillance inside the United States and ""does not do so"", the statement added. A U.S. government source familiar with the matter said it would be normal for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the CIA both to open investigations into such leaks. U.S. officials previously have confirmed that prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia for years have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation of WikiLeaks and its personnel. A spokesman for the prosecutors declined to comment on the possibility of that probe being expanded. It is not clear if the investigation of the latest CIA leaks is part of the probe. Contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably Edward Snowden and Harold Thomas Martin, both employed by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton while working for the National Security Agency. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and a Democrat on the intelligence committee, said the government needed to stop the breaches. ""I think we really need to take a look at the contractor portion of the employee workforce, because you have to be loyal to America to work for an intelligence agency, otherwise don't do it,"" Feinstein said. Both U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committees have either opened or are expected to open inquiries into the CIA breach, congressional officials said. Some cyber security experts and technology companies have criticized the government for opting to exploit rather than disclose software vulnerabilities, though an interagency review process set up under former President Barack Obama was intended to err on the side of disclosure. Those concerns would grow if U.S. authorities did not notify companies that CIA documents describing various hacking techniques had been compromised. Apple, Alphabet's Google, Cisco Systems and Oracle did not immediately respond when asked if they were notified of a CIA breach before WikiLeaks made its files public. At Apple, none of the vulnerabilities described in the documents provoked a panic, though analysis was continuing, according to a person who spoke with engineers there. Google's director of information security and privacy, Heather Adkins, said in a statement: ""As we've reviewed the documents, we're confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android (operating systems) already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities. Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections."" One reason the investigation is focused on a potential leak by contractors rather than for example a hack by Russian intelligence, another official said, is that so far there is no evidence that Russian intelligence agencies tried to exploit any of the leaked material before it was published. One European official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the WikiLeaks material could in fact lead to closer cooperation between European intelligence agencies and U.S. counterparts, which share concerns about Russian intelligence operations. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of seeking to tilt last year's U.S. presidential election in Trump's favor, including by hacking into Democratic Party emails. Moscow has denied the allegation. One major security problem was that the number of contractors with access to information with the highest secrecy classification has ""exploded"" because of federal budget constraints, the first U.S. official said. U.S. intelligence agencies have been unable to hire additional permanent staff needed to keep pace with technological advances such as the ""internet of things"" that connects cars, home security and heating systems and other devices to computer networks, or to pay salaries competitive with the private sector, the official said. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents. A person familiar with WikiLeaks' activities said the group has had the CIA hacking material for months, and that the release of the material was in the works ""for a long time."" In Germany on Wednesday, the chief federal prosecutor's office said that it would review the WikiLeaks documents because some suggested that the CIA ran a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt. ""We will initiate an investigation if we see evidence of concrete criminal acts or specific perpetrators,"" a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office told Reuters. Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to visit Washington on March 14 for her first meeting with Trump, who has sharply criticized Berlin for everything from its trade policy to what he considers inadequate levels of military spending.

"Elaine Pofeldt, special to CNBC.com",03092017,CNBC,03022017,"Allen Lau, CEO of the fast-growing storytelling app Wattpad, believes running his company in Toronto gives him an unfair advantage over his entrepreneurial counterparts in Silicon Valley. In Silicon Valley, where he ran a previous company, he'd be vying for engineers against Google and Facebook. ""To compete in that environment for the best talent would be very, very fierce,"" says Lau. ""In a smaller pond we are the bigger fish. That helps us attract the best possible talent."" That talent has helped him attract more than $66 million in venture capital and grow his digital community to 45 million users over the last 10 years. With 130 employees and revenue growing 30 percent year-over-year, Lau says, ""we are very determined to build this company in Toronto. We have no plan to open up another office elsewhere, except salespeople."" Lau is a well-known presence on Toronto's fast-growing start-up scene, where by all accounts excitement about entrepreneurship is percolating as it never has before. There are currently between 2,100 and 4,100 active tech start-ups in Toronto's ecosystem, according to a report by Tech Toronto, a community for entrepreneurs. Toronto and the cities immediately surrounding it had a population of 5.4 million people in 2015. A confluence of factors is shaping the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the fourth-largest city in North America. One driver is the city's engineering talent pool. There are 150,000 full-time students enrolled in universities throughout the Greater Toronto area. In addition, the federal and provincial governments offer strong support for technology innovation and financial assistance. Start-ups are also supported by a robust venture capital community. More than $2 billion in venture capital was disbursed in Canada in 2016 — a 15 percent increase over 2016 and the most funding since 2002, when the number hit $2.7 billion, according to the Canadian Venture Capital & Private Equity Association. Toronto has benefited. It was home to Canada's biggest venture deal of 2016. Thalmic Labs, a maker of wearable technologies based in Kitchener, Ontario, near Toronto, corralled $120 million in a series B round in September from investors, including Intel Capital, The Amazon Alexa Fund and Fidelity Investments Canada. With the action showing no signs of slowing and Toronto start-ups standing out in areas such as artificial intelligence, many local players say they're not interested in turning the city into the next Silicon Valley. ""I think Toronto at some level really wants to be the first Toronto,"" says Ameet Shah, a partner at Golden Venture Partners, a seed-stage fund in Toronto whose start-up Five Mobile was acquired by Zynga in July 2011. ""We hate being called Silicon Valley North."" So why is entrepreneurship percolating in the city now? ""It's a convergence of momentum,"" says Craig Morantz, an angel investor in the Toronto area who previously served as CEO of Kira Talent, a locally based start-up that offers a video admissions platform for colleges. One important catalyst has been the critical mass of successful Canadian tech firms, such as Shopify, Hootsuite, Kik and D2L, with offices in the city, alongside U.S. companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google. ""You build some anchor-tenant companies, they scale up, and the talent goes on to start other companies,"" says Mike McDerment, CEO of FreshBooks, an accounting software provider based in Toronto. When this seasoned talent starts companies, a growing number of angels are raring to help them get started. ""More money is available at earlier stages — pre-seed, seed and series A,"" says Shah. With the Silicon Valley market increasingly frothy, deal-hungry venture capitalists, both from within Canada and in the United States, have also cast eyes on Toronto. ""Motivated U.S. investors realize there are some really great companies up here — and are coming looking for them,"" says Mark MacLeod, founder of SurePath Capital Partners, a strategic advisory firm to the global small-business software market based in Toronto. He is often contacted by investors looking to check out interesting companies in the city over a day or two — which he says is easy to arrange. ""Capital doesn't really care about borders,"" says McDerment. ""It's a really good environment to make an investment."" His firm raised $30 million in 2014 from Oak Investment Partners, a firm with offices in Palo Alto, California, and Greenwich, Connecticut, with participation from Atlas Ventures in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Georgian Partners, a Toronto firm. And as more area start-ups evolve into scale-ups and get acquired, local entrepreneurs have developed a greater sense of what is possible, say observers. McDerment points to Bump Technologies' acquisition by Google in 2013 and Rypple's acquisition by Salesforce in 2011. ""The thing people don't know about Toronto is how many great exits have happened,"" he says. Fortunately for fast-growing start-ups, engineers are abundant, thanks to the presence of RIM (Blackberry) and schools such as University of Waterloo, known for its prestigious engineering school, and University of Toronto. And it costs less to hire them than comparable professionals from Silicon Valley. ""I can hire a very senior Canadian engineer for $70,000 U.S. dollars,"" says Morantz.

Leticia Miranda,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"West Elm's issues seem to go well beyond #PeggyGate, the recent guffaw in which the now infamous Peggy couch was pulled from  sale after a viral  essay lamented its poor quality. Consumers have forked out for the brand's glossy, midcentury modern aesthetic — the kind of middle-class professional look that screams, ""I've graduated from Ikea"" — but beneath the surface is a product that offers more in elegance than endurance, according to former employees and unhappy customers. ""I think people in general, they think it's high quality because it's so good-looking,"" former West Elm store employee Lee Hamby told BuzzFeed News. ""But let's face the facts: It's not a high-end furniture brand."" More from Buzzfeed: ﻿If you ask to get your washing machine repaired, a Dish TV guy might show upAmerica's biggest health care stocks aren't moving much in response to Obamacare repealGoogle sometimes highlights misinformation in search results The Peggy sofa is ""a piece of s--t,"" Alex Fawcett, a former visual merchandiser for West Elm in Tysons Corner, Virginia, told BuzzFeed News. The company's product quality ""isn't fantastic, but they're producing on-point design that is basically beautiful and trendy and affordable, considering most people can't afford to go to some haute couture Brooklynite store that will cost several thousand dollars."" A West Elm spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in a statement on Tuesday that it follows ""industry-best standards with commitment to quality materials and manufacturing and rigorous third-party testing."" ""We also take customer feedback seriously and strive to be as responsive as possible,"" it added. But the prices are high enough that plenty of customers expect better. The furniture retailer, which is owned by pricey kitchenware chain Williams-Sonoma, isn't a stranger to quality complaints. Take, for instance the case of the $300 leather dining chair. @joshua_lory: .@westelm quality on $299 chair When Joshua Lory, 32, and his wife moved to San Jose, California, from New York City, they were won over by a set of  West Elm framework leather dining chairs with a dark walnut finish, priced at $300 per chair. Yet when the chairs were delivered in February, Lory noticed a problem almost immediately. ""Out of the six chairs we received, three were damaged in shipping or not put together correctly,"" he said. ""You can also put them in a line and they're not all even. Some are higher than the others."" The chair is now listed as ""no longer available"" online. Lory said a customer service representative told him the whole line had been discontinued because of ""production issues"" and offered to replace the chairs once the issues are fixed. ""They're not charging Ikea prices,"" Lory said. ""West Elm has a lot of pressure on them to put out new styles and be a little higher quality, but they're charging a lot of money for these chairs."" Consider Exhibit B: the Reeve marble dining table. @arkent74: @westelm can you help? I've called, emailed, & no response. Table is falling apart. Alison Kent, 42, told BuzzFeed News she was happy with all of her West Elm purchases until she bought a $600 Reeve marble dining table that started chipping, revealing a marble veneer. ""It wasn't cheap,"" she said. ""I don't really use the table a lot. I had probably eaten at it all of three times."" West Elm's customer service department told Kent they weren't able to refund or replace the table because it was not ""technically an in-store purchase,"" she said. During another call, they offered a 20%-off coupon. In one final attempt, she spoke to a store worker, who told her the line had been discontinued because other customers had complained about the marble chipping. ""I was just really disappointed in their level of customer service and their inaction in caring about the quality of the work they put together and the inability to follow through,"" she said. The company did not respond to requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. A number of unnamed employee reviews on jobs site Glassdoor.com include complaints that West Elm's furniture is not up to par,"" that ""the product might be attractive but the quality is terrible,"" and that the ""products are vastly over-priced compared to quality and craftsmanship."" Consumers think West Elm is ""better quality than it really is,"" said Hamby, who worked in visual merchandising for West Elm from 2007 to 2011. Its slick design and branding has allowed the company to command prices above other starter furniture brands like Ikea.  West Elm's Peggy sofa, which was upholstered in fabric, retailed for $1,199; Ikea's Landskrona leather sofa retails for $799 and comes with a 10-year warranty. ""It's probably a couple steps up from Ikea,"" said Hamby. But ""it's not something you're going to pass on for generations."" Fawcett, the former store staffer in Virginia, said: ""When you come to a brand like Ikea, they may have a sturdier product because they don't put out a whole lot of pieces throughout the year. West Elm has an assortment of sofas and key pieces which changes every year. There is not a lot of lead time to test these products full-on like Ikea would."" @maryrachelcutter: So disappointed my @westelm Reeve coffee table is falling apart after only 14 months :( #worstelm #fixmytable The flaws get noticed by customers. When Cassandra Berger decided to ""be a grown up and invest in a good bed,"" she bought West Elm's  mod upholstered platform bed for about $1,000. About nine months later, she noticed three out of the four legs had cracked and splayed out and discovered the joint that connects the bed frame to the legs had cracked. The company has offered to replace the legs, although it did not address the cracked joint. ""I've ranted enough times about this,"" she said. ",West Elm's quality issues don't stop at #PeggyGate
Abigail Stevenson,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"Jim Cramer was very worried about the pizza space going into Domino's Pizza's earnings last week, as weakness from Yum Brands' Pizza Hut and Papa John's indicated that there was a price war heating up. That was all proved wrong when Domino's earnings knocked it out of the park, including a 12 percent increase in domestic same-store sales. On Monday, he spoke with Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle who said the investments that the company has made in its stores, food and technology during the past few years are now paying off both internationally and domestically. ""We view ourselves as a work-in-progress brand,"" Doyle said. ""We continue to find places that we can improve the experience for the customer and as long as we are making investments that do that, that can permanently improve the experience for our customers and we think we are going to continue to grow."" What separates Domino's from the pack is that it is a play on what Cramer calls the stay-at-home economy. This refers to strength in stocks that don't require people to get off the couch, such as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. ﻿Watch the full interview here: Domino's began investing in technology approximately seven years ago and made the decision to manage the technology in-house. Its investments in technology have made it even easier for people to order from home and never speak to another human being, thanks to partnerships with non-traditional restaurant partners, such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. ""Those are kind of the big players in technology, and we've got to be there with them with our customers if we are going to grow our sales,"" Doyle said. Customers can order with an Apple watch, Facebook messenger, Alexa and Google Home. The platform also allows them to track their pizza from the store to their door. It's even rolling out an autonomous delivery vehicle called ""DRU"". Approximately half of the employees of its Ann Arbor, Michigan-based headquarters work in technology or analytics surrounding the data created on its platform. Doyle also attributed the success of the quarter to Domino's franchisees. On its earnings call, Papa John's said its soft quarter was due to a decline in NFL ratings. However, Doyle confirmed that Domino's was not impacted by any NFL decline and managed to take share from the big players in pizza. This is a shift for Domino's, as Doyle cited approximately 80 percent of gains in the past 5 years were taken from smaller players. ""We did take share from the category overall, and maybe a little bit more of it came from the larger players this category,"" Doyle said. Questions for Cramer?

Many tech investors are probably familiar with the basic facts about Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) -- it's the biggest search engine in China, it has a growing ecosystem of cloud-based services like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, and it benefited greatly from Google's exit from the mainland Chinese market in 2010. Those are the bullet points in the growth story that boosted Baidu stock by nearly 1,500% over the past decade. But today, we'll take a look at six lesser-known facts about the ""Chinese Google"" which many investors might have overlooked. Image source: Author's screenshot. After earning a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Buffalo, Baidu co-founder and CEO Robin Li worked at Dow Jones & Co.'s IDD Information Services and search company Infoseek in the 1990s. Like Google, Baidu believes that autonomous electric cars would be a natural extension of its data mining ecosystem. The company started testing out driverless cars on public roads in late 2015, and formed a driverless tech research center in Silicon Valley last April. Image source: Getty Images. Baidu is powering these vehicles with a combination of NVIDIA's automotive chips, HERE Maps, and its own AI algorithms. It's currently outsourcing production of these vehicles to Chinese automakers, and has declared that it will launch an autonomous shuttle bus by 2018. For search engines like Baidu and Google, AI plays a key role in recognizing images, analyzing search patterns, and deciding what types of targeted ads will appeal to users. That's why Baidu hired a lot of top talent in AI -- its chief scientist Andrew Ng previously helmed the Google Brain AI project, and its new augmented reality chief Qi Lu was previously an AI specialist at Microsoft. Baidu hasn't been shy about challenging Google in the AI arms race. In January, it pitted its AI program against Google's AlphaGo AI in a series of facial and voice recognition tests in a live TV broadcast. Baidu previously invested in Uber's Chinese division, but Uber eventually retreated from the market due to tough competition -- especially from market leader Didi Chuxing. Uber sold its Chinese business to Didi last August, but retained a 17.7% stake in the new subsidiary. Baidu and Uber China's other shareholders received a 2.3% stake. That stake is small, but Baidu could boost it and more tightly integrate Didi's services into its O2O (online-to-offline) ecosystem. Didi could also play a key role in automating Baidu's driverless cars. Baidu owns a 25% stake in Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP), the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China. For years, Ctrip was engaged in a price war with its primary competitor Qunar (NASDAQ:QUNR), which crushed both companies' margins. Baidu owned a 45% stake in Qunar, but it swapped that stake for a 25% stake in Ctrip in 2015 -- which effectively merged the two companies and ended the price war. That move also tethered Ctrip's services more tightly to Baidu's growing O2O ecosystem. In late 2014, Baidu introduced DuBike, a bike equipped with a wide array of health and motion sensors which sync to a mobile app. It also features on-board navigation signals, which let riders follow directions without glancing at their phones, and lets riders share their routes with friends. To top it off, the entire system is powered by a rider's kinetic energy -- so the bike never needs to be recharged. Baidu's DuBike. Image source: Baidu. The heart of Baidu's business is still search-based advertising, but that could gradually change as its efforts in driverless cars, AI, its O2O ecosystem, and even smart bikes pay off. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on these adjacent efforts as the company trades blows with other tech titans -- like Tencent and Alibaba -- over the next few years. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Any investor would love to get their hands on a crystal ball and take a quick peek at what's going to happen over the next decade. The problem is, those crystal balls are hard to come by, so we all have to settle for looking at what companies are doing right now -- and attempt to anticipate how that will help or hurt them in the future. Image source: Amazon. The company's ability to diversify its businesses -- while still tying many of them to its Prime service -- has given Amazon a lead over its competitors that won't fade any time soon. Image source: Google. With a $581 billion market cap, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a juggernaut of the technology industry, yet it still innovates like a much smaller, scrappier company. Alphabet may still earn most of its revenue -- 99% -- from Google, but that hasn't stopped it from making big bets on the driverless car market and even moonshots like curing cancer. Among the more than 20 companies under the Alphabet umbrella, there are units trying to secure major positions in the future of transportation, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the burgeoning Internet of Things. Add to that the company's mobile dominance with its Android platform, and its new devices like the Pixel Phone and Google Home and its crystal clear that Alphabet will still be one of the most dominant tech giants a decade from now. Image source: Facebook. Every day, the world feels like it gets a little bit smaller and slightly more connected, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) deserves at least partial credit for that. With more than 1.86 billion users on the company's main platform, and more growth coming in huge markets like India, Facebook shows no sign of slowing down in the social media space. The company plans to have 5 billion users by 2030. Take a minute and remember that we have 7 billion people on the planet right now. That's a hefty goal, but if any company can do it it's Facebook. Aside from its main Facebook platform, the company is investing billions in connecting people around the world through its WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and is investing heavily in building what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls ""the next computing platform"" -- virtual reality. Image source: Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has gotten some flak for the high price of its F-35 Lightning stealth fighter jet, as President Trump has so kindly pointed out on Twitter. But despite the criticisms, the F-35 is poised to help Lockheed Martin dominate the aerospace industry over the next decade. Consider that the F-35 is expected to be in service until 2070 and could bring in more than $1 trillion in revenue for the company over that time span. Sure, Lockheed may further trim the cost of the planes -- as it did recently, when it announced its long-term efforts to reduce costs had cut the price on its next batch of 90 planes by $700 million -- but with more than 50 years of revenues expect to come from this jet family, there's little reason to be skeptical of Lockheed's dominance. Image source: Netflix. Not so long ago, the idea of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) being capable of creating original, award-winning programming would have seemed absurd. But over the past few years, the company has amassed a vast trove of original content that has not only won over critics but also helped the company win new customers. In fact, 57% of the streaming service's U.S. subscribers say they signed up for because of its original content. Netflix now boasts about 93.8 million subscribers in 190 countries,  and it's still growing. The company faces rising competition from Amazon's Prime video service, but says it plans on investing $6 billion in original content this year, which should help it fend off rivals. A decade from now, Netflix will have the advantage of that much more original content production under its belt, and more streaming experience than any of its competitors. Image source: Disney. Add to all of that the company's long list of theme parks, cruise ships, resorts, and its Pixar Studios, and it's easy to foresee Disney holding a powerful position the entertainment business for years to come. The company will have to adapt to a shifting pay-TV landscape, and adjust to how those changes will impact the company's all-important ESPN networks. But investors would be wise to remember that the company already has many decades worth of strategy-shifting experience. Image source: GE. 7. General Electric General Electric (NYSE:GE) has weathered more changes than most companies over its 100-plus year history, and the conglomerate  recently reinvented itself once again to benefit from the rapidly evolving industrial and technological landscape. Consider that CEO Jeff Immelt said back in 2015 that his company is ""on track to become a top 10 software company.""  Software may seem like a far cry from the engine turbines and other industrial equipment GE is known for, but it's anticipating the rise of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), in which equipment is connected to the Internet, collects data, and then analyzes it, helping make companies and systems more efficient. GE is already well on its way in this market, and with the IIoT estimated to add $14.2 trillion to the global economy by 2030, there's plenty of room for growth. Image source: Tesla. Compared to other U.S. automakers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still  in its infancy, but the electric carmaker is quickly becoming key player in the space. Tesla is preparing to launch its fourth vehicle, the Model 3, later this year, and estimates that it will produce 500,000 cars annually starting in 2018. That's not so impressive when compared to, say, Ford's 2.6 million U.S. vehicle sales last year. But Tesla is betting that the future of passenger cars is electric, and it's building out a vast network of supercharger stations across the U.S and Europe to fuel them, has already built the battery-making Gigafactory to help drive down vehicle costs, and is a leader in the driverless car space. If electric and self-driving vehicles are the future, then the next decade could certainly be dominated by Tesla. Image source: Oracle. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is slowly shifting from a hardware-dominated sales model to one that generates more recurring revenue from software and services. Its cloud computing revenue was up 64% year over year in its most recent quarter, and topped $1 billion for the first time. Oracle is now the leading cloud computing provider for companies that have 1,000 or more employees, and has made major investments in the space with acquisitions such as cloud provider NetSuite, which it picked up for a cool $9.3 billion. The shift away from hardware to software and services may have been slow in coming for Oracle, but it's making up for lost time, and betting that its current cloud investments will pay off over the long term. Given its current position in the tech world, and its rising power in cloud computing, you can bet Oracle will maintain its position for years to come. Image source: Nike. No other company dominates the sports apparel world like Nike (NYSE:NKE), and at this point, there's virtually no stopping it. It has not only built one of the strongest brands on the planet, but it also knows how to keep the momentum going. Consider that the company's $93 billion market cap allows it do things like sign a lifetime sponsorship deal with Lebron James that's estimated to be worth up to $1 billion. But branding is only part of the company's staying power. Nike has proved that it can continue innovating its product lines, and it has 40-plus years of success in marketing them in the right way. Others may sprint faster for a time to gain share in the $320 billion athletic apparel market, but Nike is running a marathon, and it's clear it trained harder and has more stamina than any of its competitors.

Image source: Getty Images. Americans are changing the way they watch television. More and more customers are showing interest in over-the-top streaming TV services. Over 200,000 people joined AT&T's (NYSE:T) DirecTVNow in about one month. DISH Network's (NASDAQ:DISH) Sling TV has over 1 million subscribers. Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation Vue is also very popular. Now YouTube -- a subsidiary of Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company -- is throwing its hat in the ring as well. The company recently revealed YouTube TV, a slightly differentiated television service that costs just $35 per month. Here's what investors need to know about YouTube TV. YouTube TV's channel lineup. Image source: YouTube YouTube focused on signing deals with the big four broadcast companies. As a result, cable-only media companies such as Viacom and Time Warner are missing from the bundle. No CNN, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, or HBO. But it does mean cable networks owned by the big four -- ESPN, FX, USA, E!, and so on -- are all there. That's kind of the opposite approach of Sling TV. Sling launched without any broadcast networks, inviting subscribers to buy a television antenna to supplement the service. Importantly, local networks are limited in availability. That's why YouTube TV is launching only in markets where the media companies own the local broadcast affiliate. Sony tried something similar before expanding nationwide with a reduced price for subscribers where live local channels are not available. Overall, the channel lineup is somewhat lacking compared with competing services at around the same price point. Customers that signed up early for DirecTV Now are receiving 100 channels for $35 per month, and new customers can still receive 60 channels for that price. PlayStation Vue customers can get a similar set of channels for $35 per month, and Sling TV subscribers can get around 50 channels for $40 per month. The limited geographical reach and channel lineup should reduce the number of subscribers YouTube TV will attract. Although YouTube TV may lack some of the content available on other platforms at similar price points and the geographic reach of its competition, it has one major advantage. It already owns leading technology in video streaming. All three of the aforementioned competitors suffered major technical difficulties following their launches. DirecTV Now received a lot of bad press as its servers were overloaded making parts or all of the service unusable. YouTube, on the other hand, already streaming 1 billion hours of video every day. Consumers may be willing to sacrifice some channels for more reliable service. But YouTube still has to prove that it can deliver where competitors failed. YouTube TV is a somewhat underwhelming product at launch. With a limited channel lineup and geographic reach, it's unlikely to make any significant impact on YouTube's operations in the near term. In the long term, however, getting a viable product out there now could lead to a much better product in the future. YouTube is already offering a few differentiating features such as unlimited cloud DVR, AI powered search and personalization (likely backed by YouTube viewer data), and the ability to split the account six ways so different users get different recommendations. If YouTube can get the content deals in place while maintaining competitive pricing, it could be a big winner in the future. ","
      
    YouTube TV Is Here: What Investors Need to Know -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. YouTube recently announced its plans to offer a live television streaming service to compete with the likes of DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, and more traditional pay-TV operators. YouTube TV will include 40 live channels and will be initially available in select markets. While YouTube TV is missing quite a few channels compared with competing services, it has the potential to attract a lot of attention from media companies in the future thanks to one huge advantage over the competitors: Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary and owner of YouTube, is one of the best digital video advertisers in the world. Image source: YouTube Disney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger is actively trying to get his networks into digital skinny bundles. Indeed, Disney's networks, including ESPN, are available in the lowest-priced tiers of all of the aforementioned streaming services. Importantly, Disney is not sacrificing any of its affiliate fees to get its channels into those tiers. ""The per-channel fees, which we are not getting too specific about, are commensurate with what the fees are on the existing services,"" Iger said about its deal with DirecTV Now. But there's an added benefit to going digital. ""Some of the technology platforms will offer dynamic ad insertion. We think that that has got some real potential for the company,"" Iger told investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call last year. Dynamic ad insertion allows media companies to serve targeted ads to viewers instead of using the one-size-fits-all system of traditional live broadcasts. YouTube TV may give media companies the opportunity to tap into Google's targeting data. On top of that, YouTube already has millions of advertisers on its platform, which it could tap for more premium YouTube TV ads. Media companies might give YouTube TV a bigger break on affiliate fees if it can produce meaningfully higher ad revenue per viewer than its competitors. Media companies will handle the majority of their ad buying at the launch of YouTube TV, but YouTube will have access to about two minutes of ads for every hour of viewing. That's the ad inventory that every cable company receives. If YouTube can use its decade of advertising experience and produce outsize results, it could increase interest from media companies for its services. That bit of advertising is about the only thing that will make YouTube TV profitable, as analysts estimate its affiliate fees total about $29 before accounting for various regional sports networks, which could add $4 to $5. Suffice it to say YouTube TV has a lot running on that small slice of advertising inventory. The market Google is going after with YouTube TV isn't so much the pay-TV market as it is the television advertising market. Google tried to break into the market before by partnering with media companies about a decade ago. Now, it's using YouTube TV as a platform to gain access to that inventory, which generated about $71 billion in the U.S. last year. Getting YouTube TV off the ground and showing media companies what it's capable of with advertising is the first step. The more successful it is with its own ad inventory, the more likely it is to win the business of more media companies. In turn, more customers will sign up as the value improves and YouTube is able to bring on more networks. If YouTube TV is successful, it will be because its superior advertising makes it a win-win-win -- the media companies, the consumers, and YouTube. ","
      
    YouTube TV's Biggest Advantage -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For many retired workers, Social Security isn't just some ancillary income channel that pads their pockets during retirement. It's a vital source of income without which millions of seniors would likely be living in poverty. According to the latest data snapshot from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in June 2017, more than 41.9 million retired workers were receiving an average of $1,368.67 per month. The data show that slightly more than 60% of these retired workers will rely on their Social Security benefits to comprise at least half of their monthly income. Image source: Getty Images. Because Social Security is such a critical program for our nation's seniors, it pays for retirees (as well as future retirees) to keep a very watchful eye on what changes could be coming down the pipeline. Obviously, political changes are a bit hard to predict. President Trump has suggested that he wouldn't be looking to directly alter the Social Security program, and would instead tackle things indirectly by focusing on economic growth. Since the payroll tax is the primary funding tool of Social Security, a faster growing economy could indeed lift Social Security's coffers and help stem an estimated $12.5 trillion budgetary shortfall in the program over the next 75 years. Trump is hopeful that individual and corporate tax reforms, as well as a focus on new trade deals, domestic energy, and a long-term infrastructure plan, will add this desired growth and lift Social Security. In the much nearer term (i.e., by next year), we have a bit more visibility when it comes to direct aspects of Social Security that are likely ripe for change. Here are three Social Security changes that I believe can be practically locked in as a given in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Unless there's some serious cohesion in Congress and a new Social Security bill is passed, the full retirement age for new retirees born in 1956 will be rising by two months in 2018 to 66 years and four months. Your full retirement age, which is determined by your birth year, is the age at which the SSA deems you eligible to receive 100% of your monthly benefit payment. This benefit is determined by factoring in your 35 highest-earning years of work. For persons born in 1956, claiming Social Security at any point between age 62 and age 66 and four months will mean accepting a reduced payout for life. Likewise, waiting until age 66 years and five months all the way until age 70 could lead to an even larger payout than what you're due at your full retirement age. The 2018 increase in the full retirement age was actually signed into law all the way back in 1983 by Congress in order to account for lengthening life expectancies. Long story short, if you're born in 1956 (or later), you're going to have to wait even longer to receive 100% of your benefits, or you'll have to be willing to accept a steeper reduction in your lifetime payouts. Image source: Getty Images. There are still a few months to go before Social Security's inflation calculation is made and 2018's cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is announced, but as things stand now, it's looking quite favorable that seniors will net their largest COLA in years. Right now, Social Security's COLA is governed by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The average third-quarter reading from the previous year serves as the baseline, while the average third-quarter reading from the current year serves as the comparison point. If the CPI-W falls year-over-year, there is no COLA (i.e., beneficiaries receive the same benefit payment without a ""raise""). If there is an increase, beneficiaries receive the difference rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. Recently released data from the Social Security Board of Trustees in July predicts a 2.2% rise in COLA for 2018. The primary culprit behind this increase is higher fuel prices, with general economic inflation playing a smaller role. However, it's still important to remember that the ""raise"" seniors are receiving is merely meant to match the inflation rate, not put seniors ahead of the curve. If anything, with COLAs falling short of the medical inflation rate in 33 of the past 35 years, COLAs are doing a pretty poor job of keeping seniors on par with the real inflation they're facing.

The National Average Wage Index (AWI) is what's behind Social Security's maximum taxable earnings, meaning a steady increase in U.S. GDP probably means a healthy increase in maximum taxable earnings. As noted above, Social Security's payroll tax is what provides the bulk of revenue to the program (87.3% in 2016, according to the SSA). In 2017, earned income between $0.01 and $127,200 was subject to the 12.4% payroll tax to fund Social Security. It's worth noting that most workers don't pay the full 12.4%. Instead, the total is split down the middle between employers (6.2%) and employees (6.2%). For the wealthy, it means any earned income beyond $127,200 is free and clear of Social Security's payroll tax. While it's tough to gauge how much of an increase we're on track to see in the AWI, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a roughly 3% increase in maximum taxable earnings, pushing the upper boundary of the scale to north of $130,000. Long story short, expect the rich to pay more in 2018. There's still plenty of time for these scenarios to be altered, but these Social Security changes are looking very probable in 2018. ","
      
    3 Big Social Security Changes You Should Expect in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

"Brian Feroldi, Jason Hall, Rich Duprey, Jordan Wathen, and Dan Caplinger",03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It isn't hard to figure out why Amazon.com has been one of the best-performing stocks over the past two decades. The e-commerce giant's top line has skyrocketed since its founding in 1994 as more consumers warm up to the idea of shopping online. In turn, investors have bid up shares on the hope that the company's massive revenue growth will translate into huge profit growth, too. So what other companies could potentially grow at a breakneck speed over the next few decades? We asked a team of Fools that very question, and they picked MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF), Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Read on to find out why. Image source: Getty Images. Dan Caplinger (MercadoLibre): To look for Amazon-like growth potential, it makes sense to stay in the same arena that Amazon serves while searching for a niche that the online retail giant hasn't yet sought to cover. MercadoLibre has that appeal, as it has set out to become the primary e-commerce giant serving the Latin American region. With hundreds of millions of potential customers in a rapidly growing part of the emerging world, Latin America gives MercadoLibre plenty of upside potential. MercadoLibre has done a lot to build up an entire ecosystem to facilitate internet commerce. Starting with its premier marketplace site, MercadoLibre later added a variety of add-on services, including its MercadoPago payment system, MercadoEnvios for shipping, and a service to allow purchasers to get financing on what they buy when necessary. These ancillary businesses provide a full-service experience for MercadoLibre users, but they also have the potential to become independently successful in their own right and expand into more applications. MercadoLibre does face the challenge of dealing with more volatile economic conditions. For instance, in recent years, Latin America largely missed out on the economic growth that the U.S. has enjoyed, because of falling commodity prices. That filtered through to MercadoLibre's prospects. However, with commodities starting to bounce higher, MercadoLibre has posted solid growth, and the runway for the e-commerce giant spans a long way into the future. Rich Duprey (NVIDIA): After the run-up in value NVIDIA has had over the past few years, rising some 600% since 2014, it's easy to think its stock is priced for perfection. As it trades at 62 times trailing earnings and 44 times forward estimates, it's understandable why some are concerned about valuation. But at times some companies deserve the heightened expectations -- because their businesses are that good. The depth and breadth of the graphics-chip maker's portfolio gives it a huge competitive advantage over rivals Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), driving its leading GPU segment to exceed the market's growth. Notably, the segment is enjoying rapid adoption in AI, the cloud, gaming, and self-driving vehicles. That shows its importance not only in its mainstay gaming market, but also in the auto market, in the Internet of Things, and as part of devices that are pushing the boundaries of virtual reality and machine learning. GPUs are perhaps at the core of the wave of the future: deep learning that will literally drive the driverless cars, advance healthcare, and more. NVIDIA's leadership has come at the expense of Intel and AMD, but make no mistake: It's still gaming that is the moneymaker here, accounting for more than 60% of total revenue as its GeForce GPU continues to fuel strong adoption of its Pascal architecture. AMD's Polaris processors may help lift its performance, but they still lag far behind NVIDIA's offerings. The chipmaker may have to do everything right, but it's proving that it is capable of doing so, and it routinely exceeds even its own forecasts of growth. It expects fourth-quarter revenue to come in at $1.9 billion, give or take, which would be a nearly 50% year-over-year increase -- a goal well within its reach. No company can grow continuously in a straight line, and there will be hiccups along the way for NVIDIA, but there's no reason to think that, even if investors get nervous again, the strength of its business won't be able to continue driving it higher to achieve Amazon-like growth. Brian Feroldi (Illumina): While the human genome was first decoded more than a decade ago, I'd bet that you still haven't had your DNA sequenced. That's because it still costs more than $1,000 to do so, which is a price tag that is still too high to drive mass adoption. However, I'd bet that you will have your genome sequenced in the next decade or so as costs continue to fall. If I'm right, then Illumina -- a leading provider of genomic-testing equipment -- looks poised for massive growth from here. Illumina is the dominant player in the genomic-sequencing market. The company sells both the machines that sequence the DNA and the supplies that are needed to run each test. This razor-and-blade model has allowed Illumina's revenue to rise rapidly even while the cost of performing a test has fallen dramatically. Here's a great chart that shows this phenomenon in action: Image source: Illumina. CAGR = Compound annual growth rate. Recently, Illumina stunned the markets with the launch of its NovaSeq series, which is a next-generation testing system that promises to drive down the costs of sequencing a genome to as little as $100. With a price point that low, I could easily see this technology going mainstream. But what can healthcare providers do with the information gathered through DNA sequencing? To help find out, Illumina has teamed up with IBM and Philips to create new tools that will standardize and simplify data interpretation. If successful, the project could help providers identify diseases at far earlier stages than current technology allows. In total, Illumina's new technology could help to revolutionize the world of healthcare as we know it today. If this pans out, then Illumina could be poised to deliver decades of top- and bottom-line growth. Jason Hall (First Solar): Solar and renewable energy stocks are likely to get trashed in the near term, as President Donald Trump's administration makes good on his campaign promise to cut regulations. And while a lot of investor money will shift away from renewables and chase after the companies that could benefit in the short term, the long term remains in the favor of companies like First Solar. This is because, even as the Trump administration announces plans to cut emissions regulations across the transportation, automotive, and utility industries in the United States, the rest of the developed world is putting more emphasis on renewables. And with the bulk of global population expansion -- particularly in the energy-consuming middle class -- happening outside North America over the next several decades, don't let local politics cloud your view when it comes to the growth prospects for First Solar. After all, the company already derives nearly half of its business outside North America. There's a good chance the market will remain very unfavorable on First Solar's stock in the short term. But looking out years down the road, billions of new global middle-class members will be relying on solar all over the world, no matter what U.S. politics and regulations look like. If you're willing to ride out short-term choppiness completely unrelated to the big picture, and potentially get Amazon-like returns, First Solar is a great stock to own. Jordan Wathen (WisdomTree Investments): WisdomTree Investments currently dominates in an obscure corner of the index fund world. WisdomTree's most popular funds allow you to invest in Japanese and European stocks without exposing yourself to currency risk. The bad news is that investors have turned cold on the strategy. The company's currency-hedged funds, which held about $39.2 billion in assets at their peak in the second quarter of 2015, ended the fourth quarter of 2016 with just $18.8 billion in assets. As the dollar strengthened, investors now want to bet on a weaker dollar, a bet that WisdomTree funds aren't particularly useful for. Luckily, the company has a few other emerging strategies. Its domestic dividend funds are proven winners and have been excellent asset gatherers. It has also expanded abroad to start new exchange-traded funds in markets that aren't as saturated with ETFs as American stock exchanges. I see WisdomTree as something of a lottery ticket in an industry that should see its assets under management grow at a high-single-digit clip for a long time to come. For a levered company like WisdomTree, that can easily turn into years of double-digit earnings growth. ","
      
    5 Stocks With Promising, Amazon-like Growth Potential -- The Motley Fool

Tim Hanson,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. IMAGE SOURCE: SNAP. Given the overlap between the user bases of Robinhood and Snap -- both skew heavily millennial -- this may seem like smart investing. It was none other than master investor Peter Lynch who advised a generation of individual investors to strongly consider buying the stocks of companies with whose products they were familiar (the oft-quoted ""buy what you know""). But early investors in Snap's publicly listed shares have already experienced quite the ride. After spiking in its first days of trading as investors clamored for the shares, demand has declined and Snap is down more than 25% from its intraday high. Where does Snap go from here? I won't pretend to know. But no matter what happens next, beginner investors who bought shares of the company should be proud that they got started investing in stocks and -- provided they stick with it -- stand to learn a lot about investing. As for what those lessons will be, that's going to depend on whether or not Snap succeeds as an investment. Let's take a look at three potential lessons from two possible futures. From competition to questionable economics, there are a lot of forces working against Snap's success. But if there is something working for it, it's the obvious dedication and vision of co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel. While Spiegel is a somewhat controversial figure, it's clear from the company's prospectus that he has strong opinions about the future of Snap. From declaring that Snap is a camera company to being explicit about the company's willingness to take risks to build engaging products, this is not a company that it will inadvertently lose its strategic direction. In fact, in order to be sure that the direction of Snap is determined by Spiegel and Spiegel alone, the shares of stock that Snap sold to investors do not have any voting rights. That means shareholders can't weigh on management performance, the composition of the board, or even executive compensation. What's more, Spiegel continues to own nearly 20% of the company, giving him a vested interest in increasing the value of the firm. There is a tradition of visionary CEOs from Sam Walton to Steve Jobs to Jeff Bezos to Mark Zuckerberg who have seemingly willed their companies to greatness even when Wall Street didn't understand what those executives were trying to accomplish. If Snap succeeds from here, Spiegel is in a position to be added to that list and serve as another example that leadership is as fundamental to investing success as financials. Snap investors are undoubtedly feeling some anxiety around the company's recent 25% plunge. And regardless of whether Snap wins or loses for investors, investors should be prepared for frequent additional significant plunges. Consider, for example, Michael Batnicks' recent look at the performance of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) over time. He observes eloquently that ""Amazon's path to a 38,000% return was filled with heartache, despair, and nausea."" That's because it experienced a three-day 15% or more decline 107 different times.  Amazon, however, stayed focused on running its business, and Amazon investors who did the same have been handsomely rewarded for tolerating that volatility. The lesson for Snap investors is that even if the stock works out to be a fantastic, this won't be the only time you may feel sick to your stomach. Credit Suisse strategist Michael Mauboussin recently put out a paper on base rates -- a study of the frequency with which certain events actually happen. In the case of three-year sales growth, for example, he finds that while analysts forecast a fairly normal distribution of results, that forecast is far too narrow. There are fewer -10% to 10% growers than expected and more companies than forecast that experience sales declines or more than 10% or sales growth of greater than 10%. That's particularly true of companies that grow sales 45% annually over a given three-year period. While analysts expect zero companies to actually achieve this feat, Mauboussin found that this has happened about 2.5% of time (or 1,318 instances between 1950 to 2015). In 2016, Snap grew sales from $58.7 million to $404.5 million -- a 589% increase. No one is expecting this rate of growth to continue. But if it does, even at a substantially lower rate, Snap may exceed expectations just as Facebook has. Predicting growth, particularly when it comes to technology, is hard, and that can be an opportunity for investors. Snap is currently worth just under $30 billion. Today, an average company trades for approximately 25 times its annual earnings. Ergo, were Snap an average company, we would expect annual profits of $1.1 billion. But Snap is not an average company. I know this because Snap did not make $1.1 billion last year. Rather, it lost $514 million. Should a company that's losing half a billion dollars annually be worth $27.5 billion? Historically, the answer to that question has been ""no."" This is to say that Snap not only has to reverse those losses to justify its current valuation, but it has to make a lot of money in the future to not only maintain that valuation, but to cause it to increase (which is how investors will make money from here). If that doesn't happen, Snap shares may underperform even if the business continues to operate respectably.  That's what happens when investors overpay. Even if you believe Snap's visionary leadership sets it up for success, vision without accountability is a potentially dicey proposition -- and that's exactly what Snap has offered with the combination of founder control and non-voting shares. Consider, for example, the plight of overconfident CEOs (and categorizing Spiegel as overconfident does not seem unfair). Not only are overconfident CEOs more likely to destroy value with their investments, they are less likely to pay dividends to shareholders (meaning they retain more value to destroy) and are the most likely of all CEOs to misstate earnings results. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the mergers and acquisitions space, where 90% of deals fail to achieve pre-deal expectations. Repeat offenders in the tech space such as Yahoo! and HP continued for years to spend billions of shareholder dollars on acquisitions with little tangible benefit, and it's taken activist investors at each for management to sit up and take notice of their shortcomings. This cannot happen at Snap because investors have no say in how the business is run. If Snap fails from here, it may be because management is setting money on fire and no one can stop them. There's an obvious, but overlooked truth about initial public offerings, or IPOs. And that's that the company that's IPO-ing knows when it's going to happen. This is important because companies spend years preparing for their IPOs and they are often timed in such a way as to allow the company to put its best foot forward and realize the most favorable valuation from investors. For example, I mentioned earlier that Snap grew sales an eye-popping 589% last year. That's impressive, but it's not an accident. Snap likely focused on and spent heavily to achieve that sales growth knowing that that would be a metric valued by new investors. This is one of a number of reasons why recent IPOs are well-documented to on average underperform the market's return. Generally speaking, it's worth watching a newly public company for a period of time to see how it performs after the shine wears off and how management stands up to the new scrutiny of being public. But regardless of whether Snap is up, down, or sideways from, it should go without saying that you as an investor need to own more than just one stock. Doing so helps spread out the risk of one or more of your investments not living up to original expectations, whatever the reason. Achieving this diversification can be as easy as buying a low-cost index fund or getting into the habit of saving and regularly making new investments in stocks. Over time you should seek to build out an entire portfolio of investments to help you achieve your long-term financial goals. So congratulations if your investing journey has begun with an investment in Snap; it just shouldn't end there. ","
      
    So, You Bought Shares of Snap -- The Motley Fool

Selena Maranjian,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A recent study has estimated that $5.4 billion was left on the table by homeowners who didn't refinance their mortgages when they could have. The researchers found that, while most folks who could benefit did indeed refinance, about 20% did not. If you're carrying a mortgage, it's worth finding out whether you can save by refinancing. Refinancing is when you essentially trade in your current mortgage for a newer one -- ideally one with more attractive terms. The first loan gets paid off by the new one. Here are some steps you need to check before refinancing. They can help you think through and decide whether refinancing makes sense for you. Image source: Getty Images. First off, there's a rule of thumb that says, if current interest rates are at least about a percentage point higher than your current loan's rate, refinancing is likely to be worthwhile. Don't be rigid with the rule, but if the difference in rates is close to a whole percentage point, it's worth taking a closer look at refinancing. As an example, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was recently 4.32% --  up from 3.77% a year earlier. If your 30-year loan is carrying a rate of about 5.3% or more, refinancing is likely to make sense. A Bankrate.com mortgage calculator reveals that a standard $200,000 loan will sport monthly payments of $1,111 at an interest rate of 5.3%, but just $990 at 4.3%. That's a meaningful difference of $121 per month, or $1,452 per year. Image source: Getty Images. Another question to ask yourself is, how much equity do you have in your home? Lenders will generally require that you buy private mortgage insurance (PMI) if you don't have 20% equity. It's the same when you get an initial mortgage: If you pay less than 20% down, PMI is likely in the cards, adding to the expense of paying for your home. Even if you paid 20% down, though, if your home's value has fallen, your equity in it may no longer be 20%. (Indeed, some people are ""underwater"" on their loans -- meaning that they currently owe more than their homes are worth. That can make it hard to sell the home, and hard to refinance, too.) Next, consider how much overall debt you're carrying, from all sources -- such as your home loan, car loans, credit card debt, and so on. (Student loans can count, too, if they're not currently deferred.) Lenders don't want you to owe too much relative to your earnings, as that could make you a shakier borrower, so they pay close attention to your debt-to-income ratio. To calculate your debt-to-income ratio, divide the total of all your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. To qualify for most mortgages, you'll want your debt-to-income ratio to be no more than 43% -- and ideally, lower. Image source: Getty Images. Your debt-to-income ratio may have been fine when you originally bought your house, but if you have since taken on more debt, you may be a less promising borrower today. If so, it could be worth spending a little time paying down your debt before refinancing. Meanwhile, give your credit score a close look, too. In order to offer you their best rates, or at least good ones, lenders will generally like to see you with a score in the 700s -- and the higher, the better. To see just how much your credit score matters, the table below reflects recent rates for someone borrowing $200,000 via a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage: FICO Score APR Monthly Payment Total Interest Paid 760-850 3.904% $944 $139,766 700-759 4.126% $969 $148,990 680-699 4.303% $990 $156,434 660-679 4.517% $1,015 $165,541 640-659 4.947% $1,067 $184,183 620-639 5.493% $1,135 $208,492 Source: MyFICO.com, as of early March 2017. If your score was on the poor side when you initially got your mortgage, and you've improved it since then -- perhaps by paying off lots of bills on time, or paying off costly credit card debt in order to reduce your debt-to-income ratio -- you may be able to refinance at a meaningfully lower interest rate, even in an environment of rising rates. Image source: Getty Images. For example, if you started out with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), you may be facing gradually increasing interest rates over the coming years -- which will cost you more and more. You could refinance into a fixed-rate loan, locking in a low rate. (Even today's increased rates are historically very low.) Alternatively, you might switch from a 30-year fixed-rate loan to a 15-year fixed-rate loan, in order to pay the loan off sooner and pay much less in interest. It will likely entail higher monthly payments, though, so be sure you can swing those. If you're not very sure you can, there's a handy compromise: You could get a 30-year loan with no prepayment penalty and then pay significantly more than your required payment each month. That way, you can shave many years off the loan and avoid a lot of interest payments. If you're getting pre-approved for a mortgage or a refinancing, make sure that your new loan doesn't include a prepayment penalty. If you're already in a 30-year mortgage with no prepayment penalty, you may not need to refinance at all -- you can shorten the life of your loan by just plowing more money into paying down your principal. Meanwhile, if your current loan's monthly payments are too steep for you -- which might be the case if you have a 15-year mortgage now -- you might refinance into a fresh 30-year loan for the lower payments. Just know that that will be costing you a lot in interest over the long run, and that entering retirement with mortgage payments is not ideal. If you know now that you won't be in your current home more than a few more years, you might refinance from a fixed-rate loan into an ARM with lower rates. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, consider the closing costs, as refinancings feature them, too. Closing costs can amount to 2% to 5%, or more, of the value of the loan -- so if you're borrowing $200,000, you might be forking over $5,000 or more. To figure out when you'll break even, divide the closing costs by how much lower your monthly payment will be. If your costs are, say, $6,000, and you're saving $100 per month, divide $6,000 by $100, and you'll get 60. That means it will take 60 months (five years) before you'll break even. That's no problem if you expect to be in the home at least that long. But if you might be moving sooner than that, reconsider refinancing. Interest rates are inching up now -- but that doesn't mean it's too late for you to refinance your mortgage. Use the steps above to see whether you might be able to save a lot through refinancing.

    6 Steps to Check Before Refinancing Your Mortgage -- The Motley Fool

Danny Vena,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Home automation is a growing trend with its roots in decades old wired technology. It is quickly becoming a child of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. While many of its components still host wired connections like their ancestors, much of the recent innovation is linked via AI-based virtual assistants. Here's a look at some of the ways you can invest in this nascent technology. Investors looking for a pure-play in the growing trend of home automation need look no further than Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ:CTRL), the industry-leading provider of automation and control solutions for the connected home or business. This is an extremely small company, with a market capitalization of about $365 million, so investors should expect some share price volatility that is often associated with small market cap companies. Its professional systems are installed during the initial homebuilding or can be part of a retrofit. It provides homeowners with a growing number of options for automation including communication, entertainment, security, lighting, and temperature control. Products can be connected via a central network and the system can integrate over 10,000 third-party product choices. The home automation segment is forecast to grow. Image source: Getty Images. Control4 has been exhibiting massive growth. In its most recent quarter the company produced revenue of $57.4 million, up 34% over the prior year quarter, and earnings of $0.16 per share compared to a loss of ($0.03) year over year. The company has been increasing its sales and marketing efforts, which appears to be paying off. Control4 continues to expand its base of dealers in both its domestic and international markets. Early last year, it acquired Pakedge Networking and is continuing to roll this product out among its dealer base. The inclusion of an organic networking solution will drive revenue and increase customer satisfaction, by more quickly identifying issues in customer networks. The company is also expanding its addressable market by providing lower priced options for middle income homeowners. Investors looking for a more diversified offering have numerous options. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a top choice in the managed services segment of the market. While nested in the company's security service, it also provides lighting and environment controls. Investors will no doubt be familiar with Comcast's cable and broadband services, which provides the company with the advantage of controlling the network. Comcast has grown both revenue and earnings consistently over the last five years, and the stock has increased 156% to the S&P's 75% over the same time. The home automation Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Market offers a multitude of options. The list of products in the segment is extensive and range from lighting, thermostats, cleaning products, and many more. Some of the biggest names in technology provide artificial intelligence-based virtual assistants that can act as the controller for your DIY system and a gateway investment in the category. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa, Alphabet's Google Assistant and Apple's Siri virtual assistants will integrate with a plethora of devices. The development of the smart-speaker system controlled by these virtual assistants will likely prove to be the tipping point in the DIY segment. Amazon's Echo, powered by Alexa, currently boasts more 7,000 third party skills.  While not all these skills are related to home automation, it does provide an indication of just how much of a lead Amazon possesses in the area. Google Assistant, which is integrated into most Google hardware, is the smarts behind its Home smart speaker. These companies are major players in big tech, with any income from home automation barely making a dent in their overall revenue. Each is making a play for the control of your in-home ecosystem. By becoming a one-stop shop, and having an assistant become a virtual presence in your home, each company hopes that this will lead to a greater share of your consumer dollars. ^SPX data by YCharts Each of these companies represents a solid way to invest in the home automation segment, offering pure play, or diversified options. This is an emerging technology that bears watching, as investments will evolve over time. Now how can I automate making my bed? ","

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos is on a winning streak. Jeff Bezos dreams of package deliveries to space. Image source: Blue Origin. In the nearest term, Blue Origin's New Shepard suborbital rocket, powered by the liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen BE-3 engine that it built in-house, is preparing to carry human tourists to the edge of space. Flight safety tests are ongoing, and if the company holds true to its plans, paying passengers could begin visiting space aboard New Shepard as soon as next year. Last year, Blue Origin broke ground on a massive new rocket factory in Florida, which will build the rockets to take them there. Getting to the Moon could be done with Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket, now under development. Alternatively, says Bezos, ""our architecture can fly on top of SLS"" that Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) are building for NASA, ""or it can fly on top of the [smaller] Atlas 551 and deliver a more modest payload to the surface of the Moon."" Either way, Blue Origin believes it can have a ""Blue Moon"" lander (based on New Shepard's vertical-landing technology) ready and able to begin moon landings as early as July 2020. Incidentally, Bezos argues that such a lunar settlement is a necessary precursor to the manned Mars mission that NASA is planning to conduct circa 2034: ""I think that if you go to the Moon first and make the Moon your home, then you can get to Mars more easily."" And what comes after that? Like his competitor Elon Musk at SpaceX, Bezos believes that reusability ""is a key"" to commercializing space. As Bezos explains, ""The reason that Amazon has succeeded is ... because so many thousands of start-up companies can participate. That's because the cost of [participating in the internet economy] is very low."" But now, Bezos wants  to use Blue Origin to do to space exploration what he's already done to package delivery with Amazon. The trouble with space travel, Bezos explains, is that ""the cost of admission ... is quite high.... So very few experiments get done."" The cost of the fuel needed to reach orbit (or even the Moon) is ""trivially small,"" says Bezos -- about $0.10 per pound, or a few hundred thousand dollars per launch. The real reason space is so expensive, therefore, is that the spacecraft that burns the fuel is an expensive piece of hardware that's thrown away after every mission. Like Musk at SpaceX, Bezos believes that developing reusable spacecraft that can launch and land -- on Earth, on the Moon, or elsewhere -- will permit companies to cut out the cost of expendable spacecraft, and pay mainly for the ""trivial"" cost of fuel when traveling to space. This will lower the cost of space launches, and permit more start-up companies to launch cheaper things, and experiment with space travel. And Bezos believes this is essential. Laying out the math, he suggests one take the current energy usage on Earth, and grow it just a few percentage points per year to account for population growth and rising standards of living. In just a few hundred years, says Bezos, the entire land surface of the Earth will need to be covered in solar panels to meet our energy needs. Because this is obviously impractical, Bezos believes that energy-intensive manufacturing will ultimately need to be conducted in space, where resources are abundant and solar power is available 24/7, with no clouds or weather to muck up the process. (NASA may agree. Already, it's cooperating with Made in Space to prototype and test systems for additive manufacturing -- aka 3D printing -- in orbit, including aboard the International Space Station.) Fifty-plus years from now, says Bezos, Earth will be ""zoned residential and light industrial,"" and essentially all of our heavy manufacturing will be done in space. Bezos believes this so-called ""Great Inversion"" is the future for Mankind. And with New Shepard, New Glenn, and soon Blue Moon, he's helping to make it so. ","

Executive memberships will now cost $120, up from $110. But with that increase, Costco is also raising its maximum annual 2% reward to $1,000 from $750 for that membership. This is the first time Costco has increased its membership since 2011. The increase shouldn’t be a problem for the most diehard Costco customers, said Sucharita Mulpuru, chief retail strategist at Shoptalk, which hosts commerce events. The shopper who could afford the former $55 annual fee and the average cost of a Costco basket at check-out is already an affluent customer, she said. “These are customers who will pay $5 for a latte and not think twice about it,” she said. “I just don’t think they’ll drop their Costco membership because of this modest price increase.” (Costco said the price increase will affect about 35 million members. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Many shoppers, particularly those with large families, are likely to save enough over the course of a year to offset the $60 cost, said Courtney Jespersen, a retail expert at the personal finance company NerdWallet. For instance, Costco offers significant discounts on its pharmacy items for members, said Brent Shelton, an online shopping expert at deal aggregator FatWallet.com. (Sam’s Club also has a pharmacy for its members with about the same discounts as Costco’s, but membership for that program costs $100 per year.) “If you or your family are in a position that you require a lot of prescription medicines, then a Costco membership can be one of the most valuable investments you’ll make,” Jespersen said, noting that even with insurance, not all prescriptions are covered for consumers. Diapers, wipes and formula are some of the other products that prove most cost-effective, and bulk-buying obviously means parents need to take fewer trips to the store. Costco also offers items other big-box stores do not, including gasoline, and even car rental discounts and vacation packages through Costco Travel, which is available to all members, Shelton said. Tires, wine, movie tickets, Nutella, gift cards, Extra Virgin olive oil and pure vanilla extract are some of the best deals at Costco, said Kyle James, the founder of the coupon and deal-finding site Rather-Be-Shopping.com. Others say shoppers who might already have been on the fence about whether their membership might want reevaluate, Jespersen added. After the price increase, Costco will be $15 more than rival $45 Sam’s Club’s standard membership (which doesn’t include the pharmacy discounts) and $10 more than the $50 membership at BJ’s stores. Sam’s Club online also has a partnership with the cash-back site Ebates, offering shoppers 1.5% cash back, whereas Costco does not participate in that program, Shelton said. If shoppers aren’t going to use Costco as their primary store, “You may want to think twice if you’re going to get the value back out of it,” Jespersen said.

And not everything you buy at Costco or other warehouse stores will necessarily be cheaper, despite the reputation for low-cost prices, MarketWatch reported last year. Meats, such as bacon and chicken breasts, are often great buys at warehouse clubs (freeze whatever you don’t use), as are some kitchen appliances, but books, compact discs, and DVDs are often cheaper online; and condiments and perishables will obviously spoil if you don’t use them early. With or without memberships, some studies show that when you spend time in stores and touch the products, you are actually more likely to buy them. Merely touching an object results in an increase in perceived ownership of that object, one University of California, Los Angeles study found. “If you think everything’s a good deal, you might be tempted to overspend,” Jespersen said. And Costco isn’t the only retailer that offers deals, so consumers would likely benefit by shopping around before making a significant purchase, Jepsen added. And fewer people appear to be want to visit standalone big box retail stores, a December 2016 report by consulting firm Deloitte found. The number of those who said they planned to shop at big box stores during the 2016 holidays fell to 59% from 63%. And it’s not just big box stores: Those who plan to visit traditional malls fell to 50% from 53% over the same period. “Online shoppers are not just browsing either,” the report said. Those polled said they plan to spend just as much online as they do in physical stores. Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

William Cohan,03092017,MarketWatch,03022017,"Published: Mar 4, 2017 3:36 p.m. ET The left has gone too far in its attacks on Wall Street, says William Cohan By I am a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts and would have voted for George McGovern for president in 1972 if I hadn’t been 12 years old at the time. I have never voted for a Republican in my life and most certainly didn't start this past November. I have very little respect for Donald Trump as a businessman and even less for him as a politician. I remain positively mystified about how enough of my fellow Americans in the right combination of Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin could have voted for a man so temperamentally and intellectually ill-suited for the job of president of the United States. But — and it pains me to write this — as wrongheaded as I think Trump has been about nearly everything he has done in his first five weeks in the Oval Office, there is one huge thing he has been right about: Wall Street. He is absolutely correct to seek to change the onerous financial regulations that have reigned down on both the big Wall Street banks and the smaller, more local banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. And it is on this foundational, fundamental issue that my like-minded liberals are dead wrong. They’d like to impose more regulations on Wall Street. Big mistake. They’d like to break up the big Wall Street banks, and had even introduced legislation is recent years to do just — and that would even more wrong. They have argued that anyone who has ever worked on Wall Street should not be allowed to work in Washington — mind-boggling pigheaded and downright discriminatory. Liberals find every aspect of Trump’s policy repugnant, and I get that. He is repugnant. But he is largely right about how to reform finance and Wall Street, whether most liberals care to admit that or not. We’ve got to have a fact-based understanding of what Wall Street is and what it does. Think of it — and banks generally — as the magnificent engine of capitalism, taking money from people who want to save it or to invest it — bank depositors — and allocating it at a competitive price to those who want it or need it to start, to grow, or to nurture businesses around the world, and that provide so many of us the jobs and the incomes we need and want to live better, more fulfilling lives. It is the envy of the world, and one that has made the United States the dominant economic power in the past century. You may think the banks are evil, but I bet you like your iPhone. You probably like your mortgage, your 401(k), your car, your widescreen TV and Facebook too. If you do, you like what Wall Street does, and you should want it to succeed. But in the wake of the financial crisis, Washington politicians and regulators threw sand into the gears of the beautiful machine. It was an understandable populist reaction to the real pain and suffering that Wall Street, in large part, had caused the American people by packaging up shoddy mortgages and then selling them off around the world as AAA-rated investments, even though many bankers knew that they weren’t. That was wrong. That bad behavior should have been prosecuted by Eric Holder’s Justice Department, but it wasn’t, not in a way that gave a measure of satisfaction to the American people that bad behavior wouldn't go unpunished. We needed accountability for the wrongdoing that bankers and traders perpetrated but instead we got market-crushing bureaucracy designed to turn banks into utilities. But, of course, banks are not utilities, and shouldn’t be treated or regulated as ones. Supplying capital to those who want it is not the same as supplying electricity. Banks need to take risks — hopefully prudent ones — in order to nurture the next Apple, Google, Microsoft or General Electric when they come along. Reducing overly burdensome regulations on banks will get them lending again to the next batch of American companies that have the potential to change the world. Rewarding bankers, traders and executives to take smart risks, while punishing them when they mess up, will also help our economy grow quickly. Trump is right that there should be an intelligent, well-considered reform of the onerous provisions of the rules and regulations imposed on banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank law, passed in 2010 to re-regulate banks, runs to more than 800 pages and is nearly opaque. More than additional 20,000 pages of rules and regulations have followed in its wake. Most people are clueless about what this mountain of paper requires banks to do. Some of it — that which requires higher capital requirements for big banks, less leverage, that derivatives to be traded on exchanges, even the much-maligned Consumer Protection Financial Bureau — is worthwhile and should be retained. But much of the law, and its various still-unfulfilled mandates, should be tossed out. Investors in the equity markets seem to be heartened — euphoric even — about the overhaul of financial regulation that Trump has promised. Since his unexpected election victory, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has soared, and is now past 21,000, after being stuck around 17,500 for the last years of the Obama administration. More than $2.5 trillion of paper wealth has been created for people invested in the U.S. stock markets. Whether the upward movement in stocks can be sustained remains to be seen, of course, but at least in this one isolated but highly important aspect — reducing regulation on Wall Street — the otherwise utterly irresponsible Trump administration is onto something.

Quentin Fottrell,03092017,MarketWatch,03022017,"Published: Mar 2, 2017 4:59 p.m. ET Take a deep breath when you come face-to-face with the company head By The chief executive of Uber gets into an Uber… It sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, but that’s what happened to Travis Kalanick, the chief executive and co-founder of Uber Technologies Inc. He took an Uber with friends on Feb. 5 and got into a shouting match with the driver over his company’s policies. The argument was captured on the dash cam of Uber driver Fawzi Kamel in San Francisco. In it, Kamel complains about how Uber’s lower fares have hurt his income. “I lost money — $7,000 — because of you,” Kamel said. “I’m bankrupt because of you.” Kalanick shot back: “Bulls—! …Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own s—.” On Tuesday evening, Kalanick apologized for his behavior and said he needed to “grow up.” (You can view the video here.) Clearly, there are no winners in this particular situation, but it raises an important question: What do you do if you have complaints about your company and you find yourself face-to-face with your boss in a café, elevator or even an Uber? “We should all have an elevator speech ready for our executives or our boss,” says Tim Sackett, president of HRU Technical Resources, an information technology and engineering staffing firm in Lansing, Mich. But the employee should have a statement or question that requires an answer. Or, even better, an idea. “Have you ever thought of…?” It should be an idea or question that can be answered fairly, yet in a way that positions you as someone who wants to be a part of the solution. “That answer will set you up for future success,” he says. Don’t miss: ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ tackled workplace sexual harassment And if you see a big problem in the company, whether it’s one of policy or culture, tell the truth. Remember that scene in “Working Girl” where Melanie Griffith’s character (Tess) proves that she came up with the idea for a company merger? She took her moment and, in this context at least, gave her character Tess her Hollywood ending. Before that, of course, she crashed a society wedding and pitched the idea to the head of a fictional company. (Not to be recommended.) Real life is rarely so simple, but there’s a lesson in that confident and opportunistic approach, says Steve Langerud, workplace consultant and principal of Steve Langerud & Associates in Grinnell, Iowa. “Be clear, factual and solution-oriented,” he says. And brief. There may be less than a minute before one of you has to go. “If you had the CEO in an elevator use a simple structure to think about what you would start, stop, and continue doing to help the organization succeed.” It could be explaining a big idea, as Tess did in the movie, or it could be a valuable piece of advice, framed as a compliment rather than a criticism. “The Uber employee was right to share his experience. Bosses want to be successful and improve. Hearing from employees and customers downstream from decisions is critical to tweaking performance. This was a great opportunity for Uber that went south.” Also read:  From the Oscars to the Oval Office, tweeting and texting at work is catching flak “All CEOs want to hear what’s really going on in their companies, because they mostly get watered down, filtered versions from those who report to them directly,” Sackett says. “If we know this, the Uber driver might have gained favor and more time if he would have said, ‘I have some feedback I would really like to share with you directly on my experience as a driver.’” And if the conversation goes well, Sackett says, you could finish up with, “Can you give me a way to connect with you at a time when you’re ready to talk business?” Of course, having a conversation when either party is in a relaxed social setting or at the end of a long night may not be appropriate. “Employees should have a voice and I admire employees who have the courage to speak up,” says New York-based work place expert and digital marketer Piera Palazzolo. “However, if you want to have a fruitful exchange, you shouldn’t start by accusing someone. You immediately put the person on the defensive and they might stop listening. Now, while the driver embarrassed the CEO, I’m not sure he got his real message across.” Either way, she says, don’t wait until tomorrow to say what you want to say. Make the most of that moment, whether you’re in an Uber or standing by the water cooler. “Speaking out is always a good idea,” Palazzolo says. “But how you do it is key.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

                                    successful initial public offering, in which the shares closed up 44% on their first day of trading, was the rally’s exclamation point. We all know why that’s happened: Investors expect the Trump administration and Congress to slash regulations, cut taxes and perhaps enact a big infrastructure-building plan. That’s added fuel to an already growing economy and lifted business and consumer confidence. It’s also boosted the confidence of individual investors, who had sat out much of the eight-year-old bull market. Wall Street led the charge early on, but now retail investors are back in force. On Saturday, The Wall Street Journal reported that individual investors are snapping up stock exchange-traded funds “at a record-breaking pace,” pouring around $124 billion into ETFs so far this year. Retail investors accounted for 85% of the inflows into BlackRock’s iShares ETFs. “The retail investor is leading the way this year,” a BlackRock official told the Journal. And though no one states their political preferences when buying ETFs (thank God!), I’ll bet Republicans and Trump supporters, many of whom shied away from stocks during the “Obama bull market” that took the Dow from just under 8,000 to almost 20,000, are now jumping in with both feet. This column first highlighted the trend late last year. Three polls taken back in December bear it out: •The CNBC All-America Economic Survey indicated that 42% of Americans expected the economy to improve in 2017, a substantial jump and the highest percentage of optimists since 2008. That, however, was “powered by Republicans and independents,” CNBC’s Steve Liesman reported. Some 74% of Republicans said the economy would improve in 2017, compared with only 15% the previous year. Republicans also “grew significantly more optimistic” on the stock market, Liesman wrote. •A Bloomberg National Poll found 54% of Americans were bullish on the U.S. stock market for 2017. “More than three-quarters of those who voted for Trump say U.S. equities will be at higher levels at the end of 2017, while only about a third of those who voted for Clinton think so,” Bloomberg reported. •The Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index hit +96 in the fourth quarter, its highest point since January 2007. “Investor confidence zoomed 155 points in the post-election poll among investors who identify as Republican, from an index score of 0 in the third quarter,” according to Gallup. That’s zero, folks, with an “o.” “Conversely, Democrats’ confidence fell by nearly as much, from +174 to +25.” Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I rest my case. Many conservatives and Republicans have avoided stocks for years, worried about the debt, the Federal Reserve’s “money printing,” the dollar as “fiat money,” etc., etc. “For the past eight years, questions about how the economy is doing have been driven by partisan views. Republicans were all but in denial about job growth and improvement in the stock market,” pollster J. Ann Selzer told Bloomberg. Instead, they kept their money in banks or their mattresses or took much too seriously the ads for precious metals on conservative talk radio. This doom-and-gloom investing had a huge opportunity cost: While cash earned nothing and gold was mired in a secular bear market, stocks gained around 150% during the Obama years, replenishing retirement accounts and then some. Fidelity’s 401(k) balances, for example, are at record levels. According to the Federal Reserve, Americans held $11.3 trillion in savings and checking accounts as of the third quarter of 2016. The Investment Company Institute reported that as of March 1, retail investors had nearly $1 trillion in money-market funds. That’s a lot of cash that could be put to work. I’m still bullish on stocks and the economy, but risk is rising that ebullient investors will be disappointed if President Trump’s agenda gets stalled in Congress or if his administration gets hopelessly bogged down in Russia-related investigations and tweet storms. Conservatives and Republicans are finally going all-in on a market they boycotted during the Obama years. That has added fuel to the rally’s fire. But it may eventually push this bull market into its final euphoric stage, when the greater fools finally come off the sidelines just in time to get their clocks cleaned. Howard R.

                                   and let them down? The answer: Snap will be somewhere in between, but it’s going to be lot more like Facebook than Twitter. This means if you weren’t among the privileged few to get in on the Snap IPO, it’s worth watching the stock for the buyable pullbacks that are very likely to play out — just as they did with Facebook and for similar reasons. Read: Snap shares soar in debut after largest IPO since 2014 But first, let’s look at three reasons why Snap will treat investors more like Facebook than Twitter. 1. Snapchat is rolling out ads without killing off robust user growth It’s no surprise that Snap followed the tried-and-true social media business strategy with Snapchat: First roll out a cool platform that’s free, to get people hooked. Then monetize. Of course, whenever an internet service is “free,” it really just means that users are the product. But thanks to cool features like lenses, geofilters and bitmojis that add effects for better personalized expression, Snapchat users don’t seem to mind this arrangement. They also like the disappearing pictures and video. As with normal conversation, knowing that what you say won’t be archived forever online promotes some refreshing spontaneity. This is why about 158 million people now use Snapchat every day. That’s pretty good for a company launched only a few years ago. Users visit the app more than 18 times a day. They spend a half-hour a day there on average. And they send over 2.5 billion snaps a day. For many users, Snapchat “Stories,” which are mini-timelines posted by friends, are the first stop of the day online. These are impressive metrics. The key is whether all those users stick around as they get “monetized” — or as Snapchat rolls out ads. That’s happening right now, and the early signs are good. This tells us Snapchat will be a lot more like Facebook than Twitter. Here are some numbers that back this up. Last year was the first big “monetization” year for Snapchat and its parent. We know this because revenue ramped sharply — about sixfold to $404 million from $59 million. Yet this didn’t kill user growth. Quite the opposite. Growth actually increased, despite the arrival of ads. In the first three quarters of 2016 — the first year of serious monetization — daily active user growth over the year before was 52%, 65% and 62%. That’s more than the roughly 50% growth in each the last three quarters of 2015. In short, this tells us that, at least so far, users aren't alienated by ads. “During Twitter’s stumble, Snapchat accelerated its user and revenue growth. They are experiencing astronomical growth,” says Matthew Kennedy, an analyst with Renaissance Capital, which manages the Renaissance IPO ETF 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    IPO, -3.18%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                   “Snapchat has already proven it can grow and compete with the established players.” This helps explain why Snap was able to price its IPO at $17, a dollar above the indicated range. “There has been a scarcity of these kinds of deals,” says Kennedy. It’s true that fourth-quarter 2016 user growth was a little softer at 48%. But Snap blames this on technical problems with a wave of updates on its Android platform. The slight slowdown could also be the effect of the law of large numbers. As the user base grows, Snap has to add a lot more to get the same percentage gain. Make no mistake, though, the wheel is still in spin for Snap. It has a long way to go in “monetization” to join the big leagues. Snapchat gets $1.05 in revenue per user a quarter compared to over $7 at Facebook, notes Renaissance Capital. But the company is still in the early stages of the monetization game. And it does have some advantages. One is that a lot of its ads are unobtrusive, in the sense that users basically opt in. Snap, for example, lets companies sponsor “creative tools” like lenses and geofilters, the features that let users add artwork to pictures and video. Snap says this helps advertisers because it means its users audience engages with ad campaigns during the “creative process,” making ads an “organic part of the snaps they send to their friends.” That sounds like investment banker-speak, but Snap offers some proof of this. To promote “X-Men: Apocalypse,” 20th Century Fox ran a sponsored lens campaign that let users turn themselves into characters from the movie. In one day, people spend a collective 56 years playing with these sponsored lenses. Putting aside what their bosses, parents and significant others thought about this, the campaign sparked a 13-percentage-point increase in brand awareness. That’s seven times the norm for mobile-based ads, according to a study by the ad agency Millward Brown. The campaign also drove up interest in watching the move in a theater by more than three times the amount of a typical mobile ad. And while Snapchat makes a big deal out of respecting user privacy, the reality is it’s watching users closely because it wants to insert ads in the right context. Advertising is more effective “when paired with the right contextual understanding,” says the company. “Smartphones can achieve this because they are personal in a way that other forms of media will never be — we eat, sleep, and poop with our smartphones every day.” Does this mean Snapchat knows when you are on the toilet? I doubt it and I hope not. But the company says it has proof that it’s getting, um, “context” right. About 88% of users who saw an ad campaign for men’s deodorant were in the target audience of males between the ages of 13 and 34, according to a study by Millward Brown. Of course, questions remain about whether Snap can hold on to its youthful audience as it expands into an older demographic. Many young Facebook users fled to Instagram and Snapchat as their parents joined. But some early signals are promising. About half of all smartphone users in Norway still use Snapchat, even though about 46% of those users are now over 35. 2. Like Facebook, Snapchat will remain founder-run Snapchat is getting a lot of bad press because co-founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy will keep most of the voting power. They control the entire C share class of stock, which gives them 10 votes a share. The A shares, the stock offered in the IPO, have nada. No votes. (B shares issued to some early investors have one vote.) This gives the co-founders 88.5% of the voting power. Lowly investors who buy on the IPO have no influence at all. Read: Snap IPO boils down to one question: Do you trust Evan Spiegel? Rather than kvetch, though, investors need to embrace this and recognize it for the positive that it really is. I like democracy as much as anyone, but the truth is that founder-run companies typically outperform for two reasons. One is that founders are imbued with entrepreneurial spirit. Their drive to innovate and win remains, no matter how much money they make. Second, when founders control all the votes, they don’t have to obsess as much about short-term quarterly results. Companies that hand over voting power to the public have to worry about quarterly results, for fear of being ousted by activists if they don't satisfy. This set up gives shareholders some influence. But it can hurt investors because it means managers may be forced to focus on the short term at the expense of long-term strategic thinking. The downside here for investors is that in business — as in life — the biggest rewards often go to those who focus on long-term strategic goals over short-term gratification. Remember the marshmallow experiment? There’s good news in this for anyone who couldn’t get IPO shares at $17 because they aren’t favored clients at Goldman Sachs

The good news is that it’s pretty likely that Spiegel and Murphy may post at least a few “disappointing” quarters because they are reinvesting cash — as opposed to putting it toward earnings to satisfy investors with their short-term focus. The founders even tell you this will likely be the case. “Our strategy is to invest in product innovation and take risks to improve our camera platform,” they say in filings. “While not all of our investments will pay off in the long run, we are willing to take risks in an attempt to create the best and most differentiated products on the market.” I say go for it. Invest and create a better company. That’s what you do best as founders. In fact, this is another reason why it often pays to invest in founder run companies. Founders have the vision and long-range strategic thinking that pays off for patient investors. But all of this means that there may well be buyable Snapchat selloffs along the way as the founders chose to reinvest cash rather than report earnings, and investors get fed up with this and sell. This happened with other high profile founder-run companies like Facebook, Alphabet

Since those points in time, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon.com are all up four to nine times. So this is a dynamic worth watching at founder run companies. 3. Snapchat is a major player in a big trend One of the best ways to make money in stocks is to invest in a megatrend. Snapchat clearly fits the bill. It’s a pure play on mobile advertising, which will continue to win out over steadily declining TV advertising. Mobile advertising will probably grow threefold to $196 billion in 2020 from $66 billion last year, says Snapchat’s parent. One of the major factors here “is the shift of people’s attention from their televisions to their mobile phones,” says the company. “This trend is particularly pronounced among the younger demographic, where our daily active users tend to be concentrated.” Citing stats from Nielsen, the company says people age 18-24 spent 35% less time watching TV last year than they did in 2010. This is a trend that’s likely to continue, so it’s a tailwind that makes it much easier for Snap to succeed. “They are definitely in the right space,” says Kennedy, at Renaissance Capital. Michael Brush is a Manhattan-based financial writer. At the time of publication, he had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. Brush has suggested FB, GOOGL, AMZN and JPM in his stock newsletter Brush Up on Stocks. ",Here’s why Snap will reward investors like Facebook — instead of failing them like Twitter - MarketWatch
Bill Bischoff,03092017,MarketWatch,03022017,"Published: Mar 9, 2017 2:38 p.m. ET By They’re both too high, right? But your debts may actually help keep the evil twin at bay. Why? At least some of that interest you shovel out each month is probably tax-deductible. Back in “the good old days,” taxpayers were allowed to deduct all their interest charges, even credit-card bills for vacations, Armani suits and movie tickets. Then, Congress caught on. Now the Tax Code permits deductions only for certain varieties of interest. This makes debt management more important than ever, because you are basically penalized by the IRS whenever you have interest that falls into the nondeductible category. Here’s a quick summary on when you get a tax break for borrowing and when you don’t. Home-mortgage interest You are allowed an itemized deduction for interest on up to $1 million worth of mortgages used to acquire or improve your main personal residence and one other home. Mortgage interest on your third personal residence and beyond is considered a nondeductible personal expense. So the tax-wise debt-management trick here is to: (1) make sure you don’t have over $1 million in mortgage debt and (2) pay cash for your third, fourth and fifth homes. We should all have such financial challenges. Interest on home-equity loan You are also allowed to claim an itemized deduction for interest on home-equity loans totaling up to $100,000, regardless of how you use the loan proceeds. The $100,000 figure is above and beyond the $1 million limit explained above. So you can actually have up to $1.1 million of debt against your first and second homes and still deduct the interest. Warning: interest on home-equity loans is deductible for alternative minimum tax (AMT) purposes only if you use the proceeds to acquire, construct or improve a first or second residence. So if you are in the AMT mode, you should understand that you may not get any tax benefit if you take out a $75,000 home-equity loan to buy a BMW and pay for your kid’s braces. On the other hand, if you spend the $75,000 to put in a swimming pool and spa alongside your house, you can deduct the interest under both the regular tax and AMT rules. Does this make any sense? Of course not, but Congress doesn’t ask for our input on tax legislation. Interest on vacation homes For most people, the vacation home is the second home and the mortgage interest will turn out to be deductible under the rules explained earlier. However, when you rent the property part of the time, the tax rules get very tricky. Nevertheless, you will usually be able to deduct all of the interest or nearly so. Investment interest When you borrow money and use the proceeds to buy taxable investment assets, the resulting interest is called investment-interest expense. The most common example: interest on broker-margin accounts. You can deduct investment interest to the extent of your taxable investment income—from interest, short-term capital gains, certain royalties and the like. If you don’t have enough investment income, the excess interest expense gets carried over to the following tax year. Hopefully, you’ll have enough investment income in that year to claim your write-off. If not, the carry-over procedure happens all over again. And so on and so on. You can also choose to treat all or part of your long-term capital gains and qualified dividends as investment income. The upside of making this choice is it allows you to currently deduct more of your investment-interest expense. The downside is the amount of long-term gains and dividends treated as investment income gets taxed at your regular rate (which can be as high as 39.6%) instead of the normal rate of 15% or 20%. (Note that these rates may change for 2017 and beyond if President Trump’s tax proposals become law.) If you have investment interest, complete IRS Form 4952 (Investment Interest Expense Deduction) to calculate your write-off. You also use this form to indicate how much of your long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, if any, you want treated as investment income. What about interest on loans used to purchase nontaxable investments, like municipal bonds or muni-bond funds? Nondeductible. Logically enough, the government won’t let you write off interest on debts used to generate income that goes untaxed. So if your investing strategy calls for some borrowing, the tax-wise trick is to spend the debt proceeds to buy taxable investments and use cash to pay for the nontaxable ones. College-loan interest Not too long ago, Congress finally gave us a much-needed tax break for up to $2,500 of annual interest on loans used to pay for college. But the deduction comes with limitations, and high-income types won’t be eligible (surprise). If you fall into the ineligible category, consider taking out a home-equity loan instead. You have a decent shot at being able to deduct the interest, as explained above. Interest on 401(k) loans This is generally nondeductible regardless of how you use the money. Sorry. But this is not really so bad, because you are basically paying interest to yourself. The potential downside of tapping this particular line of credit is that you must immediately repay the loan if you leave the company. If you don’t, you’ll be taxed as if you received a distribution equal to the loan balance. When this happens before age 59 1/2, you will generally be tagged with a 10% penalty tax to boot. So you generally shouldn’t even think about taking out a 401(k) loan unless you are darn sure you’ll be able to pay it back on time and in full. Interest on car loans, credit cards and other ‘consumer debt’ Unless you are borrowing to finance a business expenditure—like a car used in your sole-proprietorship business—you can generally forget about any tax breaks. This is why it’s often advisable to take out a home-equity loan and use the money to pay off credit-card balances and car loans. You may be able to convert high nondeductible interest charges into relatively low interest charges that are fully deductible. If so, this procedure is an excellent debt-management scheme. Just make sure you read the earlier caveats about the deductibility issue. Business interest What happens when you borrow money and use it to finance your small business? The interest is generally fully deductible just like any other garden-variety business expense. Before you jump for joy at the apparent simplicity of the preceding sentence, be warned that the IRS has a complicated set of rules which basically require you to trace the debt proceeds to business uses. If this affects you, be sure to schedule a chat with your tax accountant to talk about what exactly is needed to lock in your write-offs. This story has been updated.

                                   fell more than 12% on Monday, reversing two straight sessions of upswings since its market debut. The selloff followed two more bearish initiations on Wall Street, adding to several others that have emerged in the past few days claiming the stock is overvalued. Needham analyst Laura Martin initiated coverage on the stock with an underperform rating, which is the equivalent of sell, and a fair value price target range of $19 to $23 a share. She expressed concern that Snap stock could suffer through at least 2019, plagued by decelerating user growth and huge losses that could weigh on its fair value even if sales increase. Also Read: How Snap stacks up against Facebook and Twitter “The sexier and more glamorous a company’s IPO, the more likely it is to be overpriced at its IPO date and to suffer meaningful downwards earnings and valuation revisions in the first 8 quarters after it goes public,” said Martin, citing “academic literature.” CFRA Research analyst Scott Kessler initiated coverage with a sell rating and $22 target. A number of analysts in recent days have expressed concern that Snap stock is overvalued, particularly when it was trading well above its IPO price in the high-$20s range. The average rating on the stock among a poll of six analysts surveyed by FactSet is the equivalent to sell, while the average price target is $16.50, below Snap’s IPO price. Snap stock closed at $27.09 on Friday after pricing in its market debut at $17 the day earlier. It ended at $23.77 on Monday. In a note to clients that went out Monday morning, Needham’s Martin referred to Snap as a “lottery-like stock,” which at first glance may look like a good buy. However, closer scrutiny of its fundamentals reveal a different story plagued with risks, she said. Among those risks is slowing user growth, which is exacerbated by the fact that Snapchat has a total addressable market that is 80% smaller than Facebook Inc.’s

                                   according to Needham’s calculations. Facebook, which recently rolled out a Snapchat-like ephemeral photo-sharing service called Instagram Stories, offered to buy Snapchat in 2013 for $3 billion. Its rival Snapchat service, launched this past summer, has been credited for a deceleration in Snapchat’s user base. “We see strong user engagement, but user growth that has decelerated,” said Kessler, who cited similar reasons for his sell rating. Revenue gains may be outpacing peers right now, but it faces much larger rivals, which becomes an issue as it tries to scale beyond a niche product, he said. Snapchat’s revenue growth might also be an issue. The company reported revenue of $463.1 million last year, up sharply from just $58.6 million in 2015 as it continued to increase its ad load. However, Needham’s 2017 revenue target of $3.3 billion for 2019 would require the company to have a 14% to 16% share of adjusted mobile or digital ad spending, while it had just a 2% share in 2016. Even if Snap does grow revenue by eightfold to meet that target, its share price could still decline when taking into account the enterprise value/sales ratios of digital-advertising leaders Facebook and Alphabet Inc.

                                   said Martin. Needham also believes there’s “no clear path to profitability before 2020.” Last year, Snap reported a loss of $514.6 million, compared with $372.9 million in 2015, which stemmed from higher costs of revenue. Snapchat, which has been referring to itself as a camera company in an effort to distance itself from its social media peers, was joined in Monday’s sea of red by GoPro Inc.

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"(Reuters) - A federal judge rejected Google’s proposed class-action settlement with non-Gmail users who said it illegally scanned their emails to Gmail users to create targeted advertising. In a decision on Wednesday night, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said it was unclear that the accord, which provided no money for plaintiffs but up to $2.2 million in fees and expenses for their lawyers, would ensure Google’s compliance with federal and state privacy laws. Koh called the proposed disclosure notice inadequate. She said this was because it did not clearly reveal any technical changes that Google would make, or that Google scans non-Gmail users’ emails to create ads for Gmail users. The judge also said the notice did not make clear that Google could still extract data for the “dual purpose” of creating targeted ads and detecting spam and malware, and then use that data once emails went into storage after being transmitted. “In sum, based on the parties’ current filings, the court cannot conclude that the settlement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable,” Koh wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, declined to comment. Koh distinguished the settlement from a similar accord with Yahoo Inc that she said required more disclosures. Michael Sobol, a partner at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein representing the plaintiffs, in an interview said, “we will press on with the litigation, while exploring opportunities for a resolution consistent with the court’s decision.” He said this could include an end to the challenged scanning. The named plaintiffs, Daniel Matera of New York and Susan Rashkis of San Francisco, had accused Google of violating the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California Invasion of Privacy Act through its scanning practices. Koh ruled six days after Google won preliminary approval from a different judge in her court of a separate $22.5 million settlement with businesses over internet ad placements. In that case, known as Google AdWords Litigation, businesses accused Google of placing their ads in obscure places such as error pages and undeveloped websites known as parked domains, causing them to overpay for the placements. The case is Matera v Google Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 15-04062. ","

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam on Thursday called on all companies doing business there to stop advertising on YouTube, Facebook and other social media until they find a way to halt the publication of “toxic” anti-government information. At a meeting with the information and communication minister, companies including the local operations of Unilever, Ford and Yamaha Motor all committed to obey the call to suspend YouTube advertising. Last month, the communist country began putting pressure on advertisers to try to get YouTube owner Google and other companies to remove content from foreign-based dissidents. But Information and Communication Minister Truong Minh Tuan  said the response had not yet been good enough. Although there were 8,000 anti-government videos on YouTube, Google  had only blocked 42 and hadn’t removed them completely, the ministry said. “Today we call on all Vietnamese firms that are advertising not to abet them to take advertising money from firms to use against the Vietnamese government,” Tuan told companies at a meeting in Hanoi. “We also call on all internet users to raise their voice to Google and Facebook to prevent toxic, fake content violating Vietnamese law in the online environment.” YouTube reiterated its global policy of thoroughly reviewing government requests to block content they believe is illegal and restricting it where appropriate. Facebook gave no immediate response. The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry association which includes both companies, said Vietnam and its businesses benefited greatly from the internet. “It is critical for the Vietnamese government to protect the open nature of the internet, and put in place the right conditions that incentivize investment and nurture innovation,” said Jeff Paine, the group’s managing director. For governments to complain to Google and Facebook about content published online is not new, but industry officials said there was less precedent for a state to try to put pressure on them through their advertisers. Vietnam’s state-owned Vinamilk, and flag carrier Vietnam Airlines suspended YouTube ads last month after the government told them their ads had appeared alongside inappropriate content. Because of the computer-directed processes that pair adverts with their targeted audiences on social media, companies are not always aware of or have direct control over which specific videos an advert has been placed alongside. Vietnam has come under fire from Western countries and human rights groups for its Decree 72 on social media - which bans information that it deems anti-government, damaging to national security or destroying national unity. Despite the restrictions, content that ostensibly breaches the code’s standards is still prolific. While Vietnam makes up a very small part of the business operations of companies like Google and Facebook, it is one of Asia’s fastest growing economies and a hot investment target for global consumer brands. Within Vietnam itself, YouTube and Facebook account for two-thirds of digital media market share in Vietnam, according to Nguyen Khoa Hong Thanh, Operations Director at digital marketing agency Isobar Vietnam.

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order. A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trump’s first executive order banning travel from a number of countries the administration said posed a security risk. Airbnb Inc, Dropbox Inc and Kickstarter are among the companies that did sign the brief. Major tech companies that signed on to the earlier effort but not this week included Microsoft Corp, eBay Inc, Intel Corp, Netflix Inc and Twitter Inc. The lawsuit may succeed despite losing the overt support of such big names. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trump’s executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary. Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson’s order “unprecedented judicial overreach.” Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump’s executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February. It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the “friend-of-the-court” brief this time around. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said. Box Inc, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position. A Twitter spokeswoman pointed to past company statements opposing Trump’s initial travel ban in January but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment. Representatives of Apple, Google, eBay, Intel, Microsoft and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ","

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon’s Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri’s original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that. “Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants,” said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. “The only way to leapfrog today’s limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them.” (Story corrects “language model” in paragraph 10 to “acoustic model”.)

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"BIEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swatch Group is developing a Swiss-made operating system as it seeks to offer a smaller, more flexible alternative to the dominant systems which connect items such as smartwatches to the internet, its chief executive said on Thursday. The world’s biggest watchmaker has been skeptical about smartwatches, which use systems like Google’s Android Wear, Samsung’s Tizen OS and Apple’s WatchOS to connect to the internet, and has so far launched watches with limited connected features under its Tissot and Swatch brands. CCS Insight expects the market for smart wearables to almost double to 185 million units worth $16.9 billion by 2021. Nick Hayek said the biggest problems facing competitors’ smartwatches related to energy consumption and privacy. Swatch Group, whose brands include Omega, said last month it was working with Swiss research institute CSEM to launch an “ecosystem” for connected objects by the end of 2018. Swatch said this would offer absolute data protection and ultra-low energy consumption and would not need regular updates. “I don’t want to become the industry standard for smartwatches,” Nick Hayek said on Thursday, adding it would be dangerous if everybody depended on just one or two dominant operating systems. “But in Switzerland we have a lot of expertise when it comes to creating something that is smaller, consumes much less energy, is independent and more cost-efficient and can go into little objects,” he said. Swatch had many requests from small U.S. startups looking for flexible open-source systems and would serve these customers while also using the system in its own watches, he said. Ben Wood, an analyst with CCS Insight, said there were dangers in Swatch trying to build its own system, adding that it would be hard to compete with Google, Samsung and Apple, which had more resources in this area. “Swatch may be able to develop its own software platform, but attracting developers to get access to the most popular apps needs an operating system with scale. Just look at how BlackBerry ended up abandoning its own software,” Wood said. But if Swatch was able to offer people something unique it might be able to break into the market, Francisco Jeronimo at IDC said, adding that this was a “a gigantic task”. However, users had not yet locked in to a specific interface in what is a still new segment, therefore offering an opportunity for Swatch, Jeronimo said. ","

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators said on Monday concessions by Russia’s Gazprom aimed at avoiding fines should allay concerns of market abuse, signaling a thaw in business ties between Moscow and Brussels despite tensions over Ukraine and Syria. The provisional deal, which is subject to feedback from some EU states and market players, moves closer to ending one of Brussels’ longest-running antitrust probes that began with raids on offices in 10 countries in 2011 and culminated in charges Gazprom, which supplies a third of the EU’s gas, had abused its dominant position. If the deal comes into force, Russia’s state gas exporter will escape fines of up to 10 percent of its global turnover - an outcome likely to anger Poland and eastern EU countries which have sought a tougher line from Brussels. Eight member states in the east at the center of the case, all formerly dominated by Moscow, now have until May 4 to object to the European Commission’s view and could seek changes in the deal. Europe’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has brought actions and levied fines against major multinationals such as Google, said Gazprom’s offer met concerns and provided “a forward looking solution”. “Combined, we think that these measures are important improvements to ensure the free flow of gas at competitive prices,” Vestager said The legally-binding deal would entail Gazprom bowing to EU conditions to do away with terms barring countries from exporting its gas to other countries; tying contracts to investments in pipelines; and monopoly pricing in the three Baltic states, Bulgaria and Poland. The fight over pricing and destination clauses have been the toughest issues in high-level talks between Vestager and Russian officials that have dragged on for years to find a compromise. As part of the deal, Gazprom pledged greater transparency on prices. It will allow clients to renegotiate decades-long, oil-indexed contracts - opposed by the Commission. Prices would be linked to benchmarks such as European gas market hubs and border prices, including in Germany. Gazprom deputy head Alexander Medvedev said in a statement the commitments “demonstrate our willingness” to soothe the concerns of EU regulators and to closing the case soon. Within a bloc divided over its stance on Russia, some EU nations see the move towards a settlement as running counter to calls for more sanctions on Russia over its bombing in Syria. “The fundamental question is how friendly are we going to be with Gazprom,” one senior EU diplomat said, voicing dismay that Vestager had chosen to fine Google but not Gazprom. Vestager said during a news conference that her view was purely based on enforcing EU law and not influenced by politics. With a settlement, Russia would accept EU authority in applying competition law - something it has long balked at. If Gazprom fails to comply, the EU could resort to fines without reopening its case as it did when it imposed a 561 million euros ($731 million) penalty on Microsoft for breaking its promises. One EU official described the attitude in Brussels as “it’s better to appease than confront” its eastern neighbor. But EU officials said they were bracing for tough feedback from some nations, with Poland already locked in a court battle with the Commission over what it views as lenient treatment of Gazprom in another case. In the so-called “market test”, Gazprom’s competitors and governments in Poland, the three Baltic states, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have the right to weigh in. They will have seven weeks, almost twice the normal time, in part due to elections in Bulgaria, officials said. In recent years, Gazprom has changed some of its more contentious behavior under pressure from increased competition from liquefied natural gas imports, price arbitration cases brought by western customers and more liquidity on Europe’s energy markets. But EU regulators say those do not extend to the region, where some countries are almost 100 percent dependent on Russian gas imports. In addition to the antitrust case, the Commission has proposed legislation that will allow Brussels to vet bilateral energy deals between EU nations and countries such as Russia - as such agreements are not covered by competition law. That is why EU regulators said they had no power to tackle disagreements over the Yamal pipeline between Russia and Poland. However, Gazprom has offered not to seek damages from Bulgarian partners over the cancellation of the planned South Stream pipeline under the Black Sea. ","

La stima è dell’Ufficio parlamentare di bilancio e si basa sui dati di raccolta  pubblicitaria  forniti dall’Autorità per le comunicazioni. “I ricavi generati da Google in Italia sono stimati in 570 milioni a fronte di 67 milioni risultati dal bilancio di Google Italia. Per Facebook la differenza è ancora maggiore: rispettivamente 225 milioni contro 8 milioni”, sostiene l’Upb durante un’audizione in Senato sul disegno di legge 2526, presentato da Massimo Mucchetti, presidente della commissione Industria, per istituire una nuova versione della cosiddetta Web tax. L’Italia, assieme ad Stati membri europei, critica da tempo Google, Yahoo! e gli altri giganti del web perché fanno profitti in tutto il mondo ma hanno sede fiscale in Paesi come l’Irlanda, dove il prelievo sul reddito d’impresa è tra i più bassi d’Europa. Le proteste non hanno portato ad alcun risultato: l’Unione europea consente alle multinazionali di pagare le tasse solo nei paesi in cui sono presenti con una “stabile organizzazione di impresa”, cioè uffici e stabilimenti. Il ddl punta a ridurre l’elusione dei giganti di Internet indirizzando in modo più mirato la fase di accertamento. Le misure principali sono due: da un lato è previsto il concetto di “stabile organizzazione occulta” basato su alcuni precisi parametri e, dall’altro, alle società che rifiutano di regolarizzarsi è applicata una ritenuta alla fonte pari al 26% degli importi pagati, analoga alla ‘diverted profit tax’ inglese. “L’elevata entità del prelievo alla fonte ha l’obiettivo di incentivare la società a dare concreto contenuto economico alla stabile organizzazione, assoggettandosi così alla normale imposta sugli utili prevista dall’ordinamento italiano”, commenta l’Upb. Il guardiano dei conti pubblici ipotizza che, per effetto del ddl, le imposte versate a fronte dei ricavi pubblicitari riferibili all’Italia salirebbero da 2,2 fino ad un massimo di 133 milioni per Google e da 0,2 a 156,6 milioni per Facebook.

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Individuals cannot demand that personal data be erased from company records in an official register, the European Union’s top court ruled on Thursday, limiting the “right to be forgotten”. The case, brought by Italy, related to businessman Salvatore Manni who won compensation from the Lecce Chamber of Commerce because it was clear from its records that he had led a company that went bankrupt in 1992 and was wound up in 2005. Manni said this was the reason why properties at a tourist complex, built by another company he headed, had failed to sell. Individuals’ so-called right to be forgotten has become an increasing demand as growing amounts of personal data are held by corporations and government agencies. In May 2014, the EU court ruled that people could ask search engines, such as Google or Microsoft’s Bing, to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from the web results produced from searches for people’s names. In Thursday’s ruling the European Court of Justice said that company registers needed to be public to ensure legal certainty and to protect the interests of third parties. Company registers only contained a limited amount of personal information and, as executives in companies should disclose their identity and functions, it said. This did not constitute too severe an interference in their private lives and personal data. However, the court said there might be specific situations in which access to personal data in company registers could be limited, such as a long period after a company’s dissolution. But this should be determined on a case-by-case basis. ","

That’s according to market research firm eMarketer, which said in a report Tuesday that, overall ,Google will still be the leader in terms of digital ad dollars, accounting for 40.7% of the U.S. share this year. While that is more than double Facebook’s piece of the pie, Facebook is leading in display ads. eMarketer is forecasting Facebook’s display-ad business in the U.S. will increase 32.1% this year, hitting $16.33 billion ,with Facebook accounting for 39.1% of the market share. eMarketer said the growth in ad spending on Facebook can be attributed to an increase in the number of users and the time the users are spending on the social network, which in turn draws more advertisers. What’s more, eMarketer said Instagram is driving growth in advertising for Facebook. eMarketer is forecasting Instagram will represent 20% of Facebook’s mobile revenue this year, which is up from 15% a year ago. Google’s display-ad revenue is forecast to increase to $5.24 billion, but its market share will decline 12.5%. “Facebook’s users are increasingly captivated by videos on the platform—not just on Facebook, but on Instagram as well. Video, both live and recorded, is a key driver of growing user engagement and advertiser enthusiasm,” said eMarketer forecasting analyst Monica Peart in a report. (See also: Facebook B2B Campaign to Court Video Advertisers.) As for advertising spending in the search market, eMarketer said Google’s market share will increase 16.1% to $28.55 billion in 2017, with Google claiming close to 78% of the total search ad revenue in the U.S. this year.  “Google’s dominance in search, especially mobile search, is largely coming from the growing tendency of consumers to turn to their smartphones to look up everything from the details of a product to directions,” said Peart. “Google and mobile search as a whole will continue to benefit from this behavioral shift.” As for newly public Snap Inc.’s (SNAP) Snapchat, eMarketer said the messaging app is poised for “explosive growth” in 2017 with ad revenue increasing 157.8% to $770 million in the U.S. That below the $800 million eMarketer previously forecast because of higher-than-expected revenue sharing with Snap partners. eMarketer said Snapchat will represent 1.3% of the mobile ad market in the U.S. this year, with that growing to 2.7% by 2019.

The national spokesperson for The Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, she is a featured columnist for Investopedia. The views expressed by columnists are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Investopedia.] How do the super wealthy invest their money? Beyond stocks and bonds, ever wonder what really rich investors' portfolios have that yours doesn't? The answer may be what’s known as ""alternative investments."" These are investments that represent a style of investing intended to protect wealth in the event of a big crisis or just everyday stock market turbulence. Think hedge funds as one example. Most alternative investments were designed for the 1%. But now alternative investments are pushing into the mainstream. One reason is that alternatives are touted as investments that hint at potential higher overall returns on your money. This is critically important, especially to retirees trying to live off dividends and 1% interest as income to replace their old paychecks. The whole purpose of introducing an alternative investment into your investment mix is simple: diversification. The reason is that when one asset type, such as a stock, goes down, the right different type of asset – real estate, for example – could be moving in the opposite direction from stock prices. The point is to protect yourself against downside risk. With a number of investors convinced that the stock market is overdue for a major tumble (see 3 Investors Who Think a Stock Market Crash is Coming), the smart money is increasingly looking for different ways to put their savings to work. Alternative investments are finally becoming available outside of the 1% because prescient fund managers have started to focus on America's growing group of mass affluent investors.  According to global consulting company McKinsey & Company, since 2005, global assets in alternatives have grown twice as fast as traditional investments. Here’s a list of some of the alternative investments that can produce high returns that are uncorrelated to the stock market. Some are as esoteric as they sound. You might be comfortable putting some of your life’s savings into some of these alternatives, while others, not so much: Many financial advisors completely avoid investing in alternatives for one good reason: lack of liquidity. Traditional stocks and index funds are easy to track and monitor. Want to know what Apple's or Snap’s stock is doing today or what kind of dividend Coca-Cola’s paying? Type it into Google, and you can see it instantly. But investing in alternatives typically means holding on for at least five years. Tracking them requires a much deeper dive than a 60-second Google search. The lack of available current information translates into risk. Alternatives are ""off road"" investments, and accurately monitoring the value of a private investment in something like real estate is anything but easy. A great deal of trust is involved with each and every transaction. How can you even understand how well an investment is performing without a standardized pricing system? All the same, according to Wealth Management, wealth managers say they plan to add more ‘alt’ investments to some client’s portfolios, increasing them from an average of 13% today to 18% by 2018. The real answer is sometimes. They can be incredibly useful, especially for hedging against risk during economic downturns. A study conducted by Informa Investment Solutions and published by BlackRock reveals that many alternative investments did provide protection over stocks during the 2001 and 2008 recessions because they didn't fall as much as stocks. But these numbers look at alternatives as a whole rather than individual classes. It all depends on which alternative investment you're buying. For example, hedge funds had an atrocious 2016, despite how sexy they sound. After all, super-rich investors put their fortunes into hedge funds, so they must be good, right? Wrong. Credit Suisse Capital Services found  that hedge funds were hit hard by redemptions in 2016 because of the widespread underperformance across the board. More than 80% of investors redeemed some or all of their investment from hedge funds in the first half of the year, according to Credit Suisse's study. The study also revealed that more than half of those redemptions were due to specific managers' underperformance or strategy drift. Alternatives are opaque. That's why it's important to choose funds managed by experts who specialize in them. If the trades aren't executed properly, you could wind up doing exactly the opposite of what you're trying to do – ramping your risk instead of reducing it. You could end up with subpar returns and oversized fees that disappear into fund managers' pockets. But by far the biggest weakness with alternatives is that it can be nearly impossible to check the track records of these alternative fund managers, according to the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) of the SEC. There are usually no third-party verification and audits. Some financial advisors conduct their own due diligence, but real due diligence should be one of the services a fee-based fiduciary offers, according to the OCIE. The reality is that even they can't really see the level of detail needed to track performance. Often, they're just relying on the data provided by the funds rather than third-party performance data. The only third-party option is to look for the fund's GIPS (Global Investment Performance) standards, although not all alt investments claim compliance with the standards. These standards provide ""apples-to-apples comparisons"" of performance data. Click here for a list of the firms that claim compliance, and check out the standards on the website to gain a fuller understanding of what compliance with them means. You'll probably notice that the list of funds claiming compliance is very short compared to the number of available investments. What's more, many individual investors and even some advisors don't seem to be demanding it. They're buying into non-compliant funds anyway. If you're going to incorporate alternative investments into your portfolio, how do you do it safely? Different types of funds make them convenient and accessible, and they're usually managed by experts other than your advisor – someone who specializes in a particular type of alternative investment. Look for funds that have multiple managers, strategies or asset classes so you get more diversification for your investment dollars. Expect some sticker shock because all these alternative funds will come with higher fees than single-strategy funds. There's a lot more management going on within them than with a single-strategy fund. It’s true you don’t need to be super-rich anymore to join the alternatives club, but you should be affluent enough to afford to invest in this way. Most wealth managers won’t touch this strategy unless you meet a certain minimum amount of total investable assets – typically around $2 million to $3 million. Most financial advisors outsource the job of actually watching over the investments. Right now, if you have a fee-only fiduciary advisor you’re likely paying less than 1% of the value of your invested portfolio (annually) to compensate for care-taking all your investments. You most likely expect proper diversification as part of the service in order to protect your money. Once alternatives enter the picture, you can expect those advisory fees to go up because of the outsourcing. That means your bottom line returns have to be that much higher to clear that hurdle. Many advisors I talk to suggest allocating between 20% and  25% of your portfolio to private or alternative investments. The rest should go into traditional stocks, bonds and cash. Other experts insist on a much lower allocation. For example, Ed Butowsky, managing partner at Chapwood Investments told CNBC that he recommends investors have around 15% to 20%. How much depends heavily on your age, so it's important to work with a fiduciary advisor who can determine what percentage is best for you. In some cases, that might even be 0% of your portfolio.

Shoshanna Delventhal,03162017,Investopedia,03092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Over the past five years, Herbalife Ltd.’s (HLF) stock has defiantly climbed in the face of billionaire William Ackman’s efforts to expose its alleged wrongdoing. (See also: William Ackman’s Crusade to Take Down Herbalife.) The documentary ""Betting on Zero,"" which arrives in theaters this week, highlights the events surrounding Ackman’s decision to bet $1 billion on short-selling Herbalife stock. The hedge fund manager expected the firm’s alleged pyramid scheme, perhaps the largest in history, to send its stock crashing and burning down to zero, where Ackman’s hedge fund would then receive a full return on investment. Ackman insists Herbalife not only employs an illegal business model, but also targets particularly low-income and immigrant communities, robbing them of their life savings. Herbalife and its supporters challenge the portrayal of billionaire investor Ackeman as a champion the public good, saying he is actually just a market manipulator in pursuit of his own fortune. While the FTC eventually concluded a multiyear investigation of Herbalife, ordering the Los Angeles-based company to pay $200 million and completely restructure its business, the decision was seem as somewhat of a defeat for Ackman. The crusade also became a personal battle between Ackman and his long-time nemeses Carl Icahn, a fellow billionaire. Just before the film’s debut this week, Icahn invested another $19.1 million to up his share of the multi-level marketing nutrition supplement firm as its stock started to fall to a two-month low. After ""Betting on Zero"" premiered at the TriBeca Film Festival, the documentary maker says Herbalife  ramped up a campaign to sabotage the film and prevent people from seeing it. The film’s website includes a section called “Attempts to Suppress and Discredit 'Betting on Zero,'” indicating paid contractors posing as “community activists” distributed leaflets intended to discredit the film. Further, Herbalife launched the website bettingonzero.com that the filmmakers denounced as a “repository of false and misleading information about the film and is subject to periodic wild and dramatic revisions.” The team behind the film also says a lobbying firm contracted by Herbalife bought up half the tickets to the Washington, D.C., premiere, stating “either they invited a lot of friends who didn’t show up or they didn’t want people to see it.” Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this new documentary is the relevance of the topic. The FTC’s settlement forcing Herbalife to restructure goes into effect this May, while Herbalife has also recently disclosed a separate probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into its anti-corruption compliance in China. ""Betting on Zero"" was financed by John Fichthorn, co-founder of Dialectic Capital Management, who indicates that while has not bet against Herbalife since producing the film, he has in the past. Director Ted Braun indicates he remains independent from the financiers and Ackman. ""Betting on Zero"" will be available on-demand via iTunes and Google Play next month.

Michael J. Kramer,03162017,Investopedia,03092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Tesla (TSLA) is perhaps the greatest Bull/Bear debate in the history of the stock market. The discussion of how much Tesla is worth has now been raging for years. The Bulls say it will be worth multiples more than its current value. The Bears say it is a cash-burning machine headed toward bankruptcy. Talk about two opposite ends of the spectrum. There is a general flaw in both of these arguments, and 2017 is likely going to decide which is right and which side is wrong. Let's get back to the flaw in the Bull/Bear argument. The Bears will say TSLA is a cash-burning machine headed to bankruptcy. True, the company does burn lots of money, but so did Amazon (AMZN) for many years. The Bears will argue that electric vehicle demand will be picking up and TSLA can't hold its market share. Right now, more EV cars are coming to market. The Bears will argue that Tesla can never build 500,000 Model 3 cars for $35,000 a year and the company will lose tons of money per car. The Bull case is just as flawed, as they believe Tesla will revolutionize the industry. It's true that nobody spoke about electric vehicles 10 years ago. The Bulls think TSLA is making cars that will cut greenhouse emissions. Yes, but the electricity needs to be produced from somewhere. The Bulls will argue that Tesla is disrupting the auto industry. Yes, it is forcing automakers to roll out EV models en masse. Do you notice anything similar on each side of the argument? Autos, all it talks about is cars and the auto industry. Is Apple a phone maker or is it a tech company that makes phones? There's a big difference. A phone for the most part is a commoditized product. They are cheap to make and the barrier to entry seems pretty low. Or is Apple a tech company that makes software and an ecosystem that the phone serves as merely a gateway to the user? Now, is Tesla an automaker like Ford, GM or Daimler? Or does it resemble a tech company such as Google, Microsoft and Apple? It is an important question; valuations are very different. Sure, Tesla makes a car, just like Apple makes an iPhone. Tesla is, and does, have an ecosystem, with its software that runs the car, the autonomous driving network with machine learning and over-the-air updates. When was the last Ford, GM or Daimler pushed out an autonomous driving update over the air? Trying to value something that is changing the landscape of an industry is nearly impossible. The market has already told us what TSLA is worth: like it or not, $40 billion. Why? Because it has been trading in the same range for nearly three years. Knowing what it will be worth three years from now is the impossible task. I'd argue with anyone that tries to make a case for a Tesla valuation three years, let alone two years, out. It is nearly impossible to predict any of the variables that go into any of the models used to figure these valuations out. None. Can you tell us what the risk-free rate will be? How many cars Tesla can produce? What will be the demand for the cars? One can't, so it is not even worth trying. (See also: The Impossible Task of Valuing Netflix.) TSLA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Instead, one should focus on what information is presently at hand. TSLA's revenue growth over the years has been steady and seemingly growing at a faster pace, if one sees the curve on the chart above. Despite these gains, TSLA has been unable to turn a profit. Often, analysts and investors get hung up with companies beating or missing analyst expectations because investing is all about expectations. In this case, despite beating or missing guidance and expectations, revenue growth has been consistent and stable. Revenue growth should be the main driving point when investing in a company like TSLA. Is the company consistently growing revenue at a faster pace, or is it stalling out and hitting stumbling blocks? Is the company consistently producing more cars and making more deliveries? TSLA has been growing all of these metrics regularly, which would indicate the company is producing cars into high demand. One needs to move away from Tesla being an electric vehicle. TSLA is a technology company that is producing cars. These cars drive on four wheels and use a form of energy to move it forward and backward. A buyer of this car is likely not buying it because they believe they are saving the planet; they are buying it because they want to own it and they like driving it. Ask a Tesla owner what they think of the car. The owner of a Tesla has likely been driving BMWs, Mercedes, Audis and Range Rovers for a good portion of their adult life. It says something about the quality of the product itself. If these cars were not viewed as a solid product, they would not sell, whether they were EVs or not.  A buyer of Tesla is not buying the car because they worry about the price of gasoline or for any other reason. They are buying it because they like driving it and typically don't really care if it is an EV or not. The TSLA Model 3 is expected to start at a base price of $35,000, but of course, people will not get a car for that amount. Most people will opt for options just like they do on any car they purchase. A BMW 3 Series starts at about $31,000, but by the time you get done with the options, the car is likely to run over $40,000. A Model 3 will be competing with the BMW 3, Audi A4 and Mercedes C line-up of cars, not the Chevy Bolt. As for the Model S and Model X, investors seem to think that perhaps TSLA has hit a wall because guidance for the first half of 2017 is flat from 2016. If it is likely not the case of stalling demand, it may be a case of TSLA trying to focus on the Model 3 ramp and not wanting to set expectations for the street too high. How much is a company worth that is currently on an exponential growth curve, and about to do the impossible? It looks we are about to find out. Odds are the answer is: a lot more than its current value.

 ,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"Apple, Alphabet's Google and Facebook are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order. A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trump's first executive order banning travel from a number of countries the administration said posed a security risk. Airbnb, Dropbox and Kickstarter are among the companies that did sign the brief. Major tech companies that signed on to the earlier effort but not this week included Microsoft, eBay, Intel, Netflix, and Twitter. The lawsuit may succeed despite losing the overt support of such big names. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trump's executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary. Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson's order ""unprecedented judicial overreach."" Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump's executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February. It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the ""friend-of-the-court"" brief this time around. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. ""We do expect the group to expand."" Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said. Box Inc, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position. A Twitter spokeswoman pointed to past company statements opposing Trump's initial travel ban in January but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment. Representatives of Apple, Google, eBay, Intel, Microsoft and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ","Apple, Google, Facebook skip legal challenge to new travel ban"

From this fall, technology lovers will quite literally be able to wear their hearts on their sleeves, donning a new smart jacket which allows them to control their mobile device at the swipe of a cuff. Users will be able to skip songs, use Google maps and make phone calls by brushing their sleeve. The denim jacket, which will retail at $350, is the first of its kind and makes use of 'Project Jacquard' technology, which has been under development by Google since 2015. The technology combines thin, metallic alloys with natural and synthetic yarns to create touch-sensitive interactive fabrics. ﻿These conductive yarns can then be connected to a tiny circuit, no larger than a button, creating data which can be wirelessly transmitted to mobile phones and other electronic devices. The smart fibres are washable and the button circuit has a two-day battery life. According to the Project Jacquard website, the technology can be incorporated into a variety of fabrics, suggesting further wearable technologies could be on the horizon should the smart jacket be well-received by consumers. ""Jacquard is a blank canvas for the fashion industry. Designers can use it as they would any fabric, adding new layers of functionality to their designs, without having to learn about electronics.

Nectar Gan,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"Google is still in talks with Beijing over its plans to return to the mainland Chinese market, according to a senior Chinese lawmaker and former top official with knowledge of the negotiations. ""China has been in touch with Google through various channels. Last year, leaders of our country's important department had further communication with Google,"" said Liu Binjie, a standing committee member of the National People's Congress and former head of the General Administration of Press and Publication. More from the South China Morning Post: Beijing to release national artificial intelligence development plan Chinese villagers become millionaires selling yarn online China's opening up requires open minds – not a blocked internet There was hope that a part of Google's business would return to China first, gradually followed by others, the lawmaker said. ""The academic sector will be the first to get through,"" Liu said. ""China's focus is on [making] academic progress, such as academic exchanges as well as [exchanges in] science and culture, instead of news, information or politics."" Other Google functions under negotiation included ""service functions that do not involve [politically] sensitive information,"" according to the lawmaker. But no timetable had yet been set for Google's return, he said. Since Google pulled its search engine out of mainland China in 2010 after a bitter spat with Beijing over its strict censorship rules, the internet giant has from time to time expressed its desire to venture back into the world's biggest internet market. China has 721 million users and the number is still growing. In 2015, Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt told a tech conference in Beijing that Google was in constant dialogue with Beijing as it sought to ""serve the whole of China"". Alphabet is Google's parent company. ""China's principle is that you have to operate according to Chinese law if you want to enter the Chinese market,"" Liu said. ""But if [Google] goes by Chinese rules, it would harm its global operation rules and [its image as] a fair, open platform. Some agreements have yet to be reached in this aspect."" The lawmaker added that commerce regulators were involved in the talks, which had been ongoing since 2014. A Ministry of Commerce spokesman said he did not know about the matter and that the ministry was ""not the department in charge"". Google did not respond to requests for comment.

The findings were discussed on a panel at YouTube Corner during the the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas on Monday, and will be published on the Think With Google blog. What Google discovered was millennials parents were different, in particular: - Millennial dads are stepping up and taking on more caregiving roles. On YouTube, more millennial dads watch parenting-related videos than moms. Panelist Akash Pathek, who is the director of brand marketing and digital strategy at McDonald's, said data shows many millennials are choosing care of families over pursuing a career. In addition, fewer and lower paying jobs have lead millennial moms and dads to share the responsibility of raising a family. ""If you look at their generation — the baby boomer generation — you had really classical roles,"" McDonald's director of brand marketing and digital strategy Akash Pathek said on the panel. ""This is not stereotyping. Millennials are in less classical roles.

Eight out of 10 say their child is one of their best friends, and about three-quarters say their children are involved in household decisions. - Millennials are more likely to hold onto their hobbies than previous generations, whether that means taking time for themselves or involving their kids. - Millennial parents rely on guidance from multiple sources, and are fine accepting advice from companies through branded content.

Arjun Kharpal,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"Amazon's voice assistant Alexa – which is installed in its Echo smart speaker – could bring the U.S. e-commerce giant $10 billion of revenues by 2020 and be a ""mega-hit"", according to a note published by RBC Capital Markets on Thursday. The investment bank has dubbed the technology ""voice-activated internet (VAI)"" and said it represents a ""material opportunity"" for both Amazon and Google, which has its own technology called Google Assistant. But many investors are trying to figure out how this technology will make money for these firms. RBC suggest that it could be a huge business for Amazon driven by sales of devices that contain Alexa, voice-driven shopping and platform revenues. The result is that the device sales and shopping could generate $10 billion in total revenue. RBC said there will be 60 million Alexa devices sold in 2020, bringing the total install base to around 128 million. RBC breaks down each reason. In a survey of 1,748 Amazon customers carried out in Septemebr 2016 by RBC, 33 percent of respondents said they had heard of Alexa, Echo and related products. A similar survey in March 2017, showed that this had increased to 77 percent. Meanwhile, ownership has jumped from 13 percent to 87 percent in the same period. ""Our take is that Amazon has a potential mega-hit on its hands with Alexa – a product/service that has the potential to materially increase the frequency and intensity of Amazon's relationship with its customers,"" RBC said in a note. Amazon has been trying to get Alexa installed on several devices and at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January, the firm announced integrations with LG refrigerators and even Ford's cars. But Amazon faces stiff competition from Google Assistant, the U.S. search giant's own voice assistant which is built into Android smartphones and its own smart speaker called Google Home. RBC was surprised by the popularity of Google Home since it was only launched in October 2016 in the U.S. Awareness of Google Home among 1,748 Amazon customers surveyed by RBC was 60 percent. Whereas when RBC did a similar survey in September 2015, just shortly after the Echo had launched widely in the U.S., only 33 percent of respondents had heard of Alexa. Google however still only has around 80 Actions, which are similar to Alexa's skills, which total above 10,000. ""Although we only have our initial survey results to draw upon, we are seeing strong initial traction for Google Home. That said, Google still has a lot of catching up to do,"" RBC concluded.

Marguerite Ward,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"Applying to job listings online is a routine step for those seeking a new position. But it's not the best strategy for landing a new job, according to Google executive Peter Roper. ""Frankly there's a lot of jobs on LinkedIn, there's a lot of job services,"" Roper tells CNBC. ""Those are jobs people know about."" While job posting websites make it easier for you to apply, it also means that it's a lot easier for hundreds, if not thousands, of others to do the same. ""Those are the jobs that are really the most competitive to get because they're widely publicized,"" he says in an interview at the Millennial 20/20 conference. Roper, who leads the company's mobile branding, has a better strategy. 1. Make a list of places you'd love to work ""If you want to focus your energy and narrow your search,"" he says, ""create a list of companies that you're interested in."" This includes companies that don't necessarily have job openings listed on their website, Roper says. 2. Email the right person ""Personally reach out to the hiring manager or person in charge of your department there,"" he says. Keep the email short and concise. Taking this extra step shows the hiring manager that you are willing to devote time and energy to contacting them, which helps you stand out from the crowd. Roper used this strategy in his own career and it helped him get to where he is today. In 2013, he sent a cold email to the CEO of Songza, a music app he loved. He asked if the company was looking for anyone to help run sales. While Songza did not have any job openings listed online, the CEO responded saying that he was, in fact, looking for a sales executive. Roper landed the job, and a few years later, Google acquired the app. Though the importance of email etiquette is sometimes overlooked, Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture, says how you write emails can actually make or break your career. The CEO of Birchbox, the founder of StyleSeat and countless others say that emailing the right people was crucial to their success. Don't be afraid of the cold email, Roper says.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a surprise hit on its hand with the Echo smart speaker. After releasing it exclusively to Prime members in late 2014, the device proved so popular that Amazon was able to quickly open orders to everyone in the U.S. by the following summer. On Christmas Eve of 2015, the Echo was one of the top five items ordered, according to Amazon's annual holiday press release. Last year, Echo device sales climbed nine times compared to 2015's holiday season. That's despite the November introduction of Google Home, a competing smart speaker from the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary. During Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggested Echo devices, powered by the virtual assistant Alexa, outsold Google Home 10-to-1 in the quarter. However, Mahaney is changing his tune after conducting a more in-depth survey. ""Home's awareness and installed base could be much closer to Alexa -- with a brand awareness in the U.S. 80% that of Alexa and an installed base that may be close to a third that of Alexa,"" he recently wrote in a note. It looks like Google Home is quickly catching up to Amazon's Echo. Image source: Google. Google plans to keep making Google Home a better device by improving its search capabilities and functionality. ""We are going to invest a lot in it over 2017,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""I think there is a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for the very long term,"" he added. Google intends to leverage its massive Android platform to continue improving Google Assistant, the artificial intelligence (AI) behind Google Home. At least 200 million devices will have access to the voice assistant, which will provide Google with a lot more opportunities to learn exactly what people are looking for when they say, ""OK, Google."" Google will also have to improve Google Home's capabilities. The device currently has around 80 Actions, which is nothing compared to the 10,000-plus functionalities available with Alexa. To that end, Google launched the Actions on Google developer kit in December. Strategy Analytics estimates Google will sell 1 million Google Home devices by midyear. That still trails Amazon's sales by a significant margin. The research group estimates Amazon sold 6.3 million Echo devices last year, and that should go up meaningfully in 2017. Mahaney estimates Amazon will sell 60 million Echo devices by 2020, bringing the install base to 128 million. While Google Home sales are improving relative to Amazon Echo, it's not clear device sales will follow a similar path. Google Home lacks one of the key functionalities of Amazon's devices: the ability to easily shop on Amazon. Seventeen percent of Echo owners use Alexa to place orders on Amazon, according to Mahaney's survey. As the number of devices in use grows, Mahaney expects the amount of shopping done via Alexa on Amazon to grow as well. By 2020, sales through the voice assistant could reach $5 billion, according to the analyst's estimate. Google doesn't even have a business model for monetizing Google Home beyond hardware sales. Search and display ads don't work very well on a device with no display. Moreover, Google doesn't offer a compelling differentiating factor for consumers to pick its device over another smart speaker. Comparatively, Amazon Prime members, of which there's a rapidly growing number, have lots of reasons to pick the Echo, like easy access to ordering things on Amazon or inexpensive use of Amazon Music Unlimited. As such, Amazon is poised to win the long-term competition even if Google Home is catching up in the short term. ","
      
    Google Home Is Catching Up to Amazon's Echo -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. Any investor would love to get their hands on a crystal ball and take a quick peek at what's going to happen over the next decade. The problem is, those crystal balls are hard to come by, so we all have to settle for looking at what companies are doing right now -- and attempt to anticipate how that will help or hurt them in the future. Image source: Amazon. The company's ability to diversify its businesses -- while still tying many of them to its Prime service -- has given Amazon a lead over its competitors that won't fade any time soon. Image source: Google. With a $581 billion market cap, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a juggernaut of the technology industry, yet it still innovates like a much smaller, scrappier company. Alphabet may still earn most of its revenue -- 99% -- from Google, but that hasn't stopped it from making big bets on the driverless car market and even moonshots like curing cancer. Among the more than 20 companies under the Alphabet umbrella, there are units trying to secure major positions in the future of transportation, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the burgeoning Internet of Things. Add to that the company's mobile dominance with its Android platform, and its new devices like the Pixel Phone and Google Home and its crystal clear that Alphabet will still be one of the most dominant tech giants a decade from now. Image source: Facebook. Every day, the world feels like it gets a little bit smaller and slightly more connected, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) deserves at least partial credit for that. With more than 1.86 billion users on the company's main platform, and more growth coming in huge markets like India, Facebook shows no sign of slowing down in the social media space. The company plans to have 5 billion users by 2030. Take a minute and remember that we have 7 billion people on the planet right now. That's a hefty goal, but if any company can do it it's Facebook. Aside from its main Facebook platform, the company is investing billions in connecting people around the world through its WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and is investing heavily in building what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls ""the next computing platform"" -- virtual reality. Image source: Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has gotten some flak for the high price of its F-35 Lightning stealth fighter jet, as President Trump has so kindly pointed out on Twitter. But despite the criticisms, the F-35 is poised to help Lockheed Martin dominate the aerospace industry over the next decade. Consider that the F-35 is expected to be in service until 2070 and could bring in more than $1 trillion in revenue for the company over that time span. Sure, Lockheed may further trim the cost of the planes -- as it did recently, when it announced its long-term efforts to reduce costs had cut the price on its next batch of 90 planes by $700 million -- but with more than 50 years of revenues expect to come from this jet family, there's little reason to be skeptical of Lockheed's dominance. Image source: Netflix. Not so long ago, the idea of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) being capable of creating original, award-winning programming would have seemed absurd. But over the past few years, the company has amassed a vast trove of original content that has not only won over critics but also helped the company win new customers. In fact, 57% of the streaming service's U.S. subscribers say they signed up for because of its original content. Netflix now boasts about 93.8 million subscribers in 190 countries,  and it's still growing. The company faces rising competition from Amazon's Prime video service, but says it plans on investing $6 billion in original content this year, which should help it fend off rivals. A decade from now, Netflix will have the advantage of that much more original content production under its belt, and more streaming experience than any of its competitors. Image source: Disney. Add to all of that the company's long list of theme parks, cruise ships, resorts, and its Pixar Studios, and it's easy to foresee Disney holding a powerful position the entertainment business for years to come. The company will have to adapt to a shifting pay-TV landscape, and adjust to how those changes will impact the company's all-important ESPN networks. But investors would be wise to remember that the company already has many decades worth of strategy-shifting experience. Image source: GE. 7. General Electric General Electric (NYSE:GE) has weathered more changes than most companies over its 100-plus year history, and the conglomerate  recently reinvented itself once again to benefit from the rapidly evolving industrial and technological landscape. Consider that CEO Jeff Immelt said back in 2015 that his company is ""on track to become a top 10 software company.""  Software may seem like a far cry from the engine turbines and other industrial equipment GE is known for, but it's anticipating the rise of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), in which equipment is connected to the Internet, collects data, and then analyzes it, helping make companies and systems more efficient. GE is already well on its way in this market, and with the IIoT estimated to add $14.2 trillion to the global economy by 2030, there's plenty of room for growth. Image source: Tesla. Compared to other U.S. automakers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still  in its infancy, but the electric carmaker is quickly becoming key player in the space. Tesla is preparing to launch its fourth vehicle, the Model 3, later this year, and estimates that it will produce 500,000 cars annually starting in 2018. That's not so impressive when compared to, say, Ford's 2.6 million U.S. vehicle sales last year. But Tesla is betting that the future of passenger cars is electric, and it's building out a vast network of supercharger stations across the U.S and Europe to fuel them, has already built the battery-making Gigafactory to help drive down vehicle costs, and is a leader in the driverless car space. If electric and self-driving vehicles are the future, then the next decade could certainly be dominated by Tesla. Image source: Oracle. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is slowly shifting from a hardware-dominated sales model to one that generates more recurring revenue from software and services. Its cloud computing revenue was up 64% year over year in its most recent quarter, and topped $1 billion for the first time. Oracle is now the leading cloud computing provider for companies that have 1,000 or more employees, and has made major investments in the space with acquisitions such as cloud provider NetSuite, which it picked up for a cool $9.3 billion. The shift away from hardware to software and services may have been slow in coming for Oracle, but it's making up for lost time, and betting that its current cloud investments will pay off over the long term. Given its current position in the tech world, and its rising power in cloud computing, you can bet Oracle will maintain its position for years to come. Image source: Nike. No other company dominates the sports apparel world like Nike (NYSE:NKE), and at this point, there's virtually no stopping it. It has not only built one of the strongest brands on the planet, but it also knows how to keep the momentum going. Consider that the company's $93 billion market cap allows it do things like sign a lifetime sponsorship deal with Lebron James that's estimated to be worth up to $1 billion. But branding is only part of the company's staying power. Nike has proved that it can continue innovating its product lines, and it has 40-plus years of success in marketing them in the right way. Others may sprint faster for a time to gain share in the $320 billion athletic apparel market, but Nike is running a marathon, and it's clear it trained harder and has more stamina than any of its competitors.

    10 Companies Set to Dominate the Next Decade -- The Motley Fool

"Brian Feroldi, Jason Hall, Rich Duprey, Jordan Wathen, and Dan Caplinger",03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It isn't hard to figure out why Amazon.com has been one of the best-performing stocks over the past two decades. The e-commerce giant's top line has skyrocketed since its founding in 1994 as more consumers warm up to the idea of shopping online. In turn, investors have bid up shares on the hope that the company's massive revenue growth will translate into huge profit growth, too. So what other companies could potentially grow at a breakneck speed over the next few decades? We asked a team of Fools that very question, and they picked MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF), Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Read on to find out why. Image source: Getty Images. Dan Caplinger (MercadoLibre): To look for Amazon-like growth potential, it makes sense to stay in the same arena that Amazon serves while searching for a niche that the online retail giant hasn't yet sought to cover. MercadoLibre has that appeal, as it has set out to become the primary e-commerce giant serving the Latin American region. With hundreds of millions of potential customers in a rapidly growing part of the emerging world, Latin America gives MercadoLibre plenty of upside potential. MercadoLibre has done a lot to build up an entire ecosystem to facilitate internet commerce. Starting with its premier marketplace site, MercadoLibre later added a variety of add-on services, including its MercadoPago payment system, MercadoEnvios for shipping, and a service to allow purchasers to get financing on what they buy when necessary. These ancillary businesses provide a full-service experience for MercadoLibre users, but they also have the potential to become independently successful in their own right and expand into more applications. MercadoLibre does face the challenge of dealing with more volatile economic conditions. For instance, in recent years, Latin America largely missed out on the economic growth that the U.S. has enjoyed, because of falling commodity prices. That filtered through to MercadoLibre's prospects. However, with commodities starting to bounce higher, MercadoLibre has posted solid growth, and the runway for the e-commerce giant spans a long way into the future. Rich Duprey (NVIDIA): After the run-up in value NVIDIA has had over the past few years, rising some 600% since 2014, it's easy to think its stock is priced for perfection. As it trades at 62 times trailing earnings and 44 times forward estimates, it's understandable why some are concerned about valuation. But at times some companies deserve the heightened expectations -- because their businesses are that good. The depth and breadth of the graphics-chip maker's portfolio gives it a huge competitive advantage over rivals Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), driving its leading GPU segment to exceed the market's growth. Notably, the segment is enjoying rapid adoption in AI, the cloud, gaming, and self-driving vehicles. That shows its importance not only in its mainstay gaming market, but also in the auto market, in the Internet of Things, and as part of devices that are pushing the boundaries of virtual reality and machine learning. GPUs are perhaps at the core of the wave of the future: deep learning that will literally drive the driverless cars, advance healthcare, and more. NVIDIA's leadership has come at the expense of Intel and AMD, but make no mistake: It's still gaming that is the moneymaker here, accounting for more than 60% of total revenue as its GeForce GPU continues to fuel strong adoption of its Pascal architecture. AMD's Polaris processors may help lift its performance, but they still lag far behind NVIDIA's offerings. The chipmaker may have to do everything right, but it's proving that it is capable of doing so, and it routinely exceeds even its own forecasts of growth. It expects fourth-quarter revenue to come in at $1.9 billion, give or take, which would be a nearly 50% year-over-year increase -- a goal well within its reach. No company can grow continuously in a straight line, and there will be hiccups along the way for NVIDIA, but there's no reason to think that, even if investors get nervous again, the strength of its business won't be able to continue driving it higher to achieve Amazon-like growth. Brian Feroldi (Illumina): While the human genome was first decoded more than a decade ago, I'd bet that you still haven't had your DNA sequenced. That's because it still costs more than $1,000 to do so, which is a price tag that is still too high to drive mass adoption. However, I'd bet that you will have your genome sequenced in the next decade or so as costs continue to fall. If I'm right, then Illumina -- a leading provider of genomic-testing equipment -- looks poised for massive growth from here. Illumina is the dominant player in the genomic-sequencing market. The company sells both the machines that sequence the DNA and the supplies that are needed to run each test. This razor-and-blade model has allowed Illumina's revenue to rise rapidly even while the cost of performing a test has fallen dramatically. Here's a great chart that shows this phenomenon in action: Image source: Illumina. CAGR = Compound annual growth rate. Recently, Illumina stunned the markets with the launch of its NovaSeq series, which is a next-generation testing system that promises to drive down the costs of sequencing a genome to as little as $100. With a price point that low, I could easily see this technology going mainstream. But what can healthcare providers do with the information gathered through DNA sequencing? To help find out, Illumina has teamed up with IBM and Philips to create new tools that will standardize and simplify data interpretation. If successful, the project could help providers identify diseases at far earlier stages than current technology allows. In total, Illumina's new technology could help to revolutionize the world of healthcare as we know it today. If this pans out, then Illumina could be poised to deliver decades of top- and bottom-line growth. Jason Hall (First Solar): Solar and renewable energy stocks are likely to get trashed in the near term, as President Donald Trump's administration makes good on his campaign promise to cut regulations. And while a lot of investor money will shift away from renewables and chase after the companies that could benefit in the short term, the long term remains in the favor of companies like First Solar. This is because, even as the Trump administration announces plans to cut emissions regulations across the transportation, automotive, and utility industries in the United States, the rest of the developed world is putting more emphasis on renewables. And with the bulk of global population expansion -- particularly in the energy-consuming middle class -- happening outside North America over the next several decades, don't let local politics cloud your view when it comes to the growth prospects for First Solar. After all, the company already derives nearly half of its business outside North America. There's a good chance the market will remain very unfavorable on First Solar's stock in the short term. But looking out years down the road, billions of new global middle-class members will be relying on solar all over the world, no matter what U.S. politics and regulations look like. If you're willing to ride out short-term choppiness completely unrelated to the big picture, and potentially get Amazon-like returns, First Solar is a great stock to own. Jordan Wathen (WisdomTree Investments): WisdomTree Investments currently dominates in an obscure corner of the index fund world. WisdomTree's most popular funds allow you to invest in Japanese and European stocks without exposing yourself to currency risk. The bad news is that investors have turned cold on the strategy. The company's currency-hedged funds, which held about $39.2 billion in assets at their peak in the second quarter of 2015, ended the fourth quarter of 2016 with just $18.8 billion in assets. As the dollar strengthened, investors now want to bet on a weaker dollar, a bet that WisdomTree funds aren't particularly useful for. Luckily, the company has a few other emerging strategies. Its domestic dividend funds are proven winners and have been excellent asset gatherers. It has also expanded abroad to start new exchange-traded funds in markets that aren't as saturated with ETFs as American stock exchanges. I see WisdomTree as something of a lottery ticket in an industry that should see its assets under management grow at a high-single-digit clip for a long time to come. For a levered company like WisdomTree, that can easily turn into years of double-digit earnings growth. ","
      
    5 Stocks With Promising, Amazon-like Growth Potential -- The Motley Fool

  "
Dan Caplinger,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Getting an early read on how much you'll owe in income tax is important. If you know what your tax bill is likely to be, then you can make plans now to make sure you don't have any unpleasant surprises come tax time. With the new Trump administration having just taken office, there's some uncertainty about what 2017 taxes will look like. But you can make good estimates based on two possibilities: that current law continues or that the Trump tax proposal becomes law. One thing to keep in mind is that every $100,000-earning taxpayer will have a different tax bill because of other factors that affect taxes. Your marital status, the number of children you have, the expenses you have, and the other sources of income outside your work you have all have an impact on the amount of tax you owe. Image source: Getty Images. However, to keep things simple, we'll talk about two hypothetical taxpayers: Here's a quick look at how to calculate tax liability on the tax return you're about to file this season, for the 2016 tax year: Category Single Example Married Example Starting earnings $100,000 $100,000 Retirement account contribution ($5,000) ($5,000) Standard deduction ($6,300) ($12,600) Personal exemptions ($4,050) ($16,200) Taxable income $84,650 $66,200 Tentative tax $16,934 $9,003 Child tax credit $0 $2,000 Final tax bill $16,934 $7,003 Calculations by author. If tax laws don't change in 2017, then the calculation looks much the same. The only differences are in the tax brackets and the standard deduction, which rise slightly due to inflation. Category Single Example Married Example Starting earnings $100,000 $100,000 Retirement account contribution ($5,000) ($5,000) Standard deduction ($6,350) ($12,700) Personal exemptions ($4,050) ($16,200) Taxable income $84,600 $66,100 Tentative tax $16,889 $8,983 Child tax credit $0 $2,000 Final tax bill $16,889 $6,983 Calculations by author. Under the Trump tax plan, taxes would look a lot different. Retirement account contributions would still be deductible, but personal exemptions would go away in favor of a large standard deduction. Some of the details still haven't been ironed out, but using the proposed tax brackets in the plan would produce the following tax bill: Category Single Example Married Example Starting earnings $100,000 $100,000 Retirement account contribution ($5,000) ($5,000) Standard deduction ($15,000) ($30,000) Taxable income $80,000 $65,000 Tentative tax $15,125 $7,800 Child tax credit $0 $2,000 Final tax bill $15,125 $5,800 Calculations by author. It's not entirely clear whether the Trump tax plan would preserve the child tax credit in its current form or replace it with other incentives based on child care. However, the example above shows how even though taxable income won't change that much as a result of the proposed reforms, the combination of some minor taxable income reductions and the impact of replacing the current 10% and 15% brackets with a 12% bracket creates substantial tax savings. The federal government has the right to change tax laws all the way until the end of the year -- and then some, based on a few extraordinary situations in which lawmakers imposed retroactive changes all the way back to the beginning of the previous year. That said, there has been some disagreement between the White House and Capitol Hill regarding exactly what shape tax reform should take, and intra-party squabbling has some policymakers thinking that tax reform itself is at risk of not getting done this year. Moreover, even if a tax bill does become law, elected officials might decide it's easier to implement the changes for 2018 rather than trying to make them retroactive to the 2017 tax year. Nevertheless, it's valuable to take a look at these different proposals to see how they might affect you. That way, you'll be prepared for whatever comes, and you'll be better able to assess any alternative proposals that might arise in the coming months. ","
      
    How Much Will I Pay in 2017 Taxes if I Make $100,000? -- The Motley Fool

Tim Hanson,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. IMAGE SOURCE: SNAP. Given the overlap between the user bases of Robinhood and Snap -- both skew heavily millennial -- this may seem like smart investing. It was none other than master investor Peter Lynch who advised a generation of individual investors to strongly consider buying the stocks of companies with whose products they were familiar (the oft-quoted ""buy what you know""). But early investors in Snap's publicly listed shares have already experienced quite the ride. After spiking in its first days of trading as investors clamored for the shares, demand has declined and Snap is down more than 25% from its intraday high. Where does Snap go from here? I won't pretend to know. But no matter what happens next, beginner investors who bought shares of the company should be proud that they got started investing in stocks and -- provided they stick with it -- stand to learn a lot about investing. As for what those lessons will be, that's going to depend on whether or not Snap succeeds as an investment. Let's take a look at three potential lessons from two possible futures. From competition to questionable economics, there are a lot of forces working against Snap's success. But if there is something working for it, it's the obvious dedication and vision of co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel. While Spiegel is a somewhat controversial figure, it's clear from the company's prospectus that he has strong opinions about the future of Snap. From declaring that Snap is a camera company to being explicit about the company's willingness to take risks to build engaging products, this is not a company that it will inadvertently lose its strategic direction. In fact, in order to be sure that the direction of Snap is determined by Spiegel and Spiegel alone, the shares of stock that Snap sold to investors do not have any voting rights. That means shareholders can't weigh on management performance, the composition of the board, or even executive compensation. What's more, Spiegel continues to own nearly 20% of the company, giving him a vested interest in increasing the value of the firm. There is a tradition of visionary CEOs from Sam Walton to Steve Jobs to Jeff Bezos to Mark Zuckerberg who have seemingly willed their companies to greatness even when Wall Street didn't understand what those executives were trying to accomplish. If Snap succeeds from here, Spiegel is in a position to be added to that list and serve as another example that leadership is as fundamental to investing success as financials. Snap investors are undoubtedly feeling some anxiety around the company's recent 25% plunge. And regardless of whether Snap wins or loses for investors, investors should be prepared for frequent additional significant plunges. Consider, for example, Michael Batnicks' recent look at the performance of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) over time. He observes eloquently that ""Amazon's path to a 38,000% return was filled with heartache, despair, and nausea."" That's because it experienced a three-day 15% or more decline 107 different times.  Amazon, however, stayed focused on running its business, and Amazon investors who did the same have been handsomely rewarded for tolerating that volatility. The lesson for Snap investors is that even if the stock works out to be a fantastic, this won't be the only time you may feel sick to your stomach. Credit Suisse strategist Michael Mauboussin recently put out a paper on base rates -- a study of the frequency with which certain events actually happen. In the case of three-year sales growth, for example, he finds that while analysts forecast a fairly normal distribution of results, that forecast is far too narrow. There are fewer -10% to 10% growers than expected and more companies than forecast that experience sales declines or more than 10% or sales growth of greater than 10%. That's particularly true of companies that grow sales 45% annually over a given three-year period. While analysts expect zero companies to actually achieve this feat, Mauboussin found that this has happened about 2.5% of time (or 1,318 instances between 1950 to 2015). In 2016, Snap grew sales from $58.7 million to $404.5 million -- a 589% increase. No one is expecting this rate of growth to continue. But if it does, even at a substantially lower rate, Snap may exceed expectations just as Facebook has. Predicting growth, particularly when it comes to technology, is hard, and that can be an opportunity for investors. Snap is currently worth just under $30 billion. Today, an average company trades for approximately 25 times its annual earnings. Ergo, were Snap an average company, we would expect annual profits of $1.1 billion. But Snap is not an average company. I know this because Snap did not make $1.1 billion last year. Rather, it lost $514 million. Should a company that's losing half a billion dollars annually be worth $27.5 billion? Historically, the answer to that question has been ""no."" This is to say that Snap not only has to reverse those losses to justify its current valuation, but it has to make a lot of money in the future to not only maintain that valuation, but to cause it to increase (which is how investors will make money from here). If that doesn't happen, Snap shares may underperform even if the business continues to operate respectably.  That's what happens when investors overpay. Even if you believe Snap's visionary leadership sets it up for success, vision without accountability is a potentially dicey proposition -- and that's exactly what Snap has offered with the combination of founder control and non-voting shares. Consider, for example, the plight of overconfident CEOs (and categorizing Spiegel as overconfident does not seem unfair). Not only are overconfident CEOs more likely to destroy value with their investments, they are less likely to pay dividends to shareholders (meaning they retain more value to destroy) and are the most likely of all CEOs to misstate earnings results. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the mergers and acquisitions space, where 90% of deals fail to achieve pre-deal expectations. Repeat offenders in the tech space such as Yahoo! and HP continued for years to spend billions of shareholder dollars on acquisitions with little tangible benefit, and it's taken activist investors at each for management to sit up and take notice of their shortcomings. This cannot happen at Snap because investors have no say in how the business is run. If Snap fails from here, it may be because management is setting money on fire and no one can stop them. There's an obvious, but overlooked truth about initial public offerings, or IPOs. And that's that the company that's IPO-ing knows when it's going to happen. This is important because companies spend years preparing for their IPOs and they are often timed in such a way as to allow the company to put its best foot forward and realize the most favorable valuation from investors. For example, I mentioned earlier that Snap grew sales an eye-popping 589% last year. That's impressive, but it's not an accident. Snap likely focused on and spent heavily to achieve that sales growth knowing that that would be a metric valued by new investors. This is one of a number of reasons why recent IPOs are well-documented to on average underperform the market's return. Generally speaking, it's worth watching a newly public company for a period of time to see how it performs after the shine wears off and how management stands up to the new scrutiny of being public. But regardless of whether Snap is up, down, or sideways from, it should go without saying that you as an investor need to own more than just one stock. Doing so helps spread out the risk of one or more of your investments not living up to original expectations, whatever the reason. Achieving this diversification can be as easy as buying a low-cost index fund or getting into the habit of saving and regularly making new investments in stocks. Over time you should seek to build out an entire portfolio of investments to help you achieve your long-term financial goals. So congratulations if your investing journey has begun with an investment in Snap; it just shouldn't end there. ","

Selena Maranjian,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A recent study has estimated that $5.4 billion was left on the table by homeowners who didn't refinance their mortgages when they could have. The researchers found that, while most folks who could benefit did indeed refinance, about 20% did not. If you're carrying a mortgage, it's worth finding out whether you can save by refinancing. Refinancing is when you essentially trade in your current mortgage for a newer one -- ideally one with more attractive terms. The first loan gets paid off by the new one. Here are some steps you need to check before refinancing. They can help you think through and decide whether refinancing makes sense for you. Image source: Getty Images. First off, there's a rule of thumb that says, if current interest rates are at least about a percentage point higher than your current loan's rate, refinancing is likely to be worthwhile. Don't be rigid with the rule, but if the difference in rates is close to a whole percentage point, it's worth taking a closer look at refinancing. As an example, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was recently 4.32% --  up from 3.77% a year earlier. If your 30-year loan is carrying a rate of about 5.3% or more, refinancing is likely to make sense. A Bankrate.com mortgage calculator reveals that a standard $200,000 loan will sport monthly payments of $1,111 at an interest rate of 5.3%, but just $990 at 4.3%. That's a meaningful difference of $121 per month, or $1,452 per year. Image source: Getty Images. Another question to ask yourself is, how much equity do you have in your home? Lenders will generally require that you buy private mortgage insurance (PMI) if you don't have 20% equity. It's the same when you get an initial mortgage: If you pay less than 20% down, PMI is likely in the cards, adding to the expense of paying for your home. Even if you paid 20% down, though, if your home's value has fallen, your equity in it may no longer be 20%. (Indeed, some people are ""underwater"" on their loans -- meaning that they currently owe more than their homes are worth. That can make it hard to sell the home, and hard to refinance, too.) Next, consider how much overall debt you're carrying, from all sources -- such as your home loan, car loans, credit card debt, and so on. (Student loans can count, too, if they're not currently deferred.) Lenders don't want you to owe too much relative to your earnings, as that could make you a shakier borrower, so they pay close attention to your debt-to-income ratio. To calculate your debt-to-income ratio, divide the total of all your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. To qualify for most mortgages, you'll want your debt-to-income ratio to be no more than 43% -- and ideally, lower. Image source: Getty Images. Your debt-to-income ratio may have been fine when you originally bought your house, but if you have since taken on more debt, you may be a less promising borrower today. If so, it could be worth spending a little time paying down your debt before refinancing. Meanwhile, give your credit score a close look, too. In order to offer you their best rates, or at least good ones, lenders will generally like to see you with a score in the 700s -- and the higher, the better. To see just how much your credit score matters, the table below reflects recent rates for someone borrowing $200,000 via a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage: FICO Score APR Monthly Payment Total Interest Paid 760-850 3.904% $944 $139,766 700-759 4.126% $969 $148,990 680-699 4.303% $990 $156,434 660-679 4.517% $1,015 $165,541 640-659 4.947% $1,067 $184,183 620-639 5.493% $1,135 $208,492 Source: MyFICO.com, as of early March 2017. If your score was on the poor side when you initially got your mortgage, and you've improved it since then -- perhaps by paying off lots of bills on time, or paying off costly credit card debt in order to reduce your debt-to-income ratio -- you may be able to refinance at a meaningfully lower interest rate, even in an environment of rising rates. Image source: Getty Images. For example, if you started out with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), you may be facing gradually increasing interest rates over the coming years -- which will cost you more and more. You could refinance into a fixed-rate loan, locking in a low rate. (Even today's increased rates are historically very low.) Alternatively, you might switch from a 30-year fixed-rate loan to a 15-year fixed-rate loan, in order to pay the loan off sooner and pay much less in interest. It will likely entail higher monthly payments, though, so be sure you can swing those. If you're not very sure you can, there's a handy compromise: You could get a 30-year loan with no prepayment penalty and then pay significantly more than your required payment each month. That way, you can shave many years off the loan and avoid a lot of interest payments. If you're getting pre-approved for a mortgage or a refinancing, make sure that your new loan doesn't include a prepayment penalty. If you're already in a 30-year mortgage with no prepayment penalty, you may not need to refinance at all -- you can shorten the life of your loan by just plowing more money into paying down your principal. Meanwhile, if your current loan's monthly payments are too steep for you -- which might be the case if you have a 15-year mortgage now -- you might refinance into a fresh 30-year loan for the lower payments. Just know that that will be costing you a lot in interest over the long run, and that entering retirement with mortgage payments is not ideal. If you know now that you won't be in your current home more than a few more years, you might refinance from a fixed-rate loan into an ARM with lower rates. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, consider the closing costs, as refinancings feature them, too. Closing costs can amount to 2% to 5%, or more, of the value of the loan -- so if you're borrowing $200,000, you might be forking over $5,000 or more. To figure out when you'll break even, divide the closing costs by how much lower your monthly payment will be. If your costs are, say, $6,000, and you're saving $100 per month, divide $6,000 by $100, and you'll get 60. That means it will take 60 months (five years) before you'll break even. That's no problem if you expect to be in the home at least that long. But if you might be moving sooner than that, reconsider refinancing. Interest rates are inching up now -- but that doesn't mean it's too late for you to refinance your mortgage. Use the steps above to see whether you might be able to save a lot through refinancing.

    6 Steps to Check Before Refinancing Your Mortgage -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. I won't keep you in suspense -- Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) owns 400,000,000 shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), worth a total of $16.7 billion as of this writing. This translates to a 9.4% stake in the beverage giant, and makes Coca-Cola Buffett's third-largest stock investment. The investment has served Buffett and Berkshire's shareholders well. Of the Coca-Cola stake's market value, more than $15.4 billion represents profit. The $560 million in dividends it will receive this year from Coca-Cola represents nearly half of what Buffett paid for the shares in the first place. Here's why Buffett likes Coca-Cola so much, and whether you should consider joining him in the investment. Image Source: The Motley Fool. It's easy to understand why Buffett likes Coca-Cola so much. For starters, Buffett is a loyal customer and by his own estimates, consumes about one-fourth of his calories from Coca-Cola every day. From an investment perspective, the company has one of the world's strongest brand names, which allows it to charge more than rivals for essentially the same product, and to sell even more of its products all over the world. In fact, Coca-Cola has 20 different brands that generate more than a billion dollars in sales per year -- each. Buffett's feelings on Coca-Cola's brand power are summed up in one of my favorite Buffett quotes of all time: ""If you gave me $100 billion and said to take away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world, I'd give it back to you and say it can't be done."" Efficiency is another factor Buffett likely loves about Coca-Cola. The company has a massive and efficient distribution network. And, the company has an excellent balance sheet and ample cash flow to grow and diversify its product lines as management sees fit. Finally, Buffett likes Coca-Cola for one of the same reasons he thinks investors should like Berkshire Hathaway -- the company is so well-organized and efficient that it doesn't matter who is running the business, the company should do just fine over the long run. In fact, Buffett once remarked that a ""ham sandwich"" could run Coca-Cola. It's never a good idea to invest in a stock simply because a billionaire owns it -- even if that billionaire is Warren Buffett. Even the best investors are wrong from time to time, and Buffett is certainly no exception. Personally, I'm a big fan of Coca-Cola as a company. Management has done a fantastic job of growing and diversifying its products in recent years to adapt to changing consumer tastes. In fact, nearly one-third of Coca-Cola's revenue comes from non-carbonated drinks, and it is now the number one still beverage company in the world. Adaptability is one of my favorite traits in a company, especially one as big and successful as Coca-Cola. ","

If there's one thing that's certain in the world of technology, it's change. And so it goes for telecommunications giant CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL), which continues to foster its strategic revenue streams to offset declines in its legacy businesses. Of course, CenturyLink also has its hands full ensuring its impending acquisition of Level 3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT) closes as planned later this year. But in the meantime, one intriguing strategic growth opportunity for CenturyLink lies with its budding status as an IT services and enterprise cloud solutions provider. To that end, CenturyLink recently launched its new Cloud Application Manager, a ""cloud-agnostic management platform"" designed to simplify enterprise customers' deployment of workloads, managed services, and third-party cloud resources across hybrid hosting environments. CenturyLink's Cloud Application manager helps automate and manage multiple clouds from a single interface. Image source: CenturyLink According to David Shacochis, CenturyLink VP of Hybrid IT product management: Many of our customers and partners struggle with the business challenge of determining the best execution venue for their business applications. We designed Cloud Application Manager to give our customers a wide variety of infrastructure options across diverse public and private cloud environments. Cloud Application Manager helps companies avoid vendor lock-in, automate application deployments, scale workloads across disparate hosting environments, and optimize their costs over time. Better yet, CenturyLink is offering customers the flexibility to use Cloud Application Manager through either a self-service model with their own IT staff, or as one actively managed by CenturyLink's team. Cloud Application Manager also comes in either a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) version, or in a ""data center version"" with a virtual appliance that runs on-premises in the customer's data center. If all of this sounds familiar, it's likely because Cloud Application Manager leveraged CenturyLink's $20 million acquisition of multi-cloud platform specialist ElasticBox this past June. At the time, CenturyLink CTO Aamir Hussain noted their acquiree's compelling platform supported over a dozen different cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services, IBM's SoftLayer, Microsoft Azure, and VMware, as well as Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, and of course CenturyLink Cloud. As Hussain further elaborated, ElasticBox's platform freed ""businesses to focus on issues that are central to their organization rather than spending time and resources managing multiple clouds."" So what does this mean for CenturyLink's business? For perspective, during CenturyLink's quarterly conference call last month, management explained that lower-than-expected managed hosting and IT services revenue was one culprit for the company arriving near the low end of its fourth-quarter 2016 guidance. To be fair, the bulk of the blame still sat with slower growth in both CenturyLink's consumer broadband and consumer video revenue. But those obviously troublesome segments come with their own challenges. And any relative success CenturyLink can garner through current and forthcoming products like Cloud Application Manager could serve to not only drive incremental revenue themselves, but also afford the company a perfect segue into CenturyLink's other complementary IT consulting and managed services solutions. Prior to Cloud Application Manager's formal launch, for example, CenturyLink had already launched other new and expanded solutions in recent months spanning managed security services, Managed SAP and HANA, enterprise cloud and managed big data, and Big Data-as-a-Service products. CenturyLink CEO Glen Post insisted they ""have all been very well received by industry analysts and are beginning to show good traction with our customers."" In the end, then, I think investors would do well to keep a close eye on any similar signs of early traction for CenturyLink's Cloud Application Manager when the company next reports quarterly results in early May. If it proves successful, it could mean better days ahead for patient CenturyLink shareholders. ","

"Brian Feroldi, Jason Hall, Rich Duprey, Jordan Wathen, and Dan Caplinger",03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and George Soros have minted themselves a fortune by staying one step ahead of the markets. That's why we Fools like to dig through SEC filings each quarter to see what these brilliant investors have been buying or selling recently. After digging through those filings, our team of Fool contributors noticed that these investors have been selling off their positions in Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX), Transocean (NYSE:RIG), Seadrill Ltd. (NYSE:SDRL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Is it a good idea to follow suit? Image source: Getty Images. Dan Caplinger (Transocean): The offshore-drilling industry has been a tough place to make money lately, and many investors have started to lose faith in Transocean and its peers. Late last year, well-known activist investor and billionaire Carl Icahn slashed his position in Transocean, citing the need to take tax losses but also having suffered a dramatic decline in the value of the stock since his initial investment. Transocean and offshore drillers in general have been among the hardest hit in the industry, largely because the projects that rely on the company's drilling rigs tend to be more expensive than land-based exploration activity. When oil prices were above $100 per barrel, the higher potential reward made offshore drilling worth the effort, and that helped push demand for drilling equipment much higher. Yet when the energy market went into the tank, Transocean found itself with clients who no longer wanted to move full steam ahead on expensive offshore projects. In the aftermath, gluts of equipment have contributed to lower contract rates. Currently, Transocean is at a turning point. Current oil prices have rebounded somewhat, but they still aren't high enough to justify a return to full capacity. If oil rises further, then Transocean is in a position to recover its losses. But if oil sags, it could spell a long-term problem for Transocean and its growth prospects. Rich Duprey (Barrick Gold): Considering his track record lately, investors might not want to follow the moves billionaire investor George Soros is making these days, but he's not a billionaire for nothing. Soros Fund Management reportedly lost $1 billion betting against a market rally following Donald Trump's election and in the fourth quarter dumped all of its holdings in Barrick Gold, only to see shares of the miner surge this year. While it had jumped as much as 50% between its mid-December lows and the peak it hit mid-February, it's eased back a bit since, and investors should consider which way it will go from here. After all, Soros' biggest sin may have been simply selling too early -- but if we look at Barrick Gold's bigger picture, I'd say no, don't follow Soros' lead here. In its fourth-quarter earnings report last month, the gold miner reduced its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) to just $732 per ounce, or 40% below gold's current price. It shows that the cost-cutting initiatives Barrick has implemented are bearing fruit, and the gains are expected to accelerate this year, with AISC falling even further. The gold miner has paid off a good chunk of its long-term debt, and though it still carries some $8 billion worth on its balance sheet, there isn't much coming due anytime soon. Moreover, Barrick owns five core mines that should produce 70% of its volumes this year, with ore grades that are more than double that of the miner's peer group. It also expects to produce some 5.9 million ounces this year, or 5% more than in 2016. There's good reason to keep betting on gold generally and Barrick Gold in particular, and following George Soros in dumping your shares might just tarnish your portfolio. Brian Feroldi (Facebook): With a net worth of roughly $13 billion, Steven Cohen is one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. That's why it caught my attention when I found out that Point72 Asset Management -- one of Cohen's hedge funds -- dumped 96% of his position in Facebook in the fourth quarter. If you look at the numbers, you might be scratching your head as to why Cohen would want to give up on Facebook right now. Last quarter, Facebook's revenue surged 51% while expenses grew by only 29%. The difference caused margins to balloon and allowed EPS to more than double. Those are impressive figures for any company, let alone a megacap like Facebook. Given those terrific results, my hunch is that Cohen is worried that Facebook's revenue is going to significantly decelerate in the years ahead. That's a legitimate concern now that the company's ad load is leveling off. Furthermore, expenses are expected to continue to rise significantly as the company adds engineering talent. That could lead to a meaningful slowdown in profits. With shares trading near an all-time high, perhaps he wanted to cash in his chips while he could. Regardless of Cohen's move, I for one couldn't be more excited about Facebook's long-term potential. That's why I have no intentions to part ways with my shares anytime soon. Jason Hall (Seadrill Ltd.): After the company disclosed in its most recent quarterly earnings filing that Chapter 11 bankruptcy is on the table, investors of every ilk -- not just billionaires -- have been selling off shares of Seadrill. And for good reason, since the company is facing more than $1 billion in debt it must pay off between now and June, with hundreds of millions of it maturing at the end of April. As things stand today, the writing's on the wall that the company won't pay off that first debt maturity, which would put it in default on essentially all of its long-term debt soon after. Should you follow the rest of Seadrill's investors to the exits? Probably, yes, if you have capital at risk that you really can't afford to lose. The offshore-drilling industry remains an awful business right now. Offshore oil and gas producers are on track to spend less capital this year than anytime in the past decade-plus. There's still a chance that Seadrill can turn things around and come to terms with its debt holders, in which case today's price will end up being a bargain. If you're willing to take on that risk -- and acknowledge you could end up with nothing -- there's a case for staying invested. Just don't be shocked if it doesn't work out. Jordan Wathen (Wal-Mart): Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, nearly blew out of its billion-dollar position in Wal-Mart in the most recent quarter. And while Wal-Mart may have been a small part of Berkshire's portfolio, few likely know more about Wal-Mart than Warren Buffett does. In May 2003, Berkshire Hathaway acquired a little-known Wal-Mart subsidiary known as McLane Company, a distributor of groceries and foods to stores all around the country. Shortly after that acquisition, in 2005, Berkshire purchased shares of Wal-Mart, perhaps having learned to appreciate the retailer's operations after observing it through McLane Company. More than a decade after Berkshire's investment, Buffett apparently wants out. Wal-Mart finds itself situated between fierce competition in grocery and general merchandise. In grocery, competitors such as Aldi, which has quietly opened more than 1,600 stores in the U.S., many of which are located in proximity to Wal-Mart stores, competes directly on price for core grocery items including milk and produce. In general merchandise, online stores such as Amazon.com have the lead in distribution and can deliver products directly to their customers' doors, often at a better price. Buffett has shared his praise for Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, telling CNBC last May, ""We haven't seen many businessmen like him."" Keep in mind that Berkshire is awash in cash and prefers to leave gains unharvested rather than collect its winnings and pay taxes. That Berkshire is reassessing its stake in Wal-Mart should give shareholders pause about the company, and retail in general. ","

Maurie Backman,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Many financial experts rely on the 4% rule to guide their retirement savings advice. And while the rule certainly has merit, it's not without flaws. Here, we'll take a deep dive into the 4% rule and review its strengths and weaknesses. Developed by William Bengen in the mid-1990s, the 4% rule states that if you withdraw 4% of your savings during your first year of retirement, and then adjust withdrawals for inflation going forward, there's a strong chance your savings will last 30 years. As an example, if you were to kick off retirement with a savings balance of $600,000, you'd withdraw $24,000 your first year and then adjust future withdrawals upward to keep pace with inflation. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Given that Americans are living longer these days, planning for a 30-year retirement is an unquestionably smart move. The only problem is that the 4% rule has some inherent defects that, if followed, could dash that 30-year dream. The 4% rule is based on a number of assumptions, the most potentially fatal of which is the idea that the typical retiree's portfolio will consist of 40% to 50% bonds, and that those bonds will pay enough interest to reasonably keep up with inflation. But as anyone who's currently invested in bonds will tell you, today's interest rates are nothing to write home about, and they're considerably lower than what rates looked like back when the rule was established. If you're looking at portfolio that's 50% bonds (which isn't unreasonable, as we're often advised to shift toward bonds as retirement nears), but those bonds are only capable of producing a fraction of their once-anticipated income, an annual withdrawal rate of 4% could be downright infeasible. Another problem with the 4% rule is that it assumes a rather even market performance over time. But what happens if a downturn hits just before you're set to retire? If your investments take a dive, you'll risk depleting your savings sooner than expected if you stick to a 4% withdrawal rate. Then there's the opposite scenario: What if the market exceeds expectations during your withdrawal period? You could end up shortchanged if you limit yourself to a 4% withdrawal rate, and while that's far better than running out of savings, it also means losing out on a chance to enjoy your money while you're still alive. The value of the 4% rule is that it serves as a benchmark for savings -- plus, it's pretty easy to use. Let's say you expect to need $4,000 a month in retirement income, $1,500 of which will come from Social Security. That leaves you with a $2,500-a-month gap, or $30,000 a year that will need to come from independent savings. Multiply that amount by 25, and you'll arrive at a $750,000 savings target. Once you establish your own target, you can use this helpful calculator to see whether your savings are likely to amount to the total you'll need. Or, you can use common sense to see whether you're on track. If, for example, you're 50 years old and have just $50,000 saved for retirement, you don't need a calculator to tell you that without a major ramp-up in savings, you're not going to hit a $750,000 goal. Similarly, if you're 40 years old but have not yet saved a dime, you'll need to get moving if you want a shot at a secure retirement. ","

                                   Waymo LLC against Uber, is the alleged theft by a former manager of Google’s project, Anthony Levandowski. Waymo alleges that six weeks before resigning, Levandowski copied 14,000 confidential files and trade secrets from his company-issued laptop. Among those files were designs for Google’s custom-designed Lidar system, the technology that gives autonomous vehicles their vision. The suit alleges those designs were used for Levandowski’s self-driving truck startup, Otto, which was bought by Uber just a few months after it launched. Waymo learned of the alleged theft when a Lidar component supplier inadvertently attached machine drawings of what was said to be Uber’s Lidar circuit board in an email, a design it said is strikingly similar to Waymo’s own unique design. “One of the most powerful parts of our self-driving technology is our custom-built Lidar,” the Waymo team wrote in a blog post detailing the suit. Waymo’s Lidar technology and the intellectual property associated with it “are some of Waymo’s most valuable assets,” it said. Uber said it has determined Waymo’s claims to be a “baseless attempt to slow down a competitor,” a spokeswoman said. “We look forward to vigorously defending against them in court.” Lidar, which started out as an acronym for “light detection and ranging,” is a scanning and mapping technology made of remote sensing technology that emits high-frequency focused laser beams to measure distances between one or more sensors and external objects. That data is then used to compute distances and ranges to create a three-dimensional image of the world seen in real time. Lidar systems are made up of thousands of hardware and software components, including Lidar sensors that enable self-driving cars to see their surroundings and detect obstacles. While a prominent electric-car company in Silicon Valley believes in a different technology, Waymo believes Lidar will be one of the keys to a self-driving future. Lidar has been evolving since its first use in the early 1960s, after the invention of the laser. One early use was on the Apollo 15 mission in 1971, when astronauts used a laser altimeter to map the surface of the moon. It has been used to map particles in atmospheric research and, in recent years, to create three-dimensional maps, such as in Google Maps and Google Earth. “The fact that Lidar is a key culprit in this [lawsuit] story shows how valuable it is,” said Alex Lidow, the co-founder and CEO of Efficient Power Conversion, or EPC, a decade-old privately held developer of transistors that are used in Lidar systems. Lidow said that his company did not send the accidental email to Waymo and added that he cannot confirm his Lidar customers, since EPC has non-disclosure agreements with them. Lidar is such an important component in the self-driving-car race that it has brought new attention to older companies like Velodyne Inc., founded in 1983 in Morgan Hill, Calif. Velodyne’s first major Lidar sensors were used in systems on five of the six self-driving vehicles that completed the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, one of several races created to inspire research into autonomous cars; two years later, Google started working on self-driving cars, with Velodyne Lidar systems on the roof. See also: Why the father of the self-driving car left Google Currently, self-driving cars involved in test drives are easily recognizable because they have a rotating Lidar device, cameras and other gadgets on the roof, somewhat similar to the cars that take images for Google Street View. But the high-end version of these systems can cost as much as $70,000 or more, a prohibitive cost for a vehicle to be privately owned or to be part of a corporate fleet of self-driving taxis or trucks. Last August, Velodyne received $150 million in investments from Ford Motor Co.

                                   to help the company quickly mass produce more affordable automotive sensors. Since then, Velodyne unveiled a design for a new Lidar sensor, aimed at lowering the cost. In January, it announced the opening of a new megafactory in San Jose, Calif., to ramp up production of its latest 3-D Lidar sensors and meet high global demand, as well as a new R&D facility in Alameda, Calif. Its newest design for a Lidar sensor seeks to get the cost of a subsystem to less than $50. Lidar technology has also captured the attention of several startup companies. But the one that has received the most attention is Quanergy Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., which is focused on a compact, low-cost, automotive-grade Lidar sensor and system to make self-driving cars more affordable when they are ready for prime time. The company was co-founded in 2012 by Chief Executive Louay Eldada, who has a Ph.D. in optoelectronics and 36 issued patents, with 35 patents pending, according to his LinkedIn bio. “We looked around to see what other people are doing and we didn’t see anything close” to Quanergy, said Martin Eberhard, co-founder and former CEO of Tesla Inc.

Wardenclyffe was part of a group that invested in Quanergy in its Series A round in December 2014. “Lidar solves a real problem,” Eberhard said, explaining that with the really accurate 3-D maps Lidar creates, it “gives you the exact distance of the object everywhere it can see.” Quanergy has since become a rare unicorn company in the hardware arena, thanks to a Lidar system that can be discretely hidden behind a panel on a front bumper of a car. In August, Quanergy raised $90 million in a Series B round at a valuation of well over $1 billion. Its latest solid state Lidar costs $1,000 per sensor in small quantities, and $250 each in volumes of 100,000 Other Lidar sensor startups include LeddarTech Inc. in Quebec City, Canada; Phantom Intelligence Inc. in Quebec; and TrilLumina in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which has raised $27 million in funding, and grew out of the Sandia National Laboratories. Don’t miss: Want to invest in self-driving cars? Check out the chips There is not a lot of market data yet on Lidar. According to data from Strategic Analytics and Bernstein Research, the total number of Lidar sensors sold in 2014 was about 1 million units, with expectations that the total will grow to around 4 million units in 2019. Quanergy said the total addressable market for Lidar is about $2 billion in 2020, growing to about $5 billion by 2015. Other potential markets Quanergy is targeting for Lidar include advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), security, industrial automation, 3D mapping, drones, robotics and for smart homes. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk is not a fan, and his aversion to Lidar brings up some questions about how widespread its use will be. He believes radar-based visual systems are better, and is focusing on those for Tesla’s self-driving automobiles. Unlike radar, Lidar cannot penetrate fog, heavy rain, or snow, but radar has its own issues, including difficulty detecting non-moving objects and certain materials such as metallic objects. “One of the key debates today around enabling technologies is whether or not Lidar will be necessary and whether [the] cost of Lidar can come down enough for it to be an integral part of the vehicle,” wrote Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst, in a recent report on the electronic revolution in the automotive industry. Rasgon believes that radar in conjunction with cameras may become more widely used than Lidar. “Radar is easier, cheaper, more ubiquitous,” he said in an interview. “Ideally, you would want to use the cheapest solution that you can...The performance is very good in Lidar, but if you can get by with cameras and radar, that is probably the best way to go.” Tesla too is involved in its own lawsuit, including allegations of intellectual property theft, in this emerging industry. Earlier this year, Tesla sued Sterling Anderson, the former head of its autopilot program, and Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google’s self-driving car business, for improper recruiting of engineers and for intellectual property theft, for allegedly stealing “hundreds of gigabytes” of confidential information for their new startup, Aurora Innovation LLC. Aurora’s co-founder told The Wall Street Journal in an email that Tesla’s suit was “meritless.” It’s not clear which system is the best and it may come down to which technology has the best mix of accuracy, low cost and compact form factor. Google’s Waymo said in the lawsuit that by designing its Lidar systems itself, it has already driven down the costs; its Lidar systems are now less than 10% of the cost of Lidar systems just a few years ago. Read also: Don’t expect to buy a self-driving car anytime soon “Waymo expects mass production of their technology will make it ever more affordable,” the company said in its suit. It also lowered the cost by inventing and patenting a design that simplified the circuit to control the paths of the lasers, compared with what is used now. If Uber settles or loses this intellectual property suit, it’s going to be another setback for the ride-hailing app company, already under fire for failing to deal with sexual harassment claims. In an interesting twist, Uber’s Otto unit had already, according to Reuters, purchased a Lidar sensor company, called Tyto Lidar. Its co-founder and CEO, Brent Schwarz, is now in charge of business operations & strategic partnerships at Otto, according to his LinkedIn profile, which says Tyto Lidar was acquired in May 2016. It is far too early to tell how these suits will shape up if they get to trial. It’s unlikely that any of these companies will want any trade secrets bandied around in court documents or on the witness stand, no matter how redacted they may be. But it is clear that in Waymo’s suit against Uber, Lidar is the star technology in this lawsuit and if it goes to trial, it will be a fascinating look at an evolving young industry and one of its potential core technologies.

The Reelist is a column featuring Kristen Page-Kirby’s musings on movies. For Washington Post film critic Ann Hornaday’s review of “Beauty and the Beast,” click here. As a book-loving teenage girl, I was pretty much required to adore 1991’s animated “Beauty and the Beast.” As a professional cynic, I was pretty much required to be wary of Disney’s live-action remake — and I was. I am here to report, though, that the legacy of the original is in loving, capable hands, and those hands have crafted a piece of art that is part homage, part update and very nearly all wonderful. So let’s talk about the “exclusively gay moment” people are freaking out about! Once upon a time, movies pretended that everyone was straight, the same way they pretended that no one ever had sex before marriage. Enter the “coded gay,” those characters whose sexuality was given a wink and a nod. My favorites are Martin Landau in “North by Northwest,” Marlene Dietrich in “Morocco” and basically everything Peter Lorre ever did. This code was the cinematic equivalent of pretending those nice older ladies who live next door to you are just roommates; it made it possible to represent a gay character while nearly entirely divorcing him or her from any sort of romantic or sexual life. Some say LeFou (played by Josh Gad in the “Beauty and the Beast” update), sidekick to the brutal, moronic Gaston (Luke Evans), was always coded gay. I disagree — leading one rousing song in praise of your burly best friend does not a homosexual make — but it’s not a completely unfounded argument. I’m not going to get into the specifics of THE MOMENT, partially because it’s less than two seconds long and partially because it’s not like any trouser snakes run rampant on screen. (I’m also not going to tell you the other two LGBTQ-friendly moments I spotted. It’s like a sexual orientation scavenger hunt!) THE MOMENT simply suggests that LeFou might get his own happily ever after, and that he might spend it with a guy. And that, I think, is why some people — many of whom, I wager, have not SEEN THE MOVIE — are freaking. Disney has presented a gay man as a normal part of the world. Which should not be surprising, since gay men are, you know, a normal part of the world. In cracking the code, Disney has made it impossible for people to separate LeFou from his romantic life, and that’s what makes some people uncomfortable. Removing sexual or romantic interests from LGBTQ characters (and people) makes them safer to those who consider them dangerous. That’s how people who are opposed to the “homosexual lifestyle” can still love their daughter’s soccer coach (and her “roommate”) or the church choir director who just never found the right girl. It’s OK to be gay — just don’t have any romantic or sexual interests. All THE MOMENT does is break LeFou out of the coded closet and make his sexuality a part of his life. After all, Belle’s sexuality is a part of hers, in this movie where the main lessons involve looking past differences and celebrating love, even when it’s between two members of different species. Disney hasn’t made LeFou gay. They’ve just made him fully human.

Jack Nicas,03162017,MarketWatch,03092017,"Published: Mar 16, 2017 9:03 p.m. ET ‘Beauty and the Beast’ promo may usher in new way to monetize the voice-activated helper By Google’s smart home speakers on Thursday played an unprompted promotion for Walt Disney Co.’s new “Beauty and the Beast” movie, the first sign of how the world’s largest advertising company could shoehorn ads into its growing number of voice interactions with users. Users of Google’s voice-controlled speaker, called Google Home, heard a 17-second promotion for the movie, after asking the devices about the their schedule. “By the way, Disney’s live-action Beauty and the Beast opens today,” the device said, according to user videos. After mentioning a detail about the movie, it said, “For some more movie fun, ask me to tell you something about Belle,” a main character in the film. The promotion, which appeared to be Google’s first attempt to test advertising on Google Home, reflects a new balancing act between monetizing new search formats and users’ tolerance for more ads. The promotion was also read aloud on some smartphones that run Google Assistant, the company’s digital-assistant technology that also underpins its speakers. Joseph Vorbeck, a 32-year-old web developer in New York City, said he wasn’t pleased to hear the Disney promotion after his Google Home told him the weather and his schedule for the day. “It was kind of jarring,” he said. Advertising on the device “would really ruin the experience for me.” Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc.

Kari Paul,03162017,MarketWatch,03092017,"Published: Mar 13, 2017 6:03 a.m. ET A new WikiLeaks report alleges the CIA may be tapping our phones By Ever feel like someone is watching you? You may not be paranoid. A new round of documents regarding government surveillance was unveiled by WikiLeaks on Tuesday, alleging that the Central Intelligence Agency hacks smartphones, computers and connected TVs to spy on American citizens and others around the world. (The CIA declined a request for comment.) To be clear, the techniques released in these documents are “very targeted,” said Sydney, Australia-based security researcher Troy Hunt. “Authorities would want to have a very good reason to use those techniques and the vast majority of people are outside the scope of what they’d be used for,” he said. Still, the revelations are not the first to suggest the government is surveilling citizens — in fact, they aren’t much different from the documents National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked in 2013, according to Mark Weinstein, a privacy advocate and chief executive officer of social network MeWe. He said each new round of revelations fuels the growing anxiety U.S. citizens have about being watched. “People are feeling an overwhelming sense of being creeped out by the aggregate of these stories,” he said. For average citizens starting to think about how to keep their communications out of reach of Big Brother, here are some of the ways to lock down devices and keep government entities, advertisers and corporations out of your daily lives. Use encrypted communication To avoid surveillance — by governments or others users — you should switch to more secure apps for messaging, like Signal, which is free for download on iTunes and Google Play. The app, which is recommended by Snowden himself to avoid surveillance, allows users to send encryption-protected information to others who also use the app and collects and stores very little data about users. WhatsApp, for example, is also encrypted but does store metadata — the information about who you are messaging and where, and is owned by Facebook

Similarly, iMessage is encrypted by default, but Apple

                                   still stores metadata on user conversations for up to 30 days and can hand the information over to law enforcement with a warrant. Messaging on iPhone is also only encrypted between two iPhone users, so texting Android users will revert messages to unencrypted SMS. Apple had a standoff with law enforcement over equipping devices with so-called “back doors” to enable them to access user information. The issue came to a boiling point when Apple refused to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock the iPhone of the man who carried out a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. in 2016. No method is 100% secure, as the documents released Tuesday allege that the CIA has been able to access phones directly, bypassing encryption. This means they could install keyloggers or other surveillance tools directly onto user devices, intercepting communication at the source. “Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage are all encrypted end to end and the techniques for ’circumvention’ are akin to looking over someone’s shoulder as they type their messages into a secure platform like these,” Hunt said For nonmobile devices, users can implement PGP, a protocol that stands for “Pretty Good Privacy,” to encrypt and protect email. Cover up your webcams The documents released by WikiLeaks allege that the CIA built hacking tools that could remotely control devices including iPads, iPhones, Android devices and computers — hacking the camera and microphone to secretly record video and sound. A simple, cheap way to put a stop to this is to cover the camera with electrical tape or a Post-it Note. In fact, Snowden did just that in “Citizen 4,” the 2014 documentary made about him. Any opaque material works, but there are also a number of novelty stickers sold online to cover everything from computer cameras to iPad and iPhone devices. Buy stickers from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights for legislation that protects civil liberties against surveillance, and you can support internet freedom for the world while implementing your own. Update your devices Keeping your devices updated is a basic way to prevent hacking and other security breaches. Phones that are not updated are much more likely to be compromised, as a number of high-profile bugs have shown in recent years. In 2015 a flaw was discovered in 95% of Androids that allowed the phones to be hacked with a simple text, and a similar iPhone flaw was found just months before that. Apple can push out fixes to users remotely, but Google doesn't — making it all the more important to click that pesky “update your device” pop up whenever you see it. Don’t miss:  7 ways to keep your smart home from being hacked “You have to take care of basic cyber hygiene,” said Michael Kaiser, head of the public-private partnership to educate the public on digital privacy and security at the National Cyber Security Alliance. “Keep software up-to-date, and use strong passwords and two factor authentication.” Secure your smart TV (or don’t buy one) One of the hacks allegedly implemented by the CIA that WikiLeaks data revealed acts as a bug on Samsung TVs, allowing the agency to record citizens even after they had turned the TV off. Users can disable the features on Samsung that allow outsiders to snoop under ‘settings.’ Scroll to support, then ‘terms and policies’ and turn off voice-related services on the TV. However, Weinstein said the only sure way for users to prevent this is to unplug the TV completely when it is not being used — or avoid buying smart TVs at all. Users may run into issues with DVR and other “off-TV” capabilities, but without camera or audio capabilities, TVs will be less likely to monitor consumers. Buy a “dumb” TV and use a device like Apple TV that collects less information. A number of models come without video, microphones and other extras. Cover your tracks on social media Even without the government looking over our shoulders, social media makes it easy to give away a lot of privacy on our own, posting vacation photos and other personal details. Going completely dark on social media — deleting Facebook and Instagram accounts and moving to a cabin in the woods to avoid tracking — may be too extreme for the average consumer. It’s better to “start with what we can do,” said Weinstein. This includes steps as simple as switching from Google

While the WikiLeaks allegations center on government surveillance, Weinstein said, they are contributing to an awareness of how often we are watched in places that were once private, like the living room. “This is a lot bigger than ‘I have nothing to hide,’” Weinstein said. “This is about the fundamental right to enjoy your life without having someone over your shoulder watching.

Natalia Drozdiak,03162017,MarketWatch,03092017,"Published: Mar 16, 2017 8:05 a.m. ET By BRUSSELS--The European Union's antitrust agency is scrutinizing whether algorithms make it easier for companies to collude over prices online and is considering stricter fines for cartels using those tools, the bloc's competition chief said Thursday. At issue are programs companies use that continuously crawl the internet to check prices in online shops. That software allows the firms to monitor or adjust prices automatically, thereby potentially helping cartels operate more effectively. ""We need to keep an eye out for cartels that use software to work more effectively,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a speech at an event hosted by the Germany's Federal cartel office. ""If those tools allow companies to enforce their cartels more strictly, we may need to reflect that in the fines that we impose."" In a joint report last year, the German and French competition authorities raised the issue of tacit or explicit collusion through transparency of online prices. Ms. Vestager noted that the practice of using automated price systems was common: around two-thirds of retailers who track rival's prices use automated systems, some of which also use the software to automatically adjust prices. She referred to one example where two different companies sold posters of music artists like Justin Bieber and agreed not to undercut each other's prices on Amazon.com Inc.

                                   by using pricing algorithms to ensure their prices were matched. Still, she said, not all automated pricing systems are necessarily suspicious, such as algorithms to find the lowest prices, like air fares. Antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Britain have already investigated some automated pricing cases, such as the posters case. The EU, meanwhile, is looking at whether software has limited the ability of retailers to set their own prices for consumer electronics, in a recently announced e-commerce case, she said. The EU watchdog said that while the previous antitrust cases dealt primarily with agreements put in place by people and implemented by computers, she said there was capacity for illegal collusion agreements to be struck directly between different companies' software. ""We need to make it very clear that companies can't escape responsibility for collusion by hiding behind a computer program,"" she said, adding that companies should build pricing algorithms in a way that doesn't allow them to collude with others. -Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com ",EU examines role of algorithms in price collusion - MarketWatch
Kelsey Sheehy,03162017,MarketWatch,03092017,"Published: Mar 16, 2017 1:34 p.m. ET It depends on your situation By This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Congratulations! You picked an internet provider. The hard part is over, right? Well, almost. After you select your speed — and your bundle, if you go that route — you need to make one last decision: Rent a modem and router from your provider or buy your own. Running the numbers makes the decision easy. You need a modem for your internet to work. If you want Wi-Fi, you’ll need a router, too. Internet providers typically charge $10 to $15 a month to lease an all-in-one modem and router. So, over two years, you’ll pay $240 to $360 for your modem-router combo. But you can purchase your own modem and router, separately or in a combo unit, for less than the cost of renting. A Netgear high-speed cable modem-router combo sells for around $70 on Amazon

                                   Cable or Cox Communications. Most tech experts suggest opting for a separate modem and router over a combo unit. The reason: You can get more out of your router — features, settings and power — if it’s a stand-alone unit. Buying your modem and router will save you money in the long run, but there are a few scenarios in which renting makes sense. You have roommates. Splitting the cost of a modem and router is easy. Figuring out how to divvy up the device should one or more roommates move out — not so much. Unless you can settle on a system that works for everyone, renting and splitting the bill will likely save headaches down the road. Your employer foots the bill. Some lucky folks don’t pay for their internet service. Instead, their company pays the monthly bill. They may not pay for equipment, though. If that’s you, don’t dig into your wallet for a new modem. You’re moving soon. If your living situation is temporary, renting might make the most sense. Especially if you don’t know where you’ll land next and what your internet options will be when you get there. That said, if you know those things, you might be able to buy equipment that will work when you settle into more permanent digs. If you’re particularly tech averse, you may also be inclined to rent, since your internet provider may offer free troubleshooting and repair services only on modems leased or purchased through it. Just keep in mind that most modems and routers are easy to set up and require little to no fiddling once they’re up and running. Routers are universal and can be used with any internet service provider. Modems are a slightly different story. First, you need to make sure the modem’s compatible with your internet provider. Most carriers have a list of approved modems on their website and many major providers allow the same devices. So you can often keep your modem if you switch providers, as long as it’s the same type of internet service (cable, DSL or fiber). Some providers, like Verizon Fios, don’t let customers use their own equipment. But Fios customers can opt to buy their modem directly from Verizon,

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    VZ, +0.44%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                   an option that will save you roughly $90 over two years compared with renting. The next step: Make sure the modem has staying power. This rule applies even if you’re buying it directly from your provider. Internet speeds are only getting faster and older modems — those with DOCSIS 2.0 technology — top out at 38 Mbps download speeds. If you’re paying for internet speeds of 30 Mbps or higher, or think you might in the future, spring for a model with DOCSIS 3.0 technology. These support speeds up to 150 Mbps, which is plenty fast for even the most connected families. Once you’ve settled on a compatible modem, consider buying a used or refurbished model. You’ll save even more money and lose little to nothing in terms of performance. Just make sure you’re clear on the return policy should you have any issues. Buying a modem and router will increase your upfront costs, but lower your monthly internet bill. Most tech experts suggest buying separate devices, but a combo unit will get the job done if you’re trying to keep things simple. Either way, you’ll save money in the long run. And that’s always a smart decision. More from NerdWallet: Kelsey Sheehy is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website. Email: ksheehy@nerdwallet.com. Twitter: @KelseyLSheehy.

Quentin Fottrell,03162017,MarketWatch,03092017,"Published: Mar 11, 2017 7:12 a.m. ET Without foreign workers, the working-age population would fall over the next 20 years By Immigration is projected to drive growth in American working-age adults. The U.S. economy churned out 235,000 new jobs in February in the first full month of the Trump White House, signaling steady growth, helped by weather-sensitive industries like construction. “The economy has added almost half a million jobs in the first two months of 2017, the best back-to-back performance since last summer,” MarketWatch reporter Jeffrey Bartash reported Friday. President Donald Trump has vowed to clamp down on immigration from certain countries and restrict H1B visas for skilled workers. But new data released this week suggests the U.S. will need more immigrants to keep the workforce growing. For most of the past half-century, baby boomers — those born after World War Two and before 1965 — have been the main driver of the nation’s expanding workforce, but now that they’re heading into retirement only two groups of workers are projected to grow over the next two decades: immigrants and those whose parents are first-generation immigrants, a new report by the Pew Research Center, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C., concluded. “The most important component of the growth in the working-age population over the next two decades will be the arrival of future immigrants,” it said. “The U.S. tech industry is utterly dependent upon foreigners, not only for workers, but for ideas and entrepreneurship,” MarketWatch columnist Rex Nutting wrote earlier this month. “Many of Silicon Valley’s best-known names were founded by immigrants (Google

Don’t miss:  5 blue-collar jobs that pay $100,000 a year The number of adults in the prime working ages of 25 to 64 — 173.2 million in 2015 — will rise to 183.2 million in 2035, Pew estimates. That growth will be lower than the total in any single decade since the baby boomers flooded the American workforce in the 1960s. The number of immigrants in the U.S. workforce will rise by 4.6% to 38.5 million from 2015 to 2035, while the number of workers whose parents are first-generation immigrants will also increase by 13.6% to 120.1 million over the same period. U.S. born workers with U.S. born parents will remain the majority, however, but will fall by 10% to 183.2 million over that same 20 years. “The increase in the potential labor force will slow markedly,” the Pew report found. The declining number of U.S.-born working-age adults with U.S.-born parents means that they will become a smaller share of the working-age population, Pew found. They will make up 66% in 2035, compared with 74% in 2015. Meanwhile, U.S.-born children of immigrants will make up a growing share of working-age adults: 13% in 2035 versus 6% in 2015. The immigrant share of working-age adults will also tick up, from 20% in 2015 to 21% in 2035. That fall in working-age adults born in the U.S. is due to ageing baby boomers and low birth rates since the 1970s. Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

Bill Bischoff,03162017,MarketWatch,03092017,"Published: Mar 9, 2017 2:38 p.m. ET By They’re both too high, right? But your debts may actually help keep the evil twin at bay. Why? At least some of that interest you shovel out each month is probably tax-deductible. Back in “the good old days,” taxpayers were allowed to deduct all their interest charges, even credit-card bills for vacations, Armani suits and movie tickets. Then, Congress caught on. Now the Tax Code permits deductions only for certain varieties of interest. This makes debt management more important than ever, because you are basically penalized by the IRS whenever you have interest that falls into the nondeductible category. Here’s a quick summary on when you get a tax break for borrowing and when you don’t. Home-mortgage interest You are allowed an itemized deduction for interest on up to $1 million worth of mortgages used to acquire or improve your main personal residence and one other home. Mortgage interest on your third personal residence and beyond is considered a nondeductible personal expense. So the tax-wise debt-management trick here is to: (1) make sure you don’t have over $1 million in mortgage debt and (2) pay cash for your third, fourth and fifth homes. We should all have such financial challenges. Interest on home-equity loan You are also allowed to claim an itemized deduction for interest on home-equity loans totaling up to $100,000, regardless of how you use the loan proceeds. The $100,000 figure is above and beyond the $1 million limit explained above. So you can actually have up to $1.1 million of debt against your first and second homes and still deduct the interest. Warning: interest on home-equity loans is deductible for alternative minimum tax (AMT) purposes only if you use the proceeds to acquire, construct or improve a first or second residence. So if you are in the AMT mode, you should understand that you may not get any tax benefit if you take out a $75,000 home-equity loan to buy a BMW and pay for your kid’s braces. On the other hand, if you spend the $75,000 to put in a swimming pool and spa alongside your house, you can deduct the interest under both the regular tax and AMT rules. Does this make any sense? Of course not, but Congress doesn’t ask for our input on tax legislation. Interest on vacation homes For most people, the vacation home is the second home and the mortgage interest will turn out to be deductible under the rules explained earlier. However, when you rent the property part of the time, the tax rules get very tricky. Nevertheless, you will usually be able to deduct all of the interest or nearly so. Investment interest When you borrow money and use the proceeds to buy taxable investment assets, the resulting interest is called investment-interest expense. The most common example: interest on broker-margin accounts. You can deduct investment interest to the extent of your taxable investment income—from interest, short-term capital gains, certain royalties and the like. If you don’t have enough investment income, the excess interest expense gets carried over to the following tax year. Hopefully, you’ll have enough investment income in that year to claim your write-off. If not, the carry-over procedure happens all over again. And so on and so on. You can also choose to treat all or part of your long-term capital gains and qualified dividends as investment income. The upside of making this choice is it allows you to currently deduct more of your investment-interest expense. The downside is the amount of long-term gains and dividends treated as investment income gets taxed at your regular rate (which can be as high as 39.6%) instead of the normal rate of 15% or 20%. (Note that these rates may change for 2017 and beyond if President Trump’s tax proposals become law.) If you have investment interest, complete IRS Form 4952 (Investment Interest Expense Deduction) to calculate your write-off. You also use this form to indicate how much of your long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, if any, you want treated as investment income. What about interest on loans used to purchase nontaxable investments, like municipal bonds or muni-bond funds? Nondeductible. Logically enough, the government won’t let you write off interest on debts used to generate income that goes untaxed. So if your investing strategy calls for some borrowing, the tax-wise trick is to spend the debt proceeds to buy taxable investments and use cash to pay for the nontaxable ones. College-loan interest Not too long ago, Congress finally gave us a much-needed tax break for up to $2,500 of annual interest on loans used to pay for college. But the deduction comes with limitations, and high-income types won’t be eligible (surprise). If you fall into the ineligible category, consider taking out a home-equity loan instead. You have a decent shot at being able to deduct the interest, as explained above. Interest on 401(k) loans This is generally nondeductible regardless of how you use the money. Sorry. But this is not really so bad, because you are basically paying interest to yourself. The potential downside of tapping this particular line of credit is that you must immediately repay the loan if you leave the company. If you don’t, you’ll be taxed as if you received a distribution equal to the loan balance. When this happens before age 59 1/2, you will generally be tagged with a 10% penalty tax to boot. So you generally shouldn’t even think about taking out a 401(k) loan unless you are darn sure you’ll be able to pay it back on time and in full. Interest on car loans, credit cards and other ‘consumer debt’ Unless you are borrowing to finance a business expenditure—like a car used in your sole-proprietorship business—you can generally forget about any tax breaks. This is why it’s often advisable to take out a home-equity loan and use the money to pay off credit-card balances and car loans. You may be able to convert high nondeductible interest charges into relatively low interest charges that are fully deductible. If so, this procedure is an excellent debt-management scheme. Just make sure you read the earlier caveats about the deductibility issue. Business interest What happens when you borrow money and use it to finance your small business? The interest is generally fully deductible just like any other garden-variety business expense. Before you jump for joy at the apparent simplicity of the preceding sentence, be warned that the IRS has a complicated set of rules which basically require you to trace the debt proceeds to business uses. If this affects you, be sure to schedule a chat with your tax accountant to talk about what exactly is needed to lock in your write-offs. This story has been updated.

Roger M. Stein,03162017,MarketWatch,03092017,"Published: Mar 13, 2017 3:15 p.m. ET Like factory work before it, Wall Street jobs are increasingly automated By President Donald Trump has vowed to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. through new policies and regulatory reform. But this effort faces a strong headwind: In all walks of life, human employment is being challenged. Many manufacturing jobs have been replaced by robots. Meanwhile, drivers are on their way to being displaced by driverless cars, tax professionals by software, and much more. Recently Trump turned his attention to the financial services industry, signing two directives aimed at repealing portions of the Dodd-Frank and Consumer Protection acts, citing onerous restrictions that hamper legitimate investing and financial activity. But regulatory change isn’t likely to repel the march of the robots that is transforming the financial services business. FinTech — the finance industry equivalent of robots in manufacturing — is too far along for that. If future investors and consumers of financial services begin to trust FinTech platforms as they have done in retail and travel, then fewer humans will be working in finance. The raw materials of finance are capital and trust. We trust banks to hold our money and give it back to us when we want it; and we trust brokerage firms to buy the securities we want at market prices and to debit and credit our accounts accordingly. How can robots replace humans in a trust intensive business? The answer lies largely in the emergence of a fundamentally new business model: the “platform” business. In a platform transaction, processes and checks and balances are done securely by machines. More importantly, customers’ wide acceptance of (and participation in) a platform business itself facilitates trust. Consider: Potential customers witness the acceptance and participation of their peers, eventually becoming comfortable enough to participate themselves. Such comfort with platforms extends broadly across industries and organizations. Indeed, trust in a platform appears to depend much more heavily on the platform and brand than on the type of business the platform provides. For example, popular internet platforms Amazon.com

                                   share three critical components: 1. Open access: Anyone with internet connectivity can participate. 2. Functionality embedded in an IT system: Automation enables customers to conduct important operations (for example: search: route; optimize, analyze). 3. Key business processes: These are enabled by the technology for business-specific activities. Amazon is a good example of such a platform, allowing anyone with network connectivity to access its complex and highly automated sales, inventory, and order fulfillment processes. Similar platforms are appearing in finance. So called robo advisers such as Betterment and peer-to-peer lending services such as Lending Club are early examples. Robo advisers allow customers to conduct investment activities such as trading and portfolio rebalancing according to client objectives. Such platforms are still rudimentary and lack many basic human capabilities such as interpreting reports and understanding the implications of policy changes and regulation. Similarly, peer-to-peer lending platforms are in their early days and being watched by regulators for unforeseen risks they could impose on borrowers and lenders.. Despite these limitations, FinTech platforms are on the rise. Robo adviser platforms do many core investment and risk-management activities quite well, and this seems to be more than adequate for large numbers of retail investors.  Peer-to-peer lending is meeting a key need and is likely to continue to grow. Specialized platforms for specific business processes such as payables, payments, and compliance (or “RegTech”) are also emerging. The emergence of these FinTech platforms will be impacted by regulation, especially as the lines between finance and technology blur and regulators need to determine whether to treat these platforms as banks or technology companies. See more:  Taxing robots is Bill Gates’s dumbest idea yet At the same time, developments in machine intelligence, learning and natural language processing are enabling computers to interpret text and unstructured inputs directly from real-world sources. This will continue to extend the capabilities of FinTech platforms. The Robo adviser platforms of the future will not only balance clients’ portfolios but may well be able to synthesize real-world developments and their implications into portfolio strategies. Regardless of the outcome of Trump’s attempts to roll back regulations enacted in the aftermath of the financial crisis, automation through FinTech is a clear trend. Partnerships between technology platforms and financial services franchises are already being formed.

                                   Watson for preparing tax returns was inadvertently juxtaposed against one for Google’s constantly connected AI- and big-data-driven “home” device. Just as H&R Block chose not to build its own Watson from scratch, other financial players are unlikely to choose to build Google’s or Amazon’s artificial intelligence and machine-learning capabilities from scratch. Platform partnerships seem much more probable, and both the current administration and regulators are unlikely to prevent a future where your financial adviser or intermediary could be a machine.

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google announced on Wednesday that it will revamp its popular maps app to allow users to share their locations, in order to boost engagement on a product of increasing strategic importance to the search giant. Within the next week, users worldwide will be able to share where they are in real time on devices running both Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc’s iOS software, Google said. The feature is part of an array of new tools aimed at boosting the effectiveness of Google Maps, which analysts say is critical to the company’s ambitions in commerce and transport. The location-sharing feature is aimed at helping people find each other in crowded places, such as concerts and conferences, and users will retain control over who they share their whereabouts with and for how long, said Google executive Jen Fitzpatrick, who leads Google Maps. “That coordination in that sort of last-mile moment winds up being sometimes more complicated than you might think,” she told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday. Location-sharing features have sparked alarm among privacy advocates in the past. To address those concerns, Google will remind users both in the app and via email of whom they are sharing their location with. While the recipient of a user’s location could pass that link onto a third party, Google will advise people to use the feature only with those they trust, said Ben Greenwood, a product manager for Google Maps. “This is not a new concept,” Fitzpatrick said of location-sharing. “This is about making it simple, accessible and giving users a lot of control and privacy.” In the coming weeks, Google will also roll out mapping features aimed at helping users find parking and remember where they parked their cars, Fitzpatrick said. Ride-hailing services have also become an important aspect of the app, and Google Maps will have partnerships with 14 companies in 70 countries by the end of the week, she said. Mapping has become a key contributor to Google’s advertising juggernaut, said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research, and the tech giant cannot afford to let the app languish. “It’s an absolutely essential service for them to drive more growth in all of their key revenue-generating businesses,” he said.

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"FRANKFURT/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Google and sister company Jigsaw are joining forces to defend election organizers and civic groups against cyber attacks free of charge as the broader tech industry seeks to fend off criticism that it is not doing enough to stop online efforts to distort elections. The growing frequency of politically-motivated online attacks — from the recent hacking of Twitter accounts by Turkish nationalists to the U.S. Democratic Party’s email breach — has left governments and pro-democracy groups scrambling for ways to thwart hackers and the rising tide of “fake” news. Alphabet Inc subsidiaries Jigsaw and Google are offering a free Protect Your Election package to low-budget organizations. The service to ward off website attacks has already been offered to news organizations for the past year under what is known as Project Shield. Last week Jigsaw, which develops security tools for civic groups, joined up with Google to defend a voter information website that came under cyber attack during the Dutch national election. The KiesKompas and Stemwijzer websites — used by about half of Dutch voters to see which parties best match their political views — were knocked out by a deluge of web traffic on March 14, which spilled over into election day. “The attack was not child’s play: it was very sophisticated because the attackers kept trying different avenues of attack again and again,” said KiesKompas director Willem Blanken. KiesKompas, which rougly translates as ChoiceCompass, enlisted the help of Jigsaw on the evening of March 14, while Stemwijzer, or VoteGuide, signed up NBIP, a non-profit group set up by about 100 Dutch internet and telecoms providers. The election guide services remained out of action on the morning of the vote, but both were successfully restored to service around midday. The rise of Google and tech rival Facebook was welcomed as a gift to democracy and free speech against autocratic governments. More recently, however, there has been a growing backlash against fake news on social media, which has polarized political debate, and the failure to stop extremist groups using their networks to spread propaganda and find new recruits. Google vowed on Tuesday to police its websites better by ramping up staff numbers and overhauling its policies after several companies deserted the internet giant for failing to keep their adverts off hate-filled videos. A spokesman for Jigsaw said on Tuesday that it plans to offer the Protect Your Election suite free to individuals and organizations involved in forthcoming national votes in France, South Korea and Germany and subsequent elections as they occur. Jigsaw is funded by Alphabet and remains autonomous from Google, though the sister companies work together on larger-scale projects. Project Shield defends against so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that have plagued the web since about 2000 and which government and commercial experts say have intensified over the past year. Such attacks have targeted not only political parties, but also election monitors and independent news organizations in Myanmar (2010), Malaysia (2013), Ecuador (2015), Mexico (2015-2016), Montenegro (2016) and the Netherlands (2017). Hundreds of companies compete to protect websites from intruders, including Clouldflare, Akamai and Imperva Incapsula. Basic measures are often free and more robust safeguards can cost hundreds of dollars a month. However, sustained high-volume attacks at decisive moments during elections can quickly run up thousands of dollars in bills — a big stretch for civic groups with minimal funding. In addition to Project Shield, Jigsaw is offering Password Alert to ward off attempts to steal Google passwords and Two-Step Verification for an added layer of protection on web and mobile accounts as part of its Protect Your Election toolkit. News websites, human rights websites and election monitoring and information websites are eligible to apply for DDoS protection, the Jigsaw spokesman said. Candidates and campaigns are eligible for the two-password protection tools, but not the free DDoS protection. More details can be found at: g.co/protectyourelection This starter set of security tools offer baseline protection but can only go so far in thwarting the dizzying array of political shenanigans that now play out in cyberspace. They could do little, for example, to ward off the hijacking of high-profile Twitter accounts by a Turkish nationalist hacker group that took place as the Dutch voted last week and attracted widespread media attention. These attacks involved hacking into an Amsterdam-based social media analytics company to post anti-Dutch and anti-German messages amid a diplomatic spat with Turkey. Officials at the Dutch election guides said that web traffic on their sites appeared to come from various nations but the identity of the attackers remains a mystery. Several of the officials denied a De Telegraaf report that Turkey was behind the attacks. “There’s just nothing to substantiate that. We simply don’t know,” KiesKompas director Blanken said. ","

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"(Reuters) - A federal judge rejected Google’s proposed class-action settlement with non-Gmail users who said it illegally scanned their emails to Gmail users to create targeted advertising. In a decision on Wednesday night, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said it was unclear that the accord, which provided no money for plaintiffs but up to $2.2 million in fees and expenses for their lawyers, would ensure Google’s compliance with federal and state privacy laws. Koh called the proposed disclosure notice inadequate. She said this was because it did not clearly reveal any technical changes that Google would make, or that Google scans non-Gmail users’ emails to create ads for Gmail users. The judge also said the notice did not make clear that Google could still extract data for the “dual purpose” of creating targeted ads and detecting spam and malware, and then use that data once emails went into storage after being transmitted. “In sum, based on the parties’ current filings, the court cannot conclude that the settlement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable,” Koh wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, declined to comment. Koh distinguished the settlement from a similar accord with Yahoo Inc that she said required more disclosures. Michael Sobol, a partner at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein representing the plaintiffs, in an interview said, “we will press on with the litigation, while exploring opportunities for a resolution consistent with the court’s decision.” He said this could include an end to the challenged scanning. The named plaintiffs, Daniel Matera of New York and Susan Rashkis of San Francisco, had accused Google of violating the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California Invasion of Privacy Act through its scanning practices. Koh ruled six days after Google won preliminary approval from a different judge in her court of a separate $22.5 million settlement with businesses over internet ad placements. In that case, known as Google AdWords Litigation, businesses accused Google of placing their ads in obscure places such as error pages and undeveloped websites known as parked domains, causing them to overpay for the placements. The case is Matera v Google Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 15-04062. ","

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Social media companies Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc will have to amend their terms of service for European users within a month or face the risk of fines, a European Commission official said on Friday. U.S. technology companies have faced tight scrutiny in Europe for the way they do business, from privacy to how quickly they remove illegal or threatening content. The Commission and European consumer protection authorities will “take action to make sure social media companies comply with EU consumer rules,” the official said. The comments confirmed a Reuters report from Thursday. Germany, the most populous EU state, said this week it planned a new law calling for social networks such as Facebook to remove slanderous or threatening online postings quickly or face fines of up to 50 million euros ($53 million). The authorities and the Commission sent letters to the companies in December saying that some of their service terms broke EU consumer protection law and that they needed to do more to tackle fraud and scams on their websites. The companies proposed some ways to resolve the issues and discussed them with the authorities and the Commission on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said, adding that the meeting was constructive. According to the letters seen by Reuters, some of those contested terms include requiring users to seek redress in court in California, where the companies are based, instead of their country of residence. Other issues include not identifying sponsored content clearly, requiring consumers to waive mandatory rights such as the right to cancel a contract, and an excessive power for the companies to determine the suitability of content generated by users, according to the letters. In the case of Alphabet’s Google unit, the concerns were about its social network Google+. Google and Facebook were not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment.

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam on Thursday called on all companies doing business there to stop advertising on YouTube, Facebook and other social media until they find a way to halt the publication of “toxic” anti-government information. At a meeting with the information and communication minister, companies including the local operations of Unilever, Ford and Yamaha Motor all committed to obey the call to suspend YouTube advertising. Last month, the communist country began putting pressure on advertisers to try to get YouTube owner Google and other companies to remove content from foreign-based dissidents. But Information and Communication Minister Truong Minh Tuan  said the response had not yet been good enough. Although there were 8,000 anti-government videos on YouTube, Google  had only blocked 42 and hadn’t removed them completely, the ministry said. “Today we call on all Vietnamese firms that are advertising not to abet them to take advertising money from firms to use against the Vietnamese government,” Tuan told companies at a meeting in Hanoi. “We also call on all internet users to raise their voice to Google and Facebook to prevent toxic, fake content violating Vietnamese law in the online environment.” YouTube reiterated its global policy of thoroughly reviewing government requests to block content they believe is illegal and restricting it where appropriate. Facebook gave no immediate response. The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry association which includes both companies, said Vietnam and its businesses benefited greatly from the internet. “It is critical for the Vietnamese government to protect the open nature of the internet, and put in place the right conditions that incentivize investment and nurture innovation,” said Jeff Paine, the group’s managing director. For governments to complain to Google and Facebook about content published online is not new, but industry officials said there was less precedent for a state to try to put pressure on them through their advertisers. Vietnam’s state-owned Vinamilk, and flag carrier Vietnam Airlines suspended YouTube ads last month after the government told them their ads had appeared alongside inappropriate content. Because of the computer-directed processes that pair adverts with their targeted audiences on social media, companies are not always aware of or have direct control over which specific videos an advert has been placed alongside. Vietnam has come under fire from Western countries and human rights groups for its Decree 72 on social media - which bans information that it deems anti-government, damaging to national security or destroying national unity. Despite the restrictions, content that ostensibly breaches the code’s standards is still prolific. While Vietnam makes up a very small part of the business operations of companies like Google and Facebook, it is one of Asia’s fastest growing economies and a hot investment target for global consumer brands. Within Vietnam itself, YouTube and Facebook account for two-thirds of digital media market share in Vietnam, according to Nguyen Khoa Hong Thanh, Operations Director at digital marketing agency Isobar Vietnam.

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Google said on Wednesday it would offer an audio-only option on its Duo video calls service to help users communicate using poor-quality connections, and was adding a feature to permit file sharing in group chats on its Allo messaging App. The company launched Google Duo in August, providing video calls for users on Android and iOS, pitting it against Apple Inc’s FaceTime, Microsoft Corp’s video-calling app Skype and Facebook Inc’s Messenger. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, said audio-only calls on Duo would be available from Wednesday in Brazil, and would be rolled out to users around the world in the coming days. The audio-only calls would work well on all connection speeds and be data efficient, Google Vice President for Product Management Mario Queiroz said in a blog post after he announced the moves at a Google conference in Sao Paulo. With more than 139 million people online, Brazil ranks among the top five internet populations in the world. In response to requests from users in countries like Brazil, Google said that Android users everywhere would be able to share documents and other files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3) with friends on Allo in group chats. It also said it was rolling out two new features for Google Photos on Android and iOS to make backup and sharing easier on low connectivity. “Now your photos will back up automatically in a lightweight preview quality that’s fast on 2G connections and still looks great on a smartphone,” Queiroz said in the blog post announcing the new features. When a stronger Wi-Fi connection becomes available, backed up photos would be replaced with high-quality versions, he added. Google also said it was adding a new location sharing feature in Google Maps to allow users to let friends and family know where they were and when they would arrive at their destination. Users can stop sharing that information at any time, Queiroz said. ","

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"(Reuters) - The decision by a handful of high-profile consumer brands to pull advertising from Google’s YouTube over offensive content could threaten the site’s long-term strategy of stealing ad dollars from television, analysts and ad industry professionals said Thursday. The immediate financial impact of the controversy is likely to be limited, in part because a big chunk of YouTube revenue comes from smaller advertisers who lack the budget for TV campaigns and do not have easy alternatives. Some analysts also believe that departing advertisers, eager to reach YouTube’s millennial audience, will quickly return. But with “brand safety” emerging as a major concern for marketers amid a surge in hate speech and other types of offensive content across the internet, the widespread assumption that major advertisers are ready to shift large chunks of their budgets from TV to digital now looks much more dubious. The timing may also favor television networks as they usually present their fall line-ups and woo big advertisers starting in May, agency executives said. “Video is actually a lot more fragile of an ecosystem than the Silicon Valley, software-eats-everything crowd may want to think,” said Joel Espelien, a senior analyst at the Diffusion Group, which studies the future of television. “The point is all content isn’t actually the same, all advertising isn’t actually all the same. There is an element of taste. And when you ruin that, the whole thing does kind of start to fall apart.” Google offers little visibility into YouTube’s financial performance, but analysts view it as a key driver for the company’s growth as its traditional search advertising business matures. Analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets estimates YouTube will bring in about $14 billion in revenue this year. Alphabet shares have fallen more than 3 percent since Monday, closing at $839.65 on Thursday. Whether the recent events are a mere blip on the radar for Google or a harbinger of bigger problems to come may depend on whether the company can quickly improve its technical tools to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. YouTube has begun reviewing its advertising policies and will take steps to give advertisers more control, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. Google also plans to hire more people for its review team and refine its artificial intelligence – a key step, since much of the ad-serving is handled by automation. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, acknowledged in a Fox News interview that ads appearing next to videos promoting hate speech or advocating violence had slipped through the digital cracks in Google’s elaborate ad-serving systems. “We match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match,” Schmidt said. “We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be OK.” But Google’s public statements have done little to assuage advertisers’ fears, said David Cohen, president, North America, for media buying firm Magna Global. Privately, Google has gone into more detail about how it plans to combat the issue, including ratcheting up its algorithms to better categorize content and being more stringent about how content is labeled, Cohen said. But such additional controls would reduce the percentage of content that carries advertising and could disrupt the vibrant community of independent creators on YouTube, who drive traffic to the site and rely on revenue-sharing from advertising. “YouTube has a decade-long head start, but obviously everyone wants a piece of the pie,” he said. Even before the most recent revelations about YouTube, control over online ad placement had become a hot button topic for advertisers. Social networks and news aggregators came under fire during and after the U.S. presidential election for spreading fake news reports, and advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. “Between non-human traffic and fraud, fake news and hate speech, brands are more concerned than ever,” said Marc Goldberg, CEO of Trust Metrics, a New York-based company that addresses ad fraud.

The two remaining Republicans in the Senate were absent and did not cast a vote. According to the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. The bill next goes to the U.S. House of Representatives, but it was not clear when they would take up the measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was overturning a regulation that “makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment.” But Democratic Senator Ed Markey said, “Republicans have just made it easier for American’s sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared, and sold to the highest bidder without their permission.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules. In a joint statement, Democratic members of the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission said the Senate vote “creates a massive gap in consumer protection law as broadband and cable companies now have no discernible privacy requirements.” The Internet and Television Association, a trade group, in a statement praised the vote as a “critical step towards re-establishing a balanced framework that is grounded in the long-standing and successful FTC privacy framework that applies equally to all parties operating online.” Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for advocacy group Consumers Union, said the vote “is a huge step in the wrong direction, and it completely ignores the needs and concerns of consumers.” ","

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"BIEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swatch Group is developing a Swiss-made operating system as it seeks to offer a smaller, more flexible alternative to the dominant systems which connect items such as smartwatches to the internet, its chief executive said on Thursday. The world’s biggest watchmaker has been skeptical about smartwatches, which use systems like Google’s Android Wear, Samsung’s Tizen OS and Apple’s WatchOS to connect to the internet, and has so far launched watches with limited connected features under its Tissot and Swatch brands. CCS Insight expects the market for smart wearables to almost double to 185 million units worth $16.9 billion by 2021. Nick Hayek said the biggest problems facing competitors’ smartwatches related to energy consumption and privacy. Swatch Group, whose brands include Omega, said last month it was working with Swiss research institute CSEM to launch an “ecosystem” for connected objects by the end of 2018. Swatch said this would offer absolute data protection and ultra-low energy consumption and would not need regular updates. “I don’t want to become the industry standard for smartwatches,” Nick Hayek said on Thursday, adding it would be dangerous if everybody depended on just one or two dominant operating systems. “But in Switzerland we have a lot of expertise when it comes to creating something that is smaller, consumes much less energy, is independent and more cost-efficient and can go into little objects,” he said. Swatch had many requests from small U.S. startups looking for flexible open-source systems and would serve these customers while also using the system in its own watches, he said. Ben Wood, an analyst with CCS Insight, said there were dangers in Swatch trying to build its own system, adding that it would be hard to compete with Google, Samsung and Apple, which had more resources in this area. “Swatch may be able to develop its own software platform, but attracting developers to get access to the most popular apps needs an operating system with scale. Just look at how BlackBerry ended up abandoning its own software,” Wood said. But if Swatch was able to offer people something unique it might be able to break into the market, Francisco Jeronimo at IDC said, adding that this was a “a gigantic task”. However, users had not yet locked in to a specific interface in what is a still new segment, therefore offering an opportunity for Swatch, Jeronimo said. ","

(MSFT) may have been late to the cloud web hosting party, but it’s been growing the business at a fast clip, which prompted Pacific Crest Securities to downgrade its investment rating on cloud hosting competitor Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) last week. Last week, Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin lowered his price target on Amazon to $895 from $905 a share largely because Amazon Web Services (AWS) is facing real competition from the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOG) in the cloud hosting market. The analyst pointed to the fact that both Microsoft and Google have made major drives to land startups and Fortune 500 companies and those efforts are paying off. ""AWS boasts a multiyear lead over Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. However, heavy investments could increase the viability of these alternatives,” wrote Bracelin in a research noted covered by Fortune. “After three years of outsized gains and a tripling of profits, AWS' growth could moderate this year and next.” The analyst noted the cloud computing business is still in its infancy but is expected to grow in the years to come. Bracelin estimates that of the total $1.3 trillion spent on information technology around $60 billion is earmarked for the cloud. That leaves a lot of opportunity for AWS, Microsoft and Google to grab more share. For Microsoft, the cloud hosting business has been a good one for the software giant in recent months. When Microsoft reported second-quarter earnings results in late January, it posted a nearly 4% increase in profits thanks to the fast-growing cloud computing business. During the fiscal second quarter, Azure revenue surged 93% year over year (up 95% in constant currency). While Microsoft doesn’t break out how much money it makes in that business, some Wall Street analysts believe Microsoft’s Azure cloud generated revenue of $3 billion in the most recent quarter. (See also: Microsoft's Azure Cloud Revenue Estimated at $3B.) Microsoft is taking steps to expand its cloud hosting business and, at the same time, lower the cost. Earlier this month it announced it had created a Windows Operating System for servers that runs on ARM processors instead of Intel Corp. (INTC). Microsoft is also embracing an open-source design for its cloud servers dubbed Project Olympus. The move to embrace ARM processors and an open-source design for cloud servers is aimed at lowering its costs by embracing new hardware and becoming more flexible so that it can stay on the same competitive footing with Amazon and Google in the cloud server market.

Ryan Downie,03232017,Investopedia,03162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Finisar Corporation (FNSR) has experienced a wild ride in the stock market during recent years, with a sharp decline in March 2017 dampening the gains achieved over the prior 12 months. After declining nearly 50% in 2015, FNSR charged through late 2016, finishing that year up over 100%. As evident in the following Google Finance chart, the stock gained an additional 20% year to date through February 2017, but a sell-off from that $36 peak pulled it back to the $26 to $27 range in March. Finisar's cyclical operations and somewhat speculative valuation have fueled this volatility, but it is highly unlikely that the underlying business' long-term value has fluctuated as drastically as the market price for shares. This would suggest that Finisar stock has been a strong candidate for exiting or entering positions at various points over the past two years, so it warrants fundamental analysis. (See also: Finisar Stock Rises Ahead of Q4 Earnings.) Finisar supplies optical subsystems and components that are used in data centers and telecommunications networks. The explosion of storage and networking needs is expected to continue due to drivers such as mobile device ubiquity, cloud storage, increasing application richness, video consumption, the Internet of Things and big data. Finisar's financial results are therefore highly cyclical due to product lifecycle and the company's place in the supply chain. New components that are widely adopted tend to have better margins before succumbing to pricing pressure. Moreover, demand shocks for end products can lead to inventory overhangs, often causing more substantial disruptions further up the supply chain. As is common with component suppliers, Finisar's margins have been inconsistent. Notably, investors grew concerned when the company failed to fully capitalize on revenue growth in 2014 and 2015 due to margin contraction. The 2016 run-up of Finisar stock was driven by renewed optimism as margin expansion accompanied strong growth. Company management attributed these strong gross margin figures to a strong cyclical environment with product mix favoring newer, high-demand products. In a relatively fragmented market, speculation of imminent consolidation also fueled higher valuations. (See also: Finisar Sales Fall Due to LR4 Module Issues.) The March 2017 swoon was likely caused by souring outlook and aggressive valuation. Negative sentiment began swirling when Finisar's competitor Ciena Corporation (CIEN​) reported poor results. Finisar followed this by reporting earnings 5% below analyst expectations and revenue 3% short of consensus estimates. Even worse, Finisar guided for $0.50 to $0.56 in earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter, below the previous consensus forecast of $0.58. Fears of margin compression and cyclical downturn clouded the story, cutting into the stock's market value. (See also: Ciena Misses Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q1.) Such reactions to cyclicality are identified by value investors as opportunities to exploit long-term price inefficiencies. Finisar's case is especially interesting because its results could have been influenced materially by a temporary issue with a large customer in China and regular seasonality related to the Chinese New Year. If investors are overreacting to short-term developments, then excellent value could be realized. Scrutiny of Finisar's valuation, outlook and operational metrics relative to peers does not reveal anything spectacular. The company is generally slightly less expensive than its peers, has a slightly better growth outlook and is comparably efficient in operations. Finisar stock is well within its historical range of valuation multiples. (See also: Introduction to Fundamental Anlysis.) Investors who want exposure to the communications network equipment market and are bullish about Finisar's product portfolio in the long term might take advantage of the March price dip. Finisar is no longer trading at a premium to its peers, and a PEG ratio of 0.8 is especially enticing. A 10-year revenue CAGR of 13.2% is also respectable. However, the entire peer group is buoyed by bullish valuations, so conservative investors should be wary of earnings multiples near cyclical peaks. The relatively short product lifecycle also lends itself to unstable market shares, which is a risk to long-term stability. (See also: A Primer on Investing in the Tech Industry.)

After nine years of losses, Germany's largest investment bank is taking a number of steps to shore up its balance sheet, improve operational efficiency and raise earnings. Following an $8.5 billion capital raise and waves of layoffs, DB is now looking to improve its management team with a board shakeup. The board has asked Gerhard Eschlbeck, IT security head at Google Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) to join the non-executive board as Siemens CEO Peter Löscher's replacement. According to Handelsblatt, the change could ripple throughout the firm, because ""supervisory boards in Germany are responsible for hiring and firing chief executives and also weigh in on corporate strategy.""

""Deutsche Bank will be significantly increasing their in-house internet expertise with the shift, which is also likely to please the supervisory authorities,"" Handelsblatt writes. In addition to new oversight, the bank is looking to reduce risk on its balance sheet with an aggressive sale of troubled home loans. According to The Wall Street Journal, the bank ""has been offering attractive financing terms to help investors and other banks buy soured mortgages"" in an attempt to improve the company's chances of seeing profitability in 2017 and to increase liquid capital following the bank's recent issuing of billions in debt. (See also: Deutsche Bank Plans to Raise $8.5 Billion.) DB's move to offload these mortgages won't only benefit the bank's balance sheet; it could also lower the firm's $7.2 billion bill with U.S. authorities.

DB's approach to troubled mortgages is the exact opposite of U.S. rival The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which can get relief from its own outstanding $5.1 billion fine if it buys troubled mortgages and rehabilitates them. (See also: Goldman Buys Bad Mortgages Worth $5.7 Billion.)

The national spokesperson for The Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, she is a featured columnist for Investopedia. The views expressed by columnists are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Investopedia.] How do the super wealthy invest their money? Beyond stocks and bonds, ever wonder what really rich investors' portfolios have that yours doesn't? The answer may be what’s known as ""alternative investments."" These are investments that represent a style of investing intended to protect wealth in the event of a big crisis or just everyday stock market turbulence. Think hedge funds as one example. Most alternative investments were designed for the 1%. But now alternative investments are pushing into the mainstream. One reason is that alternatives are touted as investments that hint at potential higher overall returns on your money. This is critically important, especially to retirees trying to live off dividends and 1% interest as income to replace their old paychecks. The whole purpose of introducing an alternative investment into your investment mix is simple: diversification. The reason is that when one asset type, such as a stock, goes down, the right different type of asset – real estate, for example – could be moving in the opposite direction from stock prices. The point is to protect yourself against downside risk. With a number of investors convinced that the stock market is overdue for a major tumble (see 3 Investors Who Think a Stock Market Crash is Coming), the smart money is increasingly looking for different ways to put their savings to work. Alternative investments are finally becoming available outside of the 1% because prescient fund managers have started to focus on America's growing group of mass affluent investors.  According to global consulting company McKinsey & Company, since 2005, global assets in alternatives have grown twice as fast as traditional investments. Here’s a list of some of the alternative investments that can produce high returns that are uncorrelated to the stock market. Some are as esoteric as they sound. You might be comfortable putting some of your life’s savings into some of these alternatives, while others, not so much: Many financial advisors completely avoid investing in alternatives for one good reason: lack of liquidity. Traditional stocks and index funds are easy to track and monitor. Want to know what Apple's or Snap’s stock is doing today or what kind of dividend Coca-Cola’s paying? Type it into Google, and you can see it instantly. But investing in alternatives typically means holding on for at least five years. Tracking them requires a much deeper dive than a 60-second Google search. The lack of available current information translates into risk. Alternatives are ""off road"" investments, and accurately monitoring the value of a private investment in something like real estate is anything but easy. A great deal of trust is involved with each and every transaction. How can you even understand how well an investment is performing without a standardized pricing system? All the same, according to Wealth Management, wealth managers say they plan to add more ‘alt’ investments to some client’s portfolios, increasing them from an average of 13% today to 18% by 2018. The real answer is sometimes. They can be incredibly useful, especially for hedging against risk during economic downturns. A study conducted by Informa Investment Solutions and published by BlackRock reveals that many alternative investments did provide protection over stocks during the 2001 and 2008 recessions because they didn't fall as much as stocks. But these numbers look at alternatives as a whole rather than individual classes. It all depends on which alternative investment you're buying. For example, hedge funds had an atrocious 2016, despite how sexy they sound. After all, super-rich investors put their fortunes into hedge funds, so they must be good, right? Wrong. Credit Suisse Capital Services found  that hedge funds were hit hard by redemptions in 2016 because of the widespread underperformance across the board. More than 80% of investors redeemed some or all of their investment from hedge funds in the first half of the year, according to Credit Suisse's study. The study also revealed that more than half of those redemptions were due to specific managers' underperformance or strategy drift. Alternatives are opaque. That's why it's important to choose funds managed by experts who specialize in them. If the trades aren't executed properly, you could wind up doing exactly the opposite of what you're trying to do – ramping your risk instead of reducing it. You could end up with subpar returns and oversized fees that disappear into fund managers' pockets. But by far the biggest weakness with alternatives is that it can be nearly impossible to check the track records of these alternative fund managers, according to the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) of the SEC. There are usually no third-party verification and audits. Some financial advisors conduct their own due diligence, but real due diligence should be one of the services a fee-based fiduciary offers, according to the OCIE. The reality is that even they can't really see the level of detail needed to track performance. Often, they're just relying on the data provided by the funds rather than third-party performance data. The only third-party option is to look for the fund's GIPS (Global Investment Performance) standards, although not all alt investments claim compliance with the standards. These standards provide ""apples-to-apples comparisons"" of performance data. Click here for a list of the firms that claim compliance, and check out the standards on the website to gain a fuller understanding of what compliance with them means. You'll probably notice that the list of funds claiming compliance is very short compared to the number of available investments. What's more, many individual investors and even some advisors don't seem to be demanding it. They're buying into non-compliant funds anyway. If you're going to incorporate alternative investments into your portfolio, how do you do it safely? Different types of funds make them convenient and accessible, and they're usually managed by experts other than your advisor – someone who specializes in a particular type of alternative investment. Look for funds that have multiple managers, strategies or asset classes so you get more diversification for your investment dollars. Expect some sticker shock because all these alternative funds will come with higher fees than single-strategy funds. There's a lot more management going on within them than with a single-strategy fund. It’s true you don’t need to be super-rich anymore to join the alternatives club, but you should be affluent enough to afford to invest in this way. Most wealth managers won’t touch this strategy unless you meet a certain minimum amount of total investable assets – typically around $2 million to $3 million. Most financial advisors outsource the job of actually watching over the investments. Right now, if you have a fee-only fiduciary advisor you’re likely paying less than 1% of the value of your invested portfolio (annually) to compensate for care-taking all your investments. You most likely expect proper diversification as part of the service in order to protect your money. Once alternatives enter the picture, you can expect those advisory fees to go up because of the outsourcing. That means your bottom line returns have to be that much higher to clear that hurdle. Many advisors I talk to suggest allocating between 20% and  25% of your portfolio to private or alternative investments. The rest should go into traditional stocks, bonds and cash. Other experts insist on a much lower allocation. For example, Ed Butowsky, managing partner at Chapwood Investments told CNBC that he recommends investors have around 15% to 20%. How much depends heavily on your age, so it's important to work with a fiduciary advisor who can determine what percentage is best for you. In some cases, that might even be 0% of your portfolio.

Rebecca McClay,03232017,Investopedia,03162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs For the first time in history, more people live in urban areas than rural areas. About 55 percent of the world’s population now lives in cities, where economic activity generates 86 percent of global GDP. By 2050, the number of people living in cities are expected to swell to include 70 percent of the world’s population. With the population shift, metropolitan areas will be reaching tipping points in regards to infrastructure, housing, and the environment. They face increasing cybersecurity and terrorism risks. So-called ""smart cities"" are tackling these challenges by leveraging technologies like broadband internet, the internet of things (IoT) and the cloud. A broad range of U.S. companies are positioned to benefit by offering services to cities where rapidly growing populations are straining resources and creating challenges to keeping municipal services running smoothly. Cities like Singapore, London, New York, Paris and Tokyo can achieve 30 percent reductions in crime and energy use and 20 percent reduction in water loss and traffic delays by deepening investments in technology, according to a recent Bank of America report. In the U.S., the smart city market is expected to grow to as much as $1.6 trillion by 2020, triggering fast growth in areas like 5G mobile communications, artificial intelligence (AI), building automation, big data, bricks and steel infrastructure, and cloud. Companies involved in cybersecurity, electric cars, IoT, sensors, surveillance and telecom infrastructure should see demand rapidly increase with urbanization. (See also: 2016’s Most Promising Countries to Invest In.) Multinational companies, especially those with aggressive technology strategies, have high exposure to these smart cities. Choosing the right investments from this group should give investors a great opportunity to capitalize on the challenges of increasing populations. Bank of America has identified 250 stocks that have exposure to smart cities, and has ranked them according to low, medium and high exposure. Below we look at the top U.S. company picks in each category. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), with a market cap of $164.2 billion, operates in more than 170 countries manufacturing computer hardware and software. Constantly innovating new products and discarding outdated strategies, IBM has high exposure to smart cities, according to Bank of America. (See also: IBM Launches Enterprise-Ready Blockchain Service.) American Tower Corp. (AMT), owner and operator of infrastructure for wireless broadcast communications, is also well positioned to leverage urban population explosions in areas that are rapidly adopting technologies. The Boston-based company, with a market cap of $49.8 billion, operates about 100,000 different communications sites in 13 countries. And technology giants Intel Corp. (INTC​) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO​), which provide network connectivity services around the globe, are also very well positioned in smart cities. Two U.S. companies that have high exposure to demand for buildings that are outfitted in modern technology, called “intelligent buildings,” are IBM and Cisco. General Electric Co. (GE) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON), which provide building automation systems, have medium exposure to smart cities, according to Bank of America. General Electric has a market cap of $260.8 billion, and Honeywell has a market cap of $97.1 billion. (See also: Manufacturing Giants Back U.S. Tax Reforms.) Alarm.com Holdings Inc. (ALRM​), a Vienna, Virginia-based company that provides cloud-based services for home monitoring, is the only company in Bank of America’s “smart home” category that has high exposure to smart cities. Last year, Alarm.com integrated its platform with both Apple Inc.’s (AAPL​) Apple TV and Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN​) Echo. Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL​) and Apple, with their myriad of popular high-tech consumer products, have medium exposure to smart cities. (See also: Google Releases Amazon Echo Competitor Google Home.) No U.S. firm had high exposure to high-tech safety and security needs, but Bank of America identified several with medium exposure: Barracuda Networks Inc. (CUDA​), Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW​) and Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR​), VMware Inc. (VMW) and Symantec Corp. (SYMC​). These firms have significant business worldwide in cybersecurity efforts expected to be in higher demand with the rise of urbanization. For example, Barracuda provides security networks and products that protect email and web surfing against viruses and spyware, among other threats. The Campbell, California-based company is transitioning to a cloud-based model that’s among the fastest in the IT landscape, according to Baird. (See also: Barracuda Networks Rises on Robust Q3.) First Solar Inc. (FSLR​), with a market cap of $3 billion, and SunPower Corp. (SPWR​), with a market cap of $876.1 million, both have medium exposure in solar energy, which is on track to become the main source of energy production by 2050. First Solar has a massive presence in utility-scale energy, and SunPower is a dominant player in residential and commercial solar energy products. (See also: A Look at Solar Energy Earnings.) In the renewable energy and utilities sector, NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE), Edison International (EIX) and PG&E Corp. (PCG) are among U.S. firms with medium exposure to smart cities. Tesla Inc. (TSLA​), the newest American automaker, is the only U.S. company with high exposure to the ""smart mobility"" trend.

Michelle Castillo,03232017,CNBC,03162017,"Google's momentum as a must-buy stock may be slowing down, as U.K. companies begin to pull away from the advertising giant over concerns regarding where their ads are appearing. Pivotal Research Group downgraded Alphabet stock from buy to hold on Monday after media buying agency Havas pulled spending from YouTube and Google Display Network in the U.K. last week. Other reports indicated more companies including the U.K. Government, L'Oreal, RBS, HSBC, Sainsbury's, Sky, Marks & Spencer, McDonald's and Audi have also suggested they would pull ads from the Google-owned platforms over similar concerns, Pivotal said. Pivotal reduced its price target on Alphabet to $950 from $970. Google has the world's biggest digital advertising platforms. According to eMarketer, it will account for 40.7 percent of all U.S. digital advertising budgets in 2017, more than double Facebook's share. According to the Financial Times, Havas spends approximately $217 million on digital ads in the U.K. annually. It also told the publication it was mulling a complete freeze on all Google advertising. The brands are reacting to a The Times of London report stating several video ads from brands and charities including Mercedes-Benz, Waitrose and Marie Curie were seen running next to jihadist and neo-Nazi content, giving these groups advertiser money. Google's EMEA president of business and operations, Matt Brittin, apologized on Monday for the misplacement of advertising. ""While Google has apologized for the incidents, and while the scale of the underlying problem may be relatively small in absolute terms, for large marketers, any one instance of an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm a brand's business value,"" Pivotal's Brian Wieser wrote in a report. Google addressed the concerns at Advertising Week Europe on Monday, saying the company would work on policies to find content advertisers deemed ""safe,"" improve advertiser controls and work faster to remove content that violated its policies. However, Pivotal was unsure if that would be enough to assuage fears, because it minimized rather than solved the issue. ""Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem,"" Wieser said. ""This should curtail spending slightly from the large agency-serviced brands which probably account for a quarter of spending on Google."" ",Google stock downgraded to hold on ad fears
Michelle Castillo,03232017,CNBC,03162017,"Google's ad troubles are becoming a bigger concern to Wall Street, but analysts have yet to go completely negative on the company because of it. Both Mizuho and Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned on Thursday a potential hit to Alphabet's revenue from companies pulling out ads due to fears of them appearing next to objectionable content, primarily on YouTube. But while it may affect Google's earnings in the near future, they still believe Alphabet stock is still worth purchasing. ""However, if Google does not nip this issue in the bud, we think there could be broader repercussions around YouTube's brand, if consumers, creators and advertisers stop coming to the site,"" Mizuho managing director Neil Doshi wrote in a note. Google came under fire late last week when a report in The Times of London revealed ads from companies and charities including Mercedes-Benz, Waitrose and Marie Curie were running alongside neo-Nazi and jihadist videos on YouTube and websites served by the Google Display Network in the U.K. However, some agencies have suggested the ad adjacency issue is a digital advertising issue in general, especially in online video. Media buying agency Havas pulled spending from YouTube and Google Display Network in the U.K., while Johnson & Johnson said it would pause all global advertising on YouTube on Thursday, accoridng to Reuters. Other companies including Sainsbury's, Sky and Marks & Spencer have also expressed intent to do so, according to Pivotal. The analyst group changed its Alphabet stock rating from buy to hold on Monday.Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote that it is difficult to predict how much the issue would affect Google in the long run. It acknowledged that some American brands have pulled money, and each 1 percent loss in global revenue equals about $200 million annually or $16 million a month. It also noted it didn't think companies were pulling their advertising permanently. ""We would expect many advertisers to return to Google over the next few months as ad controls are improved, but it could take several quarters for spend levels to return to normal,"" the company wrote in the note. Similarly, Mizuho said if the issue affected 10 percent of Google's revenue, it would only decrease the company's earns per share by $0.15 cents this year or a little under 1 percent of the  value. ""We like the fact that Alphabet continues to innovate around ads, and we see device bidding, expanded text ads, and Google cloud as meaningful drivers of growth in 2017,"" Doshi wrote. ""While we view this (YouTube) ad issue as a near-term concern, we believe Google is working hard to address the issues and win back the trust of its brand advertisers.""

Todd Haselton,03232017,CNBC,03162017,"Google released the next version of Android to app developers on Tuesday. The new iteration of Google's mobile operation system, which will likely power the next generation of Android smartphones and tablets, is simply known as ""Android O."" Google's vice president of engineering Dave Burke detailed some of the changes that developers and consumers can expect from the Android O release, which probably won't be available to consumers until next fall. ""Android O puts a big priority on improving a user's battery life and the device's interactive performance,"" Burke explained in a blog post. Burke said a new function in Android O allows the operating system to limit what sorts of things applications can do in the background, resulting in battery life savings for the end user. Android O will also add Picture in Picture support, a feature Apple already offers on its iPad tablets. Google says it will also be available for phones, however, and will allow folks to watch movies or other video clips while performing other activities, like checking email or surfing the web. The Android O Developer Preview is available now. Expect to hear more about Google's next operating system, perhaps even its official name, during Google I/O 2017 in mid-May. Until then, it's time to play the perennial guessing game about the operating system's eventual name.

In the coming months, owners of the Google Home smart speaker will be able to ask Google Assistant — the AI system embedded in Google's devices — to find the closest store with a particular item in stock. Example: ""'OK Google, where can I find a brown pair of men's Top-Siders, size 11, nearby?'"" said Jonathan Alferness, vice president of product at Google. ""The Assistant will answer with how many stores have the item and how far away they are,"" he said. Participating retailers include Saks Fifth Avenue, Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, PetSmart and Sephora. The new feature is powered by local inventory feeds sent by retailers that buy ads on Google, he said. In the past year, local shopping queries have increased 45 percent and the search giant has doubled the number of retailers that send local inventory feeds, said Alferness. Google announced the new features at the Shoptalk e-commerce conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday afternoon. Alphabet's Google is battling it out with Amazon to deliver goods and services to consumers at home. Google was late to the market with its smart speaker, which it started selling in the U.S. in November 2016, more than a year after Amazon's Echo became widely available in the U.S. The Echo could be a ""mega-hit"" and deliver $10 billion in revenue by 2020, according to RBC Capital Markets. But with this new feature, Google is offering users something the e-commerce giant doesn't — a way to find merchandise at your local store and try before you buy. ""This cart will give shoppers the ability to buy multiple items from multiple merchants all in one transaction through the Assistant,"" said Alferness. ""For retailers, this means larger basket sizes and better margins."" It's all part of Google's long-term strategy to develop products and services that use artificial intelligence to make it easier for people to interact with computers and complete everyday tasks, he said. That, in turn, will feed into Google's ad-based business model. ""The better that we can satisfy users' needs, the better off we'll be,"" said Alferness.

Lucy Handley,03232017,CNBC,03162017,"Tech giants Facebook and Google are set to continue their dominance of the global digital advertising market this year, according to new figures. The forecast from market research company eMarketer shows that Google is likely to make $72.69 billion in ad revenues in 2017, while Facebook will make $33.76 billion. Together, that equates to a 46.4 percent share of advertisers' total global digital ad spend. Shelleen Shum, a senior forecasting analyst at eMarketer, credited mobile and video for their dominance. ""This year, Facebook and Google will once again emerge as the global leaders in digital advertising, scooping up almost half of worldwide digital ad money, tapping on continued strength in mobile and video advertising,"" she said in an emailed statement. ""Facebook and Google's dominance in mobile advertising remains intact as they take up over half of worldwide mobile ad revenues throughout the forecast period. The figures come amid controversy for Google, which has apologized to brands whose ads appeared next to extremist content on YouTube, while Facebook is tackling fake news on its site. Advertisers' spend on digital formats globally will increase by 17.4 percent to $583.91 billion, equivalent to 38.3 percent of their entire ad budgets, the report also stated. Snapchat is set to make more money from advertising this year, growing its revenues to $900 million, representing a hike of 163.3 percent, eMarketer forecasts.

 ,03232017,CNBC,03162017,"Apple, Alphabet's Google and Facebook are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order. A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trump's first executive order banning travel from a number of countries the administration said posed a security risk. Airbnb, Dropbox and Kickstarter are among the companies that did sign the brief. Major tech companies that signed on to the earlier effort but not this week included Microsoft, eBay, Intel, Netflix, and Twitter. The lawsuit may succeed despite losing the overt support of such big names. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trump's executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary. Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson's order ""unprecedented judicial overreach."" Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump's executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February. It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the ""friend-of-the-court"" brief this time around. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. ""We do expect the group to expand."" Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said. Box Inc, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position.

Anita Balakrishnan,03232017,CNBC,03162017,"Google may not be able to guarantee advertisements won't appear next to offensive content, but it is working on a solution that ""can get pretty close,""  according to Alphabet's executive chairman Eric Schmidt talking to FOX Business on Thursday. Google has faced fallout on Wall Street this week as advertisers put pronounced pressure on the company's policies. Google is one of the top platforms for digital advertisers, accounting for about 40 percent of all online ad budgets, and 13 percent of display ad budgets, according to eMarketer. Google's YouTube video site ran ads for major brands next to neo-Nazi and jihadist videos, according to The Times of London. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson have since suspended some digital advertising, and some analysts said the outcry could be a concern for the company's outlook. Schmidt was asked whether he can ensure that the algorithm doesn't make the same mistake again. ""We can't guarantee it, but we can get pretty close,"" he said. Google has increased the time it takes to manually review ad matching and violations of Google's terms of service, Schmidt said. Hopefully, Google can build products that can move extreme content down in the rankings in a way that's better than what social media does, Schmidt said. ""We're very good at detecting what's the most relevant and what's the least relevant. It should be possible for computers to detect malicious, misleading and incorrect information and essentially have you not see it. We're not arguing for censorship, we're arguing just take it off the page, put it somewhere else...make it harder to find,"" Schmidt said, adding:  ""I think we're going to be ok."" Schmidt also appeared on ""CBS This Morning,"" where he discussed the new presidential administration. He said that it was ""literally crazy"" to not allow talented people to come to America, just because they are foreign.

Geoff Cutmore,03232017,CNBC,03162017,"Facebook and Google's runaway success in capturing large stakes in the digital advertising market comes with responsibilities and they need to do more when curating how advertisements are placed on their platforms, according to WPP Group CEO Martin Sorrell. Sorrell, whose company owns ad agencies such as the Grey Group and Ogilvy & Mather, was speaking to CNBC at the sidelines of the China Development Forum, where he said the two tech giants have to exert more control over ad placements on behalf of brands, and take more responsibility for it. ""They've always maintained they were sort of digital engineers standing there with their digital spanners, trying to tighten the nuts on their digital pipes and not being responsible for the content that was going through the pipes,"" said Sorrell. A key criticism leveled against both Facebook and Google is that the companies are not doing enough to arrest fake news on their platforms. ""They can't just say look we're a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages,"" Sorrell said. He added that, as far as placing advertisements was concerned, they have to be held to the same standards as traditional media organizations. Another concern is that sometimes advertisements are automatically placed alongside objectionable and inappropriate content within those platforms that brands do not have control over. ""The big issue for Google and Facebook is whether they are going to have human editing at this point ... of course they have the profitability. They have the margins to enable them to do it. And this is going to be the big issue — how far are they prepared to go?"" Sorrell said, adding they needed to go ""significantly far"" to arrest these concerns. A failure to address such issues could see Facebook and Google potentially take hits on ad revenue if brands stop advertising on their platforms. For example, French advertising firm Havas recently pulled all its ad spend from Google and its video platform, YouTube. The Guardian reported that Havas took the step after talks with Google broke down because the tech giant couldn't provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees over the filtering and classification of video or display content. Havas' decision came after the UK government joined organizations including the Guardian, BBC and Transport for London in pulling advertising from Google and YouTube, the Guardian report said. Sorrell said blanket withdrawals from advertisers across these digital platforms will not solve the problem. Instead, he urged for greater cooperation with the tech giants. ""I think the most constructive way of doing it is getting Google and Facebook to understand the problem, which I think they do, and to get them to step up to control it just like any other media right now would in a traditional sense,"" he said.

Marguerite Ward,03232017,CNBC,03162017,"Kim Scott knows what makes a good boss. After she helped lead Google's AdSense team, Scott became a sought-after CEO coach in Silicon Valley, advising C-suite clients at Dropbox, Twitter and other top companies. Every leader has his or her own style, but Scott says the best ones have one characteristic in common: ""radical candor."" Made up of two key components, it's a trait the coach says every manager should cultivate: 1. Care about your employees The first part of radical candor is caring about more than just metrics and results. ""It's not enough to care only about people's ability to perform a job,"" Scott writes in her new book ""Radical Candor."" In order to be a great boss, you have to go beyond being professional — you have to want to get to know your employees on a human level, she says. This doesn't mean memorizing birthdays or names of family members, but having real conversations and getting to know your employees. Perhaps counterintuitively, it's about acknowledging that your employees are people with lives and aspirations that extend beyond those related to shared work. ""It's about giving a damn,"" the former Google exec says, ""sharing more than just your work self and encouraging everyone who reports to you to do the same."" 2. Establish open and honest conversations The second dimension of radical candor involves being open and honest with your employees, both when their work is good and when it isn't. Speaking honestly about someone's performance shows that ""you care enough to point out the things that aren't going well and those that are,"" the expert says. When a person's work is not up to par, challenge them to improve and offer to help them do so. ""This develops trust,"" Scott writes. By combining these two strategies, managers can boost team morale, which has in turn been shown to boost productivity and results, according to the former Google exec. ""Caring personally about people even as you challenge them will build the best relationships of your career,"" she says.

Marguerite Ward,03232017,CNBC,03162017,"Applying to job listings online is a routine step for those seeking a new position. But it's not the best strategy for landing a new job, according to Google executive Peter Roper. ""Frankly there's a lot of jobs on LinkedIn, there's a lot of job services,"" Roper tells CNBC. ""Those are jobs people know about."" While job posting websites make it easier for you to apply, it also means that it's a lot easier for hundreds, if not thousands, of others to do the same. ""Those are the jobs that are really the most competitive to get because they're widely publicized,"" he says in an interview at the Millennial 20/20 conference. Roper, who leads the company's mobile branding, has a better strategy. 1. Make a list of places you'd love to work ""If you want to focus your energy and narrow your search,"" he says, ""create a list of companies that you're interested in."" This includes companies that don't necessarily have job openings listed on their website, Roper says. 2. Email the right person ""Personally reach out to the hiring manager or person in charge of your department there,"" he says. Keep the email short and concise. Taking this extra step shows the hiring manager that you are willing to devote time and energy to contacting them, which helps you stand out from the crowd. Roper used this strategy in his own career and it helped him get to where he is today. In 2013, he sent a cold email to the CEO of Songza, a music app he loved. He asked if the company was looking for anyone to help run sales. While Songza did not have any job openings listed online, the CEO responded saying that he was, in fact, looking for a sales executive. Roper landed the job, and a few years later, Google acquired the app. Though the importance of email etiquette is sometimes overlooked, Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture, says how you write emails can actually make or break your career. The CEO of Birchbox, the founder of StyleSeat and countless others say that emailing the right people was crucial to their success. Don't be afraid of the cold email, Roper says.

Marketers will continue to shift a larger percentage of their ad budgets to digital in 2017. U.S. digital ad spending is expected to reach $83 billion this year, up 16% according to eMarketer. By far, the two biggest digital advertisers are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The two will combine to take 57% of the market this year. That's up from 54% last year as the two combine to take about 74% of all the growth in U.S. ad spend. Even with the recent introduction of ads on the extremely popular Snapchat from Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and continued pressure from Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the two giants continue to completely dominate the competition. Image source: Google. Google's biggest business, search, is also its biggest growth driver. Google's search ad revenue is expected to climb 16% this year compared to its overall revenue growth of 15%. eMarketer expects Google to take 78% of all U.S. search ad spend as it takes share from Microsoft and other smaller competitors. The search giant will bring in about $28.6 billion from search ads this year, according to the research group. Google's growth stems largely from mobile. Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the U.S., and Google is the default search engine on iOS, the second most popular mobile operating system. Microsoft's efforts to penetrate the mobile market largely fell flat, although it is the search engine behind Siri on iOS. Americans use Google for about 94% of their searches on mobile. As mobile continues to account for more and more of our time, Google's lead in search will only grow wider. While Google grows more dominant in search, Facebook is increasingly dominant in display ads. eMarketer expects Facebook's U.S. advertising to grow 32.1% to $16.33 billion this year. Google is its next closest competitor, and it's expected to generate just $5.24 billion from display ads. Image source: Facebook. eMarketer's projection for U.S. ad revenue growth is actually below analysts' consensus estimate for Facebook's overall revenue growth this year. It's worth noting the U.S. is historically Facebook's largest and one of the faster-growing regions in terms of revenue. However, saturation in ad load could cause U.S. ad growth to slow more significantly compared to regions where Facebook has faster user growth. Instagram will make a significant contribution to Facebook's U.S. ad revenue this year, growing to account for about 20% of Facebook's total on mobile, up from 15% last year. Mobile accounted for 84% of Facebook's total ad revenue last quarter. One of Facebook and Google's biggest competitors in display advertising, Twitter, is expected to see its mobile ad revenue decline for the first time in its history. Its revenue on mobile devices will fall about 5% to $1.15 billion, according to eMarketer. Mobile accounted for 89% of Twitter's total ad revenue in the fourth quarter. The expected to decline comes after management provided anemic first-quarter guidance and followed it up by de-emphasizing certain ad products. Twitter is shifting its focus to its most profitable products in order to make good on its effort to become profitable this year. Meanwhile, Snapchat is a growing force in video ads. Indeed, eMarketer expects the company's U.S. ad revenue to grow 158% to $770 million. Even with its robust growth, Snap's app revenue still only accounts for 1.2% of the total U.S. mobile ad market, and just 4% of the total growth in U.S. digital advertising. Even with strong competition, Facebook and Google continue to dominate the market as users flock to their services. The trends favor both to continue growing faster than the rest of the industry for the foreseeable future, too. ","

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a surprise hit on its hand with the Echo smart speaker. After releasing it exclusively to Prime members in late 2014, the device proved so popular that Amazon was able to quickly open orders to everyone in the U.S. by the following summer. On Christmas Eve of 2015, the Echo was one of the top five items ordered, according to Amazon's annual holiday press release. Last year, Echo device sales climbed nine times compared to 2015's holiday season. That's despite the November introduction of Google Home, a competing smart speaker from the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary. During Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggested Echo devices, powered by the virtual assistant Alexa, outsold Google Home 10-to-1 in the quarter. However, Mahaney is changing his tune after conducting a more in-depth survey. ""Home's awareness and installed base could be much closer to Alexa -- with a brand awareness in the U.S. 80% that of Alexa and an installed base that may be close to a third that of Alexa,"" he recently wrote in a note. It looks like Google Home is quickly catching up to Amazon's Echo. Image source: Google. Google plans to keep making Google Home a better device by improving its search capabilities and functionality. ""We are going to invest a lot in it over 2017,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""I think there is a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for the very long term,"" he added. Google intends to leverage its massive Android platform to continue improving Google Assistant, the artificial intelligence (AI) behind Google Home. At least 200 million devices will have access to the voice assistant, which will provide Google with a lot more opportunities to learn exactly what people are looking for when they say, ""OK, Google."" Google will also have to improve Google Home's capabilities. The device currently has around 80 Actions, which is nothing compared to the 10,000-plus functionalities available with Alexa. To that end, Google launched the Actions on Google developer kit in December. Strategy Analytics estimates Google will sell 1 million Google Home devices by midyear. That still trails Amazon's sales by a significant margin. The research group estimates Amazon sold 6.3 million Echo devices last year, and that should go up meaningfully in 2017. Mahaney estimates Amazon will sell 60 million Echo devices by 2020, bringing the install base to 128 million. While Google Home sales are improving relative to Amazon Echo, it's not clear device sales will follow a similar path. Google Home lacks one of the key functionalities of Amazon's devices: the ability to easily shop on Amazon. Seventeen percent of Echo owners use Alexa to place orders on Amazon, according to Mahaney's survey. As the number of devices in use grows, Mahaney expects the amount of shopping done via Alexa on Amazon to grow as well. By 2020, sales through the voice assistant could reach $5 billion, according to the analyst's estimate. Google doesn't even have a business model for monetizing Google Home beyond hardware sales. Search and display ads don't work very well on a device with no display. Moreover, Google doesn't offer a compelling differentiating factor for consumers to pick its device over another smart speaker. Comparatively, Amazon Prime members, of which there's a rapidly growing number, have lots of reasons to pick the Echo, like easy access to ordering things on Amazon or inexpensive use of Amazon Music Unlimited. As such, Amazon is poised to win the long-term competition even if Google Home is catching up in the short term. ","

All but one of the 16 states of the South (as defined by the Census Bureau) are tax-friendly when it comes to Social Security. Florida, Tennessee, and Texas don't charge state income taxes generally, which makes Social Security taxation largely a moot point. But most of the other states in the region -- Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia -- also have a blanket exemption on taxing Social Security. West Virginia is the only exception; it uses the federal rules to determine what gets included in state income taxes. Image source: Getty Images. By contrast, if you're looking to retire to the Northeast, be aware that fully a third of its nine states impose income taxes on some residents. Among the states in that region, New Hampshire doesn't have an income tax, and Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania don't impose their state taxes on Social Security benefits.

Of them, Vermont matches the federal law on taxation, using the same rules as the IRS to determine what gets taxed. Out in the Midwest, only seven of 12 states are free of Social Security taxes. South Dakota doesn't have an income tax. Meanwhile, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin have full state income tax protection for those receiving Social Security benefits. On the other hand, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and North Dakota tax Social Security in varying degrees. Minnesota and North Dakota are notable for following the federal rules on taxation. Nine of the 13 states in the West don't have income taxes on Social Security. Alaska, Nevada, Washington, and Wyoming don't have state income taxes at all, and Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, and Oregon have special provisions exempting Social Security benefits from state taxation. That leaves Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, and Utah, which impose taxes on Social Security for some individuals. In 37 states, you don't have to worry about state income tax on Social Security. Yet even in some of the others, there are things you can often do. For instance, New Mexico has an exemption for some retirement income that lets you shelter Social Security if you choose to use it in that way. However, many residents use the exemption to protect IRA distributions or pension income instead. Also, just because your benefits are taxable for federal purposes doesn't mean that they will be even in states that tax Social Security. Many states have much higher thresholds for taxation than the IRS. Retirees like to hold onto as much of their Social Security as they can, and dealing with taxes is never ideal. Knowing which states tax  Social Security at the local level means you can take that into consideration in planning where you want to spend your retirement. ","

The Echo Dot can get you started with Amazon's Alexa for $50. Image source: Amazon. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) wants an Alexa device in every home. The voice-controlled personal assistant sits at the heart of Amazon's Echo, Tap, and Fire TV devices, and the ecosystem of compatible gadgets is growing daily. Alexa has more than 10,000 skills available today, and I'm sure you never saw some of these life hacks coming. Here are six of the most useful, creative, and unexpected things an Amazon Alexa device can do for you today. Image source: Getty Images. Feeling peckish? Alexa offers many ways to place an order with your favorite takeout food service. Domino's Pizza was an early adopter, and Yum! Brands quickly followed suit with an ordering skill for its Pizza Hut brand. GrubHub regulars may find its Alexa skill handy, as it allows you to simply repeat any takeout order from your GrubHub history. Image source: Getty Images. Sure, there are many ways to fire up a music playlist through Alexa. Beyond that, some of the most popular Alexa skills today simply play the ambient sounds of a light rainfall, a decent thunderstorm, or ocean waves. Just what you need to wind down after a stressful day, or to get a good night's sleep. Image source: Getty Images. Alexa makes it easy to manage your workouts and keep track of that diet. The service communicates with your connected Fitbit account to keep up with your workout progress, and other fitness-tracker specialists are sure to follow suit. Specialized skills can help you run a quick workout at the drop of a hat, and you can use Alexa to keep track of your daily nutrition goals. Image source: Getty Images. Controlling smart-home devices is an important part of Alexa's skill set. Your Amazon Echo can control cloud-connected thermostats, power outlets, door locks, and lighting fixtures. You can turn off the TV, dim the lights, and lock the door without getting out of bed. Image source: Getty Images. Track your investments and bank accounts without lifting a finger. Capital One has already built an impressive suite of tracking and management tools for Alexa, letting you track credit card transactions and checking account balances. You can even make payments for your credit card bills and car loans. Several skills can grab today's business headlines or a quick stock quote, including an easy-to-use skill from The Motley Fool. Image source: Getty Images. A handful of major automobile makers already allow Alexa to start and stop, lock and unlock, and otherwise control your connected car. No, you can't tell the car to turn left or navigate to work, but you can ask it to flash the lights, turn on the seat warmers, report the current battery status, and more. Owners of Ford electric models and recent Hyundai cars have access to Alexa skills with official backing from the companies, while Tesla owners currently have to settle for third-party solutions. This is Amazon building a worldwide partner network. Most of these skills were developed by businesses not named Amazon, or by hobbyists and enthusiasts. Anyone can build an Alexa skill, marrying the voice command decoding of Amazon's devices with data-processing back ends in web services -- hosted on the Amazon Web Serivces platform or anywhere else. It's a classic example of cloud computing in action. Some of these Alexa skills will work right out of the box, while others require some hands-on configuration. In many cases, you need to enable the specific skill you want and then link it to your account with that service provider. That's how your Alexa knows which car to unlock, what credit card to use with a pizza order, or whose fitness-tracking profile to update with your dinner calories. Sometimes, you'll need to set up some security safeguards, too. The car control skills, for example, require PINs to keep house guests and children out of managing your wheels. Alexa is already a powerful personal-assistant tool but it still has a lot of growing up to do. The process of finding and enabling new skills could be smoother, and there's plenty of room to add more skills overall. Sure, 10,000 app-like skills is a good start, but it's nothing next to the 2 million apps found in the leading smartphone app stores. Virtual digital assistants like Alexa accounted for a $2 billion market in 2016, according to market intelligence form Tractica. By 2021, the same firm expects an annual revenue stream of nearly $16 billion worldwide, including $4 billion for consumer-level devices and $12 billion in the market for enterprise assistants. That's just the hardware and software, tapping into an even larger flow of voice-activated orders and subscriptions. Getting Alexa right is a big deal for Amazon. Don't forget that Alexa devices make it easy to order more stuff from the leading e-commerce company, so having these tools scattered everywhere could be a game-changer for Amazon's retail operations.

Todd Campbell,03232017,Fool,03162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. You can claim Social Security benefits at any point after reaching age 62, but the most commonly discussed ages for claiming benefits are 62, 66, and 70. Claim at age 62 and you'll receive a smaller amount than you'd get at age 66, but wait until age 70 and delayed retirement credits will net you the biggest check. Here's how much the average American is receiving in Social Security income at each of those ages. You can collect Social Security if you've accumulated 40 work credits. Typically, if you've paid into Social Security over a career lasting at least 10 years, you'll qualify for the program. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Once you begin collecting Social Security benefits, those benefits are paid by payroll taxes that are collected from current workers' paychecks. Generally, the program is designed to replace about 40% of your pre-retirement income, but the amount you receive in benefits depends on a complex calculation that's based on up to 35 years of your inflation adjusted monthly earnings. If you qualify for Social Security, you can begin receiving them as early as age 62. However, the full retirement age at which you can receive 100% of your benefit is your full retirement age, and that age varies depending on your birth year. For example, if you're turning 62 this year, your full retirement age is 66 years and two months. If you decide to hold off on claiming your benefits, you'll get delayed retirement credits that increase your payment for every month you delay, up until age 70. For example, the following table shows how much a person with a full retirement age of 66 would collect at different ages, if their full retirement age benefit is $1,000. DATA SOURCE: AUTHOR'S CHART. Now that you understand how claiming benefits at different ages can impact your Social Security income, let's take a closer look at what people are currently receiving in average benefits at various ages. In February, the Social Security Administration awarded benefits to more than 243,000 retired workers, and on average, those recipients got $1,425.63 per month. As of December, the average benefit that's being paid out to recipients who are age 62 is $1,077. Individuals who are age 66 and age 70 are receiving an average of $1,333 and $1,482, respectively. The following table shows the average amount that's being paid out to people between the ages of 62 and 70. DATA SOURCE: SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION. As you can see, the average 70-year-old is getting 37.6% more in Social Security income than the average person who is age 62. That's a big difference, and it suggests that it might make the most sense to wait until 70 to claim benefits. That could be true, but you should remember that delaying means forgoing years of payments, and those years of payments can really add up. The chart below shows that delaying benefits doesn't break even with taking them early until your late 70s or early 80s, depending on when you claim. In the following example, I assume a full retirement age of 66 and a $1,000 benefit at full retirement age. The breakeven point could be pushed back even further if you claim benefits early, invest them, and earn a return on that investment. DATA SOURCE: AUTHOR'S CHART. Everyone's situation is different, and deciding when to claim benefits is a very personal decision that will depend heavily on your retirement goals, finances, and your health. There can be important tax consequences associated with Social Security income, so regardless of when you plan to claim, make sure you do your research first and explore all the strategies that are available to you.

The online marketplace's marketing services business generated $1.1 billion in revenue last year, but it's been slowly declining since 2012, when total revenue for marketplace marketing services reached $1.3 billion. eBay is ready to get serious about advertising, with plans to build up its internal advertising sales team and cut ties with the outside sales firm that had been selling its ads. It's also getting rid of ads that link to other websites, focusing exclusively on ads for products sold on eBay itself. The move echoes a recent change in Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) ad business and leverages eBay's unique shopper data, giving it an advantage over Facebook and Alphabet's Google. Image source: eBay. eBay CEO Devin Wenig telegraphed the company's interest in growing sales of ads that focus on product listings on eBay. ""Increasingly we're seeing good results from internal ads, ads for eBay sellers promoting their inventory in our search results and in other places on our site,"" he said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""And for us that's a really, really good flywheel because keeps our buyers inside our marketplace, it allows us to create a new stream of monetization, and it allows our sellers to buy up for promotional activities."" Shifting exclusively to ads that promote products sold through eBay will keep shoppers on its site, potentially increasing gross merchandise volume. As volume increases, merchants have more incentive to sell products on eBay's marketplace and advertise those product listings. Amazon made a similar move in 2015, and the growth of third-party merchants on Amazon's marketplace is fueling its sales growth. Granted, only a small part of that growth is due to Amazon's revamped ad platform. Image source: eBay. eBay and Amazon have some of the best data for advertising. Few things are a better predictor of future purchases than a shopper's previous purchases. With 167 million active buyers making $84 billion in purchases, eBay has quite a bit of purchase data. And, eBay says its users spend 200 million hours searching and browsing its website every month. This data can make the online marketplace's platform more attractive than Facebook or Google for lucrative product ads. eBay even argues it's more attractive than Amazon because it ""offers full data transparency about advertisers' products"" on its marketplace. eBay also doesn't sell any products directly, which could encourage merchants to favor its platform over Amazon's. Not only does Amazon sell goods itself, it has an increasingly broad range of private labels with which it can significantly undercut competing products' pricing. The digital advertising space is massive. Google and Facebook are certainly dominant forces, raking in a combined $86.5 billion last year. But eMarketer estimates there was another $108 billion split among the rest of the crowd. By 2020, digital ad sales will reach $320 billion, according to the research group. After a full year of making changes to its advertising business, Amazon saw its other income segment (which includes advertising and credit card agreements) grow 81% in the fourth quarter. While Amazon only brought in $1.3 billion in other income last year, it's still a huge opportunity for the company. eBay's recent move echoes Amazon's, and provides a similar opportunity. Given its ad business is already comparable in size to Amazon's, that's a good start. But it needs to revamp the product and get back into growth mode in order to take advantage of the potential.

Matthew DiLallo,03232017,Fool,03162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) spent the better part of the last year working on high grading its backlog. What that means is that the pipeline company is purging lower-return projects while moving forward with its best options and looking for new opportunities to expand. It announced updates on those latter two initiatives this week, which is providing greater visibility into what will fuel its growth in the coming years. Earlier this month, Kinder Morgan announced that it had completed the final cost estimate for its Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project in Canada. As a result of several changes to the plan, it increased its cost estimate from 6.8 billion Canadian dollars up to CA$7.4 billion ($5.5 billion). To offset those higher costs, it also raised the tolls it would charge for capacity. That increased rate resulted in shippers returning 22,000 barrels of capacity back into the company, which represented about 3% of available capacity. Image source: Kinder Morgan Inc. However, the company immediately launched an open season to find takers for that remaining capacity. Those available volumes didn't last long, with the announcement this week that it had secured commitments for all of its available capacity. As a result, its next move is to arrange the financing for the project, which puts it on pace to start construction later this fall. If everything goes according to plan, the project should enter service at the end of 2019. In addition to announcing the successful open season on the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion, Kinder Morgan also announced this week that it was launching an open season on the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project. This project would provide an outlet for producers in the Permian Basin to move natural gas toward the Gulf Coast, including growing export markets such as Mexico and via the region's expanding LNG export capacity. If enough shippers sign on to the project, Kinder Morgan could have it in service by the second half of 2019. Since Trans Mountain would also enter service about that time, it sets the company up for a big jump in cash flow heading into 2020. What's unusual about this project is its focus on natural gas, instead of oil, which is what has attracted so much investment to the Permian in recent years. That said, with the basin's hydrocarbon makeup, producers are delivering a growing supply of associated gas that needs greater access to market centers. Image source: PDC Energy. Photography courtesy of David Tejada Photography, © 2016. For example, diversified Canadian shale driller Encana (NYSE:ECA) plans to invest about half of its 2017 capital budget into the Permian Basin to boost its oil output. That capital should fuel 50% growth in Encana's Permian production this year, while the company forecasts a 30% compound annual growth rate through 2021. However, since about 16% of the production from its Permian wells is natural gas, Encana will need a market access for that growing gas output. PDC Energy (NASDAQ:PDCE), likewise, produces a growing supply of associated gas out of the Permian after acquiring its position last year. Furthermore, its assets are in a portion of the play where natural gas is more prevalent, with natural gas making up about 35% of the company's reserves in the basin. That suggests that as its total production grows, so will its gas output in the basin. In fact, in some of PDC Energy's wells in the western portion of the basin, as much as 50% of the production is natural gas. Given the likelihood of a growing supply of associated natural gas coming out of the basin, there's a pretty good chance that Kinder Morgan will find enough takers for the capacity that it's offering on the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project. If that happens, the company will take one of the first steps toward rebuilding its backlog, which has declined sharply over the past year due to project completions and the impact from cancellations and joint ventures. These two open seasons should give investors confidence that Kinder Morgan still has plenty of growth left in the tank. While we won't see that growth move the needle for another two years, there is growing visibility that it is coming down the pipeline. It's all the more reason to believe that Kinder Morgan has the potential to deliver healthy dividend growth in future years. ","

Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) all-important Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment has been the undisputed leader of cloud infrastructure, by far, for years. The most recent third-party estimate from Canalys pegs AWS global market share at nearly 34% in the fourth quarter, larger than the next three largest competitors -- Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and IBM -- combined (31%). Competition is heating up, and rivals are starting to chip away at AWS' dominance. Image source: Getty Images. That's the underlying theme of a research note from Pacific Crest (via Tech Trader Daily). Analyst Brent Bracelin is reiterating an overweight rating but slightly reducing his price target from $905 to $895, while expressing some concern that Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are starting to catch up and ""becom[e] more viable."" The software and search giants both continue to invest heavily in their cloud offerings, both in terms of technical capability as well as geographic expansion and reach. Since AWS is immensely more profitable that Amazon's core e-commerce business, its results carry a disproportionate weight when it comes to the bottom line, and strong AWS performance has been a key driver of Amazon's rally over the past two years, which has seen shares more than double. AMZN data by YCharts. Microsoft Azure is making inroads at large enterprise customers and government agencies, which are increasingly transitioning their needs away from their own data center infrastructures and toward public cloud platforms. Google Cloud has scored a high-profile win in Snap, which has committed to spending $2 billion with the search giant and is only using AWS as a backup. Google also recently announced a handful of other big wins for its cloud business. Bracelin still believes that AWS has a ""multiyear competitive lead,"" despite rivals starting to catch up in different ways. As a result, he is tempering his expectations for growth for the next two years. Overall, the analyst considers decelerating growth a ""minor concern,"" but it's definitely something that should be on investors' radar. It's worth pointing out that the cloud infrastructure market is growing so fast -- up 49% last year and expected to jump another 46% this year -- that there should be plenty to go around. The cloud infrastructure market could generate a total of $55.8 billion in total revenue this year. Of course, the dominant vendors will compete aggressively, but we're not talking about zero-sum competition. ","

By now, you've probably heard that chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) made waves in the tech space earlier this week by announcing a deal to acquire Mobileye (NASDAQOTH:MBBYF). The deal is noteworthy for a number of reasons, least of which is the dollar value involved. Intel is paying $15.3 billion for a relatively small company in what amounts to a shot across the bow of NVIDIA, the current leader in driverless car chips. However, this deal carries deeper implications for the semiconductor industry, so let's look at why Intel is buying Mobileye and what it means for the parties directly and indirectly involved. Superficially, the deal seems like a match made in heaven. Intel's long-standing growth issues in its PC and data center segments are well-known. Moreover, its failure to capitalize on the once-in-a-generation growth opportunity presented by the rise of smartphones and tablets likely left the company anxious not to miss the boat the next time around. The autonomous vehicle market looks like a similarly major opportunity for the company. In that vein, adding Mobileye suits Intel's aims. Mobileye already enjoys partnerships with 25 automakers to install its Advanced Driver Assist System (ADAS) into their vehicles. It also has experience working with Intel, and reports indicate that the cultural similarities of the two companies were an important factor that helped facilitate the deal. Intel and Mobileye are currently working with BMW to help the automaker develop fully autonomous vehicles and bring them into wide-scale production by 2021 at the latest. However, the deal also involves at least one meaningful downside that investors need to understand. Image source: Intel As is the case with so many things, there was some give-and-take at work in Intel's Mobileye buyout. Of its possible flaws, by far the most glaring is the valuation Intel put on the target. Though the long-term results could eventually validate it Intel paid a steep price to get this deal done. Mobileye generated GAAP net income of just $108.3 million on sales of $358.1 million in 2016.  At the agreed-upon price, this means Intel valued Mobileye at either 42 times sales or 141 times earnings. For those scoring at home, the S&P 500 currently trades at about 26 times earnings,  which itself is well above its historic average. Time will tell whether this deal works out for Intel shareholders, but Intel hasn't enjoyed a lot of success with large-scale acquisitions in the past.  Its particularly garish $7.6 billion  buyout of security firm McAfee in 2011 has done little to lift the chipmaker's financial fortunes; the jury remains out on its 2015 buyout of Altera for $16.7 billion. Perhaps the best way to sum up this move is that it's a gutsy, all-in bet on the future of self-driving cars and Intel's place as a major component supplier to the market. In that vein, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that autonomous vehicles will represent a potential $70 billion addressable market by the year 2030.  Beyond that, Intel believes that supporting self-driving cars will require a large amount of additional data center, network security, and cloud computing hardware -- and it sees a $30 billion economic opportunity for the company in supplying chips to power those systems. If all of this comes to pass as predicted, Intel will eventually recoup far more than the $15.3 billion it is spending. So though it comes at a hefty premium, Intel's aggressive purchase of Mobileye is the kind of potentially transformative bet this low-growth tech giant needs to make if it intends to remain relevant over the next 20-plus years. Here's hoping it works out. ","

The biggest risk for any game-changing company is for the disruptor to be disrupted itself. Shares of Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) moved marginally lower on Friday, after an analyst reported of a rival nipping at its heels. Twilio is a fast-growing provider of cloud-based communications solutions. It's never been the cheapest provider, but you don't win over Uber, Airbnb, WhatsApp, and other market darlings as customers if you're not earning the right to command a market premium for your real-time in-app communications features. However, on Friday, William Blair analyst Bahvan Suri confirmed with a software engineer at Lyft that the country's second largest ride-sharing service is adding Vonage's (NYSE:VG) Nexmo as a possible alternative to Twilio for its text messaging, voice, and phone number needs. Lyft is a small player in Twilio's widening roster of names, but for a rival to get its foot in the door there is problematic. Suri argues that the willingness of Lyft to kick Vonage's tires shows that there's at least some customer sensitivity to pricing. A popular bullish argument for Twilio is that switching costs are high once you hop on to Twilio's market-leading platform. Why risk any miscues in the migration process when Twilio is proven and excels in its niche? However, with Vonage's bid reportedly coming in significantly less than Twilio's current pricing, the risk of fumbling the handoff seems to be offset by the lower usage costs. Image source: Twilio. Twilio is rolling. It closed out 2016 with 36,606 active customers, a healthy spike from the 25,347 accounts it was servicing when the year began. Twilio broke even on an adjusted basis for the fourth quarter, but that was better than the $0.05-per-share loss analysts were expecting. The $82 million it scored in revenue -- 60% growth -- was ahead of both the 41% to 45% top-line gain it was originally forecasting, as well as the $75.2 million Wall Street pros were targeting. Twilio's revenue guidance for the first quarter and all of 2017 was better than what analysts were modeling, but its outlook also calls for a larger deficit for both periods. This is a fair trade, in theory. Investors are buying into Twilio for its revenue growth these days. The other end of the income statement is a distant focus point. However, the emphasis on Twilio's revenue growth also makes it susceptible to a sell-off if it starts losing big accounts. This has been a volatile investment. Twilio stock has more than doubled since going public at $15 last summer, but it has also shed more than half of its value since peaking in late September. Last month's mixed quarterly results didn't help Twilio, but analysts were generally upbeat at the time. Twilio remains the favorite mid-cap growth pick at Canaccord, with analyst Richard Davis boosting his price target from $35 to $40. Brian White at Drexel Hamilton raised his price goal from $45 to $50. Optimism will of course reverse if Twilio begins losing customers. Investors will want to keep an eye on account growth at Twilio to make sure the situation at Lyft with Vonage is just a one-time flirtation. It's never pretty when the dominoes start to fall.

On Monday, Marks & Spencer Group PLC became the latest company to suspend its advertising from Google. Brittin said he would step up enforcement and review policies to make sure ads don’t inadvertently appear near inappropriate videos. He said Google wanted to be careful with how it did so because some advertisers, such as news organizations, might want to place ads alongside controversial content. “We want to be thoughtful,” he said, adding that Google would reveal more details soon.

The Reelist is a column featuring Kristen Page-Kirby’s musings on movies. For Washington Post film critic Ann Hornaday’s review of “Beauty and the Beast,” click here. As a book-loving teenage girl, I was pretty much required to adore 1991’s animated “Beauty and the Beast.” As a professional cynic, I was pretty much required to be wary of Disney’s live-action remake — and I was. I am here to report, though, that the legacy of the original is in loving, capable hands, and those hands have crafted a piece of art that is part homage, part update and very nearly all wonderful. So let’s talk about the “exclusively gay moment” people are freaking out about! Once upon a time, movies pretended that everyone was straight, the same way they pretended that no one ever had sex before marriage. Enter the “coded gay,” those characters whose sexuality was given a wink and a nod. My favorites are Martin Landau in “North by Northwest,” Marlene Dietrich in “Morocco” and basically everything Peter Lorre ever did. This code was the cinematic equivalent of pretending those nice older ladies who live next door to you are just roommates; it made it possible to represent a gay character while nearly entirely divorcing him or her from any sort of romantic or sexual life. Some say LeFou (played by Josh Gad in the “Beauty and the Beast” update), sidekick to the brutal, moronic Gaston (Luke Evans), was always coded gay. I disagree — leading one rousing song in praise of your burly best friend does not a homosexual make — but it’s not a completely unfounded argument. I’m not going to get into the specifics of THE MOMENT, partially because it’s less than two seconds long and partially because it’s not like any trouser snakes run rampant on screen. (I’m also not going to tell you the other two LGBTQ-friendly moments I spotted. It’s like a sexual orientation scavenger hunt!) THE MOMENT simply suggests that LeFou might get his own happily ever after, and that he might spend it with a guy. And that, I think, is why some people — many of whom, I wager, have not SEEN THE MOVIE — are freaking. Disney has presented a gay man as a normal part of the world. Which should not be surprising, since gay men are, you know, a normal part of the world. In cracking the code, Disney has made it impossible for people to separate LeFou from his romantic life, and that’s what makes some people uncomfortable. Removing sexual or romantic interests from LGBTQ characters (and people) makes them safer to those who consider them dangerous. That’s how people who are opposed to the “homosexual lifestyle” can still love their daughter’s soccer coach (and her “roommate”) or the church choir director who just never found the right girl. It’s OK to be gay — just don’t have any romantic or sexual interests. All THE MOMENT does is break LeFou out of the coded closet and make his sexuality a part of his life. After all, Belle’s sexuality is a part of hers, in this movie where the main lessons involve looking past differences and celebrating love, even when it’s between two members of different species. Disney hasn’t made LeFou gay. They’ve just made him fully human.

Jack Nicas,03232017,MarketWatch,03162017,"Published: Mar 16, 2017 9:03 p.m. ET ‘Beauty and the Beast’ promo may usher in new way to monetize the voice-activated helper By Google’s smart home speakers on Thursday played an unprompted promotion for Walt Disney Co.’s new “Beauty and the Beast” movie, the first sign of how the world’s largest advertising company could shoehorn ads into its growing number of voice interactions with users. Users of Google’s voice-controlled speaker, called Google Home, heard a 17-second promotion for the movie, after asking the devices about the their schedule. “By the way, Disney’s live-action Beauty and the Beast opens today,” the device said, according to user videos. After mentioning a detail about the movie, it said, “For some more movie fun, ask me to tell you something about Belle,” a main character in the film. The promotion, which appeared to be Google’s first attempt to test advertising on Google Home, reflects a new balancing act between monetizing new search formats and users’ tolerance for more ads. The promotion was also read aloud on some smartphones that run Google Assistant, the company’s digital-assistant technology that also underpins its speakers. Joseph Vorbeck, a 32-year-old web developer in New York City, said he wasn’t pleased to hear the Disney promotion after his Google Home told him the weather and his schedule for the day. “It was kind of jarring,” he said.

Natalia Drozdiak,03232017,MarketWatch,03162017,"Published: Mar 16, 2017 8:05 a.m. ET By BRUSSELS--The European Union's antitrust agency is scrutinizing whether algorithms make it easier for companies to collude over prices online and is considering stricter fines for cartels using those tools, the bloc's competition chief said Thursday. At issue are programs companies use that continuously crawl the internet to check prices in online shops. That software allows the firms to monitor or adjust prices automatically, thereby potentially helping cartels operate more effectively. ""We need to keep an eye out for cartels that use software to work more effectively,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a speech at an event hosted by the Germany's Federal cartel office. ""If those tools allow companies to enforce their cartels more strictly, we may need to reflect that in the fines that we impose."" In a joint report last year, the German and French competition authorities raised the issue of tacit or explicit collusion through transparency of online prices. Ms. Vestager noted that the practice of using automated price systems was common: around two-thirds of retailers who track rival's prices use automated systems, some of which also use the software to automatically adjust prices. She referred to one example where two different companies sold posters of music artists like Justin Bieber and agreed not to undercut each other's prices on Amazon.com Inc.

Still, she said, not all automated pricing systems are necessarily suspicious, such as algorithms to find the lowest prices, like air fares. Antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Britain have already investigated some automated pricing cases, such as the posters case. The EU, meanwhile, is looking at whether software has limited the ability of retailers to set their own prices for consumer electronics, in a recently announced e-commerce case, she said. The EU watchdog said that while the previous antitrust cases dealt primarily with agreements put in place by people and implemented by computers, she said there was capacity for illegal collusion agreements to be struck directly between different companies' software. ""We need to make it very clear that companies can't escape responsibility for collusion by hiding behind a computer program,"" she said, adding that companies should build pricing algorithms in a way that doesn't allow them to collude with others. -Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com ",EU examines role of algorithms in price collusion - MarketWatch
Kari Paul,03232017,MarketWatch,03162017,"Published: Mar 21, 2017 5:52 p.m. ET Telecommuters are more productive than office workers, study finds. By Want to make employees work better together? Let them work separately, from home. It may sound counter-intuitive, but employees are apt to work more efficiently and collaboratively when operating remotely, a new study released Tuesday by video and voice collaboration technology company Polycom, Inc. and Human Resources executive network and research firm Future Workplace found. Modern employees are expressing a growing need for flexible workplaces, the survey of more than 24,000 workers concluded. Some 62% of people are already taking advantage of flexible working practices and 98% say “anywhere working” has a positive impact on productivity. Remote work offers benefits that are rarely discussed, including better communication, improved work-life balance, and more flexibility with child care, said Jeanne Meister, a partner at Future Workplace. “There is a stigma that remote workers are disconnected from the rest of the team, yet this study proves that they are more sociable and proactively reach out to develop strong relationships,” she said. “The new technology tools that enable communication and collaboration are actually motivating workers to pick up the phone, seek face time and create lasting bonds.” The research comes as open office plans face increasing backlash for their reported negative effects on productivity. Many workers are finding it easier (and quieter) to work from home. “Shared work environments, and in particular hot-desking, are associated with increases in distraction, negative relationships, uncooperative behaviors and distrust,” one study from the Auckland University of Technology found. Another found 50% of people with open-office floor plans were unsatisfied with their sound privacy compared with only 16% of people in private offices. Don’t miss: Why you should take bizarre job interview questions very seriously And more millennials are demanding flexibility as an office perk, studies show. And not everyone believes it is because they want to sit at home in their pajamas, playing with their smartphones and watching daytime TV. “Employees in a flexible workplace are more engaged and have less intention to leave employers,” said Cassidy Solis, a workplace flexibility program specialist at the Society for Human Resource Management. “They appreciate the trust and pay it back to their employers 10-fold with loyalty.” That said, working from home can get tired, and fast. Workers who don’t come into an office do miss out on a number of benefits that cannot be replicated by technology, including office cooler chitchat and after-work happy hours. Those components of office life aren’t trivial, either: Workers who are social at work are more productive, a separate study released in 2017 by market research group Gallup found, which found if employers increased the number of employees who have a best friend within the company from 20% to 60%, they would have 12% higher profit and 36% fewer safety incidents. Still, Meister said with new technology remote work can create even closer bonds with co-workers than a traditional office environment. “You beam into someone’s personal space at home, and you see not only the person but what’s important to that person in their home office,” she said. That includes hobbies, personal aesthetic, and family members — as the world saw in a recent viral BBC interview in which a professor was bursted in upon by his adorable children, causing mayhem on camera. Workplace flexibility isn't just a benefit for employees, either: “We often talk about productivity and work life balance for employees, but it also offers employers access to global talent,” Meister said.

Kari Paul,03232017,MarketWatch,03162017,"Meals on Wheels, the popular nationwide program that provides hot meals to needy seniors, has become a rallying point for critics of President Trump’s proposed budget, which slashes spending on social initiatives to beef up military spending. But on Sunday, the Trump administration answered an emphatic ""no"" to the question of whether the budget would gut Meals on Wheels. Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director, said that the funding source the administration seeks to eliminate — the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s community development block grants — accounts for just 3 percent of Meals on Wheels’ overall funding. “Some of the stories are just either grossly wrong or nearly grossly wrong, all the stories about how we cut Meals on Wheels,” Mulvaney said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” OMB spokesman John Czwartacki said later Sunday that Mulvaney meant to say that Meals on Wheels' national headquarters gets 3 percent of its funding from the government and that he was not referring to the amount of funding that comes from community development block grants. It is unclear what percentage of the program's funding comes from HUD, but it is a relatively small amount. Meals on Wheels is not a federal program, nor do its local groups directly receive federal funding. Rather, the groups run on a mix of local, state and federal money, as well as private donations and the work contributions of volunteers, which vary depending on the funding structure of each affiliate. Most federal money that ends up supporting Meals on Wheels comes from a separate program run by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Trump administration has proposed cutting the overall HHS budget by 17.9 percent, but has not yet detailed where those cuts would fall and whether they would impact the Administration for Community Living, which funds nutrition programs for the elderly, as The Washington Post's Fact Checker columnist Glenn Kessler explained. A top official at Meals on Wheels told Kessler that the organization anticipates the cuts will impact its funding. [For the Record: White House budget director did not say Meals on Wheels did not show results] Democrats sought Sunday to shame the Trump administration for a budget that takes away resources for programs like Meals on Wheels. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the Trump budget would “take money from Meals on Wheels and give it to the Defense Department.” “We take an oath to protect and defend our country, but our strength is measured in more ways than just taking money for the health, education and well-being of the American people, which is a source of our strength,” Pelosi said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “So compassionate acts of mercy? I don’t know what faith that is.” Mulvaney defended the administration’s budget from criticism that its cuts to social programs would be painful for millions of working-class voters in rural states like West Virginia, where voters went heavily for Trump in last fall’s election. “The president knows who his voters are,” Mulvaney said, arguing that the budget demonstrates “compassion.” Noting that Trump supporters are sensitive to how their tax dollars are spent, he added, “Could I, as a budget director, look at the coal miner in West Virginia and say, ‘I want you, please, to give some of your money to the federal government so that I can give it to the National Endowment for the Arts?’ And I just think we finally got to the point in the administration where we couldn’t do that.” This article has been updated.

Quentin Fottrell,03232017,MarketWatch,03162017,"Published: Mar 19, 2017 12:36 p.m. ET How President Trump’s ‘skinny’ budget blueprint could impact meal delivery services By Among the services that could be impacted under President Trump’s budget proposals: Meals on Wheels. The administration’s proposed cuts target the Department of Housing and Urban Development and call for the elimination of the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant, which helps fund programs including Meals on Wheels, which deliver food (and human interaction) to elderly, disabled and poor recipients. “The federal government has spent over $150 billion on this block grant since its inception in 1974, but the program is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results,” the budget proposal states. “The budget devolves community and economic development activities to the state and local level, and redirects federal resources to other activities.” Don’t miss:  The ‘Missing Richard Simmons’ podcast inadvertently shone a light on taboo subjects in American society “Meals on Wheels America,” one of a myriad of these meal delivery programs, says the organization can provide meals for senior citizens for one year for roughly the same cost as just one day in a hospital. The annual meal cost is $2,765 for 250 days, based on the estimates of individual meal costs by the Mathematica Policy Research, a policy research organization in Cambridge, Mass. The cost of one day in the hospital, meanwhile, is around $2,271, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, private operating foundation based in Menlo Park, Calif. “Meals on Wheels People,” a Portland, Ore.-based service and one of the largest in the country, says it costs $2,500 annually to provide daily meals to a homebound senior, while cost of institutional care for a year in Oregon is around $60,000. But not all “Meals on Wheels” organizations will be impacted in the same way under Trump’s budget proposals. “Meals on Wheels is not a national organization,” says Julie Piper Finley, a spokeswoman for “Meals on Wheels People” in Portland and one of the largest meal delivery organizations in the country. “Meals on Wheels” is a catch-all phrase to describe these services. What’s more, that organization doesn’t receive HUD funding, she says. “Meals on Wheels Programs & Services of Rockland” in New York, however, received a Community Development Block Grant of $25,000 for its home-bound meal delivery program for the 2016-2017 fiscal year.

Certainly, there are some successes, but there’s a lot of programs that simply cannot justify their existence, and that’s where we zeroed in.” Read also:  Former NATO ambassador criticizes Trump for saying Germany owes U.S. money Some organizations say cuts to these kinds of meal programs will hurt the most needy: namely, the elderly, in this case, and children. “The administration’s proposed cuts to nondefense discretionary spending would touch on programs and services that many Americans turn to every day,” the Center for American Progress, a left-wing Washington, D.C. think tank, said in a statement. “Everything would be under threat, from Head Start for young kids, Meals on Wheels for seniors, and legal services for low-income families to post offices and funding for victims of domestic violence.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

In a survey last year of more than 560 IT professionals from Spiceworks, 52% of those who are using intelligent assistants on company-owned devices said they use Apple Siri, followed in popularity by Microsoft Corp.’s Cortana and Alphabet’s Google Now. Only 4% said they are currently using Alexa. These products meet some office needs with varying degrees of success. Like Alexa and Siri, Cortana can help manage a schedule. It goes a step farther by integrating with a line of Microsoft

For example, users can ask Cortana to pull up data and charts to show average customer spending per city. Most experts agree, however, that existing products, which were mostly designed for home use, tend to fall short of the workplace’s more robust needs. For starters, the voice-recognition software has to be more accurate, says Omar Tawakol, chief executive of Workfit, because the stakes in business are so much higher than they are at home. If an intelligent assistant for the home plays the wrong song, “it’s not too great, but it’s also not too bad,” Tawakol says. But in business, he says, “you can’t afford to have that amount of an error rate.” Workfit’s Eva transcribes meetings with an accuracy rate slightly above 90%, Tawakol says, but it is incrementally improving as the company also tries to make Eva’s processing time faster. Most human transcription services are 98% accurate, he adds, but are very costly. Most machine transcription for phone calls today is about 60% accurate, he says. Tawakol says his goal is for Eva to provide a more accurate transcription than currently, but at a cost near what people pay for machine transcription. Lee, the venture capitalist, agrees that the business market has different needs that so far consumer devices haven’t met. The complex vocabulary used in business situations, for example, is not something that home-based assistants are designed for. Intelligent assistants for the home have no idea what a sales force or product pipeline is, he says. Devices for home use also aren’t designed to track who is speaking. Patankar, for his part, says he wishes Alexa could do that, and have user profiles for each of his workers as well. The employees at his company, which does business as Process Street, use Alexa to add jobs to a task-management application. But it’s difficult to follow up, Patankar says, because the device doesn’t keep track of who added which task. Another issue is that interacting with such devices can be loud and disruptive to other employees. In an office, it can be difficult to talk to Alexa, for example, without everyone nearby hearing. Patankar also says employees sometimes accidentally trigger Alexa to start talking. It’s only supposed to turn on when she hears “Alexa” or “Echo,” but sometimes it is activated by a similar word, he says. Finally, there are issues of privacy and security — because intelligent assistants are always listening. Some security experts say such systems could pose a risk of being turned into eavesdropping devices. In a workplace, meanwhile, there is an additional concern that everyone must agree to being recorded. Even nonemployees who enter the office may need to opt in to being recorded. Lee says he thinks everyone in a workplace using such technology should be made aware that an intelligent assistant is present. Privacy also has been a major focus for Tawakol, the Workfit CEO. The company announced it raised $5.5 million in seed funding recently to further develop Eva, its meeting facilitator. To protect privacy, Tawakol says, people can turn Eva off at any point in the call by saying “Eva earmuffs” or “Eva go away.” Cat Zakrzewski is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in San Francisco.

The Justice Dept. said DirecTV was “the ringleader in a series of unlawful information exchanges” with its rivals Cox Communications Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and AT&T, before the telecommunication giant’s purchase of the satellite company. The distributors were aligned against Spectrum SportsNet LA because of the high cost for the service. Time Warner Cable, which has since been acquired by Charter Communications, paid the Dodgers for the rights to distribute the channel for 25 years in a deal Major League Baseball and the team valued at $8.35 billion. In turn, Time Warner Cable sought a premium from other distributors to carry the channel. “Today’s settlement promotes competition among pay-television providers and prevents AT&T and DirecTV from engaging in illegal conduct that thwarts the competitive process,” said Brent Snyder, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s antitrust division.

Nokia's networks sales during the final quarter of 2016 declined 14% compared with 2015, but those results were partly offset by savings and cost reductions from the Alcatel-Lucent integration, as well as strong growth in Alcatel's submarine cable business. The Finnish telecommunications company said Friday it will separate its mobile networks division into two organizations. One will be called Mobile Networks and focus on products and solutions while the other will be Global Services, focused on services. In a further step, the chief innovation and operating officer role will be split, with its current operating activities moved to a newly-appointed chief operating officer, while innovation activities will be managed by Nokia's chief technology officer, and incubation by Nokia's chief strategy officer. Chief innovation and operating officer Marc Rouanne becomes president of the Mobile Networks business group, while the executive vice president of Global Services, Igor Leprince, becomes president of that division. Chief operating officer of Fixed Networks, Monika Maurer, is named group chief operating officer, and Marcus Weldon, president of Nokia Bell Labs and chief technology officer, will retain his responsibilities. Chief strategy officer, Kathrin Buvac, takes on additional responsibilities for incubation of select new business opportunities, and Barry French, chief marketing officer, assumes additional responsibilities for health, safety, security and environment.

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"Google has come under intense scrutiny for ads appearing alongside videos on YouTube carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. The company vowed an overhaul of its practices and said on Wednesday it has started an extensive review of its advertising policies. Shares of Google parent Alphabet ended down 1.2 percent, or $10.15 per share, at $839.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. Control over online ad placement has become a hot-button issue for advertisers, with social networks and news aggregators coming under fire during and after the U.S. presidential election for spreading fake news reports. Advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. J&J said on Thursday it wanted to ensure that its product advertising did not appear on channels that promote ""offensive content."" (bit.ly/2nqZNJD) JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and the biggest issuer of general purpose credit cards, suspended all of its ads from YouTube on Thursday, according to spokeswoman Trish Wexler. The bank spends about $3 billion on marketing each year. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was $5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. While major brands suspending advertising on YouTube is a public relations pain for Google, the suspensions do not affect Google’s biggest ad product, search. According to eMarketer, Google’s 2017 global ad revenue is projected to be $73.75 billion, grabbing 62 percent of the $99.62-billion search market. Search accounts for 83 percent of Google’s overall ad revenue. The financial hit is also less certain because digital platforms tend to collect the bulk of their revenue from small-to-medium sized companies who cannot afford to buy on TV. “Digital dependence on the long-tail of advertising clients means that while major advertisers like P&G or agencies like Havas can publicly protest, they do not have the same impact on a Google or a Facebook as they have on a CBS or NBC,” analysts at MoffettNathanson wrote on Thursday. “In other words, if a major brand marketer or agency moves money to TV and out of digital, the TV industry will see the benefit whereas the digital industry might not truly feel it.” ","

Just last year, for example, GM announced 700 new high-tech engineering jobs in Ontario, dedicating largely to researching software and driverless cars. That’s just one example of why it’s so important that Canada not just train high tech talent, but retain it. Innovation, economic growth and future competitiveness depend on it. So it’s good to see the federal and Ontario governments — as well as companies like Google, Air Canada, Loblaws and the Big Five banks — investing $150 million in a new institute devoted to artificial intelligence. The Vector Institute, affiliated with the University of Toronto, will research new frontiers in AI and figure out how it can be used to make companies more competitive. Most importantly, it is designed to retain, repatriate and attract AI talent to “feed” that expertise into existing Canadian companies and startups. Happily, on that last front, Vector is already attracting interest from researchers in the United States. In fact, Geoffrey Hinton, a former U of T professor, is one. He is dividing his time between a job at Google and his position as Vector’s chief scientific adviser and says he’s already fielding inquiries from others interested in moving back. There are great opportunities in this approach. Ed Clark, chair of the Vector Institute board, says “we want those firms to grow to be a great worldwide supplier of AI capability, so that we turn this into a service export to the world, and not have a situation where all Canada does is produce PhDs and send them south.” He adds: “We want Toronto, Ontario, to be one of the core intellectual centres of artificial intelligence research in the world.” In fact, Canadian universities are already major incubators of the high tech talent that will create the next innovations. But keeping them in Canada is a challenge. University of Waterloo engineering and math graduates, for example, are heavily recruited for jobs in Silicon Valley. Part of the attraction is higher wages and better benefits, something Canadian companies may find hard to match. But part of it is job opportunities. Vector can be a step towards providing that. That will be a key to future prosperity. Says Yoshua Bengio, who heads the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms: “AI is going to bring a lot of wealth, but if it’s made elsewhere we aren’t going to get a reasonable share of that wealth, even if we contributed to the original science.” Right now the administration of Donald Trump has handed Canada an advantage in retaining and attracting AI engineers, mathematicians and scientists. For one thing, he is slashing budgets for scientific research, which is apparently driving some scientists to look here for opportunities. At the same time, his immigration policies have already benefited Vector. Two researchers on Hinton’s new Toronto-based team are Iranian, one of the countries targeted in Trump’s immigration ban. Finally, Trump isn’t focused on high tech innovation but on “making America great again” by bringing back rust belt jobs. Indeed, his big job announcement this week was about ending the “war on coal” and bringing back miners’ jobs. No mention of creating new jobs in areas like green energy. Far better to be looking ahead and betting on areas of future growth, including AI. Creation of the Vector Institute is a promising step in that direction.

 ,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian and Ontario governments plan to team up with a group of businesses to invest about C$200 million ($150 million) to fund an artificial intelligence institute at the University of Toronto, project organizers said on Tuesday. The center, to be known as the Vector Institute, will train large numbers of masters, doctoral and postdoctoral AI scientists who are needed by Canadian industry, said Ed Clark, who will head the institute. “Clearly, the giants in Silicon Valley are going to be major players in this. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t find things and areas where we end up being best in the class,” said Clark, now a business adviser to Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne. A majority of the financial commitment will come from the federal and Ontario governments, organizers said. They did not specify when the institute would begin operation. The federal government committed C$125 million to develop AI industry in its budget last week. A Toronto-based Google spokesman said the company had committed C$5 million to the Vector Institute. Geoffrey Hinton, an AI scholar known for his work with neural networks, will be the institute’s chief scientific adviser. “This initiative came from the industry. They all know they need to have lots of very skilled people. This is a very fast-moving field and you want the people to be educated by people doing basic research,” Hinton said. He said that government support for AI research and training would encourage large corporations to expand their research labs to Canada. ","

The two remaining Republicans in the Senate were absent and did not cast a vote. According to the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. The bill next goes to the U.S. House of Representatives, but it was not clear when they would take up the measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was overturning a regulation that “makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment.” But Democratic Senator Ed Markey said, “Republicans have just made it easier for American’s sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared, and sold to the highest bidder without their permission.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules. In a joint statement, Democratic members of the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission said the Senate vote “creates a massive gap in consumer protection law as broadband and cable companies now have no discernible privacy requirements.” The Internet and Television Association, a trade group, in a statement praised the vote as a “critical step towards re-establishing a balanced framework that is grounded in the long-standing and successful FTC privacy framework that applies equally to all parties operating online.” Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for advocacy group Consumers Union, said the vote “is a huge step in the wrong direction, and it completely ignores the needs and concerns of consumers.” ","

Don't show this again A judge tells Uber that even though its key witness is pleading the Fifth, its autonomous vehicle project could still be halted. Waymo has sued Uber, putting the ride-hailing company's self-driving car project at risk. A US judge has warned Uber that its self-driving car program could be halted by a lawsuit it's embroiled in. Uber is battling it out with Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google's parent company, Alphabet, and the ride-hailing company's key witness said Thursday that he intends to plead the Fifth and not testify in the case, according to Bloomberg. That witness, Anthony Levandowski -- who is Uber's head of autonomous vehicles -- said that testifying could open him up to criminal prosecution. The US Constitution's Fifth Amendment protects individuals against self-incrimination. Judge William Alsup replied that testimony or not, Uber could still be slapped with preliminary injunction. ""If you think for a moment that I'm going to stay my hand because your guy is taking the Fifth Amendment and not issue a preliminary injunction to shut down what happened here, you're wrong,"" Alsup said in a closed hearing on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. Uber has self-driving car pilots in Pennsylvania, Arizona and California. An injunction against the company could affect all three of these projects. Waymo filed its suit against Uber in February, and the original complaint read like a spy novel. Levandowski, a former Google employee, helped develop the company's lidar technology, a key component for self-driving cars that uses lasers to detect objects in a car's environment. Before leaving Google to found Otto, a self-driving trucking company, Levandowski allegedly downloaded 14,000 ""highly confidential"" files to a hard drive. The suit says San Francisco-based Uber benefited from the information after it bought Otto last year. Waymo said it learned of the alleged theft after a supplier accidentally emailed a Waymo employee a diagram of Uber's lidar dashboard. The lawsuit, being heard in the District Court for the Northern District of California, also complicates the already difficult relationship between the two companies. GV, Alphabet's venture capital arm, invested in Uber in 2013. It was one of the firm's most high-profile deals. As high profile as the legal battle is, Uber hopes parts of it will take place outside of public view. The company last week filed a motion to request that the disputes around trade secrets be resolved in private arbitration instead of a public court. The hearing to decide this matter is scheduled for April 27. The hearing for Alsup to decide whether to impose the preliminary injunction against Uber is set for May 3. During the closed hearing on Wednesday, Uber lawyer Arturo Gonzalez told Alsup that ""we're going to demonstrate to you that we are not using any of these things that they say he may have taken,"" according to Bloomberg. Uber said it plans to release its first public response and to lay out its case next week. ""We are very confident that Waymo's claims against Uber are baseless and that Anthony Levandowski has not used any files from Google in his work with Otto or Uber,"" said Angela Padilla, associate general counsel at Uber.

 ,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"(Reuters) - You know a case is momentous when a seemingly routine proposed briefing schedule turns into a hot dispute. Waymo’s patent and trade secrets suit accusing Uber of hijacking its technology for driverless cars is only five weeks old, but lawyers for both sides are already deep in litigation chess games. On Monday, Uber’s lawyers at Morrison & Foerster and Boies Schiller & Flexner filed a motion to compel arbitration of Waymo’s trade secrets and California unfair competition claims. The motion claimed Waymo’s lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan are trying to get away with a bit of litigation trickery. According to Uber, the crux of Waymo’s case, filed in federal court in San Francisco, is that engineer Anthony Levandowski, who led Waymo’s self-driving tech team for years, downloaded more than 14,000 sensitive files before he left the company to start up his own self-driving venture, which was later acquired by Uber. Levandowski, Uber said, signed two different employment contracts during his nine-year stint at Google and Waymo, both of which are subsidiaries of Alphabet. The agreements contained provisions requiring the engineer to arbitrate disputes with the company. Uber’s lawyers argued that because Waymo is accusing Uber of benefiting from Levandowski’s supposed violation of his employment contract, Levandowski’s arbitration clause applies. Uber’s brief cited cases to back its argument, which is based on the legal principle of equitable estoppel. In the closest parallel to the Waymo case, a federal judge in San Jose ordered the tech company Torbit to arbitrate its case against a fired software developer who allegedly misused Torbit trade secrets when he started his own company, Datanyze. Datanyze wasn’t subject to the employment agreement between Torbit and the developer, but the judge ruled the claims against the company were intertwined with allegations against the former employee. But Waymo, unlike Torbit in the Datanyze case, did not name its former employee as a defendant. It sued only Uber, not Levandowski, the former Waymo engineer who supposedly misappropriated Waymo data and brought it to his new employers at Uber. Uber’s motion called that elision a deliberate attempt to get around precedent requiring Waymo to go to arbitration. “Despite the myriad allegations about Levandowski’s serious misconduct while a Waymo employee, Waymo omits him as a named defendant,” Uber’s motion said. “Waymo’s purpose for proceeding in this curious manner seems clear: through artful pleading, it hopes to avoid arbitrating the misappropriation … claims at all costs.” Waymo, meanwhile, contends there is something fishy about the timing of Uber’s motion to compel arbitration. Uber first suggested at a hearing on March 16 that it would try to force Waymo into arbitration instead of litigating in federal court. On March 22, according to Waymo, Uber lawyer Arturo Gonzalez of MoFo said in an email to a Waymo lawyer that the motion would be filed the following day. Instead, Uber waited until three days later to file its motion. The timing is significant because the judge overseeing the litigation, U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco, has scheduled a May 4 hearing on Waymo’s motion for a preliminary injunction to block Uber from using supposedly misappropriated information. The judge told both sides at the March 16 hearing that he didn’t want to go to the trouble of a preliminary injunction hearing if the case is going to end up in arbitration. Uber has proposed an expedited schedule to get its motion before Judge Alsup on April 13, three weeks before the May 4 injunction hearing. The proposed schedule would only give Waymo until April 3 to file its opposition to Uber’s arbitration motion. That’s not long enough, Waymo said in a filing Tuesday - and Waymo should not be disadvantaged by Uber’s delay. If Uber had filed its motion on March 23, Waymo said, an ordinary briefing schedule would have given Waymo a full allotment of 14 days to oppose arbitration and still allowed Judge Alsup to hold a hearing before the May 4 injunction session. “Rather than accept the consequences of their own delay, defendants have asked Waymo to sacrifice half of its 14 days to respond to defendants’ motion so that their motion could be heard before May 4,” Waymo said. “It is unreasonable for defendants to seek to have Waymo’s response time cut in half simply because defendants delayed filing their motion.” Judge Alsup, who is all too familiar with the relentless litigation tactics of big tech companies from previously presiding over a hard-fought case between Google and Oracle, said in an order Tuesday that he intends to grant “a measure” of Uber’s proposed hurry-up schedule. He also said he’s not happy about the extent of redaction in Uber’s motion to compel arbitration. “Our federal courts belong to the public, and the public and the press have a legitimate interest in looking over our shoulders to see the work in progress,” he wrote. “Parties should not hide those arguments under seal out of a desire to shroud business dealings in secrecy.” That part of Judge Alsup’s order prompted Uber on Tuesday to blame Waymo for the redactions – even as Uber requested a secret meeting in the judge’s chambers “to protect legitimate privacy concerns” unrelated to the redactions. Uber said it only blacked out portions of its arbitration motion because Waymo’s former parent, Google, insisted “that the existence of an arbitration (provision) and every word in its employment agreements must be kept in strictest confidence.” I emailed lawyers for both Uber and Waymo to ask about the litigation gamesmanship. None got back to me. ","

The expansion abroad will entail opening up new offices, possibly in Europe, and offering localized versions of its products. “I think in two years we should be on par with Facebook and Google in user numbers,” Cai said. Co-founder and Chief Executive Wu Xinhong told Reuters the firm was also preparing to commercialize the facial recognition technology used in its image enhancing software. “We do not rule out collaboration with smartphone giants by exporting our software technology,” Wu said. He added that the firm plans to set up an artificial intelligence laboratory with leading universities this year and is also on track to launch Pushion, its fashion-focused social e-commerce platform in the first half of 2017. Last year the company incurred a net loss of 540.5 million yuan ($78.5 million), down from 710 million in 2015, while revenue rose to 1.58 billion yuan from 742 million yuan.

 ,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"Supported by SAN FRANCISCO — Congress on Tuesday moved to dismantle online privacy rules created during the Obama era. The rules, which were scheduled to take effect this year, would have required internet providers to get permission before collecting and selling a customer’s online information, including browsing activities. What does this mean for your privacy and what can you do? Here’s what to know. Congress voted to overturn rules created by the Federal Communications Commission in October that required broadband providers to get your permission before collecting private data on your online activities and offering it for sale to advertisers. The truth is, you never had much online privacy. The new F.C.C. rules had not taken effect, so you probably won’t notice any difference. Internet service providers have always been able to monitor network traffic, see what websites you visit and share some of that information with advertisers. Yes. The new F.C.C. rules would have given consumers stronger privacy protections — without such restrictions, internet providers may decide to become more aggressive with data collection and retention. Expect more targeted advertising to come your way. These companies provide your connection to the internet. Your gadgets are each assigned an identifier, called an IP address, and an internet provider can see which IP addresses are being used on your account. When you are browsing the web, the service provider helps route your device’s internet traffic to each destination website. In other words, internet providers can see which devices you use and which websites you visit and choose to retain that data. Many privacy advocates say this a good time to consider investing in a virtual private network, or VPN. A VPN is a tunnel that shields your browsing information from your internet service provider and allows you to appear as if you are in a different location. However, a VPN isn’t a foolproof solution. A VPN service is also tied to a service provider, meaning a VPN provider could also share your information with the service provider if it wanted to, said Runa Sandvik, a director of information security for The New York Times. In other words, you will have to pick a VPN provider that has a strong privacy policy and take a leap of faith. Ms. Sandvik recommended Freedome by F-Secure and said TunnelBear was another popular option. The Wirecutter, the product recommendations site owned by The New York Times, highlighted a service called Private Internet Access. People who are concerned about their privacy might also consider using Tor, a type of software that helps internet users mask their online identities and whereabouts, Ms. Sandvik said. Tor essentially encrypts your browsing activity and bounces a website request to multiple servers, decrypting layers of information about the request with every server “hop,” which makes it difficult to see from where and whom the original request came. Some services might break: for example, Netflix blocks VPN users from accessing its content. And Tor often makes web browsing sluggish. Ms. Sandvik recommended using a combination of the two whenever it feels necessary — like when you are accessing sensitive information related to your work, for instance. Follow Brian X.

 ,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"March 28 (Reuters) - The decision by the U.S. Congress to repeal rules that limit how internet service providers can use customer data has generated renewed interest in an old internet technology: virtual private networks, or VPNs. VPNs cloak a customer’s web-surfing history by making an encrypted connection to a private server, which then searches the Web on the customer’s behalf without revealing the destination addresses. VPNs are often used to connect to a secure business network, or in countries such as China and Turkey to bypass government restrictions on Web surfing. Privacy-conscious techies are now talking of using VPNs as a matter of course to guard against broadband providers collecting data about which internet sites and services they are using. “Time to start using a VPN at home,” Vijaya Gadde‏, general counsel of Twitter Inc, said in a tweet on Tuesday that was retweeted by Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. Gadde was not immediately available for comment. Twitter said she was commenting in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the company. The U.S. House of Representatives voted 215-205 on Tuesday to repeal rules adopted last year by the Federal Communications Commission under then-President Barack Obama to require broadband providers to obtain consumer consent before using their data for advertising or marketing. The U.S. Senate voted 50-48 last week to reverse the rules. The White House said President Donald Trump supported the repeal measure. Supporters of the repeal said the FCC unfairly required internet service providers like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. Critics said the repeal would weaken consumers’ privacy protections. Protected data includes a customer’s web-browsing history, which in turn can be used to discover other types of information, including health and financial data. Some smaller broadband providers are now seizing on privacy as a competitive advantage. Sonic, a California-based broadband provider, offers a free VPN service to its customers so they can connect to its network when they are not home. That ensures that when Sonic users log on to wi-fi at a coffee shop or hotel, for example, their data is not collected by that establishment’s broadband provider. “We see VPN as being important for our customers when they’re not on our network. They can take it with them on the road,” CEO Dane Jasper said. In many areas of the country, there is no option to choose an independent broadband provider and consumers will have to pay for a VPN service to shield their browsing habits. Private Internet Access, a VPN provider, took a visible stand against the repeal measure when it bought a full-page ad in the New York Times on Sunday. But the company, which boasts about a million subscribers, potentially stands to benefit from the legislation, acknowledged marketing director Caleb Chen. VPNs have drawbacks. They funnel all user traffic through one point, so they are an attractive target for hackers and spies. The biggest obstacle to their routine use as a privacy safeguard is that they can be too much of a hassle to set up for many customers. They also cost money. “The further along toward being a computer scientist you have to be to use a VPN, the smaller a portion of the population we’re talking about that can use it,” said Ernesto Falcon, a legislative counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which opposed the bill.

 ,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to sign a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules as a bigger fight looms over rules governing the openness of the internet, the White House said on Wednesday. Republicans in Congress on Tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The fight over privacy sets the stage for an even larger battle later this year over Republican plans to overturn the net neutrality provisions adopted by the administration of former President Barack Obama in 2015. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he did not know when Trump would sign the bill. The privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. Under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. The reversal is a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Republican commissioners have said the rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet the vote was “Terrible for American ppl, great for big biz.” Republicans next plan to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, in December said he believes that net neutrality’s days are numbered. The rules bar internet providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content and prohibit giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane” on the web’s information superhighway, to certain internet services. Critics say the rules opened the door to potential government rate regulation, tighter oversight and would provide fewer incentives to invest billions in broadband infrastructure. Pai told Reuters in February be backs “a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that” but has steadfastly declined to disclose his plans. Trump has not talked as president about net neutrality but in 2014 tweeted he opposed net neutrality. ","

Tim Parker,03302017,Investopedia,03232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs How safe is your valuable data and where should you keep it to make it safer? In 2016, the number of data breaches jumped 40%, according to a report from the Identity Resource Center and CyberScout. Victims included companies like Verizon and Anthem, prominent universities, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Democratic National Committee, to name a few.  If that doesn’t scare you into rethinking how you’re storing your valuable files, it should. There are three basic ways to store all your files: on your computer (if you still use a computer), on a private cloud and on a public cloud. Here is a look at each of these options, along with their pros and cons. If you lived through the dark days of early computers and “local file storage,” you likely stored all your valuable family photos, work files and possibly your pirated music and videos. (Remember Napster?) And then, no doubt,  you had this experience. At some point, you saw the message that made your heart sink. It threw around some computer lingo complete with an error code, but what it basically said was, “Sorry, all your stuff is gone and there’s nothing you can do about it.” That was the day you vowed that it would never happen again and you went out and got an external drive to back up your data. Although this method keeps your data relatively safe, if your computer is connected to the internet, you’ll need to know a thing or two about network security. You’ll need to configure a firewall and run constant scans. And, of course, you’ll need the actual external drive where you can back up all important files. This could be a drive that you plug in only when you’re backing up the data. The cost of a backup drive certainly beats some of the cloud alternatives. A 1TB external drive will cost you around $60.  As you’ll see, your other options are more pricey. Overall, trusting your computer to hold valuable files might not be the best idea unless you trust yourself to constantly back it up. (See also: Detailed Ways to Protect Digital Data and 4 Best and Safest Password Manager Apps for 2016.) The cloud is the 21st century computer term that everybody now knows but might not totally understand. At the most basic level, the cloud is just a collection of storage devices that aren’t part of your computer or mobile device. When people talk of storing their data in ""the cloud,""  they generally mean what's called a public cloud. You might know it as Dropbox or Google Drive. Apple machines have the iCloud. There are plenty of others, but these two are the most popular. These are companies that use massive collections of servers to store your files all around the world. People love the public cloud because their data is backed up, it’s easy to get to and many public cloud solutions now allow for basic editing. Instead of downloading and editing that Word document, you can now do it inside the cloud. And it’s not hard to find a free solution for small amounts of file storage. Even some of the largest companies rely on the public cloud. If you’re a Netflix junkie, you’re watching reruns of “Orange Is the New Black” (and all its other content) from the public cloud. (See: 8 Best Cloud Storage Solutions for Small Business.) The problem is that public clouds are increasingly the targets of hacker communities around the world. In 2016, Dropbox login data for 68 million of its customers was available on the Internet. While Dropbox said that it doesn’t believe any data were lost, it still shows that even the largest cloud companies are at risk. Amazon Web Services, the cloud backbone of many of the largest companies, suffered an outage this February that brought down a significant number of prominent company websites and services for a short time. Although rare, there’s no guarantee that you’ll have access to your data when you need it. Also consider pricing. You’re basically renting space on a company’s servers. In the case of Dropbox, the cost is $150 annually for 2TB of space. There is an alternative: a private cloud. You can purchase a 2TB (two terabytes) of private cloud solution for around $140 a year and head up in price from there. Need 8TB? That will only set you back about $300. A private cloud works well if you have basic needs. Pictures, a relatively small number of movies and a reasonable amount of other files works perfectly for a private cloud. The newer products even allow you to access your cloud from outside of your home. But there are problems with private clouds. First, if it’s connected to the Internet, hackers can get to it and that could mean trouble. The good news is that unless you’re a very well-known person, a hacker probably isn’t interested in making you a target. Second, you’ll need to have a backup solution in place. What if the unthinkable were to happen? A house fire, for example? For super important files, you’ll probably need another external drive that resides away from your home or in a fireproof safe.  Remember the price of your personal cloud? For personal file storage, a personal cloud solution is more economical, but despite the rare data breaches, the features that come with public cloud offerings probably make it worth the cost. Dropbox, for example, allows you to recover deleted files for 120 days and provides powerful data encryption and two-factor authentication – an extra security measure that makes it harder for hackers to get to your data. Some of this is possible on private clouds, but it may take some advanced tech knowledge. If your file storage needs are basic and hackers probably don’t want anything of yours anyway, a personal cloud will likely work well for you. You can use Google Drive or Dropbox’s free services to provide another layer of backup for those files as well. For more complicated needs where data backup and security is more important, you’ll probably need a public cloud solution.    ",Hacker Protection: Should You Have a Personal Cloud? | Investopedia
Rebecca McClay,03302017,Investopedia,03232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs For the first time in history, more people live in urban areas than rural areas. About 55 percent of the world’s population now lives in cities, where economic activity generates 86 percent of global GDP. By 2050, the number of people living in cities are expected to swell to include 70 percent of the world’s population. With the population shift, metropolitan areas will be reaching tipping points in regards to infrastructure, housing, and the environment. They face increasing cybersecurity and terrorism risks. So-called ""smart cities"" are tackling these challenges by leveraging technologies like broadband internet, the internet of things (IoT) and the cloud. A broad range of U.S. companies are positioned to benefit by offering services to cities where rapidly growing populations are straining resources and creating challenges to keeping municipal services running smoothly. Cities like Singapore, London, New York, Paris and Tokyo can achieve 30 percent reductions in crime and energy use and 20 percent reduction in water loss and traffic delays by deepening investments in technology, according to a recent Bank of America report. In the U.S., the smart city market is expected to grow to as much as $1.6 trillion by 2020, triggering fast growth in areas like 5G mobile communications, artificial intelligence (AI), building automation, big data, bricks and steel infrastructure, and cloud. Companies involved in cybersecurity, electric cars, IoT, sensors, surveillance and telecom infrastructure should see demand rapidly increase with urbanization. (See also: 2016’s Most Promising Countries to Invest In.) Multinational companies, especially those with aggressive technology strategies, have high exposure to these smart cities. Choosing the right investments from this group should give investors a great opportunity to capitalize on the challenges of increasing populations. Bank of America has identified 250 stocks that have exposure to smart cities, and has ranked them according to low, medium and high exposure. Below we look at the top U.S. company picks in each category. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), with a market cap of $164.2 billion, operates in more than 170 countries manufacturing computer hardware and software. Constantly innovating new products and discarding outdated strategies, IBM has high exposure to smart cities, according to Bank of America. (See also: IBM Launches Enterprise-Ready Blockchain Service.) American Tower Corp. (AMT), owner and operator of infrastructure for wireless broadcast communications, is also well positioned to leverage urban population explosions in areas that are rapidly adopting technologies. The Boston-based company, with a market cap of $49.8 billion, operates about 100,000 different communications sites in 13 countries. And technology giants Intel Corp. (INTC​) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO​), which provide network connectivity services around the globe, are also very well positioned in smart cities. Two U.S. companies that have high exposure to demand for buildings that are outfitted in modern technology, called “intelligent buildings,” are IBM and Cisco. General Electric Co. (GE) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON), which provide building automation systems, have medium exposure to smart cities, according to Bank of America. General Electric has a market cap of $260.8 billion, and Honeywell has a market cap of $97.1 billion. (See also: Manufacturing Giants Back U.S. Tax Reforms.) Alarm.com Holdings Inc. (ALRM​), a Vienna, Virginia-based company that provides cloud-based services for home monitoring, is the only company in Bank of America’s “smart home” category that has high exposure to smart cities. Last year, Alarm.com integrated its platform with both Apple Inc.’s (AAPL​) Apple TV and Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN​) Echo. Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL​) and Apple, with their myriad of popular high-tech consumer products, have medium exposure to smart cities. (See also: Google Releases Amazon Echo Competitor Google Home.) No U.S. firm had high exposure to high-tech safety and security needs, but Bank of America identified several with medium exposure: Barracuda Networks Inc. (CUDA​), Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW​) and Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR​), VMware Inc. (VMW) and Symantec Corp. (SYMC​). These firms have significant business worldwide in cybersecurity efforts expected to be in higher demand with the rise of urbanization. For example, Barracuda provides security networks and products that protect email and web surfing against viruses and spyware, among other threats. The Campbell, California-based company is transitioning to a cloud-based model that’s among the fastest in the IT landscape, according to Baird. (See also: Barracuda Networks Rises on Robust Q3.) First Solar Inc. (FSLR​), with a market cap of $3 billion, and SunPower Corp. (SPWR​), with a market cap of $876.1 million, both have medium exposure in solar energy, which is on track to become the main source of energy production by 2050. First Solar has a massive presence in utility-scale energy, and SunPower is a dominant player in residential and commercial solar energy products. (See also: A Look at Solar Energy Earnings.) In the renewable energy and utilities sector, NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE), Edison International (EIX) and PG&E Corp. (PCG) are among U.S. firms with medium exposure to smart cities. Tesla Inc. (TSLA​), the newest American automaker, is the only U.S. company with high exposure to the ""smart mobility"" trend. With a market cap of $42.4 billion, the Palo Alto, California-based company has sold more than 186,000 electric vehicles worldwide as of December 2016. General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F), the first and second largest automakers in the U.S. respectively, both offer hybrid models including pickup trucks. Their high-tech car models help give them medium exposure to increased demands in efficient transportation, according to Bank of America. (See also: General Motors Vs. Ford: Which is the Better Buy?) In healthcare, Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG​), with more than 1,240 da Vinci Surgical Systems installations that allow for robotic control during surgeries, has medium exposure to smart cities. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company has a market cap of $27.8 billion. Intuitive Surgical stock is up 28.8 percent the past year, tapping fresh all-time highs Monday. In the water and waste sector, Ecolab Inc. (ECL), a water and hygiene technology provider with a market cap of $36.7 billion, and American Water Works Co. (AWK), a public utility company in the U.S. and Canada with a market cap of $13.6 billion, also have medium exposure to smart cities.

Rakesh Sharma,03302017,Investopedia,03232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk wants to upload thoughts to your brain. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the 45-year-old billionaire has launched his fourth company, Neuralink – a startup that focuses on ""neural lace"" technology, or technology that connects human brains with computers. To do this, the company uses implantable brain electrodes that act as an additional artificial intelligence layer in conjunction with the organ's neuron networks. The startup is registered as a medical research company and already has big names in the industry associated with it. The WSJ report states that Neuralink's first products could be implantable electrodes that could be used to treat diseases related to the brain, such as depression or Parkinson's disease. Subsequently, it could move on to products that ""enhance cognitive function."" (See also: Elon Musk: Success Story.) Musk used a combination of equity funds and personal cash to finance the company. He is already the CEO of electric car maker Tesla and chairman of space company SpaceX, and he recently launched the Boring Company, a startup that intends to drill holes through the earth to develop a 3D transportation network system that eases traffic congestion. (See also: Musk Reveals Details About His Boring Plan.) Musk's newest company has its root in the disconnect in the data processing capabilities between computers and humans. Humans find it difficult to process and understand an increasingly data-driven world. In contrast, the capabilities of computers like Watson have increased exponentially due to advances in technology. Musk has proposed developing a ""direct cortical interface"" by implanting electrodes to enhance human intelligence. DARPA is engaged in a similar venture to develop an implantable neural interface that can receive and process information from up to 1 million neurons. (See also: The Other Side of Watson's AI Solution.) As the WSJ report points out, Musk has already alluded to his intentions regarding artificial intelligence. For example, he tweeted in January that an announcement related to his work on neural lace technology might come soon. He has also spoken at length about the dangers of artificial intelligence taking over humanity and started a nonprofit called OpenAI to chart a safer path toward the future. At the same time, he has also profited from his AI investments. For example, DeepMind, the U.K.-based AI startup that he invested in, was bought by Alphabet Inc. (GOOG​) subsidiary Google for more than $500 million. But Musk told Vanity Fair that his investment was a means ""to keep an eye on the arc of AI."" According to the WSJ report, Facebook, Inc.

Michelle Castillo,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Google is under fire after several ads were seen running next to offensive content in the U.K. — including neo-Nazi and jihadist videos — on YouTube and other websites it serves ads on. The revelation, first reported in early February by The Times of London, led media buying agency Havas to pull all its YouTube and Google Digital Network ads in the U.K. Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan, AT&T and Verizon, among others, have suspended or pulled advertising with Google as well. To better understand how these ads wind up next to offensive content, it helps to understand how companies buy ads online. Say that media buyers decide YouTube is the best place. Here are the main ways they could buy an ad there: On the other hand, a media buyer could decide that a simple display ad is better. Display ads are text, image or video ads that appear on websites, essentially the online equivalent of print ads. Google is one of the biggest companies that ""serves"" online ads, meaning it owns technology that places ads on websites. Here's how those media buyers can buy display ads through Google: In the old days, if a brand wanted to reach a certain demographic, media buyers would turn to a TV channel that they knew had a high number of viewers in that group, said Mikkel If Hansen, partner and product owner at media analytics platform Blackwood Seven. The company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help brands make more efficient ad buys. But those ads would appear to anybody watching the TV channel, including people outside the desired demographic. Advertisers, in a sense, overpaid to reach their desired audience. Digital platforms allow brands to target only the people they want. If people are logged into their Google accounts and have entered their personal information, the company can tell their age, gender, and location data, among other aspects like search history and websites they visit. Though digital ads are more targeted and can reach more people than TV commercials, Google and other ad tech companies use computer programs rather than people to decide where to place ads, because media buyers are purchasing type of person not a specific website. It also means no one knows all the instances the ad appeared. ""It's difficult for them to see what they bought because you are buying behavior and not actual placements,"" Hansen said. In addition, technology isn't quite good enough yet to block objectionable content instantaneously. Google can block websites tagged with offensive words, but it's harder to ""see"" what the videos are about, said Borchard. About 400 minutes of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute. ""The sheer amount of video that is being uploaded to YouTube is mindboggling,"" Borchard said. In short, there's far too much content online to scan and immediately remove if deemed offensive. Companies still rely on people to tag bad content that may have slipped through their sensors. Plus, there are potential legal issues that prevent blocking content. In a blog post on Monday, Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler apologized for the ad adjacency issues, and said the company is working to make sure that ads only show up next to creators the company can vouch for, and make it easier for advertisers to control which kinds of content their ads appear next to. Schindler also said the company will share more about where ads run, as well as act faster to take down questionable videos. ",Google ad scandal: How companies buy YouTube and Google display ads
Luke Graham,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Google is releasing an artificial-intelligence powered, voice-activated device in the U.K. on April 6 to compete with the Amazon Echo. The Google Home is a hands-free smart device powered by the Google Assistant. Using voice commands, consumers can ask it questions, request music or news briefings, and use it to help schedule their personal life. The release follows on the heels of Amazon, which launched the Echo digital personal assistant in Europe in September. Google first unveiled the Home in October. ""Google Home is a hands-free smart speaker powered by the Google Assistant that does just that. Whether you want to get answers from Google, turn up the music, sort out some everyday tasks or control compatible smart devices in your home, all you have to do is say 'Ok Google',"" said Suveer Kothari, director of product partnerships and planning for Google Home, on a blog post. Google promises the device, which costs £129 ($162), will work with other smart devices in your home, meaning users could control lights, switches and the temperature using voice commands and the Home. Along with the device, the internet giant introduced Google Wifi, a new internet router intended to cope with the increasing number of connected devices in our homes which require high bandwidths. ""Google Wifi is a connected system that replaces your current router to bring smarts, security and simplicity to home Wi-Fi to give you consistently strong coverage in your home,"" said Kothari.

Jon Fortt,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Katie Jacobs Stanton knows how to create her own options.  Stanton, a veteran of Twitter, Google, Yahoo and a presidential administration, now serves as chief marketing officer of genetic testing startup Color Genomics. Her professional journey from East Coast to West, and back and forth again, has given her rare insight into the workplace cultures that shape us today. For its podcast, Fortt Knox sat down with Stanton to talk about the environment for women in tech, and her journey to the executive ranks in Silicon Valley. Here are some key lessons from our conversation: Stanton's timing was great, joining Google in 2003 after a stint at Yahoo and a maternity leave. But she encountered some obstacles right out of the gate.  ""When I was at Yahoo, I was hired as a product manager for Yahoo Finance, and helped build the site and build it internationally. And so when I came to Google, naturally I thought, 'I can be a product manager here,'"" she said. ""And Google said, 'No, I'm sorry, you don't have a computer science background.' And I was like, but I just helped build this great product on the web, and I've been there for three years, and I was promoted.""  The leadership structure at Google was unmoved. No computer science background, no product management.  But that didn't stop Stanton. She found engineers who would work with her, and brought Google Finance to market. Along the way, she gained a reputation as a person who could ship new ideas. Stanton is from New York, went to college in Tennessee, ditched the East Coast for Silicon Valley in her 20s, and did a stint as director of citizen participation in the Obama administration and as a technology advisor in the State Department before heading back to California. International travel has helped broaden her horizons; she was serving as vice president of Twitter's international business when the company went public. That now influences what Stanton looks for when she's hiring.  ""I look for people with international experience, something I believe strongly in. People who speak foreign languages, I think, have always stood out to me,"" Stanton said, adding that she looks for those qualities even in roles that don't require it. ""I think it just brings a different lens and a different empathy, a different perspective to things.""  As someone who hadn't traveled internationally when I started my career, I couldn't help but notice that in some ways, Stanton's preference for well-traveled people could be as limiting as Google's preference for coders as product managers. The key, it seems, is to show you can deliver what the job requires even if your resume isn't the obvious fit. Stanton was fortunate enough to work for a string of female bosses during her six-year run at Google, an experience that's pretty rare in Silicon Valley's tech scene. She says having women in leadership positions will also be important to the next generation.  ""You can't be what you can't see. I think for a lot of girls, not seeing other female professors of computer science, other leaders in business"" can be a barrier, she said. ""We still have a lot of work to do for women in leadership positions.""  She's certainly doing her part. ",How one Silicon Valley insider got around Google’s leadership rules
Anita Balakrishnan,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Google may not be able to guarantee advertisements won't appear next to offensive content, but it is working on a solution that ""can get pretty close,""  according to Alphabet's executive chairman Eric Schmidt talking to FOX Business on Thursday. Google has faced fallout on Wall Street this week as advertisers put pronounced pressure on the company's policies. Google is one of the top platforms for digital advertisers, accounting for about 40 percent of all online ad budgets, and 13 percent of display ad budgets, according to eMarketer. Google's YouTube video site ran ads for major brands next to neo-Nazi and jihadist videos, according to The Times of London. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson have since suspended some digital advertising, and some analysts said the outcry could be a concern for the company's outlook. Schmidt was asked whether he can ensure that the algorithm doesn't make the same mistake again. ""We can't guarantee it, but we can get pretty close,"" he said. Google has increased the time it takes to manually review ad matching and violations of Google's terms of service, Schmidt said. Hopefully, Google can build products that can move extreme content down in the rankings in a way that's better than what social media does, Schmidt said. ""We're very good at detecting what's the most relevant and what's the least relevant. It should be possible for computers to detect malicious, misleading and incorrect information and essentially have you not see it. We're not arguing for censorship, we're arguing just take it off the page, put it somewhere else...make it harder to find,"" Schmidt said, adding:  ""I think we're going to be ok."" Schmidt also appeared on ""CBS This Morning,"" where he discussed the new presidential administration. He said that it was ""literally crazy"" to not allow talented people to come to America, just because they are foreign. ""It is insane to allow people to stay in other countries who want to come to our country to create companies, and to create new jobs, create wealth, and power our economy,"" Schmidt said.

Google Play, combined with third-party Android stores, are set to surpass Apple's mobile App Store in 2017 for consumer spending, a report from App Annie predicts. And a big reason for that is China, as Chinese app stores are now a key battleground for the rival operating systems. In addition to the main Google Play Store, Android users, mostly in China, can also access app stores through internet brands like Tencent and Baidu, and manufacturers like Xiaomi and Huawei. Those third-party Android stores only made about $10 billion in 2016, but will grow to about $36 billion by 2021, App Annie forecasts. ""What a lot of people don't realize is how huge China is,"" said Danielle Levitas, App Annie's senior vice president of research. ""Even if device sales slow, it's the biggest smartphone channel, and that's not going to change."" Just this year, consumer spending on third-party Android apps is expected to double, boosting the platform past Apple, App Annie forecasts. Across all Android stores, spending is expected to hit about $41 billion this year, just above the Apple App Store's $40 billion, App Annie estimated. Last year, consumers spent about $27 billion across all Android app stores, compared with about $34 billion in Apple's App Stores, the report said. App Annie's forecasts are based on a model that looks at data from major publishers, economic conditions, conversations with stakeholders and past performance,  said Levitas.

While a significant amount his wealth comes from stock he received as Google's CEO, the billionaire credits a few personal finance strategies with helping build his net worth. Here are the three tips Schmidt says any professional can use to make and save more money: 1. Take full advantage of your 401(k) ""If your company offers matching 401(k), take it — all of it,"" the exec tells CNBC. ""Maximize what you put into anything that's matched,"" he says. ""That's a 50 or 100 percent return depending on your company's policy, instantly.""  This isn't the only piece of advice Schmidt has for professionals. In a recently-updated edition of ""How Google Works,"" he says workers should have an elevator pitch memorized. It's not only useful for getting a new job, but can help you advance in your current role. In the book, Schmidt also encourages professionals to read constantly read about their industry. 2. Don't try to beat the market While it may be tempting to buy or sell stocks based on daily movements, short-term trading isn't going to make you rich, Schmidt says. ""Don't try to beat the market,"" he says. ""Don't try to pick stocks."" Instead, think long-term. ""Invest in index funds, Vanguard funds,"" he says, emphasizing different types of mutual funds tied to broad sectors of the stock market. This long-term strategy is the same one billionaire Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, swears by. 3. Think twice about hiring a money manager ""Two words: 'Minimize fees,'"" Schmidt says. ""Do not pay someone a lot of money to manage your money for you."" Schmidt says that paying someone to manager your money ends up costing you more over time. ""Understand how much it costs you to pay someone one percent a year to manage your money,"" he says. Instead, he says, take that money you save on fees and invest it yourself.

Marguerite Ward,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Google exec Peter Roper attributes his professional success to one specific trait: fearlessness. Before Roper became Google's head of mobile brand strategy in 2014, he made a point of constantly taking steps to build his skill set. He would propose complex projects, partner with people in different industries and even switched jobs based on what he thought he could learn in the next role. That skill-seeking strategy, along with one very bold move in particular, helped him land a leadership position at one of the most important companies in the world. ""If you're fearless,"" Roper tells CNBC, ""you're able to go after the goals that you want to achieve."" In 2013, he sent a cold email to the CEO of Songza, a music app he loved. He asked if the company was looking for anyone to help run sales. While Songza did not have any job openings listed online, the CEO responded saying that he was, in fact, looking for a sales executive. Roper landed the job, and a few years later, Google acquired the app. Soon after, Google asked him to join the team. ""If you don't put yourself out there,"" he says, ""nobody's really going to hand you the big project, or hand you the job."" When you take a risk such as cold emailing a hiring manager or proposing a new project to your boss, people will notice, according to the executive. In fact, bold moves like these help you regardless of whether someone notices, according to former Google career coach Jenny Blake. Roper isn't the only business leader whose career took off as a result of boldness. Ursula Burns, executive chairman at Xerox, got a promotion that set her on track to the C-suite after she challenged an executive in a meeting. Mark Zuckerburg, Steve Jobs and other tech visionaries dropped out of college to pursue their ideas. While those moves may seem exceptionally bold, successful people often take big risks.

Geoff Cutmore,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Technology stocks like Google and Facebook will not see their valuations hit by criticisms over the way they deal with inappropriate content, pioneering venture capitalist Yossi Vardi told CNBC on Friday, but added the firms will need to take more responsibility in policing what ends up on their services. Vardi, who has often been dubbed the ""godfather of Israel technology"" and is the chairman of venture capital firm International Technology Ventures, said that tech companies have usually not acted until a court order has come to them, but this could change. ""Because of the magnitude and the effect of them on everybody's life and becoming the foremost media platform they have to take different issues ... they are being drafted into editing the content and again,"" Vardi said. His comments come after the U.S. search giant came under fire from brands concerned that their advertisements on Google-owned video service YouTube were being placed next to extremist content. London newspaper The Times, found that ads from brands such as Mercedes-Benz and Waitrose were appearing next to neo-Nazi and jihadi content on YouTube. Many brands have pulled their advertising from YouTube, with the latest being  AT&T and Johnson & Johnson. The news has prompted debate over whether technology firms can just take a hands-off approach, or whether they act more like media companies and edit content. Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said on Tuesday the company is going to hire ""significant numbers of people"" and develop new tools using artificial intelligence to improve its ability to review questionable content. This was followed on Wednesday with an announcement that the online giant was carrying out an extensive review of its advertising policies. Facebook has also dealt with criticism over its dealing with inappropriate content, particularly around the issue of fake news. Wall Street has been concerned about the business impact on the likes of Facebook and Google. Vardi said that even if these firms had to bolster the number of people doing oversight on content, it would only be a small cost in comparison to the broader business. ""I don't think it's going to affect the valuation in a big way because whatever it will be, it will be a small fraction of the total cost,"" Vardi said. ""It will effect how people are perceiving the role of the social networks.""

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is already a dominant force in digital display advertising. eMarketer expects the social network giant's share of the U.S. market to climb to 39.1% this year, as it sells more than three times as much display advertising as its next closest competitor, Google. The Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company is expected to generate $5.2 billion in U.S. display advertising this year. But Facebook's ad revenue is largely confined to its own properties, such as Facebook and Instagram. The Facebook Audience Network (FAN) -- its ad network -- generates only a few hundred million in annual net ad revenue for the company. That number could get a significant boost in the near term, as Facebook just announced it's rolling out header bidding to all mobile web publishers. That represents not only a significant opportunity for Facebook to increase its network ad revenue, but a threat to Google's display ad business as well. Image source: Facebook Header bidding is a system that levels the playing field when it comes to selling ads online. Previously, whenever you loaded a web page, that publisher would check ad networks one by one until it found an advertiser willing to pay a reasonable price to populate the ads on the site. Since Google is such a dominant force in advertising, publishers' searches usually started and ended with Google. Header bidding allows publishers to collect bids from multiple ad networks at the same time and receive the highest bid for its ad inventory. As a result, publishers receive more revenue for their ads, and smaller ad networks stand a fighting chance against Google. The more ad networks supporting header bidding, the better it is for publishers. Facebook says publishers in its tests saw a revenue increase of 10% to 30%. Image source: Facebook Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) notably developed a header bidding solution last year in an effort to potentially grow its advertising business. Given Amazon's prowess in cloud computing -- supporting hundreds of major websites -- its integrated cloud-based solution could prove extremely popular with publishers. Now, Facebook is partnering with Amazon and several other header-bidding system developers to bring its ad network to more publishers. Facebook's audience network still represents a small part of Facebook's revenue. It reached a $1 billion run rate at the beginning of 2016, but that's gross revenue. Facebook only keeps a small percentage of that figure as net revenue. During Facebook's second-quarter earnings call last year, CFO Dave Wehner told analysts: ""The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution, as is the Audience Network."" That may change later this year, however, as Facebook faces ad load saturation. But with the social network's steady user growth and continued increases in engagement, Facebook's enormousness will still be tough to overshadow. Nonetheless, the growth of FAN will certainly help Facebook offset some of the slowdown at its flagship app. In fact, since the audience network uses the same targeting data as Facebook's in-house ads, Facebook advertisers may be inclined to start buying more ads on Facebook, especially if header bidding increases its ability to win bids on publishers' websites. FAN represents an opportunity for marketers to reach Facebook's audience outside Facebook and even expand beyond Facebook. Management says FAN offers 16% greater reach than Facebook alone and now reaches 1 billion people monthly. The value of FAN to publishers is that Facebook requires marketers to bid the same on FAN ads as on its own ads. Therefore, third-party publishers get the same (presumably high) rates as Facebook. If Facebook's average bid is higher than Google's, it could force Google to lower its take rate from publishers. Last year, Google generated $15.6 billion in gross revenue from its network partners. It also paid out $10.9 billion in revenue sharing to those publishers, about 70%. In fact, publishers' revenue share from Google has increased two percentage points since 2014, when header bidding started becoming popular. Google said that ""the increase in Network Members' TAC [traffic acquisition cost] rate was primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying."" As more ad sales shift to header bidding and more ad networks like Facebook join the fray, Google stands to see that number continue climbing, unless it wants to lose out on some of that $15.6 billion in gross revenue it generated last year.

"Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Brian Feroldi",03302017,Fool,03232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. We asked three of our contributors to each discuss a company that fits the above description. Here's why Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Waste Management (NYSE:WM) are three of the best businesses, and the best stocks, we've ever seen. All that revenue is wonderful, but what I really love about Mastercard's business is its operating leverage. In essence, this means that Mastercard's costs are largely fixed, so processing one more transaction costs the company next to nothing. Thus, every additional transaction that the company can incentivize on its network almost turns into pure profit. Since consumers have been ditching cash and checks in favor of credit and debit cards for years, Mastercard's profit margin has skyrocketed. MA Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Looking ahead, I see no reason for this trend to change. While credit and debit cards are ubiquitous in developed markets, they only represent 15% of global transactions. That suggests that this company has decades of room left for revenue and profit growth. If true, then Mastercard's stock stands a good chance at continuing to thump the market from here. That's why I've made this company one of my biggest personal holdings and have no intention to sell my shares anytime soon. Tim Green (Alphabet): The amount of cash that Alphabet's Google throws off is made even more impressive by the fact that the company is still growing at a double-digit rate. Revenue from Google grew by 20% in 2016 to $89.5 billion, with the business producing operating income of $27.9 billion. While Google does face threats, ranging from social media companies like Facebook to e-commerce giant Amazon, the company's products are so deeply embedded in people's lives that upending its business model would be a herculean task. Google dominates search, leaving its competitors fighting over the scraps. Products like Gmail, Maps, and the Chrome browser have become the standards, giving Google a massive base of users. Google's Android mobile operating system powers more than 85% of all smartphones sold, and its Chromebooks now account for more than half of all U.S. classroom devices sold. All of this feeds into it advertising business and its cloud computing business. Image source: Alphabet. The success of Google allows Alphabet to subsidize its moon shots. From self-driving cars to internet access delivered via balloons, Alphabet is betting billions that one of these long-shot ideas will take off. Many will lead nowhere, but the potential of each idea is enormous. Alphabet is one of the most successful companies in history, and that success has been sustained by significant competitive advantages. Even if none of Alphabet's moonshots pay off, the company should continue to thrive well into the future. Tyler Crowe (Waste Management): I think of some of the best businesses to be in are the ones that we don't consider on a daily basis. Those day-to-day tasks we take for granted and think nothing of paying for the service. Is there anything that fits that description better than handling our refuse? Companies that collect and properly dispose of our trash are incredibly valuable services that we barely notice. Behind the scenes, though, it is a business that has more competitive advantages than one can count. That's what makes Waste Management the kind of company that leaves me in awe of its business model. The most obvious advantage a waste handling industry has is geography and regulations. The ability to open up a new landfill for proper waste disposal faces mountains of regulatory scrutiny as well as the ""not in my backyard"" mentality of local communities. So those companies that can get a landfill up and running have near-monopolistic reign over a particular region. If that weren't enough, it's extremely capital intense to build and maintain a fleet of collection vehicles. These types of strategic benefits keep competition low in specific regions and give those operating in a particular community incredible pricing power. For investors in Waste Management, it has translated this economic moat into a value-generating machine. While no one will ever be blown away with the company's growth rates, it continues to generate gobs of free cash flow that is used to buy back stock and increase dividend payments. These sorts of shareholder-friendly initiatives have made Waste Management an incredible stock to hold for decades at a time. WM Dividend data by YCharts. It's hard to disrupt a well-entrenched business in the waste-handling industry, and that makes Waste Management a stock that should tug at the heartstrings of long-term investors. ","

Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage these days and has been dominating the headlines, while every tech company worth its salt is getting into the game. With all the hype, investors may be asking themselves: What's the best way to invest in this growing trend? Let's look at three companies with solid artificial-intelligence programs: e-commerce titan Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google search parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and cognitive-computing leader International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM). Amazon's Echo smart-home speaker, powered by AI-based Alexa. Image source: Amazon, Inc. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes that AI could be the fourth pillar of the company's business, behind its e-commerce, its cloud hosting unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its Prime membership program. Alexa, the company's virtual assistant and AI poster child, hosts a variety of products that leverage her AI foundation, including the Echo smart-home speaker, the smaller Dot, and the portable Tap, as well as the Fire tablet and Fire TV Stick. Using natural-language processing and cloud computing, these products respond to voice commands, and AI allows Alexa to learn continuously the more the products are used. Developers have created more than 10,000 ""skills"" that provide a variety of functionality, from ordering pizza to scheduling a ride-share. Amazon has also been leveraging its deep-learning innovations by deploying them across AWS as managed services available to its customers. Lex, similar to Alexa, can build sophisticated chatbots; Rekognition provides image-recognition capabilities; and Polly reads and recites text. Amazon grew its revenue to $46 billion in its most recent quarter, so its AI contribution is currently microscopic, but that could change. RBC Capital Markets predicts that Alexa could contribute an additional $10 billion annually by 2020. Google Home smart speaker system. Image source: Google. Google has been investing heavily for years in a sub-discipline of AI called deep learning, and the result of that research is an artificial neural network, christened the Google Brain. By combining massive amounts of data with complicated algorithms, the system recognizes patterns and learns in a way similar to the human brain. The company has infused the knowledge gained into a vast array of its businesses, using AI to improve the reliability of its ubiquitous search, decrease the energy consumption of its servers, and catalog images from its Street View mapping cars. Its AI-powered Google Assistant, the company's entry in the growing list of virtual personal assistants, is available in many of the company's branded devices and is the foundation for its Google Home smart speaker system. Google Assistant interacts with the company's Photos, Maps, Keep, Calendar, and other services, provides the ability to stream music and movies to Android mobile devices, and controls home-automation products. Google is also a well-known pioneer in the area of AI-based autonomous driving. With $26 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter, Alphabet will notice little effect from Home just yet; this is a new product, so we don't have data for how popular it is, but the potential market is huge. Activate.com estimates that smart speakers will be in 21 million homes by 2020. Watson employs advanced analytics to ""see"" medical images. Image source: IBM. Watson has partnered in other fields, improving the accuracy of tax returns, providing cybersecurity, and improving regulatory compliance for financial institutions. Watson is a bet on AI-based cognitive computing, data analytics, and cloud computing, as the company moves away from its legacy hardware and IT services business. IBM has yet to disclose Watson's contribution, but ""strategic imperatives,"" where Watson's revenue is reported, grew 13% in 2016 to account for 41% of total revenue. These companies are at the forefront of the AI revolution, but AI innovations represent only a portion of their total business. Investors should avoid investing in any of these companies based solely on the advantages represented by AI. That said, if you like any of these companies and are interested in adding AI to your portfolio, each offers that opportunity. While it may be difficult to quantify many of the benefits, we do know that AI can help increase revenue and efficiency, provide a compelling and productive ecosystem to consumers, and provide new opportunities for business.

Although he's known as one of the best stock-pickers of all time, billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said several times that the best investment most people can make is a simple low-cost S&P 500 ETF. In fact, he's nine years into a 10-year bet that such a fund of his choosing could beat a set of at least five hedge funds. Buffett's pick for the bet? The Vanguard S&P 500 index fund, which is available in both ETF and mutual fund forms. Image source: Getty Images. As the name implies, this ETF tracks the S&P 500 index, which is composed of 500 of the largest publicly traded American companies. And don't think by simply investing in an index fund like this that you'll be sacrificing performance -- over long periods of time, the S&P 500 has averaged annual returns of 9-10% (including dividends), and has outperformed 80% of actively managed large-cap mutual funds over the past 10 years. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO) is an excellent option for new investors, as it's a diverse basket of the largest U.S. companies, and comes with an extremely low expense ratio (annual management fee) of just 0.04%. In other words, if your initial investment in the fund is for $1,000, this translates to an annual management fee of just $0.40. The iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) invests in companies with above-average growth potential. Specifically, the fund tracks the S&P 900 Growth Index, which is composed of large- and mid-cap U.S. companies that exhibit growth characteristics. Growth stocks are generally defined as companies whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the average company within the same industry. Growth stocks tend to be a bit more volatile than value stocks, which are generally more stable and mature businesses. To give you an idea of the type of companies that qualify as ""growth"" stocks, the fund's top five holdings are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet (Google). Not surprisingly, there are a lot of tech stocks in the index, due to the growing nature of the industry. Because of this inherent volatility risk, growth stocks are an especially good candidate for ETF investors, new and experienced. So, over the short term, these stocks can move up and down quite a bit (check out a 5-year chart of Facebook), but they certainly have higher growth potential over the long run. This makes this ETF an especially good choice for new investors who are relatively young and have a long time horizon to ride out the ups and downs. And with an expense ratio of just 0.05%, it's tough to find a cheaper growth stock ETF option. The High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which is a collection of stocks (394 to be exact) that pay above-average dividend yields, specifically excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs). As of January 2018, the fund pays a 3.5% dividend yield. Among the fund's top investments are rock-solid American companies such as Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. Like the other Vanguard fund I discussed, this one also has an extremely low expense ratio -- 0.08% in this case. ","
      
    3 Top ETFs for New Investors -- The Motley Fool

Todd Campbell,03302017,Fool,03232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Social Security benefits can be claimed at any point after a recipient turns age 62, and most Americans take their Social Security as soon as they can. Claiming benefits early can be smart, but it can pay off to wait. If you're deciding when to start receiving Social Security, here's what to consider. Retirement usually means a big drop in income, and if you don't have a solid grasp on what your spending is going to look like in retirement, then you won't be able to make the best decision on when to claim. Image source: Getty Images. Depending on who you talk to, experts usually recommend budgeting for 70% to 80% of your pre-retirement income to cover expenses in retirement. However, the exact amount you'll need depends on your specific situation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), retirees spend the most money on home mortgages and auto loans, so if those loans won't be paid off when you retire, you'll need to budget accordingly. Overall, the BLS reports that the average 65-plus household spends about $45,221 per year, and housing and transportation account for $15,711 and $6,830 per year, respectively. Healthcare is another big expense in retirement, and it's usually smart to over-budget when it comes to planning for those expenses. If you're healthy, your costs might not increase significantly at first, but you'll likely require more healthcare as you get older, and that healthcare won't be cheap. Healthcare spending in over-65 households totals $5,877 per year, according to the BLS, including $4,029 for health insurance and another $694 for medicine. Fidelity Investments estimates that a couple retiring at 65 this year will fork out over $275,000 in healthcare expenses during their retirement, and ultimately, the tally could be tens of thousands of dollars higher than that if you need long-term care at some point, too. If you've paid into Social Security over a career lasting at least 10 years, there's a good chance you'll qualify for benefits. You can claim your benefits when you turn 62, but you'll receive a reduced payment. If you go the claim-early route, apply three months before you turn 62, so that you can receive your first check in the month after you turn 62. If you want to receive 100% of the benefit you're eligible for, you'll need to wait until you reach your full retirement age to claim. Your full retirement age depends on the year in which you were born, but for people turning 62 in 2018, it is 66 years and 4 months. Your third option is to wait until after your full retirement age to claim so that you can receive delayed retirement credits. These credits increase your payment for every month beyond your full retirement age that you delay. Overall, delaying increases your benefit by 8% for every year you hold off, until age 70. The following chart shows how much a Social Security recipient would receive if their full retirement age is 66, their benefit is $1,000, and they chose to claim benefits between age 62 and age 70. Data source: Author's calculations. While this example shows how benefits change depending on when you claim, the exact amount you'll receive in benefits is determined by a complex calculation based on your highest 35 years of earnings. You can create a login here to view your actual Social Security benefit, but the average monthly Social Security check is $1,404 in 2018, and the average check paid to recipients age 62, age 66, or age 70 last year was $1,112.30, $1,382.78, and $1,510.49, respectively. Once you know your expected Social Security income at age 62, age 66, and age 70 add to it any other sources of retirement income you'll receive, such as pensions and investment income. If you've thoroughly calculated your projected retirement expenses, then you should be able to use these numbers to determine the age at which you can reasonably expect to afford to retire. If you have ample income in retirement from other sources, it might make the most sense to embrace a claim-early and-invest strategy. As you can see in the following chart, waiting to claim benefits doesn't break even with taking benefits early until you reach your late 70s or early 80s, depending on when you claim. But if you claim benefits early and then invest that income, you could conceivably push that breakeven point back even further, depending on your annual returns. Data source: Author's calculations. It's also important to consider the impact of claiming decisions on your spouse's financial security after your death. If your widow and widower is full retirement age, they can receive 100% of your benefit amount after you pass away, but only up to what you would otherwise be receiving if you were still alive. Therefore, if you claim early and receive a smaller monthly benefit, it may not be enough money for your surviving spouse to maintain his or her lifestyle. If you're working in a high-paying job (relative to what you earned early on in your career), you might want to delay claiming your benefit anyway. If you've already accumulated a 35-year work history, additional high-earning years will replace lower-earning years in your benefit calculation, thereby giving your full retirement age benefit a boost. Furthermore, if you plan on working into your early 60s, then you should know that if your income exceeds limits, the IRS will tax some of your Social Security until you reach your full retirement age. In those cases, delaying when you claim so that you lower your income taxes might be a smart choice. Overall, when to claim your Social Security benefits is one of the most complex, and important, choices you'll face leading up to retirement, so make sure you understand the various retirement strategies available to you.

    Should You Take Social Security at 62, 66, or 70? -- The Motley Fool

The death of a loved one is always a tragedy. Unfortunately, in your time of grief, your struggles to cope with your loss may be compounded by the legal complexities of an inheritance. There are many rules when it comes to property passed to you after a death, including very specific requirements for inherited IRAs. Image source: Getty Images. If you inherit an IRA, or individual retirement account, you may have a limited time to decide what to do with it. Making a decision requires understanding IRS rules, which vary based on the type of IRA, your relationship to the deceased account holder, and the age of the account holder. You must make a timely decision because the IRS generally -- but not always -- mandates required minimum distributions (RMDs) from inherited IRAs. That means you must start withdrawing a set amount of money from the account at periodic intervals. If you do not take RMDs, you face a 50% tax penalty on the money you should have withdrawn. You could lose 50% of your money to the IRS if you don't act! This doesn't mean you should withdraw all assets from inherited IRAs. Money is taxed when taken out of a traditional IRA; if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket by the time RMDs are required, you can leave the funds in the account until you must begin withdrawals and thereby avoid paying your current higher rate on IRA assets. If you inherit a Roth IRA, leaving assets in the account as long as you can has an even bigger benefit: You can continue to allow the assets to grow tax-free. If you leave assets in the Roth IRA, you won't be taxed on gains, no matter how much the account grows. This guide explains your options when you inherit an IRA under various circumstances. If your spouse had a traditional IRA and passed away prior to age 70-1/2, you have three options. As you consider them, remember that you're always taxed on distributions from these accounts. If your spouse was over 70-1/2 at the time of their death, you may still move assets into your own IRA or take a lump sum distribution as outlined above. However, the rules differ for the other options. If you move the assets to an inherited IRA, then your distributions must be calculated based on your life expectancy or the original IRA owner's age. RMDs must start by the end of the year after death; however, if your deceased spouse didn't take his or her RMD before death, you must take the distribution in the same year the death occurred. When you inherit a Roth IRA from your spouse, you have the same basic options as with a traditional IRA, but the rules differ slightly. And as long as you follow the rules, you won't be taxed on withdrawals at all. One caveat: To benefit from tax-free distributions, a Roth IRA must have been open at least five years. If the account was open less than five years, then you could be taxed on any earnings upon distribution. When you inherit a traditional or Roth IRA from anyone who is not your spouse, you are not allowed to roll the account over into your own IRA. Lump sum distributions are allowed, or you can open an inherited IRA. Both the five-year option and life expectancy option are available to you, but you must act quickly to use the life expectancy option, because you must begin making distributions by the end of the year after the account holder's death for both Roth and traditional IRAs. It's hard to think about finances after the death of a loved one, but avoiding the tax penalties is vital to protect the inheritance you've received. Review your options carefully and talk with a tax professional if you've inherited a substantial IRA and cannot decide which option is best. ","

On pace to hit 2 billion monthly active users in 2017, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the world's largest social network by a long shot. But exactly how many users does Facebook have? And what can be learned about these users? Here's a look at the most telling statistics about Facebook's users. Image source: Getty Images. 1.86 billion: Facebook has 1.86 billion monthly active users -- far ahead of the rest of the world's social networks. The next three largest social networks, for instance, are each 700 million or more users behind Facebook. WhatsApp and Messenger have 1.2 billion monthly active users each, and YouTube has about 1 billion monthly active users as of last count (a complete list of the world's 10 largest social networks can be found here). 17%: Facebook's monthly active users continue to grow at a rapid rate. The company's 1.86 billion monthly active users achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016 is up 17% year over year. Data source: Facebook's quarterly SEC filings. Chart by author. 66%: Perhaps where Facebook's user statistics shine the most is the percentage of monthly active users that use the service every single day. This rate, often referred to Facebook's engagement rate, was 66% throughout 2016 -- up from 65% in 2015. 18%: Facebook's daily active users actually increased slightly faster than its monthly active users in 2016. Daily active users by the end of the year were 1.23 billion, up 18% year over year from 1.04 billion in 2015. 94%: Today, Facebook is almost entirely mobile driven. Of Facebook's 1.86 billion monthly active users, 94% of them -- or 1.74 billion -- are also monthly active users on mobile devices. Data source: Q4 2016 SEC filing. Chart by author. Unsurprisingly, 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 came from ads on mobile devices. 231 million: Believe it or not, the U.S. and Canada is Facebook's smallest geographic segment in terms of monthly active users. Facebook pegs monthly active users in the region at 231 million. It has 349 million in Europe, 673 million in Asia-Pacific, and 606 million in the rest of the world. 51%: Despite being its smallest segment measured by monthly active users, the U.S. and Canada together accounted for over half of Facebook's advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. Advertising revenue in the U.S. and Canada was $4.4 billion. Ad revenues in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and rest of the world were $2 billion, $1.4 billion, and $832 million, respectively. $15.98: In 2016, Facebook generated an average of $15.98 of revenue per monthly active user. This is up about 34% from its $11.96 of average revenue per user in 2015. At the rate Facebook is currently growing its user base, the company is well on its way to hitting 2 billion monthly active users in 2017. Indeed, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aiming far beyond 2 billion users. The ambitious CEO believes the company can hit 5 billion users by 2030. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",03302017,Fool,03232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you earn income from self-employment -- such as from a small business you own, consulting you do, or freelance work -- it may be subject to self-employment tax. Self-employment tax consists of two parts -- Social Security and Medicare taxes. Here's how your self-employment tax will be determined in 2017, as well as a calculator that can simplify the process for you. When you work for an employer, taxes for Social Security and Medicare are typically withheld from your paychecks. In addition to this, your employer matches the amount of tax you pay to both programs. Image source: Getty Images. Self-employed individuals don't have Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld from their earnings, nor is there an employer making these payments on their behalf. Therefore, both the employer and employee portions of the Social Security and Medicare taxes are the responsibility of the self-employed individual, and are collectively known as the self-employment tax. In general, you are required to pay self-employment tax if your net self-employment earnings were $400 or more for the year. As I mentioned, there are two components to the self-employment tax -- Social Security and Medicare. For the 2017 tax year, Social Security tax is assessed at a rate of 6.2% for the employer and employee. Since self-employed individuals are considered to be both the employer and the employee, the Social Security tax rate for self-employed individuals is 12.4%. However, Social Security tax is only assessed on the first $127,200 of earned income. The Medicare tax rate is 1.45% each for employers and employees, so self-employed individuals pay a Medicare tax rate of 2.9%. Unlike Social Security tax, there is no income cap for Medicare tax. The 2.9% rate applies to all of your earned income, no matter how high it is. In addition, high-income individuals pay an additional Medicare tax, at a rate of 0.9% for any income above $200,000 (single filers) or $250,000 (married filing jointly). So, the self-employment tax structure for 2017 is: To calculate your net self-employment income -- that is, the amount of your self-employment income used to calculate your self-employment tax, simply multiply your total self-employment income by 92.35%, or 0.9235. For example, let's say that you earn a profit of $130,000 from self-employment in 2017, and you had no other income. Multiplying this amount by 92.35% gives net self-employment income of $120,055. Since this is less than the Social Security taxable maximum, the 15.3% rate would apply to the entire amount, and you would owe $18,368 in self-employment tax. Half of this amount, or $9,184 (the employer's portion) is deductible on your tax return. The calculation for self-employment tax can be a little complicated. To make your life a little easier, here's a calculator that can do the math for you.  * Calculator is for estimation purposes only, and is not financial planning or advice. As with any tool, it is only as accurate as the assumptions it makes and the data it has, and should not be relied on as a substitute for a financial advisor or a tax professional. You'll notice that there's a place in the calculator for any income you get from an employer. This is because while you'll pay Medicare tax on every dime of earned income, the Social Security wage limit applies to all of your income, not separately to self-employment income. In other words, let's say that you have a full-time job with an employer, and that you earn a salary of $100,000. On the side, you run a consulting business and earn a net income of $50,000. Since your employer has already withheld Social Security tax on your $100,000 salary, you'll only need to pay Social Security tax on the first $27,200 of self-employment income. ","

Royal Dutch Shell plc (NYSE:RDS-A) (NYSE:RDS-B) has an enticing 6.2% yield, more than enough to lure in dividend investors. There are some very good things going on at the oil and natural gas giant, too. But before you buy, you have to step back and look at the big picture. If you don't, you could end up owning something you didn't expect. Here are three terrible reasons to buy Royal Dutch Shell. OK, let's be honest, the big yield is a great reason to buy Shell. But not without putting it into context. For example, Shell hasn't increased its dividend in three years. In fact, in an effort to protect cash flow, the company is offering a scrip dividend, which pays shareholders in stock so it doesn't have to pay in cash. Image source: Getty Images. This relates back to the steep decline in oil prices in mid-2014, but the roughly $50 billion acquisition of BG Group in 2016 is another important factor. That move increased the company's long-term debt by more than 50% between year-end 2015 and year-end 2016. Shell is now planning on selling $30 billion worth of assets to get its balance sheet back in order. In other words, Shell has a big yield, but there are risks you have to understand before you jump aboard. I believe it will be able to hold the line on the dividend, but until the balance sheet is in better shape, dividend increases, at least material ones, are probably on hold. Another thing you have to understand about Shell is that it's not your typical oil major... at least not after the BG acquisition. I'm not going to suggest that oil isn't important to Shell; it's still a major part of the business and an important growth engine for the company. But BG was a natural gas-focused company and a big reason Shell bought it was to make a strategic shift toward that fuel. And, to be honest, Shell was already among the largest players in the natural gas space, notably including liquified natural gas (which is how the fuel is transported when pipelines aren't an option). The BG acquisition made Shell an even bigger player in natural gas.  Image source: Royal Dutch Shell plc. This is a long-term shift toward a fuel that is expected to foster the transition from carbon fuels to clean power, like solar and wind. Strategically, it's a solid decision and helps to underpin the company's growth plans, but you can't buy Shell thinking that it's just an oil company. Because it's increasingly looking like a natural gas company, too. Despite a long and successful operating history, Shell is a commodity company. That said, oil prices have bounced back from their early 2016 lows, which may lead some investors to call an all-clear. After all, if the pickup in drilling in the United States is any indication, things are looking up for energy companies. Some perspective is needed. Brent Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts. Indeed, while oil prices have come off their lows, they remain far below the highs reached in 2014. And natural gas continues to trade at a relatively low price, historically speaking. That means there's not going to be a return to the salad days anytime soon. And the U.S. oil and gas activity could actually be part of the problem, as production here is flexible enough to ramp up and down quickly. Which is why U.S. onshore activity is expected to restrain energy prices. A new normal with lower energy prices is more likely than a steady rise at this point, limiting upside in Shell's earnings. There are a lot of good reasons to like Shell, including its push toward natural gas and debt repayment efforts. However, you have to understand the impact of these moves, as well as the bigger picture for the energy industry, where $100-per-barrel oil prices appear to be a thing of the past for now. As long as you have the bigger picture in focus, Shell is a solid option for dividend investors. ","
      
    3 Terrible Reasons to Buy Royal Dutch Shell plc and Its Fat Dividend Yield -- The Motley Fool

To say it's been a bad past two years for Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) stock would be an understatement. After topping at an all-time, split-adjusted high of $52.92 in late September 2015, Under Armour shares have since suffered a 63.2% decline. Worse yet, this sell-off has erased effectively all the outperformance against the S&P 500 that Under Armour shares had accrued over the past five years. UAA data by YCharts However, one investor's trash can be another's treasure in the stock market. Under Armour remains a strong bet for continued growth over the long term. Image source: Under Armour The drag on UA stock is the perception that it's a busted growth story, a company whose long history of prodigious growth was matched or exceeded by the equally prodigious valuation of its stock. The company's streak of growing sales at 20% or greater ended abruptly in the most recent holiday quarter, when sales managed to grow only 12%. The company blamed a weak overall quarter for U.S. retail sales, foreign currency headwinds, and inventory issues stemming from bankruptcies at larger franchises such as Sports Authority. The news of slower sales growth alone prompted Under Armour shares to tank more than 20% in a single session. Worse still, Under Armour also reduced its stated sales and profit targets; it hoped to achieve sales of $7.5 billion and net income of $800 million in 2018. However, while many investors have fled as the company transitions into its next phase of growth, Under Armour stock looks like an interesting contrarian play for long-term investors today. Like most great growth stocks, Under Armour shares have never been cheap. However, Under Armour shares today are the cheapest they've been since 2013 and toward the lower end of their valuation range in Under Armour's time as a public company. UAA PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts With Under Armour shares now less than twice as expensive as the market averages, the stock seems to be approaching the point of being a great company at a fair price for investors willing to hold its shares for the long term. Right now, the market is mostly focusing on what's recently gone wrong at Under Armour, rather than on the many positives that should continue to drive the company forward for years to come. Though other factors contributed, the primary catalyst behind Under Armour's sell-off was its reduced 2017 guidance. True, sharply reducing its revenue growth guidance suggests the company is careening toward maturity, but does the evidence support this conclusion? The company generates 83% of its sales from the U.S., compared twith48% for Nike. Even as it leans more heavily on direct-to-consumer sales amid the ongoing upheaval in the retail market, this presents a tremendous growth opportunity for Under Armour. Moreover, the company continues to push into digital health initiatives that should increase in popularity in the years to come, especially as wearable tech improves. Though it guided for 12% sales growth this year, analysts project Under Armour revenue growth to accelerate to 15% next year. Over the long term, the sell-side community projects Under Armour will grow its earnings per share by 17% annually over the next five years. The company continues to innovate, sign big-name endorsements, and establish its brand in the eyes of consumers. So even though its valuation remains rich after its recent sell-off, Under Armour still strikes me as a solid long-term bet to match sportswear powers Adidas and Nike atop this massive global market.

Therese Poletti,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 30, 2017 7:14 a.m. ET Opinion: While YouTube revenue Alphabet is losing likely 1% or less of total, advertisers could also target overall Google ad spend By Many Wall Street analysts are trying to play down the continuing advertising controversy at Google’s YouTube, but Alphabet Inc. investors are likely jittery — and should be. Last week, Google updated its ad policies and expanded safeguards for advertisers after some pulled advertising from YouTube because the video streaming site was displaying ads next to inappropriate content that espoused hate or even terrorism. Google said in a blog post that it has put in place more controls for advertisers, and it is also taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. Also:  YouTube on defensive after new restrictions on some LGBTQ content The potential impact of the increased scrutiny of ads and the backlash on YouTube, which is estimated to be about 15% to 20% of Alphabet’s

Google does not break out YouTube from Google’s other businesses, even though YouTube’s revenue is believed to rival that of Netflix Inc.

Many analysts were quick to point out, though, that YouTube’s profit performance is a drop in the bucket as compared with that of the company, “perhaps no more than a few percent of total earnings,” Anmuth wrote Monday. The very large, name-brand advertisers that have promised to drop YouTube ads could also be trying to negotiate better rates “during a time when advertisers and agencies are looking for negotiating leverage against an increasingly duopolistic digital ad community” dominated by Google and Facebook Inc.

                                   . The Financial Times reported that advertisers are asking for discounts in pricing as a result. The bigger fear for investors is that an advertiser backlash could spread from YouTube to Google’s overall search business, or cast a pall over YouTube’s planned “skinny bundle” service. Since the story broke, Alphabet shares have fallen nearly 4%. Google’s efforts to handle the situation are getting mixed reviews from investors who see cause for concern. “Their public statements do not suggest to us that the company appreciates the degree to which advertisers are concerned and the continuing announcements of advertisers suspending their activity on Google properties reinforces our view,” Pivotal analyst Wieser wrote. Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Equities Research, predicted that Google will need to give out ad credits to lure back advertisers, which would also impact YouTube revenue. Don’t miss: This is what happens on the internet in just one minute The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the YouTube service was still rife with examples of ads running alongside offensive videos. Because the ads are automated, meaning they are placed using algorithms without human intervention, the advertisers also appear to need to be more involved in placing the ads themselves. Google said it is “changing the default settings for ads so that they show on content that meets a higher level of brand safety and exchanges potentially objectionable content.” Google has managed to handle such controversies in the past, and, alongside Facebook

Investors who want to feel secure in that knowledge certainly have reason. “Don’t panic yet,” wrote Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian, in a note to clients on Monday. Panic is unnecessary, but investors will want to carry this knowledge with them into the next few Alphabet earnings reports. While Google will likely continue to mask YouTube’s true performance from its investors, any slippage in the growth rate of advertising revenue should be cause for alarm.

Frankly, I am shocked that Google is still having that problem.

Within weeks Google had software that was able to root out all that copyrighted content. Here we are 12 years later and Google’s entire business model and cash flow rests on ads and ad networks, and this same issue apparently has not been solved. They are still having issues with ads being shown on places they shouldn’t be. Just last week, I trimmed my long-held Alphabet. Alphabet could catch a doghouse effect for a while. You know, the pendulum swings back and forth, and right now it’s looking like it could be swinging against Google. What the market is willing to pay for Google’s earnings is bigger than what it will for Apple’s

But I continue to hold a core position, as I have since its IPO, because in the grand scheme of things, Google is very much about Android and the internet of things. Google browsers, self-driving cars, other ventures and search ads are all part of it too, of course. The biggest threat to Google isn’t Apple. On the ad and search side and the Android side, the biggest threat is Amazon

In coming years, we’ll all be talking to our smartphones and asking questions rather than typing in queries. Likewise, I expect Amazon to try another shot at the smartphone game, using an Android operating system, but Amazon will have built the smartphone from the ground up to be Alexa-centric. The Amazon world has become its own ecosystem from Alexa, to Amazon.com to the Amazon App. The consumer side of Amazon is stealing a playbook from the Apple ecosystem concept. The Amazon ecosystem is in the very early stages. The upshot is that I think you want to continue to own both Google and Amazon for the long term. But I think there’s more upside potential in Amazon. In fact, I think Amazon could be another dark horse that ends up being the first trillion-dollar company. (It’s now worth $403 billion.) I continue to hold both Amazon and Google in the Revolution Investing Model Portfolio and in my personal portfolio.

Cody Willard,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Apple will lose its lead over Android  in terms of revenue generated by mobile apps this year, according to a new report from App Annie,  out today. However, the firm’s estimate is based on including third-party Android app stores in its forecast, not just Google Play. When the Apple App Store is pitted against Google Play alone, Apple is expected to maintain its lead through 2021, the report says. App Annie is predicting worldwide mobile app downloads to surpass 352 billion in 2021, with gross consumer spend across all the app stores to surpass $139 billion. The iOS App Store will account for a large chunk of that spend, as it’s expected to generate over $60 billion in 2021. Google Play will generate $42 billion, and third-party stores, $36 billion. Those third-party stores – which include the Android app marketplaces offers by Tencent, Baidu, Xiaomi, Huawei, and others – accounted for $10 billion in revenue last year, and will grow to $20 billion in 2017, the report estimates.  The market for Android apps is growing thanks in large part to mobile adoption in China as well as other emerging markets, particularly Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia. This will impact app downloads, too. Android downloads from both Google Play and elsewhere will at an annualized rate of 23 percent to 299.9 billion by 2012. App downloads are more evenly distributed across countries around the world, but revenue is another matter, App Annie also found. According to its data, the top five countries by downloads – China, India, U.S., Brazil, and Indonesia – accounted for 54 percent of the downloads last year, and this won’t change much through 2021.  However, the top countries by revenue – China, U.S., Japan, South Korea, and U.K. – accounted for 75 percent of app store revenue in 2016. This is expected to grow to 85 percent by 2021. The firm chalked up this shift to increased spending on games and subscriptions from existing smartphone users in mature markets like the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, but especially the maturing market that is China. China, because of its vast population and growing middle class, still plays a key role when it comes to app store revenues, but its market is maturing, the report notes. The majority of Chinese app users are expected to settle into patterns of habitual use by 2021, which will allow revenue growth to be sustained even though downloads may slow. Downloads in China will grow at an annualized rate of 19 percent from 2016 to 2021, while consumer spend will grow 24 percent to $56.5 billion. In larger cities, much of the smartphone market in China is already saturated, meaning a lot of growth will come from other regions across the country. India, on the other hand, is still in the early stages of the app market maturity cycle, and will see significant download and revenue growth through 2021. Downloads will grow 28 percent to nearly 23 billion by 2021, and app store spend will grow an annualized rate of 75 percent to $2.1 billion. Despite India’s growth, consumer spend will be lower in the region because of a variety of factors, including more limited purchasing power and a culture that focuses more on saving versus spending on games and entertainment, App Annie says. It suggests that app developers targeting India consider other revenue models, like advertising. ",App Annie: Android to top iOS in app store revenue this year – TechCrunch

See also: New Samsung Galaxy S8 expands screen, dock turns smartphone into PC Apple will still have the most dominant single app store, however.

                                   devices like the Kindle tablet run on a modified version of Android, and Amazon has its own app store for those devices. App Annie projects that revenues for Google Play and third-party Android offerings will be roughly similar, with $21 billion in Google Play revenues and $20 billion for other offerings. Danielle Levitas, senior vice president of research for App Annie, pointed out that Android should be expected to outpace Apple, since Android devices outnumber iOS devices by about a 5-to-1 ratio worldwide. “So there’s much room for movement and while this shift might happen in 2017, ultimately, we forecast the App Store remaining the most lucrative store in the next five years,” Levitas said in an email. The splintered nature of the Android app ecosystem and monolithic approach for Apple mirror the larger smartphone market, where Android phones and tablets outsell iPhones and iPads, but Apple reaps greater rewards from its sales. According to Gartner Inc., Android had more than 80% of the smartphone market share in 2016 while iOS was at 17.7%, yet Apple routinely takes a majority of global profits in selling its devices. Don’t miss: Why Alphabet could be more valuable than Apple Apple takes in much more revenue per user and per app downloaded, according to App Annie, which reported that Apple users downloaded 29 billion apps in 2016 against 118 billion total Android app downloads. That split is expected to grow this year, when the report projects 30 billion downloads from Apple’s App Store and 165 billion combined Android app downloads, and continue into the future. In 2021, App Annie projects that Apple will have 42 billion app downloads while Android will have 308 billion combined. While Android is projected to still have the revenue lead in 2021, the split is nowhere near as large as in downloads, with Android projected to collect $78 billion to Apple’s $60 billion. “iOS will remain the most lucrative app store through 2021, generating $60.3 billion, thanks to growing revenue per device from Apple’s comparatively affluent customer base,” the report states. “However, the combination of Google Play and third-party Android is forecast to exceed iOS in 2017 as the sharp growth in installed base of Android devices makes up for lower user purchasing power.” Apple has highlighted its software and services growth in the past year, as iPhone sales have struggled to increase. While App Store revenue is not disclosed individually, executives said in a January conference call that the App Store had its strongest month ever in December, with sales topping $3 billion, and revenue grew 43% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Google also wants to make Google Play a bigger part of its offerings, bringing the app store to its Chromebook line of low-price laptops as well as its virtual-reality platform, Daydream. Apple stock has been hot of late, and hit another record closing high Wednesday after establishing its fifth record close of the month Tuesday. Apple shares have gained about 24% in the past three months and 34% in the past year, while Google’s class A shares have increased 5.8% and 10.9% in those periods.

Games accounted for slightly less than 40% of total downloads across platforms, but more than 81% of revenue, which does not include advertising revenue that gaming companies collect outside the app ecosystem.

With the new phones, Samsung has pushed the screen to both sides of the device and to the bottom of the device, with the home button becoming part of what executives called the Infinity Display. The Galaxy S8 “will fundamentally change the way you use your phone by giving you more screen,” Justin Denison, Samsung Electronics America’s vice president of product strategy, said at a live event in New York. The extension of the screen is what counts as innovation in the smartphone industry, which has seen the devices become ubiquitous and commoditized with new iterations that push forward slightly in specific areas.

With all of the major electronics manufacturers offering similar features like these voice assistants, differentiation is slowly moving to peripheral devices that connect to the smartphone, such as Apple’s smartwatch. Samsung’s major new innovation in that area is Dex, which turns the smartphone into the equivalent of a desktop computer: The dock can be connected to peripherals like a monitor, keyboard and mouse and then use the smartphone to create a PC-like environment. Samsung also has its own smartwatch and the Gear VR headset, a device powered by Facebook Inc.’s Oculus VR that fits a Galaxy phone and turns it into a portal to virtual worlds provided by Samsung and third-party developers. Samsung showed off a new controller for its updated Gear VR at Wednesday’s event, as it did at Mobile World Congress earlier this year, and detailed new content for the platform. Samsung also announced an updated Gear 360 virtual-reality camera, that includes the ability to live-stream in 360 degrees, and gave attendees at the event the Gear 360 to try out. Samsung could use a hit after a year made difficult by a smartphone launch, as a manufacturing issue in the Galaxy Note 7 caused fiery explosions in the batteries in some of the devices and led to a global recall. Despite that, Samsung managed to outpace Apple in overall smartphone sales in 2016, with Gartner reporting Samsung’s 2016 market share at 20.5% to 14.4% for the iPhone. Still, Samsung shares have gained more than 50% in the past year and nearly 13% in the past three months. That performance easily outpaces the S&P 500 index, which has gained 14.8% and 4.9% in those periods. The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, with the Plus denoting a larger form factor at 6.2” to 5.4” for the regular S8, will be available starting April 21. Preorders begin Thursday, and Samsung is offering a free Gear VR headset and controller with preorders. Samsung did not announce pricing, which could vary for consumers purchasing at different wireless carriers; the base price is $720 at Verizon and $750 at AT&T, for example. The smartphone, available in five different colors, will be packaged with AKG earbuds from Harman International Industries Inc., which cost $99 separately. They will fit into the standard headphone plug on the device, which Apple ditched in its latest iPhone. Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox.

The Justice Dept. said DirecTV was “the ringleader in a series of unlawful information exchanges” with its rivals Cox Communications Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and AT&T, before the telecommunication giant’s purchase of the satellite company. The distributors were aligned against Spectrum SportsNet LA because of the high cost for the service. Time Warner Cable, which has since been acquired by Charter Communications, paid the Dodgers for the rights to distribute the channel for 25 years in a deal Major League Baseball and the team valued at $8.35 billion. In turn, Time Warner Cable sought a premium from other distributors to carry the channel. “Today’s settlement promotes competition among pay-television providers and prevents AT&T and DirecTV from engaging in illegal conduct that thwarts the competitive process,” said Brent Snyder, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s antitrust division.

Sally French,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 24, 2017 7:04 p.m. ET Only one school beats Stanford on this list (and it isn’t Harvard) By Want to be the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates... minus the whole dropping out of school thing? Then you might want to consider enrolling in one of these M.B.A. programs. Harvard University, where Zuckerberg and Gates both studied, tied for first place with the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business for the best business schools of 2018, according to a ranking by the U.S. News & World Report. But the best business schools for accountants might not be the best business school for the next startup founder. That’s why U.S. News also ranks schools for specialty professions, including accounting, finance and entrepreneurship. For the career-specific rankings, U.S. News asked business school deans and directors of accredited M.B.A. programs to nominate up to 10 programs for excellence in each area. The schools were then ranked based on how many votes they received. Here are the top 10 business schools for entrepreneurs: 10. University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business USC’s Marshall School of Business requires all full-time, first-year students to enroll in the Pacific Rim International Management Education program, which examines the business environment and management styles in Pacific Rim and Latin American countries in class and during a 10-day trip abroad. Many attribute USC’s strong “Trojan Family” alumni network as a reason for graduates’ successful job searches. The M.B.A. program also ranked No. 8 in U.S. News & World Report’s accounting specialty ranking.

Chris Fultz,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 30, 2017 11:48 a.m. ET An heir’s guide to furniture, china, glassware, art and more By This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org. Next Avenue recently published a popular, if provocative, post called “Sorry, Nobody Wants Your Parents’ Stuff.” As the founders and co-owners of Nova Liquidation, a company that helps people with their parents’ stuff (and their own), we’d like to offer you help in understanding whether the stuff has value and, if so, how much, if you were to liquidate it. (For an example how two somewhat similar items could have very different values, see the photos below.) Here are a few simple tricks the pros use: When it comes to furniture value, you’ve probably heard that Midcentury Modern (furniture makers such as Eames and Knoll) is hot now. But there are still buyers for the best of the best traditional makers as well. Sadly, however, the value of handmade antiques has been dropping since Nancy Reagan was in the White House. In the end, it’s all supply and demand, and in many cases you can now easily spend more on 10 dining chairs from Restoration Hardware than for 10 made in the 1820s. If you don’t have pieces from good makers or tremendous age, your stuff probably falls into the “brown furniture” category — think all the stuff made after WWII to furnish the starter homes of our GIs and their families. That stuff was mass-produced quickly and has very little value today other than for crafts or reuse boutiques. Most of the best furniture from the 20th century made for the mass market was either signed or labeled in some way. Look in the top left drawer or left cabinet door. For chairs and tables, look under them. If the piece is good, it will have a label or a name clearly stamped. Some of the best makers are Baker, Kittinger, Henkel Harris, Widdicomb, Kindle, Century and Henredon. If your pieces are earlier than 20th century, look for solid wood construction and dovetails. Another clue is see how the bottom of the drawers are joined to the sides. If the edges appear to be cut down into wedges (a term called chamfering) in order to fit into the grooves of the side rails, you’ve got an old piece — cabinet makers and sawmills were unable to get wood any thinner than that for secure construction. It took the advent of pressed woods to reach that level of strength and thinness. If you really want to be an expert, check if there are circular cut marks on the backsides or secondary woods on the pieces. If so, you can assume they were cut at a mill after the Industrial Revolution. If the boards look wavy, they were hand-planned, and that’s good. If you’re hoping to cash in on the stack of silver chafing dishes, trays, flatware and candlesticks your mother labored to keep clean for 50 years, don’t buy those tickets to Hawaii just yet. Remember: after WWII, every homemaker wanted to entertain in style, but not every household could afford solid silver accessories. The bulk of what was produced was silver plate, which is just a micro-thin layer of silver applied to either copper or brass. Look at the bottom of each piece. If it doesn’t say sterling, it is not silver. The best sterling makers are Tiffany, Georg Jensen, Puiforcat and Buccellati. The value of makers like Gorham, Towle, Kirk, Stieff and Reed and Barton depends totally on the pattern; if it’s monogrammed, the value is even less. If your pieces are English or European, look for a stamp on the bottom that looks like a lion or the numbers 925, 900 or 800 — those are percentage numbers for the quantity of silver used by European makers. Many silver pieces were stamped with elaborate alphabets or symbols to confuse or excite dinner guests. Marks like EPNS, International Silver, IS, Sheffield Silver, Triple or Quadruple plate or EP are all smoke and mirrors that refer to some kind of silver plating and shouldn’t be given much attention — only some truly old and gorgeous English silver pieces have value in the plate market. If you are lucky enough to have a set of sterling silver sitting around, don’t be upset when a liquidator or an estate agent puts it on a scale to calculate its scrap value. In the end, only the most desirable patterns and makers have value over scrap today, and often even that isn’t much after you pay all the commissions to sell it. Generally, since the crash of 2008, most sterling silver flatware sets have become uncollectable. Generally, the value of coins lies in their silver content. Yes, there are exceptions for extremely rare coins, but unless your parents made special notes or treated their coins with obsessive devotion, you’re probably not looking at anything more than scrap. Coins with the most reliable resale value are ones that have been rated by one of the two U.S. rating agencies: the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) and the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC). They will be encased in permanent hard plastic sleeves that clearly state their name and level of rating (i.e. quality). Their value is easy to estimate by looking for comparable auction results. For most other American coins, just look for the date 1964. That was generally the cutoff date for the use of silver in American quarters, dimes and half dollars (nickels only had silver during WWII — weird right?). There are some exceptions when it comes to Kennedy half-dollars that were made with silver up to 1969. Art is very personal. Most of it was purchased because someone felt compelled to make it or someone felt compelled to buy it, and so it goes. Reselling it is a totally different reality. Determining the value of your family’s artworks can be very simple if you strip the exercise of all emotion. Do not assume that art your parents purchased from local painters or sculptors is worth more than decoration these days. If you can’t find a signature, try a black light in a dark room to illuminate it or look at the back for a note from a gallery or framer. Several websites record and report the sale price of every work of art at auction over the past 10+ years by artist name — for instance, Artprice.com, Findartinfo.com and Askart.com. These are wonderful places to start, but if you don’t know the artist, don’t expect a premium over decorative value. Again, there are exceptions, but that’s the general rule. We don’t know why this is almost always the hardest category for people to come to terms with, but we’ve often seen families fight between themselves or with estate agents over the value of rugs. Maybe it’s because 99.99% of the population pays retail for them and rugs are expensive. The reality, however, is that rugs are like anything else you buy to fit your taste and then try to resell. Do you really think you’ll get $10,000 for your worn Vera Wang wedding dress? No, and that goes for your rugs, too. Yes, some rugs still sell for many thousands of dollars, but those are always handmade versions that predate machine influence and chemical dyes. So unless you’ve got truly antique, vegetable-dyed rugs with an unbelievably dense knot count, you will be lucky to get 10% of the purchase price. To determine if you’ve got a real, handmade rug, turn over the corner and look at how the rows of knots are lined up. If they look very even with no variation of direction, then it’s probably machine-made. Also, if there is a label on the corner that looks like a giant sticker, it’s likely machine-made. Handmade rugs, by contrast, have very uneven rows of knots with irregular stitching on the corners used to finish the rug by hand. The knots will appear different in size and spacing. Here’s a sad fact: 15 years ago ,the auction price for a complete Reed & Barton Francis I Sterling Tea and Coffee set was no less than $30,000. Today, you can find that same set for about $10,000, and that’s before an auction house commission. Valuing china is pretty easy because most pieces lying around have a name or mark on the bottom. That’s why Google

                                   or Replacements.com, you need to ask yourself: “What did they pay for it and how much profit margin do they need to stay in business?” If a dinner plate is listed at $120, the markup is likely four times the original purchase price. As with furniture, there is a long list of manufacturers that still have a following in the resale market. The best porcelain was made by companies such as Meissen, Sevres, Minton, Wedgwood, Royal Copenhagen, Herend, Crown Derby, Worcester and Doulton. Within those makers are ranges of desirability and therefore value. If you can’t find a name and all you see are a few slashes or symbols, you probably have a finer, hand-piece. For example, the mark for Meissen is crossed swords and the mark for Sevres is a pair of interlaced L’s. One more important clue is the absence of the words “Made in…” Such identification wasn’t required until the first decade of the 20th century. Once you’ve done some research, it’s easy to find comparable values on eBay, but it is extremely important to look at completed sales there: the “green” numbers. Completed prices are what the item actually sold for, not what someone is asking for, which is often a retail price or higher. Remember, also that eBay takes, on average, 13% of the sales price as a commission. Values in this category have taken the greatest plunge since the 1980s, in our opinion. Current tastes have almost wiped out interest in most categories of decorative glass leaving only the very best makers at the top. Manufacturers like Tiffany, Durand, Steuben, Lalique, Saint-Louis and Baccarat still have a following. But the market for the most beautiful table and stemware continues to dwindle to the point where you can now easily find most patterns of Waterford selling for $20 per stem at auction. To figure out the maker of your glassware, turn the piece over and look at the center or the rim. Tilt the piece in sunlight to find an acid-etched mark. If it’s good glass, you’ll find it. The most important advice we can give, and consequently the most difficult to digest, is to absolutely forget what the purchaser paid and to instead look at these possessions from the perspective of a third party — someone who knows nothing about your history or shares one shred of your taste. Once you remove the expectations of financial reimbursement and sentiment, it will be far easier to process the estate in an orderly and stress-free manner. Essentially you need to think like an estate liquidator: Cheers! Roger Schrenk and Chris Fultz are co-founders and owners of Nova Liquidation.

Maria Armental,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 27, 2017 8:29 p.m. ET By Casual-restaurant chain Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen will soon share ownership with the likes of Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and the Capital Grille. Darden Restaurants Inc. on Monday struck a $780 million cash deal to buy the 165-restaurant Texas chain from stockholders including private-equity firms L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. The combination comes at a difficult time for casual-dining restaurants, once a fast-growing sector, as an oversupply of eateries and increased competition have dinged the industry. In October, Darden Chief Executive Eugene Lee told investors that consumers were going elsewhere with their dollars. ""Restaurants are competing against a lot of those other choices, not just restaurants,"" he said at the time. In Cheddar's, Darden gets a chain with a traditional American menu ranging from chicken tenders and cheese fries to seafood and chicken pot pie. Darden, spun off from General Mills in 1995, has more than 1,500 restaurants, with Olive Garden accounting for the bulk of locations -- and sales. In 2014, Darden sold Red Lobster, once its No. 2 chain, to private-equity firm Golden Gate Capital to focus on Olive Garden, introducing cheaper items and smaller plates at the casual Italian chain. Darden said the Cheddar's deal, expected to close this quarter, is expected to boost its per-share profit by about 12 cents for fiscal 2018, excluding certain expenses. Darden also reported third-quarter earnings Monday, saying comparable sales at Olive Garden rose 1.4%, well above the 0.4% analysts surveyed by Consensus Metrix had projected. That helped Darden post a 0.9% comparable-sales increase for the quarter, three times what analysts had expected. Its overall profit surged to $165.6 million from $105.8 million a year earlier as sales rose 1.7% to $1.88 billion. Earnings topped expectations, sending shares up 3.6% in after-hours trading to $78.30.

William Watts,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 29, 2017 3:14 p.m. ET Shipping index has seen its reputation as an indicator wax and wane By Is it time to believe in the Baltic Dry Index again? Once viewed as among the most reliable guides to near-term global economic growth, it lost some appeal in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The index, which tracks the cost of moving raw materials such as grain, iron ore and coal by ship, is on a tear. The index rose 4% Wednesday to trade at its highest level in more than two years. It’s surged more than 55% in March, according to FactSet, leaving it with a nearly 39% rise in the year to date. Analysts have noted the index tends to see a seasonal boost following the Lunar New Year. But economists at Panjiva Research argued that those effects had already dissipated by mid-February. ”The move in rates may reflect, therefore, a more fundamentally positive view” of the market, Panjiva said in a report earlier this month. As for the equity market, the index tends to lead year-over-year performance of the MSCI World Stock Index—a global equity benchmark that tracks large- and midcap stock performance across 23 developed-market countries—by around two months, said Jeff deGraaf, chairman and head technical analyst at Renaissance Macro, in a Tuesday note that included the chart below: The World Index is tracked by the iShares MSCI World ETF

But the collapse of the world economy exposed a glut of cargo ships. The shipping industry’s own particular supply woes rendered the index a less reliable guide to global economic activity. (This 2016 New Yorker article offers an excellent history of the index and its fluctuating reputation). The Baltic index’s surge comes as some analysts and investors are taking a more upbeat view on the long beaten-down shipping industry. Shares of shipping companies jumped Tuesday after Morgan Stanley analyst Fotis Giannakoulis upped his outlook for several stocks and hiked price targets on expectations the dry bulk market has bottomed. See:  Shipping stocks rocket after analyst calls the bottom Giannakoulis, in his note, highlighted strengthening freight rates, which he forecast to peak by the end of 2018. The analyst and others have noted that the Baltic index’s strength has been driven in large part by rising rates for Capesize ships—the largest in terms of size—fueled by Chinese demand for iron ore. If demand for other vessel sizes starts to pick up, the index might see its appeal continue to rise. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s  Google said on Tuesday it would roll out a mobile YouTube application designed for India, boosting the search company’s presence in a burgeoning market with spotty Internet access. Since the fall, Google has been conducting extensive tests in India of YouTube Go, which allows users to save videos to watch offline and monitor their data use. A beta version of the app has been released in the Google Play Store in India, and will be released in other emerging markets later, company executives said in an interview. Analysts have been forecasting a surge in video consumption in India since Reliance Jio, the telecom unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, upended the industry last year with cheap data plans that have prodded rivals to lower prices. Silicon Valley has long regarded India, with its population of 1.3 billion people and poor connectivity, as a prime place to test products for emerging markets. YouTube executives said they sought to build a product for Indian users from the ground up rather than releasing a slimmed-down version of their primary app. “As we talked to people in the market, they didn’t want something that felt like a stripped down version of YouTube – they wanted the full experience,” said John Harding, vice president of engineering at YouTube. Due to the frustration of trying to load video at slow Internet speeds, the YouTube team had contemplated showing users a series of images from a video with the audio, like a slideshow. But Indian consumers reacted poorly to the feature. The final design helps users discover videos that trending in their region while minimizing data usage. Users can preview videos before watching to ensure that is what they want. While Reliance Jio’s entry has boosted video consumption in India, analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Technology Market Research questioned whether YouTube Go would remain popular as cheap data plans become more prevalent. “The only future I see for YouTube Go is for feature phones or basic phones,” he wrote in an email. But with 180 million mobile users in India and mobile watch time climbing 400 percent year over year, YouTube has strong momentum in India, Jay Akkad, a product lead at YouTube, said. ","

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"The video streaming service also said once a video channel crosses the threshold, it would review the content to see if it qualifies for the placement of ads. (bit.ly/2o7vqI2) “By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators,” Ariel Bardin, YouTube’s vice president of product management, said in a blog post. YouTube has come under intense scrutiny for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video streaming service. The company vowed an overhaul of its practices last month, saying it has started an extensive review of its advertising policies. While brands have demanded greater control over the videos where their ads appear, the step taken by YouTube this week is likely too small to allay those concerns, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “Most of these (extremist) videos are going to get more viewers than that anyway,” Dawson said of the 10,000-view threshold set by YouTube. “They’re popular among the particular audience that they are targeting.” YouTube also said on Thursday that in a few weeks it would add a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program, which lets creators monetize content on YouTube in many ways, including advertisements, paid subscriptions and merchandise. Any revenue earned on channels with under 10,000 views up until Thursday will not be impacted, YouTube said. As it grapples with the advertiser revolt, YouTube must walk a fine line between giving advertisers more control and alienating the creators who drive the site’s popularity, analysts say. While some fear small creators could be hurt by restrictions, the 10,000-view threshold is so low that it will not hamper any people who make a living from their channels, said Jonathan Katz, an entertainment lawyer who represents YouTube artists. Creators understand that YouTube must protect its image to retain the ad dollars they depend on, he said. “As frustrated as (creators) might be with the YouTube ecosystem at times, they understand that their fates are tied,” he said.

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"RAMALLAH, West Bank/TEL AVIV (Reuters) - The backstreets of Ramallah are a long way from Silicon Valley, but a niche venture capital fund is trying to narrow the gap with a focus on early-stage Palestinian tech startups. With backing from Cisco, the Google Foundation, the European Investment Fund and others, Sadara Ventures is making gradual inroads in the West Bank, the Palestinian territory long occupied by Israel, financing six companies so far. Launched in 2011 by Saed Nashef, a Palestinian-American who was a software engineer at Microsoft before setting up his own companies, and Yadin Kaufmann, an Israeli-American who helped pioneer venture capital in Israel, Sadara raised $30 million for its first fund and plans to invest it over 10 years. In a sign of confidence, a second fund is being considered. “We’re likely to raise another fund in the months ahead that would be larger than the existing one,” said Kaufmann, adding that beyond the six firms backed so far, he and Nashef were looking at one or two others for the existing fund. The biggest success at this stage is Freightos, an online marketplace for international shipping, which on March 29 raised a further $25 million from investors, including GE Ventures, and has seen orders double in the last quarter. Freightos has offices in Jerusalem and Ramallah, where chief technology officer Fareed Qaddoura, previously a programing manager at Amazon, oversees around 70 R&D staff. Other firms in Sadara’s portfolio include Yamsafer, an online travel service focused on Arab-world clients, SoukTel, which provides digital communications to aid agencies and others working in hostile or hard-to-reach environments, and an Arabic-language medical consultancy called WebTeb. For Nashef, who lives in Jerusalem and splits his time between the West Bank and the United States, there is no doubt Palestinians have the drive and ideas to succeed as entrepreneurs. The challenges lie elsewhere. “The biggest obstacles they face are access and exposure,” he said, referring to the ability to get out of the West Bank and learn from what is going on in the startup world in the United States or neighboring Israel, where the venture capital and startup culture is well-funded and flourishing. “That’s an outcome of the political situation that cannot be ignored,” he said, referring to Israel’s occupation, which limits movement for Palestinians in and out of the West Bank and Gaza. “But also, it has to be said that Palestine is not exactly top of mind when people think of tech investment.” As a result, Palestinian entrepreneurs need to have more grit and investors need to take more risks. “When we started the fund, we made sure the limited partners were aware of the risks, that they shouldn’t be looking for the standard VC returns they get in Silicon Valley,” he said. While those partners - who also include the Soros Economic Development Fund, AOL founder Steve Case’s foundation and former eBay president Jeff Skoll’s foundation - want to make money, they also think about what Nashef refers to as “the double bottom-line”: earning a profit and having a social impact. The companies Sadara has backed employ more than 200 people and have generated investment of $74 million, including Freightos’ latest fund-raising round, which has a knock-on impact economically and is part of the process of building a “tech ecosystem” in the Palestinian territories. While at a political level relations between the Palestinian territories and Israel remain fraught and at times violent, in terms of business and investment, there are daily low-level interactions, including among tech companies. Some Israeli firms employ Palestinian programmers, and Israeli-Arabs increasingly work in the tech sector. Nashef acknowledges that in some respects the fund is behind projections — it wanted to have invested in around 12 companies over five years — but in other ways the landscape in the West Bank has been transformed since it started. There are now four active funds, whether venture capital or private equity, scouting Palestinian tech investments, three or four “accelerators” and a total of 17 VC-backed startups. Six years ago, there was none of that. Kaufmann points out that about 2,000 Palestinians graduate with IT degrees each year, but many go on to work for PalTel, the main telecoms company. The challenge is to create a pool of entrepreneurial talent and prevent it going abroad. “The first generation of Palestinian startups are not pushing the envelope on technology innovation,” he said. “The innovation is much more on the marketing side, adapting solutions that have been proven to work in other markets ... that’s the low-hanging fruit.” Nashef agrees there is a need to walk before running. “You can’t import talent at scale, and domestically it will take a long time to build the necessary skills without the right startup culture and experience,” he said. But they remain optimistic. “On both the financial and the impact side of the investment, I am positive,” said Nashef. The proof will be if they can achieve an “exit” — growing a company to an IPO or finding someone who wants to buy it. “What every VC aims for is exits,” said Kaufmann. “We certainly hope and expect that among our portfolio there will be companies that have successful exits, more likely acquisitions rather than IPOs, in the near future.” Nashef put a 4-5 year timeline on it. “A Palestinian exit, that’s what we’re after. An end-to-end Palestinian story.” ","

Udacity was co-founded by Sebastian Thrun, who was also the co-founder of the Google X research lab that led development of Google’s self-driving car. The new company, dubbed Voyage Auto, will not build its own cars but retrofit existing vehicles. “I’m starting a new thing with great friends called Voyage Auto,” Chief Executive Oliver Cameron said on his LinkedIn page. “We’re deploying autonomous taxis to real users very, very soon.” Cameron is a former VP engineering and product at Udacity. He said on his LinkedIn page that “Voyage is building an extremely cheap and safe autonomous taxi service”. Voyage will operate independently from Udacity, which will hold an undisclosed stake in the company. Udacity is worth more than $1 billion. It is betting that its focus on vocational courses for professionals, as well as its work for global companies such as Google, will help it to stand out in the fast-growing online education industry. Udacity has an education program for developers of self-driving cars. It has been followed by more than 6,600 students worldwide, the company said in a statement. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nvidia and Delphi are among the companies that have hired students from the program. The LinkedIn page of Voyage Auto showed it had 4 employees. Business Insider reported first about Voyage Auto. It said Voyage would not be using any of the technology built by Udacity’s students, citing Chief Marketing Officer Shernaz Daver. ","

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"HERZOGENAURACH, Germany/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Adidas launched a new sneaker on Friday with a 3D-printed sole that it plans to mass-produce next year, part of a broader push by the German sportswear firm to react faster to changing fashions and create more customized products. Adidas already lets people customize the color and pattern of shoes ordered online but new 3D printing methods will make small production runs, limited edition shoes and even soles designed to fit an individual’s weight and gait economical. Rivals Nike, Under Armour and New Balance  have also been experimenting with 3D printing but have so far only used the technique to make prototypes, soles tailored for sponsored athletes and a handful of high-priced novelty shoes. That’s because traditional 3D printers are slower, more expensive and often create an inferior product than the injection moulds for plastic that are currently used to produce hundreds of millions of shoes each year, mostly in Asia. However, Adidas says its new partnership with Silicon Valley start-up Carbon allows it to overcome many of those difficulties to produce a sole that can rival one made by an injection mould, and at a speed and price that allow for mass production. “This is a milestone not only for us as a company but also for the industry,” said Gerd Manz, Adidas head of technology innovation, announcing the launch of its new “Futurecraft 4D” shoe. “We’ve cracked some of the boundaries.” Carbon, financed by venture firms such as Sequoia Capital as well as funds set up by General Electric and Alphabet’s Google, has pioneered a technique that prints with light-sensitive polymer resin that is then baked for strength. Standard 3D printers build up products with layers of plastic powder, a method used by Hewlett Packard which is working with Nike and says its newest machines work 10 times faster and at half the cost than earlier models. Adidas hopes to sell 5,000 pairs of its “Futurecraft 4D” this year, and 100,000 next year as Carbon cuts the time it takes to print a sole from the current hour and a half to as low as 20 minutes per sole. The shoes will sell at an unspecified premium price but Adidas plans to lower the cost as the technology develops. Late last year Adidas sold a few hundred pairs of running shoes with soles made by regular 3D printing for $333 but they were relatively rigid and heavy and took 10 hours to print. Carbon’s technology will allow Adidas to make small batches of shoes far more quickly. Small production runs were not economical before as the metal moulds for most soles need to be used 10,000 times to pay for themselves, and they take four to six weeks to cast and grind. “What you can do is introduce more types of products without a cost penalty,” said Terry Wohlers, head of Wohlers Associates, a U.S. consultancy specializing in 3D printing. “With this technology, you can produce one or a few inexpensively.” Wohlers expects the 3D printing industry to more than quadruple sales to $26 billion by 2022, driven mostly by the automotive, medical, dental and jewelry sectors. Adidas initially plans batches of shoes tailored to specific sports or cities but hopes consumers will eventually be measured and tested in store to design perfectly-fitting shoes tweaked for an individual’s gait, weight and type of sport. “Individualization will come, but you’ve got to learn to walk before you run,” Manz said, citing a survey that shows 80 percent of consumers want to be part of the design process. Adidas last month experimented with a pop-up store where customers could design a custom-fitted sweater and have it knitted in the store. 3D printing will also help cut the time it takes to get new designs to stores from the 12 to 18 months it usually takes for sneakers. To that end, Adidas is also opening factories mainly operated by robots in Germany and the United States. ","

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules, the White House said, a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates. Republicans in Congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The signing, disclosed in White House statement late on Monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The bill repeals regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. The rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the repeal in a statement late on Monday for having “appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet.” Those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers.” Pai said the FCC would work with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees websites, to restore the “FTC’s authority to police internet service providers’ privacy practices.” Republican FCC commissioners have said the Obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. The action is the latest in a string of reversals of Obama administration rules. On Monday, the FCC reversed a requirement that Charter Communications Inc extend broadband service to 1 million homes that already have a high-speed provider. On Friday, Comcast, Verizon AT&T Inc said they would voluntarily not sell customers’ individual internet browsing information. Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so but the company said it has two advertising programs that use “de-identified” customer browsing data, including one that uses “aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses.” The American Civil Liberties Union said last month Congress should have opposed “industry pressure to put profits over privacy” and added “most Americans believe that their sensitive internet information should be closely guarded.” Trade group USTelecom Chief Executive Jonathan Spalter in a statement praised Trump for “stopping rules that would have created a confusing and conflicting consumer privacy framework.” Last week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans “believe that their private information should be just that.” Republicans later this year are expected to move to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility - a move that is expected to spark an even bigger fight.

Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX. “These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies,” he said.

Languishing around the edges, a clutch of buttons and patches: a microphone, a mid-1970s handheld video camera, a peace sign, a coffee cup with a face, some green lightning, an American flag. They suggest the handiwork of a magpie after a fruitful attic raid. Or an alien emissary making a sincere effort to human person. Or Google trying to be ""lit."" Turns out it's the third option. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) company Google's report – they call it a ""magazine,"" which is pretty lit – has been floating around for weeks, but mostly escaped notice until Monday. It's entitled ""It's Lit: a guide to what teens think is cool"" (inconsistent capitalization, like magazines, is lit). It finds that Gen Z adores Google's streaming video service YouTube. Netflix comes a close second, but Google's search engine is right behind it. Vice, despite its warmish reception among millennials, barely beats out the Wall Street Journal as the least lit brand on Gen Z's list. (See also: Netflix Domestic Subscriber Growth to Slow Down: Analyst.) The report plots Gen Z's (13-17) and young millennials' (18-24) perceptions of 122 brands by awareness and coolness, highlighting some interesting contrasts between the two cohorts. For example, while millennials are in thrall to In-N-Out Burger, Gen Z correctly identifies Chick-Fil-A as the coolest fast food outlet. Gen Z has less enthusiasm for car brands ""across the board."" They really love Oreos though. In general, unsurprisingly, teens are more willing to condemn something as uncool than millennials, whose answers cluster in an apathetic morass at the upper middle of the graph.  Marketers, parents and other denizens of half-forgotten decades can have plenty of fun digging through these unfamiliar new trends – while experiencing a gratingly familiar barrage of 80s and 90s bubblegum angst. Perhaps Google simply accepted that their audience would know ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" ""Saved By the Bell"" and ""Malcolm in the Middle"" better than … whatever kids watch on YouTube. That's why guide books for Japan show pictures of Indiana suburbs and tagine recipes show buckets of KFC. Right? Pages 19 and 20 sport a cork board with Polaroids thumb-tacked onto it.

And what is unmistakably a PlayStation 2 controller (and another). No shortage of chalkboard doodles, either, in case you wanted to relive the opening credits of every late-80s high school movie with 35-year-old actors. All this misdirected nostalgia has the effect of making the report difficult to read. The text is lost in splashes of Fresh Prince pinks, yellows, blues and greens. Not that it's any great loss. ""To teens,"" you'll be lit to learn, ""Google means having all the information you could ever need at your fingertips."" That makes Google ""remarkable,"" Google explains, adding, ""Teens also think Google is cool because it is popular (search engine), innovative (self driving cars, glass), creative (Google Doodles and easter eggs) and has good values."" It goes on like that. Of course, despite the time-warped design choices and bald self-promotion, this report provides crucial insight into a generation's brand perceptions, so ignore it at your peril. After all, who knows more about these things than Google, the search Imperium to which seekers of all generations go to find the answers to anything they might want to know? Oh wait.

Ltd’s (SSNLF) latest Galaxy Phone 8. The phone, which was released to critical acclaim last week, can be unlocked using face recognition technology. (See also: Samsung's All-Important Galaxy 8 Garners Positive Reviews). While that feature may save time and effort for consumers, it could also be used by lawmakers to gain evidence without an express consent from suspects in a case. This is because face recognition technology is not covered as “testimonial evidence” under the Fifth Amendment. (See also: Could Facebook And Google Survive A Face Recognition Lawsuit?). Manually-entered passwords are considered testimonial evidence because passcodes or passwords are unique and can only be obtained with a suspect's permission. Revealing pass codes or passwords can also be considered a form of self-incrimination because they provide pathways to documents or assortment forms of evidence. Biometrics, however, falls into a gray area because it does not require thought. Instead it simply requires a face scan, which can be obtained without the suspect’s permission or, even, by holding up a photograph of the said person to the smartphone. In an interview with tech publication The Verge, Jeffrey Welty, a law professor from UNC - Chapel Hill, said that the law for biometric scanning would be the same as for Touch IDs, which require fingerprint scanning. A face scan is not a testimonial act, according to him, “because it doesn’t require the suspect to provide any information that is inside his or her mind.” A precedent for the latter was set back in 2014, when a judge allowed police to force a suspect to unlock his smartphone using Touch ID. There is a catch to the situation, however. Lawmakers must move fast to unlock phones using fingerprint scans because there is only a 48-hour window during which Touch IDs can be used to unlock phones. Subsequently, pincodes are required to unlock smartphones and suspects can invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to cooperate. Lawmakers can also compel you to unlock your smartphone or any other device, if its contents are a “foregone conclusion”. In other words, the police already know about the contents of your device before they ask you to unlock it. The Verge raises the specter of customs officials using face scans to unlock phones for prospective immigrants entering the country. Welty, the professor from Chapel Hill, recommends passwords over Touch ID. “Bottom line, if you are concerned about whether law enforcement can compel access to your device, a password or passcode is much better than Touch ID or facial recognition, but it isn’t ironclad,” he is quoted as saying in The Verge.

Cloudera will surely be compared to competitor Hortonworks Inc. (HDP), which also specializes in Hadoop, an open-source project that processes and stores large data sets across many different computers. (For more, see: How Big Data Has Changed Marketing.) Hortonworks went public in December 2014, and since the first day of trading, its share price has fallen by more than 60% and its market value tumbled to just over $600 million. Cloudera, like Hortonworks, posted a big loss last year—according to the Wall Street Journal—$187 million. Cloudera has plenty of competition as well, from several big tech companies like IBM and Oracle, and cloud providers such as Microsoft and Amazon that are growing their business intelligence offerings. That competition could drag on earnings. Cloudera also already valued itself a good deal lower than its last private-market share price, according to the Wall Street Journal. Intel paid $30.92 a share in 2014, and this month, Cloudera granted stock awards to employees at $17.85 a share. Cloudera’s mutual fund investors marked down the estimated values of their shares to between $17 and $26 as of December, according to The Wall Street Journal’s Startup Stock Tracker. Early investors are likely to do well, such as Accel Partners, which owns 16.3% of Cloudera, and first bought shares at 39 cents a share in 2008, reports the Journal.  So far Cloudera has raised $1.04 billion in eight rounds from 18 investors. Its major investors include Accel Partners, Greylock Partners and Meritech Capital Partners. On the bright side, the company has done well the last few years. Its clients include MasterCard Inc. and Marks & Spencer Group PLC. Cloudera increased its revenue from $109 million in the 12 months ending January 2015 to $261 million for the 12 months ending January 2017. And a good deal of the growth came from companies purchasing Cloudera software subscriptions, a sign the company is attracting customers. Some say the $187 million loss last year is not unusual for a tech company, and note it’s an improvement of losses over $200 million in 2015. Cloudera also does have Intel going for it. The backing of a major brand provides it with a solid foundation. Cloudera is broadening its reach as well, breaking away from marketing itself solely as a Hadoop distribution platform. In its S-1 filing, Cloudera presents itself as “the leading modern platform for data management, machine learning and advanced analytics,” a move that could help set the company apart from the pack.

Levandowski is at the nexus of a battle between what is now Alphabet's self-driving car company, Waymo, and ride-hailing start-up Uber. Waymo alleges that Levandowski stole thousands of documents and trade secrets for Otto, which went on to be rapidly acquired by Uber. (Uber calls these claims ""baseless."") New court documents allege that Levandowski's conflicts of interest may have been much deeper. Not only did Levandowski try to poach Google employees, the lawsuit said, but he may have been involved in competing side businesses called Odin Wave and Tyto Lidar. Levandowski denied having ownership interested in Odin Wave when questioned in mid-2013, the lawsuit said, and also helped Google do due diligence for a potential acquisition of Tyto — a company that Otto later acquired. ""Throughout this process, Levandowski never disclosed a relationship with Tyto and its employees,"" the lawsuit said. ""Google now believes that Levandowski in fact had a relationship with Tyto and its employees that conflicted with Levandowski's duties to Google."" Levandowski hasn't been the only engineer to get hefty sums from Waymo. In the suit, Google said it has had to provide incentives"" to convince numerous other employees not to follow Levandowski to Uber. Uber and Waymo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg has previously reported that high paychecks prompted attrition at Google's car project. Bloomberg also reported that Levandowski had a long history of side projects during his time at Google, many sanctioned by founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. ""Anthony is a rogue force of nature,"" former Google self-driving car executive told Bloomberg. ""Each phase of his Google career he had a separate company doing exactly the same work."" Levandowski has invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination in the lawsuit, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. Lawyers for Levandowski could no immediately be reached. Watch: Uber's diversity report ",Waymo's Uber lawsuit reveals Anthony Levandowski's $120M pay
Todd Haselton,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"The Information said Wednesday that Google plans to add new mesh Wi-Fi networking features to Google Home, its smart Amazon Echo competitor, which would allow the product boost Wi-Fi signals around the home. The function would work similarly to Google Wifi, a stand-alone mesh networking package that replaces a single router and instead places access points that communicate with one another around the house and provides improved connectivity. Google says a single Google Wifi access point can cover a 1,500 square foot house, but that a package of three, which all work together as a seamless Wi-Fi network, can cover up to 4,500 square feet. If Alphabet does indeed build this sort of mesh networking technology into its Google Home product, then users could extend the range of their Wi-Fi networks without needing to buy additional Google Wifi access points. Google Wifi pucks retail for $129 each, the same price as a Google Home base station. The move could give Google Home an edge over the Amazon Echo, which doesn't offer the ability to extend Wi-Fi networks. The Information points to Amazon's investment in a Wi-Fi company named Luma as evidence that Amazon may be considering a similar approach, however. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.

Todd Haselton,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"YouTube TV, Google's streaming TV service, went live in select markets today and we're going to walk you through it. If you're unfamiliar with the service, YouTube TV allows customers to sign up to stream content from select partners for $35 a month. It's entering a crowded market already populated by Sony's PS Vue, AT&T's DirecTV Now, Dish's Sling TV and, soon, a new service from Hulu. We've used every option out there, so let's take a look at what YouTube TV offer and how it works.        The quality looked great, but that sort of thing can vary depending on the time of day and demand. Also, even though you're paying a monthly fee, you're still going to see ads (as the screenshot shows). Alphabet was probably wise to roll this out in select markets at first, so that YouTube TV can avoid some of the pitfalls that AT&T's DirecTV Now service faced. DirecTV Now frequently crashed when it launched, for example. YouTube TV is available for iOS, Android and the web. You can sign up now as long as you live in the aforementioned markets.

Ester Bloom,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day, reports Tad Friend of The New Yorker in the article, ""The God Pill: Silicon Valley's quest for eternal life."" Most check out well before what is considered the maximum age of 115, and some of them could afford to keep going far longer, if only science would allow it. The urge to combat aging, especially among the affluent, is an old one, but new technological breakthroughs can make the prospect seem tantalizingly close. Friend joins Nobel Prize-winning scientists, icons of the entertainment industry such as Goldie Hawn and Moby, and tech billionaires like Google co-founder Sergey Brin, for the launch of the National Academy of Medicine's Grand Challenge in Health Longevity, which will distribute $25 million as part of its endeavors to, as one doctor puts it, ""end aging forever."" For the super rich in the ""life-extension community,"" it's a small world. Brin, whose company has invested over $1 billion in a ""longevity lab"" called Calico (short for the California Life Company), is dating Nicole Shanahan, the founder of a patent-management business that will work with some of the National Academy's biotech patents. According to Friend, Shanahan attended the launch with Brin: If all goes well, Brin won't age, either, or not past a certain point. Slowing or stopping that process is the current focus of biochemist Ned David, co-founder of Unity Biotechnology, who is 49 but, according to Friend, looks 30. The scientist's youthfulness is part of his appeal, writes Friend. Last fall, Unity raised a hundred and sixteen million dollars from such investors as Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel, billionaires eager to stretch our lives, or at least their own, to a span that Thiel has pinpointed as ""forever."" In a field rife with charlatans, Ned David's Dorian Gray affect has factored into his fund-raising. ""One class of investor, like Fidelity, finds my youthful appearance alarming,"" he said. ""Another class — the Silicon Valley type, a Peter Thiel — finds anyone who looks over 40 alarming."" Investing in bio-tech breakthroughs is one way the super rich are trying to stay young and healthy indefinitely. Others in the community are settling for cryogenic freezing, in the hopes that they can be thawed once regenerative science has sufficiently advanced. CNBC's Zack Guzman reported in 2016 that ""thousands of people around the world have put their trust, lives and fortunes into the promise of cryonics."" At that point, at Alcor's center in Scottsdale, Ariz., nearly 150 individuals had elected to preserve either their heads ($80,000) or their entire bodies ($200,000) in liquid nitrogen. Some wealthy individuals are covering their bases: Thiel has invested in both Unity and Alcor. If there is a way to ""solve death,"" as Friend puts it, whether through cryonics or gene therapies, a kind of vampirism in which Silicon Valley billionaires ""end up being sustained by young blood"" or more wholesome methods such as good nutrition and medicine, some combination of the above or perhaps an actual sorcerer's stone, the next generation of well-funded alchemists is determined to find it. As a 30-year-old start-up founder confidently tells Friend, ""The proposition that we can live forever is obvious. It doesn't violate the laws of physics, so we will achieve it.""

Michelle Castillo,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"While Google and Facebook are the undisputed advertising leaders online, companies are increasingly looking for other digital ways to spend their marketing budgets, according to advertising and public relations company WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell. ""What our clients want and what our agencies want is more competition of the space, anything that gives more competition to the duopoly of Facebook and Google,"" Sorrell said to CNBC. The two tech giants account for about 75 percent of digital ad budgets, according to Sorrell. But, there are competitors ready to chip away at their dominance, including AOL and Yahoo's ad tech platforms and Snap. Even Amazon is becoming a threat, with its ad platform recently valued at $350 billion, he pointed out. ""Getting more than two solutions is important,"" he said. But while Google's issue of ads appearing next to questionable content is causing companies to pull dollars right now, Sorrell doesn't think the moves will be permanent because of how big of a presence the company has in digital adverting.

Marguerite Ward,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"If you want to pick up the skill more employers will be looking for in the future, heed the advice of executives from a global leader in technology. In an interview with CNBC, both Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet and Jonathan Rosenberg, adviser to CEO Larry Page, say that data analytics will become increasingly important in workplaces. ""I think a basic understanding of data analytics is incredibly important for this next generation of young people,"" Schmidt tells CNBC. ""That's the world you're going into."" ""By data analytics,"" the executive chairman says, ""I mean a basic knowledge of how statistics works, a basic knowledge of how people make conclusions over big data."" Focusing more on data analytics will help businesses too, the executives say. Hiring professionals with the right skills and a penchant for bold, creative thinking was a strategy that drove Google's innovation, Schmidt and Rosenberg write in a recently updated version of their book, ""How Google Works."" According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of roles for individuals with this skills set is expected to grow by 30 percent over the next seven years, well above average. Data analysts make sense of large amounts of information using statistical tools and techniques. They're able to pinpoint trends and correlations using programs such as Excel, SAS and SQL and Tableau. They typically study statistics, data science or math. Schmidt says that being able to use calculus would be a great asset to an employee, but an understanding of how to approach big data would still be very helpful in finding a job. Rosenberg agrees. ""My favorite statement that echoes Eric's,"" he says,"" is 'Data is the sword of the 21st century, those who wield it well, the samurai.'"" The quote comes from an  internal memo Rosenberg sent to employees in 2009, following the inauguration of President Barack Obama.

Ari Levy,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Alphabet's venture arm — once called Google Ventures, now known as GV — said Tuesday it joined Sequoia Capital in leading a $90 million financing of Cohesity, with the aim of helping businesses make use of mountains of stashed-away data. Secondary storage is the stuff that corporations typically archive or save for protection in case primary files get lost or corrupted. It sits on tape and disks in dark data centers. It's certainly not a subject you imagine drawing much attention in Silicon Valley, particularly in the halls of a company like Google. But what if rather than sitting dormant, all that secondary storage could be used and accessed at any time? Karim Faris, the GV partner who led the Cohesity investment, said his team had been looking for a product that could ""light up"" that data through software. GV put some money into the last round in 2015 and is now stepping up in a hefty way. ""Cohesity brings instant access, search, discoverability and the ability to restore data very easily,"" Faris said in an interview. ""They figured out a way to seamlessly insert themselves into the flow of how you do things."" Aron is part of a small exodus of entrepreneurs from Nutanix, which pioneered a type of computing infrastructure known as ""hyperconverged"" storage that combines storage hardware with various types of software, all stored in a single inexpensive device that runs in a company's data center. Nutanix was one of the first big billion-dollar ""unicorn"" start-ups of the current generation, raising nearly $500 million to reach a valuation of more than $2 billion before finally going public last September. It's currently worth about $2.5 billion. Aron co-founded Nutanix, then left in 2013 to start Cohesity; one of Cohesity's primary competitors is a start-up called Rubrik, which was started in  2014 by Bipul Sinha, a board member at Nutanix and major investor in that company. Both Cohesity and Rubrik have turned to engineers from Google and other massive consumer internet companies to develop the next generation of backup technology for the business world. Aron said about 30 percent of his 35-person engineering team came from Google. For its part, Rubrik raised a $61 million round in August and said in February that it's approaching $100 million in annualized bookings. Ask Aron or Sinha whom they consider their primary competitors and both mention legacy hardware vendors with single-purpose boxes. Aron said that in 80 percent of deals Cohesity is vying with companies like Commvault and EMC's Data Domain. His team scours the market for businesses that have switched another part of the business from a traditional vendor to something new. For example, companies that have moved from disk storage to flash make good prospects. ""It gives us an indication that they're looking for alternatives,"" Aron said. The financing round includes capital from Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise as well as a number of existing investors. Aron said the capital infusion will go toward building the company's sales and marketing efforts and pushing deeper into Europe and Asia. As for product development, Aron said backup and data protection get customers in the door, but in the future businesses will turn to Cohesity for more advanced uses like analytics and test and development. ""That's where our R&D efforts are going,"" he said. ",Alphabet leads $90m investment in Cohesity
Marguerite Ward,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Google exec Peter Roper attributes his professional success to one specific trait: fearlessness. Before Roper became Google's head of mobile brand strategy in 2014, he made a point of constantly taking steps to build his skill set. He would propose complex projects, partner with people in different industries and even switched jobs based on what he thought he could learn in the next role. That skill-seeking strategy, along with one very bold move in particular, helped him land a leadership position at one of the most important companies in the world. ""If you're fearless,"" Roper tells CNBC, ""you're able to go after the goals that you want to achieve."" In 2013, he sent a cold email to the CEO of Songza, a music app he loved. He asked if the company was looking for anyone to help run sales. While Songza did not have any job openings listed online, the CEO responded saying that he was, in fact, looking for a sales executive. Roper landed the job, and a few years later, Google acquired the app. Soon after, Google asked him to join the team. ""If you don't put yourself out there,"" he says, ""nobody's really going to hand you the big project, or hand you the job."" When you take a risk such as cold emailing a hiring manager or proposing a new project to your boss, people will notice, according to the executive. In fact, bold moves like these help you regardless of whether someone notices, according to former Google career coach Jenny Blake. Roper isn't the only business leader whose career took off as a result of boldness. Ursula Burns, executive chairman at Xerox, got a promotion that set her on track to the C-suite after she challenged an executive in a meeting. Mark Zuckerburg, Steve Jobs and other tech visionaries dropped out of college to pursue their ideas. While those moves may seem exceptionally bold, successful people often take big risks. ""The most important characteristic for young professionals,"" he says, ""is to be fearless, to really put yourself out there and accomplish your goals.""

The science of deep learning, a sub-discipline of artificial intelligence (AI), is only a recent development in the grand scheme of things, but during its short existence, it has been producing some impressive technological achievements. Advances in image recognition, language understanding, and translation have led to the development of virtual assistants, smart home speakers, and gains in cybersecurity, and they are leading the charge toward autonomous driving. Now, companies have found a way to use those AI smarts to fight cancer. Deep learning involves the construction of artificial neural networks, using software and complex algorithms to recreate the capacity of the human brain to learn. These learning computers have a particular knack for sifting through vast amounts of data and recognizing patterns, getting smarter as they go. The first breakthrough involved feeding a system thousands of pictures of cats until the program was able to recognize a cat on its own. GoogLeNet AI provides groundbreaking cancer research! Image source: Getty Images. Pathologists are responsible for reviewing all the biological tissues visible on a slide. However, there can be many slides per patient, each of which is 10+ gigapixels when digitized at 40X magnification. Imagine having to go through a thousand 10 megapixel (MP) photos, and having to be responsible for every pixel. Needless to say, this is a lot of data to cover, and often time is limited. This technology has the potential to provide initial screenings, allowing doctors to review only those images that have been flagged as potentially cancerous. The system still requires improvement, as it generated a number of false positives -- identifying cancerous cells where none were present. So, while AI won't be replacing pathologists anytime soon, these algorithms could be used to pre-screen images and not only reduce the workload on doctors, but also serve parts of the world where pathologists are in short supply. IBM enhances Watson's ability to ""see"" medical images. Image source: IBM. Google isn't the only one testing AI for this purpose. Nearly a year ago, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) partnered with numerous health systems, imaging technology companies, and academic medical centers to train Watson AI, its cognitive computer, to read medical images. This more broadly based collaboration is focusing on cancer, cardiovascular disease, eye health, and diabetes. The company announced last month that it had expanded that initiative to 24 organizations worldwide, which will provide the vital input necessary to train the system. IBM also announced the first fruits of this endeavor, an application for the detection of one type of cardiovascular disease involving a narrowing of the heart's aortic valve. It plans to expand Watson's efforts to a variety of additional cardiovascular conditions in the near future. Watson is already seeing success in a number of medical applications. In its most impressive results in the field to date, Watson reviewed the medical records of 1,000 cancer patients and was able to develop a treatment plan that concurred with oncologists' recommendations with 99% accuracy. The AI was also able to provide additional recommendations in about 30% of cases that had been missed by doctors, thanks to its ability to review even the most recent medical research. Neither company provides specific information regarding how these AI-related medical breakthroughs would contribute to the overall business, and any contribution would represent only a minuscule part of each company's total revenue at this juncture. These are still extremely early developments, but they illustrate the vast potential of AI in the not-too-distant future. These AI algorithms won't be replacing your doctor, but they might just make them more efficient. AI and its applications to medicine are still in early days, but I wouldn't be surprised to hear more groundbreaking announcements in the near future. ","

Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) has been publicly traded since 2006, and since then the fabless semiconductor company has experienced a few massive stock price run-ups and a few substantial drops as well. Investors who bought Himax right when the company went public have seen their investment gain just over 4%. To find out how the company might perform in the near future let's take a quick look at what's caused Himax's stock to pop -- and dip -- and if the company is likely to experience more of the same going forward. Image source: Getty Images. As you can see from the chart below, Himax's share price history has been on a wild ride since mid-2013, after experiencing a slow decline following its IPO. Himax's stock price began skyrocketing in 2013 on news that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google was implementing some of Himax's technology into its ill-fated Google Glass device. Google even took a 6.3% stake in the company at the time, with the option of grabbing 14.8% of Himax if wanted it -- which Google eventually decided against . Image source: YCharts. During that time the company's stock hit an all-time high, only to plummet after things with Google and its Glass device didn't pan out. Then, near the beginning of 2016, investors started getting excited about Himax's prospects in the AR space again, this time on hopes that Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Hololens would bring Himax's share price huge gains. Unfortunately, the company faced a similar situation as in the past when the Hololens failed to bring huge gains for Himax. Investors began dumping the stock after a few analysts cut their buy ratings on news that Hololens shipments were lower than expected. Much of Himax's prospects are being built around the company's ability to supply technology for its AR customers. On Himax's recent earning call, CEO Jordan Wu said that, Having invested in related technologies for over 15 years, we are uniquely positioned as the provider of choice for micro display and related optics, both of which [are] critical enablers to AR devices. The company is ramping up for more sales of its liquid crystals on silicon (LCOS) and wafer-level optics (WLO) products for AR devices after ramping up production for both later this year and into 2018. Himax says that the ramp-up is because its AR customers are looking to their next generation devices, and that Himax's tech will benefit from that. While this certainly could be true, it also feels a little like 2013 all over again. Betting on AR -- which is still an unproven market -- could take a long time to pay off for the company. Northland Capital Markets' Tom Sepenzis wrote in a recent investor note (republished on Barron's): Augmented reality remains the largest potential for HIMX with its LCOS and WLO products, but the market has hit another stumbling block as prices remain prohibitive for consumers. We believe that this will limit the number of new AR devices for the next 12-24 months.... AR is expected to be worth $117 billion by 2022, according to Markets and Markets research. Investors can look to Himax's past share price volatility and see that betting on this stock's AR future can turn out badly. A better approach may be to wait a little while longer and see if Himax's technology investments bare some fruit later this year and next, and then see how well that positions the company in the AR space.

Sean Williams,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Marijuana stocks are on fire, and they likely have the rapidly changing public perception of the drug to thank for those gains. Gallup, the national pollster that's been conducting surveys on the public's opinion toward marijuana since the 1960s, found that 60% of respondents wanted to see the drug legalized nationally as of 2016. Comparatively, only 25% approved of legalizing it nationwide back in 1995, the year before California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana for compassionate use. Image source: Getty Images. As the public's stance on marijuana has both softened and brightened, individual states have taken advantage by passing recreational and/or medical cannabis legislation. North American sales of legal pot totaled $6.9 billion in 2016 according to cannabis research firm ArcView Market Research, while investment firm Cowen & Co. anticipates legal sales growth of more than 23% per year through 2026. All of this data means one thing: a possible once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on this growth by investing in marijuana stocks. Only there's one pretty major catch: Most marijuana stocks are a fundamental train wreck. If there's one thing that nearly all marijuana stocks share in common, it's that they're losing money. Remember, there is no precedence for the cannabis industry, so many of these companies are learning as they go. The result is that all but one pot stock trading above a $200 million market value is losing money over the trailing-12-month period (we'll get to that company a bit later). Marijuana businesses also face two major disadvantages that weigh on their ability to grow and expand. For starters, traditional cannabis businesses are unable to access basic banking services, which includes something as simple as a checking account. Since financial institutions answer to the federal government, and the latter currently lists cannabis as a Schedule 1 substance, and ergo illicit, dealing with weed businesses could be construed as money laundering. This forces marijuana businesses to deal in cash, which is a major security concern and a clear inhibitor of their growth. Are marijuana stocks just one big trap for investors? Image source: Getty Images. Marijuana companies also face disadvantages when it comes to paying their corporate income taxes. Internal Revenue Service tax code 280E disallows businesses that sell federally illegal substances from taking normal business deductions. This effectively dooms pot companies to pay tax on their gross profits (should they have any) instead of their net profits. And how can we forget that nearly all marijuana stocks trade on the over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges. To be clear, the OTC exchanges have made significant strides in reporting standards over the past couple of years, but they're still nowhere near what you'd find in a company listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq. The end result is that it can be tough at times to get accurate and up-to-date financial information on OTC-listed marijuana stocks. Not to mention that most marijuana stocks also happen to be penny stocks, and that's a path we'd rather not travel due to their volatility and the high probability of losses. However, amid the minefield of money-losing marijuana stocks sit two cannabis companies that have actually generated positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) over the last 12 months. EBITDA is an important measure for investors because it focuses on the operating performance of a company and the decisions made by management. It deemphasizes a number of one-time costs and expenses, such as tax payments, depreciation, and amortization, in order to give investors a better look at the operational success or failure of a company. Image source: Getty Images. As noted, just two marijuana stocks with a market valuation of $200 million or greater are generating positive EBITDA: Canopy Growth Corp. (NYSE:CGC) and Aphria (NASDAQOTH:APHQF). Insys Therapeutics (NASDAQ:INSY), which is also known as a ""marijuana stock,"" is generating positive EBITDA on a trailing-12-month basis, too. However, because almost all of its revenue comes from its sublingual pain medication Subsys, it's a bit of a misnomer to lump Insys in with pot stocks. Canopy Growth Corp., a Canadian-based e-commerce retailer of dry cannabis and oil products that currently boasts a $1.2 billion valuation, generated $5.85 million in EBITDA over the trailing-12-month period, although it lost nearly $500,000 when analyzing its bottom line over the same time frame. However, through the first nine months of its current fiscal year, Canopy Growth has generated $0.04 per share in profit, or $4.5 million, meaning it may become the second profitable pot stock (on an annual basis) soon enough. As a retailer of cannabis products, Canopy Growth could benefit greatly if Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau moves forward with his pledge to legalize pot. This would nicely complement the company's impressive year-over-year registered patient growth from approximately 8,000 patients in the third quarter of the previous year to more than 29,000 in Q3 this fiscal year. Image source: Getty Images. Additionally, Canopy Growth has been a busy bee on the acquisition front. Its most important business development was its buyout of Mettrum Health, which was completed at the end of January. This acquisition significantly boosted the company's growth production capacity. To be clear, Canopy Growth is valued at roughly 36 times its extrapolated 12-month sales and about 205 times its 12-month trailing EBITDA, so it's not cheap by any means. But it's a rare example of a thus-far modestly successful marijuana stock in a sea of otherwise bad bets. Perhaps it's only befitting, then, that the only other marijuana stock that's generating a profit over the trailing-12-month period is Aphria, which happens to be Canopy Growth's prime competitor. Like Canopy Growth, Aphria is a medical marijuana-focused business that sells dried flower and cannabis oils in Canada through its e-commerce store as well as by telephone. Over the trailing-12-month period, Aphria has generated almost $2.1 million in positive EBITDA. Considering that the two companies have a similar business model, Aphria is also looking to benefit from Canada's more lax stance on marijuana. Trudeau has previously pledged to lift restrictions on pot, but it remains to be seen if Canada can legalize the drug throughout the country. Image source: Getty Images. Through the first half of its current fiscal year, Aphria has already generated more than $2.2 million in EBITDA. An 880-basis-point improvement in adjusted gross margin between Q2 2016 and Q2 2017 is a big reason for that difference. What's more, it's well capitalized with $98.6 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand after a $37.2 million bought deal during the second quarter, and it's commencing on part 3 of its growing space expansion, which will add another 200,000 square feet of space. Though Canopy Growth has the larger operation, the smaller Aphria may prove even more attractive. Personally, I think investors should keep their distance from marijuana stocks, but these are two names to put at the top of their radar for now. ","

Tech giants Tencent (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) are currently engaged in an ongoing O2O (online-to-offline) ecosystem war in China. Tencent is turning WeChat -- the most popular messaging app in China -- into an all-in-one platform for making payments, hailing cabs, playing games, ordering food, and making online purchases. That social-centric expansion forced Baidu, which owns the biggest search engine in China, to add similar services to its mobile app. Those battles are now moving toward the growing artificial intelligence market. By adding AI capabilities to their platforms, Tencent and Baidu can boost the analytics capabilities of their services and set the foundations for next-generation initiatives like driverless cars. Let's take a closer look at the arms race between these two companies and see if one can eventually gain the upper hand. Image source: Getty Images. Tencent first announced the establishment of its AI Lab last April, and 50 AI specialists now work there. Tencent recently poached the chief of machine learning research at Baidu's Big Data Lab, Tong Zhang, to lead the unit. Prior to joining Baidu, Zhang cut his teeth at IBM and Yahoo. Zhang will also lead a team of 200 product engineers to convert AI advances into usable features for Tencent's apps and services. Tencent wants to apply AI to four key areas -- its content, social apps, online games, and cloud services. The company notes that ""over a hundred"" of its products -- including WeChat, QQ, and the Tian Tian Kuai Bao news app -- already rely on AI. To strengthen its cloud-based AI processing capabilities, Tencent installed NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) high-end GPUs -- which are better for machine learning purposes than CPUs -- in its cloud servers. Image source: Getty Images. Tencent also developed a Go-playing AI to follow Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Google's AlphaGo AI beat Go world champion Lee Sedol last year. Tencent's Go-playing AI, Fine Art, recently beat high-ranking Japanese Go player Ryo Ichiriki. AI scientists believe that Go, which requires players to surround opponents' pieces with their own, is a better test of problem solving than chess because it has many more possible moves. Like Google, Tencent believes that AI, ride hailing apps, EVs, and driverless cars will eventually converge. That's why it recently invested in Chinese EV maker NIO and bought a 5% stake in Tesla Motors. It might even tap its existing partnership with NVIDIA, which develops CPUs for connected and driverless cars, to eventually produce its own driverless platform. Baidu founded its Big Data Lab in July 2014. The division focuses on improving its machine learning algorithms, core search technologies, and big data applications. Its products include the Siri-like virtual assistant Duer, which was recently given its own business unit, and predictive analytics tools for businesses. Like Google, Baidu wants to process the data it receives from its search, mapping, and cloud services into useful information for companies and consumers. Baidu is aggressively expanding this unit with investments, partnerships, government backing, and big hires. Like Tencent, Baidu invested in NIO during its last funding round. It partnered with NVIDIA and HERE Maps to create a cloud-connected mapping platform for autonomous cars, and plans to launch its own autonomous cars -- which are being produced by a Chinese automaker -- by 2018. It also formed the dedicated Intelligent Driving division for those efforts earlier this year. Image source: Getty Images. In late February, Baidu obtained approval from the Chinese government to launch a state-backed engineering laboratory for deep learning technologies like computer vision, machine hearing, biometric identification, and human-computer interactions. It also recently acquired Raven Tech, a Beijing-based start-up which develops an AI platform for smart homes. Baidu has hired many top AI researchers to lead these efforts, but it recently lost two major leaders. In addition to Tong Zhang's abrupt departure for Tencent, Baidu's chief scientist Andrew Ng, a former Googler who led the AI group since 2014, also resigned. Those departures have raised serious concerns, since Baidu's AI group has grown to around 1,300 people -- and those employees need experienced leaders. Tencent and Baidu's AI arms race will likely continue for years, but I doubt that either company will completely outmaneuver the other. That's because the battle between Tencent and Baidu closely mirrors the ongoing clash between Facebook and Google -- one company owns the dominant social network, while the other controls the dominant search engine. Since neither ecosystem will completely consume the other, there will probably always be people who prefer using Tencent's WeChat over Baidu's app as all all-in-one platform, and vice versa. However, investors should keep an eye on how much money Tencent and Baidu are spending on these AI and O2O efforts, since both companies have posted rising expenses in recent quarters. ","

John Rosevear,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Self-driving cars are coming. That has a lot of investors asking: How might we best invest in this disruptive emerging industry? Maybe we could keep it simple, by buying a company that already makes vehicles. ""Wait,"" I can hear you saying, ""why would we invest in an old automaker for future tech? Aren't these guys dinosaurs?"" Not all of them. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is undergoing a high-tech transformation, boosting its software chops and looking to be a leader in the emerging world of technology-enabled alternatives to traditional car ownership. And it recently took a big step forward on the self-driving software front. Is it enough to make Ford a buy? Let's take a look. A Ford Fusion self-driving test vehicle. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Ford famously came back from the dead under now-retired CEO Alan Mulally. Now, his handpicked successor, Mark Fields, is set on writing the next chapter of Ford's renaissance, as a company that is as much about tech-enabled ""mobility"" as it is about manufacturing cars and trucks. Last fall, Fields announced a comprehensive plan to boost Ford's tech savvy (and its profitability) over the next few years. You can learn more about it here, but one key to that plan is self-driving tech. Ford has been touting its advancing self-driving prowess for a couple of years now. But it took a very big step forward earlier this year, when it announced a $1 billion investment in a new start-up called Argo AI. Argo AI is no ordinary start-up, and it's not an ordinary deal. Cofounded by two veterans of self-driving development projects at Alphabet and Uber Technologies, Argo AI is being created to be the center of Ford's self-driving software development. Alphabet veteran Bryan Salesky (second from right) and Uber alum Peter Rander (left) are Argo AI's co-founders. They're shown with Ford CEO Mark Fields (second from left) and Ford CTO Raj Nair (right). Nair and another Ford executive will join Argo AI's board of directors. Image source: Ford Motor Company. The idea is that its structure as a start-up, with equity stakes and upside for employees, is likely to be a powerful tool for recruiting and retaining top talent. The retention part is important: Ford's existing self-driving software team will join Argo AI. Ford doesn't own Argo AI outright. That's intentional: It gives employees the opportunity to own stakes in the business, with the possibility of a public offering down the road. For does gets dibs on what Argo AI creates, but if it turns out that there's a market, there's a real possibility that the self-driving software system created by Argo AI could be offered to other automakers. It's a unique deal that appears to put Ford in an excellent position as the autonomous-vehicle industry emerges. Beyond that, we don't know everything that Ford has planned. It has said that it will begin mass-producing a dedicated Level 4 self-driving vehicle for car-sharing and ride-hailing use in 2021. That vehicle will be a plug-in hybrid rather than a pure battery-electric, presumably to cut down on the time it needs to be out of service. It'll be built at Ford's factory in Flat Rock, Michigan. Ford hasn't said much about its plans beyond that. But the company may be laying the groundwork for a suite of mobility services that includes a Ford-branded challenge to Uber and Lyft. Taken together, the world of ""mobility"" offers a significant bottom-line growth opportunity for Ford, one that Fields is already working to seize. Right now, Ford is solidly profitable, making hay on strong global demand for its well-regarded (and very profitable) lineup of trucks and SUVs. It's trading at just about 6.5 times its adjusted 2016 earnings, with a fat (and likely sustainable) dividend yield of 5.16% backed by a payout ratio of 52%. Fields and his veteran management team have already proven themselves to be savvy stewards of the Blue Oval; investors may need to be patient, but the next chapters of Ford's story, powered by its aggressive moves into self-driving and other new technologies, could turn out to be quite profitable ones.

There is no formal definition of a good credit score. It varies depending on what you're applying to borrow for, but it's generally accepted to be in the range of 670 to 739 in the FICO scoring model. Here's how the FICO score works, what is considered a good credit score, and how to increase your credit score from good to great. First of all, when I use the term ""credit score,"" I'm referring to the FICO score. There are other scoring models out there, but FICO is the model lenders most commonly use, by far. Image source: Getty Images. The formula that determines your FICO score is a well-guarded secret, but we do know that the FICO score is made up of five categories of information: FICO scores range from 300-850, with higher scores being better, and most consumers have FICO scores in the 500-800 range. Many credit card issuers give a free credit score to customers. These days, many offer the FICO score, but not all of them do. If your credit card company gives you a credit score that's not based on the FICO model, it's still probably a solid indicator of how you're doing, but the scoring model and range may be a little different from those discussed here. To be clear, there is no set number that is defined as the cutoff between a ""bad"" and ""good"" FICO score. And in practice, a good score depends on what you're buying. For example, if you're getting an FHA home loan, any score above 580 will get you approved. However, a score in the upper 700s can be required for the best credit cards. The average American consumer has a FICO score of 700, so that's a good reference point to determine how you're doing relative to others. Additionally, FICO offers these guidelines to help you interpret your own credit score: Rating FICO Score Range Exceptional 800 or higher Very Good 740-799 Good 670-739 Fair 580-669 Poor Under 580 Data source: www.myFICO.com. If your score is in the ""good"" range in the chart, you'll generally be able to qualify for a mortgage loan with a competitive interest rate. The best rates are reserved for top-tier buyers, but the difference in interest rates between good and excellent credit scores may be less than you think. As of this writing, here are the mortgage rates consumers with various levels of credit scores can expect, and the difference they can make to your mortgage payment: FICO Score Range Average APR Monthly Payment on $200,000 Loan Total Interest Paid 760-850 3.831% $935 $136,761 700-759 4.053% $961 $145,943 680-699 4.23% $982 $153,354 660-679 4.444% $1,007 $162,422 640-659 4.874% $1,058 $180,986 620-639 5.42% $1,126 $205,202 Data source: www.myFICO.com. The same can be said for auto loans. As long as your income is enough to justify the loan, a good credit score will generally get you approved for a car loan, new or used. Your interest rate won't be quite as good as an excellent-credit borrower would get, and your dealer may require more money down, but approval is generally not a problem with good credit. As far as credit cards go, there are some credit card products specifically designed for individuals with fantastic credit scores, and these may or may not be beyond your reach if you have a good credit score. Fortunately, there are some excellent credit card products available to people with good credit scores, and you can check out our favorites here. There is no way to build great credit quickly. I always tell friends that it's possible to go from no credit to good credit in a fairly short period, but that building excellent credit takes time. Furthermore, there is no magic formula to getting a top-notch credit score. You can read my thorough discussion of the habits of people with great credit, but the general rules are: The best path to a fantastic credit score is smart credit behavior over a period of several years, and the behaviors needed to get there aren't much more than financial self-discipline and good old-fashioned common sense.

    What Is Considered a Good Credit Score? -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of cloud storage provider Box (NYSE:BOX) rallied 35% over the past 12 months, but the stock hovers just 18% above its IPO price of $14. That's because after hitting $23 on its first trading day in Jan. 2015, Box plunged below $10 last February before gradually recovering to the mid-teens. Despite that lackluster performance, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White recently reiterated his ""Buy"" rating on the stock and his price target of $26 -- which represents a near-60% rally from its current price. White claims that Box looks cheap with an EV/Sales ratio of 3.3 based on its calendar 2018 (fiscal 2019) expectations. Is that ""low"" valuation enough to justify buying Box, or should investors ignore this overlooked cloud stock? Image source: Getty Images. Box provides cloud storage and associated services to over 71,000 businesses, including the majority of the Fortune 500 companies. Its major customers include industrial behemoth General Electric and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca. That market presence is impressive, since the cloud storage market is filled with bigger players like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) 's Google. Despite those challenges, Box has posted double-digit sales growth ever since its IPO. Its revenue rose 32% to $398.6 million in fiscal 2017, and it expects another 25%-26% growth this year. Much of that growth comes from the addition of new customers, the introduction of add-on cloud services (like security and analytics) which boost its revenue per customer, and integration partnerships with companies like Microsoft, Salesforce, and IBM. Deferred revenue, a key indicator of forward demand, rose 30% to $242 million at the end of fiscal 2017. Like many high-growth tech companies, Box's robust revenue growth doesn't trickle down to any profits. However, its non-GAAP loss narrowed from $1.16 per share in 2016 to $0.56. During that period, its GAAP loss narrowed from $1.67 to $1.19. That GAAP loss was heavily weighed down by stock-based compensation expenses, which gobbled up 20% of Box's revenues during the year. Source: YCharts The ongoing cloud storage pricing war between Amazon, Microsoft, and Google limits Box's ability to raise prices. However, all three companies can afford to use cloud storage services as a loss leader to expand their ecosystems. Box has neither the scale nor ecosystem to follow suit -- so it could eventually lose customers to those tech giants' bundling strategies. Box finished 2017 with a negative free cash flow (FCF) of $24.8 million. That marked a big improvement from its negative FCF of $116.3 million in 2016, and Box achieved its first quarter of positive free cash flow ($10.2 million) during the fourth quarter. However, Box isn't expected to achieve a full-year positive FCF anytime soon, and a negative FCF could prevent Box from scaling up to widen its moat against bigger challengers. Drexel Hamilton's bullish view on Box is based on the notion that an EV/Sales ratio of 3.3 is cheap for a company with its growth figures. For example, two other high-growth cloud service stocks with comparable sales growth -- Twilio and Veeva -- have respective EV/Sales ratios of 4.6 and 8.2 based on next year's projected revenues. It's also lower than the current industry average of 4.8 for application software makers. I think Box has solid sales growth, and its growing list of big enterprise customers indicate that it has a lot of staying power. It also did a great job at adding more services and partnerships, narrowing its losses, and achieving positive free cash flow last quarter. However, claiming Box can rise 60% based on next year's sales estimates is a bit too optimistic. It's hard to tell how much storage prices will fall over the following year, and Box CEO Aaron Levie even once admitted that cloud storage would likely be ""free and infinite"" in the future. Therefore, investors should temper their expectations for Box based on future developments across the cloud market.  ","

Warren Buffett and his company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), have historically avoided investing in tech stocks, simply because Buffett doesn't understand tech very well, and he doesn't like investing in businesses he doesn't understand. However, these days there are a select few tech stocks in Buffett's portfolio -- all of which have Buffett-like qualities. Company Recent Share Price Number of Shares Berkshire Owns Value of Berkshire's Stake Apple $157.35 129,357,106 $20.3 Billion IBM $143.77 56,862,612 $8.2 Billion Sirius XM $5.58 172,325,353 $960 Million Data Source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC Filings as of 3/31/17, except for IBM, which is an approximation based on a recent interview . Share prices as of 8/7/17. Image source: The Motley Fool. Berkshire first invested in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) about a year ago, but the initial purchase represented a relatively small investment for Berkshire. Since then, the stake has roughly increased by a factor of 20, and now represents one of Berkshire's largest stock investments. The massive increase in Berkshire's Apple investment didn't come as much of a surprise to many investors. In fact, in a December article, I said that Apple was a stock Berkshire should double-down on. Apparently, Buffett and company agreed, and then some. There are lots of reasons Buffett likes Apple, such as its dominant market position, pricing power, large and steady cash flow, and its 12-figure stockpile of cash. Apple also has ""stickiness"" -- a favorite term of Buffett's -- as it has one of the most loyal customer bases of any company in the market. Multi-generational iPhone users typically don't just decide to go buy a Samsung phone, for example. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), better known as IBM, was Berkshire's first big venture into the tech sector. Berkshire started building its stake in 2011, and has added to it several times since. In fact, IBM is now one of Berkshire's largest stock investments. Buffett's purchase of IBM came as a surprise to many investors, however his reasons for buying IBM made sense. As he said in a 2011 CNBC interview, ""...we went around to all of our companies to see how their IT departments functioned and why they made the decisions they made. And I just came away with a different view of the position that IBM holds within IT departments and why they hold it and the stickiness..."" As my colleague Tim Green pointed out in an in-depth article about Buffett's IBM investment, most of IBM's revenue comes from clients who use multiple IBM solutions, which creates big switching costs (this is what Buffett means by ""stickiness""). And, the company has done a great job of evolving and investing in new areas of technology, such as cloud computing. Satellite radio provider Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) is the newest addition to Berkshire's portfolio out of these three tech stocks, with the stake added during the fourth quarter of 2016. And while we don't know for sure why Buffett chose to add Sirius XM, the company does have a lot of qualities that Buffett loves. For one thing, Sirius XM has a dominant position in an industry whose barriers to entry are high. Think about it -- can you even name the number two satellite radio company (hint: there isn't one). And, the company has begun to demonstrate steady, sustainable growth, and consistent earnings power with revenue rising by about 10% per year for the past three years. Additionally, the company offers high-demand original content that gives it an edge over other subscription-based streaming services. Howard Stern (who will host his show through at least 2020) is the prime example, but there are a number of popular original programs offered by the service. The takeaway here is that Buffett and his stock pickers are less concerned with the industry they're investing in, and more worried about whether or not the company they're buying has the qualities Buffett looks for. It just so happens that most tech companies have generally produced inconsistent earnings and faced tremendous competitive pressures, which have steered Buffett away. These three companies are exceptions. ","

On pace to hit 2 billion monthly active users in 2017, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the world's largest social network by a long shot. But exactly how many users does Facebook have? And what can be learned about these users? Here's a look at the most telling statistics about Facebook's users. Image source: Getty Images. 1.86 billion: Facebook has 1.86 billion monthly active users -- far ahead of the rest of the world's social networks. The next three largest social networks, for instance, are each 700 million or more users behind Facebook. WhatsApp and Messenger have 1.2 billion monthly active users each, and YouTube has about 1 billion monthly active users as of last count (a complete list of the world's 10 largest social networks can be found here). 17%: Facebook's monthly active users continue to grow at a rapid rate. The company's 1.86 billion monthly active users achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016 is up 17% year over year. Data source: Facebook's quarterly SEC filings. Chart by author. 66%: Perhaps where Facebook's user statistics shine the most is the percentage of monthly active users that use the service every single day. This rate, often referred to Facebook's engagement rate, was 66% throughout 2016 -- up from 65% in 2015. 18%: Facebook's daily active users actually increased slightly faster than its monthly active users in 2016. Daily active users by the end of the year were 1.23 billion, up 18% year over year from 1.04 billion in 2015. 94%: Today, Facebook is almost entirely mobile driven. Of Facebook's 1.86 billion monthly active users, 94% of them -- or 1.74 billion -- are also monthly active users on mobile devices. Data source: Q4 2016 SEC filing. Chart by author. Unsurprisingly, 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 came from ads on mobile devices. 231 million: Believe it or not, the U.S. and Canada is Facebook's smallest geographic segment in terms of monthly active users. Facebook pegs monthly active users in the region at 231 million. It has 349 million in Europe, 673 million in Asia-Pacific, and 606 million in the rest of the world. 51%: Despite being its smallest segment measured by monthly active users, the U.S. and Canada together accounted for over half of Facebook's advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. Advertising revenue in the U.S. and Canada was $4.4 billion. Ad revenues in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and rest of the world were $2 billion, $1.4 billion, and $832 million, respectively. $15.98: In 2016, Facebook generated an average of $15.98 of revenue per monthly active user. This is up about 34% from its $11.96 of average revenue per user in 2015. At the rate Facebook is currently growing its user base, the company is well on its way to hitting 2 billion monthly active users in 2017. Indeed, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aiming far beyond 2 billion users. The ambitious CEO believes the company can hit 5 billion users by 2030. ","

Americans who qualify for Social Security retirement benefits can choose to file as early as age 62 or as late as age 70 and have a full, or normal, retirement age of 66-67 years of age, depending on when they were born. Despite the wide range of options, and the permanent benefit reduction for collecting Social Security early, the most common age people start receiving benefits is as early as possible -- age 62. There certainly are some valid reasons for starting retirement benefits this early. For example, if people retire at or before 62 years of age (whether planned or unplanned), starting Social Security as early as possible can be a smart financial decision. Here's why many Americans start collecting Social Security at 62, and the good and bad reasons for making this choice. Image source: Getty Images. According to a report by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, more Americans begin collecting Social Security at age 62 than any other age. 42% of men and 48% of women claim at 62, and well over half claim their retirement benefits before reaching full retirement age. Depending on the year you were born, your full retirement age is between 66 and 67 years of age. If you decide to claim Social Security before you reach this age, your benefit checks will be permanently reduced by these percentages: So, if your full retirement age is 66, this means that your benefit will be 25% lower if you claim it at age 62. If your full retirement age is 67, your reduction will be 30%. And if you were born from 1955 through 1959, your reduction percentage will be between these two amounts. 1. Early retirement -- One good reason, and perhaps the most obvious one, to take Social Security as early as possible is because of early retirement. If you have a nice nest egg in savings and want to leave your job before your full retirement age, it can make sense to tap into Social Security early in order to start that inflation-protected income stream, and avoid tapping into your savings too much. 2. Can't afford to wait -- On the other hand, many people are forced to leave the workforce earlier than they had planned. In fact, a study by Voya Financial found that 60% of retired workers had to stop working before they expected. One-third were forced to leave their jobs involuntarily, mostly either for health reasons or job loss. Even if they had planned to wait until full retirement age or beyond, unexpected early retirees may need the income and therefore not have much of a choice. 3. Spousal or child benefit reasons -- You can read all about spousal benefits here, but in a nutshell, if your spouse didn't work, or earned much less than you did, a spousal benefit based on your work record could provide them with retirement income. Additionally, retirees with children under 18, age 18 or 19 and still in high school, or are disabled, may qualify for children's benefits. However, both of these benefit programs require the primary worker to claim benefits before spousal or children's benefits can be paid. 4. Health concerns -- Social Security is designed so that you get the same (inflation-adjusted) benefits throughout your lifetime, regardless of when you start collecting. However, this is based on actuarial life expectancies and not your personal situation. Therefore, if you aren't in great health, have a family history of premature death, or are otherwise pessimistic when it comes to your own longevity, it can be good motivation to claim your benefits early, even though it means a reduced benefit. As you see, there are some perfectly valid reasons Americans choose to take Social Security benefits before reaching their full retirement age. However, there is one bad reason that many people give: Because ""Social Security is going broke"", or some variation of that statement. The reality is that while Social Security isn't on the most stable long-term financial footing, Americans reaching their retirement age need not worry about whether or not their benefits will be paid in the future. The bad news is that it's not expected to last. Due to the huge number of Baby Boomers expected to retire in the coming years, Social Security is expected to run annual deficits beginning in 2020 for the foreseeable future. According to the most recent projections, the Social Security trust funds will be completely depleted by 2034, after which point, the incoming tax revenue will only be sufficient to cover about three-fourths of promised benefits. Is Social Security's financial state a cause for concern? Yes. Is it bad enough that you should take your Social Security benefit early if you don't really want to? No. ","

YouTube said the policy has been in the works since November and is designed to block channels that steal others’ content for revenue. The company has long allowed all video creators to apply to run ads on their videos, and many typically were approved. The open policy enabled advertisers to reach users on little-visited corners of the internet, while amateur video creators could earn a few dollars by posting their projects on YouTube. In some cases, YouTube has also given rise to full-fledged stars who can earn seven-figure salaries each year.

Though Mobileye dominates the ADAS market, whose value is forecast to cross $40 billion by 2021, Intel bought it not for that part of its business, but for its resolve to spearhead the driverless-car revolution. In doing so, and even if it paid too much as some suspect, the Santa Clara-based chipmaker’s move constitutes a financial vote of confidence in assessments that the driverless car has ceased to be a matter of whether, and become a matter of when. Mobileye minority-share holder Shmuel Harlap’s prophecy that “in two decades it will be illegal to drive” may be overly optimistic, but it is clear by now that the age of human driving has peaked and its twilight is steadily approaching. Driverless cars will drastically reduce accidents because they will replace reckless drivers, they will never speed, and they will be equipped to see and hear better than any of us. As previously explained here, this social gospel will be partly offset by massive layoffs, first in the auto-repair industry and then also in auto production, because a car’s ability to drive independently between a couple’s workplaces will make them shed their second car, and the subsequent emergence of an autonomous cab might make many shed the first car as well. Mankind, in short, is about to demand fewer cars and the repercussions will surface on multiple plains. Microeconomically, the decline in accidents will raise households’ available income, as insurance rates will fall. Macroeconomically, the decline in automotive demand will potentially hurt economies such as Turkey’s and Poland’s, where car production has in recent years become a dominant source of income, already totaling some 12% of exports in each. All these will dwarf compared with what the autonomous car will do in the commodity markets. An average car carries more than 50 pounds of copper while the automotive industry swallows 12% of global steel output and tires gobble 65% of global rubber output. Such figures will decline in tandem with shrinking demand for cars, and down with them will go the prices of these and many other commodities, from aluminum to glass. Yet the automotive revolution’s deepest market impact will be in the energy sector, where the autonomous car’s impact will be harsher than anything oil-reliant economies have so far endured. Oil producers were challenged four times since 1973, when they hiked within one autumn a barrel’s price from $3 to $10. First, the world began conserving power, making smaller cars and turning off lights in office buildings, and then it intensified prospecting, soon finding vast deposits in the North Sea, all of which ultimately pushed down a barrel’s price

                                   from $35 in 1980 to $10 in 1986. Oil’s next setback came when wind, sun and water were harnessed as alternative energies, and its latest blow came with fracking, which triggered the great slide that followed summer 2014, when a barrel of Brent crude sold for more than $100 before tumbling to $38 by winter 2016. The common denominator among all these factors is that they either expanded supply or regimented demand, but they did not affect the actual need for oil. The driverless car will. Rather than make people drive smaller cars or more efficient engines, and rather than pour more oil into gas stations, it will simply take millions of cars off the highways by fomenting a ride-sharing culture, as indicated by Ford’s recent announcement  that it is developing a fleet of driverless cars for shared rides. In addition, the loss of concern for accidents will allow cars to be lighter, and therefore burn less gas, as will the disappearance of speeding, sudden acceleration, and parking-searches. Silicon Valley’s great effort to end human driving is therefore the biggest challenge the oil industry has faced since its inception in the 19th century. Saudi Arabia, the world’s most oil-dependent large economy, knows all this, and is therefore seeking a post-oil future through its Vision2030 program. Even so, and as part of that blueprint, the kingdom is now preparing the mother of all IPOs next year by issuing 5% of its oil company Aramco’s shares. Yet Riyadh’s announcement Monday that it is slashing Aramco’s tax rate from 85% to 50% is a telling display of its fear that oil’s smell nowadays can no longer be trusted to dizzy investors; certainly not as much a driverless car.

Nancy Collamer,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Mar 31, 2017 9:53 a.m. ET Attract more professional opportunities By This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org. By now, you undoubtedly know that a strong LinkedIn profile is critical for your career. LinkedIn, the business and employment-oriented social networking service, is where 94% of recruiters search for job candidates. It also serves as the online home of your professional brand. But with over 470 million LinkedIn users, how do you craft a profile that stands out? For answers to that question, I recently attended a talk by Sandra Long, a consultant and author of the new book, “LinkedIn for Personal Branding: The Ultimate Guide.” Long believes that thanks to the robust capabilities of LinkedIn, building a powerful online brand is easier than ever. In the old days, we referred to our brand as our “reputation” and most of our reputation was built face-to-face. But these days, first impressions are more likely to be formed online and LinkedIn is often the first place people “meet” you. Here are seven key strategies culled from Long’s book and presentation to help you attract more professional opportunities online: (For excellent examples of the strategies, check out Long’s LinkedIn profile.) 1. Invest in getting a professional photo taken. According to a 2016 LinkedIn survey, your profile is 21 times more likely to be viewed if you have a LinkedIn photo. That’s why Long says: “If you can afford a professional photographer, it is usually the best investment you can make in your personal brand and self confidence.” 2. Craft a more strategic headline. Your LinkedIn headline is important for two reasons: It creates the first impression of you and the keywords you select for it are the words that help recruiters find you. To craft a strong headline: 3. Ask for LinkedIn Recommendations. Getting them from your LinkedIn network, as well as Featured Skills/Endorsements (that’s No. 4), lets others sing your praises and keeps you from appearing boastful. For optimal results, ask for a recommendation immediately after the successful completion of a project or when you receive an important accolade or award. Make your request in person or by phone, if possible. It’s more personal than email and gives you an opportunity to talk about specifics for the recommendation. 4. Manage your Featured Skills and Endorsements. You know those annoying messages that pop up on LinkedIn asking if you’d like to endorse your contacts for a variety of skills? I’ve always considered that feature worthless. After all, I’ve had people endorse me for public speaking who’ve never heard me speak and received endorsements for career coaching from people I’ve never met. But thanks to Long, I’ve changed my tune. According to a 2016 LinkedIn study, users who display five or more skills are messaged 31 times more and viewed 17 times more than those who do not! So as meaningless as Endorsements seem, they do attract more eyeballs to your page. Fortunately, LinkedIn makes it easy to edit, rearrange and manage your endorsements. To manage them, move your cursor over the Me icon at the top of your home page, click View Profile, scroll down to the Featured Skills & Endorsements section and click on any of your skills to rearrange them so your strongest skills are at the top. You can also block any endorsements you want to hide. 5. Incorporate photos and video. When it comes to building a powerful LinkedIn profile, remember the adage: A picture is worth a thousand words. You can now easily post photos and videos to your LinkedIn profile under the Experience, Education or Summary sections. You can also use images in the background banner of your personal profile, where you can feature a logo, photo or image that colorfully enhances your brand. For example, a Realtor might display a photo of the city skyline or an executive might use a photo of a conference she recently organized. Remember, it’s far more effective to post a speaking clip that demonstrates how engaging you are than to simply state, “I am a strong public speaker.” 6. Show off your expertise with SlideShare.

Shares debuted in trading on March 2 at $24 each after the company priced its initial batch of shares at $17. The stock on March 2 traded up as much as 53% above its IPO price, hitting an intraday high of $26.05. Shares closed on March 31 at $22.53. Snapchat users post and share photos and videos on the app that can disappear after a set amount of time. The app—developed by Stanford University students, two of whom are still executives at Snap—had 158 million daily active users as of December 2016. But sentiment from investors has been largely negative due to Snap’s expensive valuation compared with its revenue, analysts said. The app launched in 2011, but generated no revenue until 2015. The first hardware offering from the company—Snapchat Spectacles, which are sunglasses that have a small camera installed and can upload video to the app—launched last year.

The regulator also ordered Wells to pay the unidentified banker $5.4 million in damages. “It was alleged that this is what he reported to his supervisor, something he believed was going on, and as a result of reporting it, he was retaliated against,” Goto said. The case isn’t related to other whistleblower complaints and class-actions lawsuits that have sprung up after it was revealed last year that Wells Fargo engaged in a years-long scam to open up millions of fake accounts and credit cards in people’s names in order to boost sales numbers. That scandal led directly to the ousting last October of then-Chief Executive John Stumpf. Wells Fargo has 30 days to appeal Labor’s ruling. It indicated it is considering fighting the decision. “We take seriously the concerns of current and former team members,” Vince Scanlon, a bank spokesman, said in a statement. Read:  Wells Fargo agrees to $110 million settlement of class-action suit “This decision is a preliminary order and to date there has been no hearing on the merits of this case,” Scanlon said. “We disagree with the findings and will be requesting a full hearing of the matter.” The case is the OSHA’s largest-ever individual award for a person who claimed he was retaliated against, in part because his pay was already so high, Goto said.

Steven Kutz,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Apr 1, 2017 12:01 p.m. ET The 31-year-old has focused on saving his money throughout his career By National Football League star Brandon Flowers is so serious about saving money that he waited until he amassed almost 10 years of salary before buying his first house. “I’ve always just saved my money. I just now bought my first house. I’ll have it for a long time. It’ll be my retirement house,” Flowers told MarketWatch. He spoke while attending the NFL’s third annual Personal Finance Camp, which aims to educate players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing. The 31-year-old Flowers was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2008 and was a Pro Bowl cornerback for them in 2013. He played for the San Diego Chargers from 2014 through 2016, and is currently a free agent. He has made $50 million in his career and made over $10 million a year in both 2011 and 2015. Held in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., from March 27 to 30, the Personal Finance Camp is run by NFL Player Engagement, the University of Miami School of Business Administration and brokerage firm TD Ameritrade. This year it was attended by over 30 players and their significant others. Some of the other players in attendance were Eric Berry, Josh Martin and DeAndre Washington. Sessions included “Understanding and optimizing your NFL player benefits,” “Principles of stock investing,” a session on taxes, one called “Creating a diversified portfolio,” as well as a player panel that included current and former players and some players’ spouses. Asked why he attended the camp, Flowers said, “I wanted to change the course within my family. I’m not just here for myself, but to teach my dad, mom, sister and kids.” He said his parents worked hard so he could have more opportunities. “My dad always worked a lot of overtime to make sure I could live a life he would want me to live. I grew up in the inner city. He sacrificed. He would stay with an aunt to save money just so we could take a vacation and he could show me more,” Flowers said. He added that his mom worked two jobs and gave up a lot so he could have a better life, too. He appreciates what they did for him, but said that since they lived paycheck to paycheck, “they can’t teach me how to save and develop generational wealth.” Also see: Meet the awesome NFL mom determined to stop her son’s finances from being sacked That’s why he’s learning all he can now. “I’ve always been scared to spend money. Whatever my financial advisers told me, I did it. I didn’t question it.” Fortunately he didn’t have anyone giving him bad advice or taking advantage of him, as has happened to some other professional athletes over the years. Also see: Financial advice from an NFL player whose mom demanded he give her $1 million “I was lucky to have a good agent. He always makes sure I look at every bank statement, every transaction on my credit card statement. I’ve had good people in my corner from the jump,” he said. “A lot of guys in NFL don’t pay attention to their money, even if they don’t spend too much.” Flowers said his favorite session at the Personal Finance Camp was the one on generational wealth. And he plans to return to the Personal Finance Camp next year. “It’s a great program,” he said. “You think you know enough until you learn a little bit more. I’m upset with myself for not coming before, but it’s never too late to start.” ",NFL star Brandon Flowers has made $50 million and only just bought his first house - MarketWatch
Rachel Koning Beals,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Apr 1, 2017 1:23 p.m. ET Income inequality, easy lending from bank rivals are problems, UBS strategists stress By Subprime auto-loan default rates match those seen just before the 2007-2009 recession. It’s a red flag that’s been flapping for some time for analysts worried it could pose risks to the broader credit market, bank health and, ultimately, the consumer-driven economy. Those concerns have been offset, in part, by other considerations: strength in loans to higher-credit individuals and a growing economy’s potential to buffer a strained lending market for the lowest-rated, or subprime, borrowers. Plus, some temporary factors are at work, such as a delay in personal tax refunds that could crimp consumers’ ability to make their car payments on time, but only for a short time. UBS analysts Matthew Mish and Stephan Caprio, in a Thursday note, don’t see subprime auto loans as an immediate threat to financial stability, but they see plenty of reasons for concern. Namely, the pay gap between low- and moderate-income workers and their higher-income counterparts is only widening while the credit available to those bringing home thinner paychecks remains abundant. New York Federal Reserve researchers, in December, counted up some 6 million Americans delinquent with car payments, and predicted that number would only worsen. Concerns were elevated in part by the latest reading for the National Automobile Dealers Association used-vehicle price index, down 8% year over year through February. Financed used-car ownership is more common among lower-credit-rated drivers. Borrowers are also taking out longer loans, in fact the longest on record, Experian reported. Read: 5 reasons to say no to 72- and 84-month auto loans Analysts, including the authors of the UBS note, have stressed the impact on the auto-lending market from an increased proportion of “deep-subprime” borrowers, as well as comparatively lax underwriting practices across nonbank lenders that include auto finance companies, captive finance firms (a company subsidiary meant to provide financing to customers buying the parent company’s product) and credit unions and thrifts. Read: Auto-loan market stuck on risky ‘trade-in treadmill,’ says Moody’s Credit-rating firms and market participants have been scrambling to explain subprime default rates for recent vintages (loans made in 2015, 2016) that have now reached levels consistent with those originated just before the 2007-09 recession (see graphic below). Mish and Caprio don’t take the nonbank involvement lightly, especially within the context of the overall health of the car-loan market. They note that a net 23% of U.S. banks forecast that U.S. consumer loan delinquencies (of which a significant share is auto related) would increase in 2017, according to the latest Fed Senior Loan Officer Survey. “This would be the highest share of banks since 2007. Given that banks have focused their lending activities on prime borrowers [those with stronger credit scores], any worsening in higher-quality customers bodes poorly for subprime loans originated by non-banks,” Mish and Caprio wrote. Banks are responding accordingly to worsening credit conditions that include falling car prices and dwindling loan-to-value (how much is still owed on the car compared with its resale value), Fitch Ratings has noted. But banks’ caution is only costing them more lost customers to captive auto finance companies and credit unions. Notably, subprime auto loans are a much smaller slice of overall subprime lending than mortgages (one of the leading culprits in the financial crisis). Auto loans make up $179 billion of the over $1.2 trillion subprime debt total. It’s also easier to unload cars than houses. These factors have so far limited the fear of economic contagion. Don’t miss: Subprime car loans aren’t subprime mortgages yet still worry Jamie Dimon and, now, John Oliver “We do not believe this implies a pending downturn…but it is yet another data-point that investors should not overlook,” the UBS analysts said in their note. “One can add consumer delinquency trends to the sharp slowdown in bank and nonbank corporate borrowing as evidence that a growth rebound may be weaker than expected.” Analysts from firms such as Wells Fargo & Co.

Weakening conditions are showing up in the specialized bond market that takes on these bundled and repackaged loans. Sixty-day delinquencies for bonds backed by deep subprime loans have risen 3 percentage points since 2012, compared with just 0.89 percentage points on all other subprime auto securities, Morgan Stanley’s Vishwanath Tirupattur, James Egan and Jeen Ng said in a research report dated March 24. “Auto loan fundamental performance, especially within ABS pools, continues to deteriorate,” the analysts said. The biggest risk, of course, lies in what’s not known, especially if the economy faces an unexpected test in the short term. “If subprime auto loan defaults are already nearing prior crisis levels, there are important questions to entertain ahead,” UBS’s Mish and Caprio emphasized. “What will they look like in a recessionary environment? What will recovery rates on defaulted auto loans be, considering they are already abnormally low? And finally, if non-banks have intermediated most of the lower quality consumer loans this cycle, will their business models, their sources of funding, and by extension their credit intermediation activities, prove resilient through a proper credit cycle?” Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fast-food chain Burger King said on Wednesday it will start televising a commercial for its signature Whopper sandwich that is designed to activate Google voice-controlled devices, raising questions about whether marketing tactics have become too invasive. The 15-second ad starts with a Burger King employee holding up the sandwich saying, “You’re watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich. But I’ve got an idea. OK, Google, what is the Whopper burger?” If a viewer has the Google Home assistant or an Android phone with voice search enabled within listening range of the TV, that last phrase - “Hello Google, what is the Whopper burger?” - is intended to trigger the device to search for Whopper on Google and read out the finding from Wikipedia. “Burger King saw an opportunity to do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices,” said a Burger King representative. Google declined to comment and Wikipedia was not available for comment. The ad, which became available on YouTube on Wednesday, will run nationally during prime-time on networks such as Spike, Comedy Central, MTV, E! and Bravo, and also on late-night shows starring Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon. Some media outlets, including CNN Money, reported that Google Home stopped responding to the commercial shortly after the ad became available on YouTube. ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"The video streaming service also said once a video channel crosses the threshold, it would review the content to see if it qualifies for the placement of ads. (bit.ly/2o7vqI2) “By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators,” Ariel Bardin, YouTube’s vice president of product management, said in a blog post. YouTube has come under intense scrutiny for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video streaming service. The company vowed an overhaul of its practices last month, saying it has started an extensive review of its advertising policies. While brands have demanded greater control over the videos where their ads appear, the step taken by YouTube this week is likely too small to allay those concerns, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “Most of these (extremist) videos are going to get more viewers than that anyway,” Dawson said of the 10,000-view threshold set by YouTube. “They’re popular among the particular audience that they are targeting.” YouTube also said on Thursday that in a few weeks it would add a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program, which lets creators monetize content on YouTube in many ways, including advertisements, paid subscriptions and merchandise. Any revenue earned on channels with under 10,000 views up until Thursday will not be impacted, YouTube said. As it grapples with the advertiser revolt, YouTube must walk a fine line between giving advertisers more control and alienating the creators who drive the site’s popularity, analysts say. While some fear small creators could be hurt by restrictions, the 10,000-view threshold is so low that it will not hamper any people who make a living from their channels, said Jonathan Katz, an entertainment lawyer who represents YouTube artists. Creators understand that YouTube must protect its image to retain the ad dollars they depend on, he said. “As frustrated as (creators) might be with the YouTube ecosystem at times, they understand that their fates are tied,” he said.

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Thursday it suspended 30,000 accounts in France as the social network giant steps up efforts to stop the spread of fake news, misinformation and spam. The move, which comes 10 days before the first round of a hotly contested French presidential election, is among the most aggressive yet by Facebook to move against accounts that violate its terms of service, rather than simply respond to complaints. Facebook is under intense pressure in Europe as governments across the continent threaten new laws and fines unless the company moves quickly to remove extremist propaganda or other content that violates local laws. (reut.rs/2oBwHEO). The pressure on social media sites including Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Facebook has intensified in the run-up to the elections in France and Germany. Facebook already has a program in France to use outside fact-checkers to combat fake news in users’ feeds. Also on Thursday, Facebook took out full-page ads in Germany’s best-selling newspapers to educate readers on how to spot fake news. U.S. intelligence agencies have determined that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. election last year in order to help Donald Trump win the presidency. Officials say a similar campaign is under way in Europe to promote right-wing, nationalist parties and undermine the European Union. In a blog post, Facebook said it was acting against 30,000 fake accounts in France. It said its priority was to remove suspect accounts with high volumes of posting activity and the biggest audiences. Two people familiar with Facebook’s process said the company had strengthened its formula for detecting deceptive accounts being run by automated means. As an example, the new process considers accounts that have smaller circles of friends and that therefore had been less of a priority previously. A key motivator was the need to get tougher on misinformation ahead of the French elections, the people said, although the move also targets accounts that generated spam for financial gain. “We’ve made improvements to recognize these inauthentic accounts more easily by identifying patterns of activity — without assessing the content itself,” Shabnam Shaik, a Facebook security team manager, wrote in an official blog post. The company is using automated pattern-recognition to identify repeated posting of the same content and increases in messaging. Thursday’s action follows other moves by Facebook to make it easier for users to report potential fraud and hoaxes. ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"(Reuters) - In 2015, the Florida Supreme Court directed the Florida Bar to solve a particular problem with for-profit lawyer referral services that purport to help consumers find law firms. A special Bar committee that spent more than a year investigating dozens of Florida referral services had reported in 2012 on all kinds of ethical pitfalls: improper solicitation of clients, undisclosed conflicts of interest, even unlicensed practice of law. But many of the referral services were beyond the reach of the bar association because they were run by non-lawyers. After some give-and-take with the Bar, the state Supreme Court decided the most effective solution was to prohibit Florida lawyers from accepting referrals from any service not owned by a member of the Florida Bar. Its 2015 order instructed the Florida Bar to amend its rules to include that restriction. Instead, as the Florida Supreme Court heard in oral arguments last week, the Florida Bar decided the real problem was not just lawyer referral services but the more recent proliferation of online legal directories and client matching services. Rather than adopt the rule change the Supreme Court directed, the Florida Bar proposed amending its regulations to impose registration and screening requirements on a broad array of legal marketing outfits, including, according to the Bar’s description, “a for-profit lawyer referral service, a group or pooled advertising program with a common telephone number or URL, a lawyer directory, an internet ‘matching’ site, or a tips or leads service, among others.” The Bar's proposal was controversial even before it was approved by the Board of Governors in July 2016 and, based on arguments at the state Supreme Court, continues to raise a lot of questions about exactly which legal marketers are covered by the rules and what they have to do to comply. Chief among the proposed rules’ opponents is the online service Avvo, which described itself in a brief to the Florida Supreme Court as “the web's largest and most heavily-trafficked legal resource,” with more than 8 million visits a month. According to Avvo, both in its brief and in arguments to the Florida justices by chief legal officer Josh King, the Florida Bar rule changes will end up hurting consumers. Nationwide outfits, Avvo said, aren’t going to want to put in the effort to come up with the extensive due diligence the Florida Bar is asking for. Florida lawyers aren’t going to want to use the services of non-compliant directories or advertising shops. The result, according to Avvo, will be a chill on information about legitimate legal services for Florida consumers. Even a broad-based marketing provider like Google AdWords could be swept up in the Bar’s new rules, Avvo said. The proposed rules – which are the first state bar attempt to regulate Avvo – may violate the First Amendment, Avvo said, and will certainly put “an exponentially larger burden of monitoring and compliance” on the Bar. “We know that the Bar is motivated by a desire to look out for the best interests of Florida consumers,” Avvo said in its brief. “However, in its attempt to ‘level the playing field’ by applying a uniform set of rules to lawyer referral services and all other mediums in which attorneys might market and sell their services, the Bar has created regulations that are over-extensive, under-targeted and out of step with the needs of consumers and clients.” The Florida justices at last week’s hearing seemed hazy on exactly what Avvo does and whether some of its services could be considered the sort of fee-sharing it wants to restrict. But the justices were also puzzled about why the Florida Bar has reached so broadly in response to the court’s narrow instruction. (Carl Schwait of Upchurch Watson White & Max, who led arguments for the Bar, explained that the group didn’t think the Supreme Court’s order simply to restrict referral services owned by non-lawyers would actually do enough to protect consumers and might run into First Amendment problems.) In an interview, Avvo legal chief King said he expects the Florida justices to refuse to adopt the Bar’s proposed rules, which he said are fatally vague. It’s not clear, for example, whether Avvo would be expected to provide a list of its advertisers to the Florida Bar or a list of every Florida lawyer in its directory, which includes all members of the Florida Bar. The proposed rule also seems to call for the Bar’s advertising committee to clear ads. “Does that mean every iteration of our website?” King said. “There’s a hornet’s nest of problems.” It’s entirely possible, however, that the state Supreme Court will agree with the Florida Bar that online marketing’s impact on consumers of legal services needs more attention, King said. He told me he wouldn’t be surprised if the justices called for a commission to dig into the issue. “That’s a dialogue we are happy to have,” he said. I don’t think there can possibly be too much transparency in legal marketing. I’ve heard way too many stories about consumers who had no idea what they were getting into when they responded to an ad on television or the Internet. On the other hand, there’s plenty of evidence that prospective clients would never receive the legal help they need were it not for lawyers exercising their free speech right to market their services. I’m glad the Florida Supreme Court is trying so hard to find the right regulatory balance. I left a message for Schwait, who represented the Florida Bar at last week’s Supreme Court arguments, but didn’t hear back. ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in an interview with Reuters that the number of ad buyers was an important milepost, showing that Facebook has room to grow despite its massive scale. The company said in September that it had 4 million advertisers, and in March 2016 that it had 3 million. The world’s largest social network, which is free to users, has 1.9 billion people on it. Much of that spending is by big brand advertisers, but to attract small firms, Facebook pitches a set of tools such as audience targeting, a mobile design studio and online courses available so far in 10 languages. The latest changes include a “one click” option in Facebook’s ads manager to reinstate high-performing ads, and a desktop tool to manage customer messages, the company said. “Small businesses provide such important products and services, but they also are a huge engine of job growth in a world where job growth is increasingly uncertain and something people really worry about,” Sandberg said. Among the 5 million advertisers, the biggest industries are e-commerce, entertainment/media and retail, the company said. Some 75 percent of them are outside the United States, and its fastest-growing markets are India, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, the company said. Nearly 50 percent of the advertisers create ads on mobile devices, reflecting the increasing importance of smartphone-based usage to Facebook’s future. More than 90 percent of Facebook’s users access the network through mobile devices, and mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of ad revenue, the company said in February. ","

Udacity was co-founded by Sebastian Thrun, who was also the co-founder of the Google X research lab that led development of Google’s self-driving car. The new company, dubbed Voyage Auto, will not build its own cars but retrofit existing vehicles. “I’m starting a new thing with great friends called Voyage Auto,” Chief Executive Oliver Cameron said on his LinkedIn page. “We’re deploying autonomous taxis to real users very, very soon.” Cameron is a former VP engineering and product at Udacity. He said on his LinkedIn page that “Voyage is building an extremely cheap and safe autonomous taxi service”. Voyage will operate independently from Udacity, which will hold an undisclosed stake in the company. Udacity is worth more than $1 billion. It is betting that its focus on vocational courses for professionals, as well as its work for global companies such as Google, will help it to stand out in the fast-growing online education industry. Udacity has an education program for developers of self-driving cars. It has been followed by more than 6,600 students worldwide, the company said in a statement. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nvidia and Delphi are among the companies that have hired students from the program. The LinkedIn page of Voyage Auto showed it had 4 employees. Business Insider reported first about Voyage Auto. It said Voyage would not be using any of the technology built by Udacity’s students, citing Chief Marketing Officer Shernaz Daver. ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Washington has billed Vice President Mike Pence’s visit to Indonesia next week as a booster for the Strategic Partnership between the world’s second- and third-largest democracies, but a raft of bilateral tensions could sap the goodwill from his trip. Pence’s counterpart in the world’s most populous Muslim country has voiced worries about U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, which critics say is biased against Muslims, and about his “America First” mantra on trade and investment. “We in Indonesia never change. The change is there. That’s why we’re asking them now, ‘what is your policy now on the economy, on democracy, now that Trump is in power?’,” Vice President Jusuf Kalla told Reuters on March 31. “What does it mean, ‘America first’? I can say, too, ‘Indonesia first’ if you say ‘America first’.” Indonesia is one of 16 countries against which the United States runs a trade deficit that will be investigated by the Trump administration for possible trade abuses. Trump’s combative approach will not sit easily with Indonesia, where economic nationalism and protectionist tendencies have flourished since a slump in commodity prices in recent years slammed the brakes on economic growth. “Unfortunately I do see a hardening of attitudes on our side,” said a senior Indonesian government official, who declined to be named. “And it’s of particular concern because we’re on that list of 16 countries ... that are going to be investigated.” The official said a tougher stand by Indonesian authorities had also contributed to a series of disputes with U.S. companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc and financial services giant JP Morgan Chase & Co. A SERIES OF FACE-OFFS Indonesia has dueled with Google over back taxes and fines running into hundreds of millions of dollars, and with Freeport in a contract row that has crippled operations at the world’s second-largest copper mine, Grasberg. It also dropped JP Morgan as a primary bond dealer after the bank’s research analysts issued a negative report on the country in November. “It’s a very unfortunate series of issues which all happen to be American,” said the official, who expects them to come up in private during Pence’s visit. Indonesia is the third stop on an April 15-25 tour that includes South Korea, Japan and Australia. Google declined to comment for this report, and JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment. Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said: “This visit is happening entirely independent of our current negotiations with the government of Indonesia.” However, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, Freeport’s third-biggest shareholder and now a special adviser to Trump, has described Jakarta’s tactics over the mining contract as “disingenuous and insulting”, according to the New York Times. Another potential irritant is biodiesel. The U.S. National Biodiesel Board (NBB), a producer group, has petitioned the U.S. government to impose anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from Indonesia and Argentina, claiming they have flooded the U.S. market. “This is one of the issues that we have asked the trade ministry to bring to the meeting (with Pence),” Paulus Tjakrawan, a director at the Indonesia Biofuel Producers Association, told Reuters. “Our hope is for the government to be firm ... Otherwise we will be taken advantage of,” he said. “Not to act like thugs but, for example, if they put barriers to our exports, why not stop importing some of their goods?” Despite the strains, the government official said Indonesia would be careful to start its relationship with the Trump administration on the right foot. Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s approach to foreign policy has been led more by economic interests than geopolitical considerations: he has pursued increased trade and investment from China but keeps a diplomatic distance from Beijing and established a strategic partnership with Washington under former President Barack Obama. U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, Joseph R. Donovan Jr, said in a statement last week that Pence’s visit reflected a continued commitment to that partnership, would deepen economic engagement and boost regional security cooperation. “The U.S. embassy here certainly is going to great lengths to make the visit a success,” said the Indonesian official. “My impression is he’s (Pence) not going to ruffle feathers in public, he’s not going to cause a ruckus.” ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"HERZOGENAURACH, Germany/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Adidas launched a new sneaker on Friday with a 3D-printed sole that it plans to mass-produce next year, part of a broader push by the German sportswear firm to react faster to changing fashions and create more customized products. Adidas already lets people customize the color and pattern of shoes ordered online but new 3D printing methods will make small production runs, limited edition shoes and even soles designed to fit an individual’s weight and gait economical. Rivals Nike, Under Armour and New Balance  have also been experimenting with 3D printing but have so far only used the technique to make prototypes, soles tailored for sponsored athletes and a handful of high-priced novelty shoes. That’s because traditional 3D printers are slower, more expensive and often create an inferior product than the injection moulds for plastic that are currently used to produce hundreds of millions of shoes each year, mostly in Asia. However, Adidas says its new partnership with Silicon Valley start-up Carbon allows it to overcome many of those difficulties to produce a sole that can rival one made by an injection mould, and at a speed and price that allow for mass production. “This is a milestone not only for us as a company but also for the industry,” said Gerd Manz, Adidas head of technology innovation, announcing the launch of its new “Futurecraft 4D” shoe. “We’ve cracked some of the boundaries.” Carbon, financed by venture firms such as Sequoia Capital as well as funds set up by General Electric and Alphabet’s Google, has pioneered a technique that prints with light-sensitive polymer resin that is then baked for strength. Standard 3D printers build up products with layers of plastic powder, a method used by Hewlett Packard which is working with Nike and says its newest machines work 10 times faster and at half the cost than earlier models. Adidas hopes to sell 5,000 pairs of its “Futurecraft 4D” this year, and 100,000 next year as Carbon cuts the time it takes to print a sole from the current hour and a half to as low as 20 minutes per sole. The shoes will sell at an unspecified premium price but Adidas plans to lower the cost as the technology develops. Late last year Adidas sold a few hundred pairs of running shoes with soles made by regular 3D printing for $333 but they were relatively rigid and heavy and took 10 hours to print. Carbon’s technology will allow Adidas to make small batches of shoes far more quickly. Small production runs were not economical before as the metal moulds for most soles need to be used 10,000 times to pay for themselves, and they take four to six weeks to cast and grind. “What you can do is introduce more types of products without a cost penalty,” said Terry Wohlers, head of Wohlers Associates, a U.S. consultancy specializing in 3D printing. “With this technology, you can produce one or a few inexpensively.” Wohlers expects the 3D printing industry to more than quadruple sales to $26 billion by 2022, driven mostly by the automotive, medical, dental and jewelry sectors. Adidas initially plans batches of shoes tailored to specific sports or cities but hopes consumers will eventually be measured and tested in store to design perfectly-fitting shoes tweaked for an individual’s gait, weight and type of sport. “Individualization will come, but you’ve got to learn to walk before you run,” Manz said, citing a survey that shows 80 percent of consumers want to be part of the design process. Adidas last month experimented with a pop-up store where customers could design a custom-fitted sweater and have it knitted in the store. 3D printing will also help cut the time it takes to get new designs to stores from the 12 to 18 months it usually takes for sneakers. To that end, Adidas is also opening factories mainly operated by robots in Germany and the United States. ","

(GOOG) subsidiary Google is stealing a march on the likes of Intel Corporation (INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA). The Mountain View, California-based company recently released its first machine learning chip – called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) – that performs ""computationally intensive"" tasks, such as voice search and image processing, and its performance beats that of chips released by Intel and Nvidia by as much as 15 times to 30 times. According to a post on Google's site, TPUs power search as well as vision models for several products, such as Image Search and Google Photos. In addition, TPUs ""were instrumental in Google DeepMind's victory over Lee Sedol, the first instance of a computer defeating a world champion in the ancient game of Go."" (See also: Google's Growing Cloud Ambitions.) The business implication of this development is that Google can save costs through significantly reducing its data center footprint by using the chips in its machines. As artificial intelligence applications become commonplace, this development could also shift business away from manufacturers of chips for data centers and set new benchmarks for performance. In a paper that will be presented in June, Google outlined its benchmarking tests conducted against Intel's Haswell microprocessor and Nvidia’s K80, which the company bills as the world's fastest GPU (chips used in gaming platforms) accelerator. Google measured the number of operations performed per second by its chip versus those from the other two companies. It found that the TPU was 14.5 times as fast as the Intel processor and 13.2 times as fast as Nvidia's chip. Norman P. Jouppi, who led more than 70 engineers on the project, said Google wanted to attract the best talent by making its achievements publicly known. Google's TPU chips also provide it with a leg up in its cloud business. The company is a distant third behind Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) in the cloud sweepstakes. (See also: Amazon Ramps Up Cloud Position as Rivals Emerge.) While not much is known about the nuts and bolts of Amazon's data centers, Microsoft uses Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips, made by Intel's Altera business, to make its data centers faster. Google's Tensor chips could also cut down costs for its data centers. In its paper, the company wrote that its TPU provides 17 to 34 times better performance per watt compared with Intel's chips and 25 to 29 times better performance compared with Nvidia's chips. In effect, this means that a TPU chip can do more with less. Potentially, this could reduce the number of chips required in server farms, thereby reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO). (See also: Two Announcements From Google's Cloud Conference.)

Joana Allamani,04132017,Investopedia,04062017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs American rapper and musician Jay Z has removed most of his music from the streaming service Spotify, leaving behind only a few early albums and collaborations with other artists. Among the remaining Jay Z albums on Spotify are his 1997 records In My Lifetime Vol.1 and Reasonable Doubt, as well as 1998’s Vol. 2 Hard Knock Life. Jay Z has also left behind Collision Course, the 2004 album which he recorded with the band Linkin Park, and a few singles he recorded with Kanye West. What could explain this decision? Jay Z co-owns Tidal, a music streaming service that is in competition with Spotify, which has more of a focus on artist exclusives. Jay Z purchased Tidal in 2015 for $56 million with a promise to customers to be a platform with superior sound quality and better compensations for all artists who used it to host their music. Jay Z has also been a vocal critic of tech companies over the issue of compensating artists; in 2015 at an event in New York he had targeted Google, Spotify and Apple, saying they paid artists much less than what they deserved. This could explain his move from Spotify, a company he views as not being artist friendly. It is also worth noting that both Spotify and Apple music are still much larger Tidal. Indeed, they are the industry leaders. Spotify has about 100 million listeners, and 50 million paid subscribers while Apple Music has 20 million subscribers. In contrast, Tidal has less than 3 million. In fact, Tidal has been reported to inflate its subscriber numbers – in September 2015, the same month that Jay Z claimed Tidal had reached a million users, the Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv said it received internal reports from the company showing that it only had 350,000 subscribers. In March last year, Tidal claimed it had 3 million subscribers, while its monthly report to music labels stated it had only 1.2 million activated accounts and 850,000  subscribers. Tidal had also acknowledged that in the past these subscriber numbers had been inflated, and put the blame on past owners. Tidal’s subscriber numbers reached a peak after Beyoncé released Lemonade on the service in April 2016, after which they began to decline, reaching 1.1 million paying customers in October. Thus, this move could be part of a strategy to draw more customers to Tidal. Fortune reports that in response to this, Apple Music has started to offer exclusives of its own, including from Frank Ocean. Spotify in turn has argued that this fragmentation of content is harmful for the experience of music fans, and to the music industry. The Rolling Stones reported last October, that this trend and business of exclusives are/is starting to reshape the music industry, that fans could expect to see artist exclusives continue for the near future, and that music listeners could get used to the idea of having multiple music streaming subscriptions, since one may not have all of the music they want to listen to.

Ltd’s (SSNLF) latest Galaxy Phone 8. The phone, which was released to critical acclaim last week, can be unlocked using face recognition technology. (See also: Samsung's All-Important Galaxy 8 Garners Positive Reviews). While that feature may save time and effort for consumers, it could also be used by lawmakers to gain evidence without an express consent from suspects in a case. This is because face recognition technology is not covered as “testimonial evidence” under the Fifth Amendment. (See also: Could Facebook And Google Survive A Face Recognition Lawsuit?). Manually-entered passwords are considered testimonial evidence because passcodes or passwords are unique and can only be obtained with a suspect's permission. Revealing pass codes or passwords can also be considered a form of self-incrimination because they provide pathways to documents or assortment forms of evidence. Biometrics, however, falls into a gray area because it does not require thought. Instead it simply requires a face scan, which can be obtained without the suspect’s permission or, even, by holding up a photograph of the said person to the smartphone. In an interview with tech publication The Verge, Jeffrey Welty, a law professor from UNC - Chapel Hill, said that the law for biometric scanning would be the same as for Touch IDs, which require fingerprint scanning. A face scan is not a testimonial act, according to him, “because it doesn’t require the suspect to provide any information that is inside his or her mind.” A precedent for the latter was set back in 2014, when a judge allowed police to force a suspect to unlock his smartphone using Touch ID. There is a catch to the situation, however. Lawmakers must move fast to unlock phones using fingerprint scans because there is only a 48-hour window during which Touch IDs can be used to unlock phones. Subsequently, pincodes are required to unlock smartphones and suspects can invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to cooperate. Lawmakers can also compel you to unlock your smartphone or any other device, if its contents are a “foregone conclusion”. In other words, the police already know about the contents of your device before they ask you to unlock it. The Verge raises the specter of customs officials using face scans to unlock phones for prospective immigrants entering the country. Welty, the professor from Chapel Hill, recommends passwords over Touch ID. “Bottom line, if you are concerned about whether law enforcement can compel access to your device, a password or passcode is much better than Touch ID or facial recognition, but it isn’t ironclad,” he is quoted as saying in The Verge.

(For more, see: Big Data.) Whispers of the IPO started in 2014 when Intel funneled $740 million into the Palo Alto, California-based company, which produces services and software to help clients analyze digital information from networked devices. Cloudera was started in 2008 by engineers from Facebook, Google, Yahoo! and Oracle. It’s one of about 200 private tech companies from around the world that in the last few years have raised funds of over $1 billion. Startup valuations skyrocketed, knocked higher by venture capital.

Cloudera will surely be compared to competitor Hortonworks Inc. (HDP), which also specializes in Hadoop, an open-source project that processes and stores large data sets across many different computers. (For more, see: How Big Data Has Changed Marketing.) Hortonworks went public in December 2014, and since the first day of trading, its share price has fallen by more than 60% and its market value tumbled to just over $600 million. Cloudera, like Hortonworks, posted a big loss last year—according to the Wall Street Journal—$187 million. Cloudera has plenty of competition as well, from several big tech companies like IBM and Oracle, and cloud providers such as Microsoft and Amazon that are growing their business intelligence offerings. That competition could drag on earnings. Cloudera also already valued itself a good deal lower than its last private-market share price, according to the Wall Street Journal. Intel paid $30.92 a share in 2014, and this month, Cloudera granted stock awards to employees at $17.85 a share. Cloudera’s mutual fund investors marked down the estimated values of their shares to between $17 and $26 as of December, according to The Wall Street Journal’s Startup Stock Tracker. Early investors are likely to do well, such as Accel Partners, which owns 16.3% of Cloudera, and first bought shares at 39 cents a share in 2008, reports the Journal.  So far Cloudera has raised $1.04 billion in eight rounds from 18 investors. Its major investors include Accel Partners, Greylock Partners and Meritech Capital Partners. On the bright side, the company has done well the last few years. Its clients include MasterCard Inc. and Marks & Spencer Group PLC. Cloudera increased its revenue from $109 million in the 12 months ending January 2015 to $261 million for the 12 months ending January 2017. And a good deal of the growth came from companies purchasing Cloudera software subscriptions, a sign the company is attracting customers. Some say the $187 million loss last year is not unusual for a tech company, and note it’s an improvement of losses over $200 million in 2015. Cloudera also does have Intel going for it. The backing of a major brand provides it with a solid foundation. Cloudera is broadening its reach as well, breaking away from marketing itself solely as a Hadoop distribution platform. In its S-1 filing, Cloudera presents itself as “the leading modern platform for data management, machine learning and advanced analytics,” a move that could help set the company apart from the pack.

Taser International changed its name to Axon to coincide with the name of its preexisting body camera line, which includes both cloud storage and a platform for analytics, and is now trading under the ticker AAXN. Taser will also adopt the ""freemium"" model more common to Silicon Valley for the next year, according to Quartz, and will give away its cameras for 12 months in order to entice police departments to pay for its platform and services down the line. This marks a major shift that has some analysts speculating that data and information sales is a driving factor. Axon CEO Rick Smith has indicated his company's hopes for an interconnected system of police reports, making use of body cameras and various cloud storage catalogs in order to analyze and share footage between investigators. Smith believes these systems could allow police the streamline the tedious paperwork process while increasing overall accountability with the public. Smith is one of many analysts and tech CEOs who believes that the future of police work will make heavy use of technological advancements. He says, ""eighty percent of American cops go out on the job with a gun, but no camera. We want to accelerate the adoption of this technology."" In recent years, body cameras as well as footage taken by bystanders have played a big part in numerous high-profile incidents involving the police and the public. Smith believes that the question of body cameras is one that bridges both sides of the American political spectrum and which should see little resistance from the broader public. While cameras themselves continue to become more advanced, Smith's vision relies more on AI systems which could process footage that the cameras record. These systems could be used to transcribe police interviews, create timelines, testimonies, and more. Of course, there exist technological and developmental barriers to achieving these goals as well. Smith's tasks require highly specialized AI systems, and large tech companies like Google don't necessarily spend a good deal of energy and time devoted to addressing these tasks. Thus, Axon has recently acquired two AI branches to increase its own focus: Dextro, a startup, and Fossil Group's computer vision wing. Smith's plan may run into difficulty with the question of surveillance. In an increasingly technological world, citizen groups are become more attuned to the possibility of these technologies being used for illegal surveillance, or of private data and information becoming public or being sold. Axon will no doubt have to address these concerns if it wishes to see its vision enacted on a wider scale. ",Taser - Now Axon - May Be Gathering Image Data | Investopedia

In a blogpost on Tuesday by Google's vice-president of people operations, Eileen Naughton highlighted the technology giant's commitment to ""extremely scientific and robust"" annual analyses to help calculate fair salaries. The model, first outlined last year, takes into account role, job level, job location and performance ratings, but is blind to gender - and, as of recently, race. The comments come days after the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) alleges that the company allows ""systematic compensation disparities against women"". In a court hearing held Friday, DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper said the agency had received ""compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters."" Naughton said the company had been ""taken aback"" by the allegations, prompting it to reiterate its salary analysis system. ""Each year, we suggest an amount for every employee's new compensation (consisting of base salary, bonus and equity) based on role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings. This suggested amount is ""blind"" to gender,"" explained Naughton. ""The analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees' gender data. An employee's manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount, providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale."" Naughton said that the model then measures individual salary calculations against those received by their peers in order to ensure there is ""no statistically significant differences between men's and women's compensation."" The Department of Labor initiated an offensive against Google in September 2016, later filing a lawsuit in January calling for access to the company's compensation data. As the case is still open, a spokesperson for the department told CNBC that it was unable to provide comment on Google's latest post. Naughton said this had been done ""without any supporting data or methodology."" ""Our analysis gives us confidence that there is no gender pay gap at Google. In fact, we recently expanded the analysis to cover race in the US,"" she added. Naughton said Google's methodology is available to other businesses who want to test their own compensation practices for equal pay. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Venessa Wong,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"Burger King is launching full-fledged marketing blitz based on triggering voice-activated Google devices, in what could become a grim precedent for TV and radio ads talking directly to voice-activated gadgets like smartphones and Amazon's Echo speakers. The fast-food company's new TV ad features a person looking directly into the camera and saying ""OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?"", which — if everything goes as planned — will trigger Google devices like the Google Home assistant and Android phones that have enabled voice search. In a demo, the ad prompts a Google Home voice-activated speaker to start reading a description of the Whopper from Wikipedia.

Just imagine the symphony of machines all telling you about the Whopper at once. Spamming people with search results for flame-broiled burgers is not what Google had in mind with when it launched the device, and the Burger King commercial, which is the work of the ad agency David, was not done in partnership with Google.

Arjun Kharpal,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"Google launched a fact checking tool in its search and news results on Friday, as the technology giant looks to fight back against the spread of fake news, amid mounting pressure on internet firms to tackle such content. The search giant will not actually be doing the fact checking itself but instead will surface results from the likes of PolitiFact and Snopes. For example, if someone searches ""27 million people enslaved"", a result showing the actual claim, who said it, and whether it is true or not, will appear. In October, Google tested the feature in a handful of countries and specifically in Google News. The announcement on Friday marks the wide-scale roll out of the feature. The information won't be available for every search, Google said, and there could be instances where the same publisher checked the same claim but came to different conclusions. Google emphasized the fact that it was not checking the facts and are ""presented so people can make more informed judgments."" ""Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it's still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree,"" Google explained in a blog post. Publishers wishing to be included in the fact check feature just need to add some additional code to their websites. Google's move comes amid heightened criticism of internet companies' inability to tackle fake news and misinformation. Google has been one of the companies under fire and has been making moves to improve how it tackles such content. Social networking titan Facebook has also taken steps to tackle fake news content including its own fact checking tool which tells users who are about to post a link to an article, whether the claims in the article have been disputed.

Todd Haselton,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"Google Home is one of my favorite gadgets, and spending a bit of time to learn some of its secrets has made it even more valuable to me and my family. Google Home, if you're unfamiliar, is Google's version of the Amazon Echo and works in much the same manner. Speak a command and Google Assistant — the name isn't as appealing as Alexa — answers your query. It's kind of like a magic speaker that just sits on your bedside table, or in your living room, always ready for your beck and call. If you own a Google Home, you can do so much more than ask the weather or how old George Washington was when he died (67). I'll walk you through five of my favorite Google Home tricks now. If you have brownies in the oven for the next 20 minutes but also need to set another timer – maybe for the kid you just placed in time out — you can use Google Home to manage both. Simply say ""Set a timer for 20 minutes,"" for your brownies, then follow with another. ""Set a timer for 10 minutes for time out."" As long as you provide specific names, you'll be able to keep adding on to the original timer. Heading out to a Spanish restaurant and want to make sure you're ready to greet the host properly? ¡No problema! Google Home can help with that. Just ask Google Assistant to translate ""Good evening, how are you?"" to Spanish and you'll get the response right away. You can also query things like: ""'How are you' in Spanish,"" or ""how do I say 'how are you' in Spanish?"" Google Home has a leg up on the Amazon Echo here. You can use it to start movies and TV shows on your Chromecast-enabled TV. Simply say ""Watch Family Guy on Living Room TV,"" for example, and the show will start playing. You'll need to make sure the TV is configured inside the Google Home app, first. Here's a simple guide on how to do that. I tried this and immediately fell in love with the feature, though I admit it's awfully similar to functionality also available on the Amazon Echo. Google Home links up with some of Google's partners, allowing you to order household products like papertowels, soap and more. All you have to say is ""Buy soap"" or ""Buy dog food,"" and the Google Assistant will walk you through available products and prices. Place an order and it'll arrive on your doorstep within the next couple of days. We walked you through how to get a daily briefing on the Amazon Echo, and you can do the same with Google Home. Just say ""Get the news,"" and Google Home will begin playing the latest headlines from CNBC, NPR, ESPN, BBC and more. You can manage news sources inside the Google Home app and easily change the order of which news sources play first. ",Google Home tips and tricks

Todd Haselton,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"Google Maps is perfect for getting directions from point A to point B, or for finding a nearby restaurant, but it also has a bunch of interesting hidden features of which most people are unaware. I use Google Maps every day and I didn't even know about some of these until Google pointed them out. I guess that's the very definition of hiding in plain view, right? Anyway, here are some Google Maps secrets that might help you get more out of the app, and you might not have known they were even there. Did you know you can create Lists of places in Google Maps, and then save them for later or share them with friends? I didn't. Just search for a place then tap ""Save"" and choose to add them to your favorite spots, or create a brand new custom list. In this example, I created a list of awesome spots to see during a visit to Manhattan. Ok, I admit I knew about this, but I think a lot of people still haven't discovered the feature. You can save maps offline for viewing and searching even when you don't have a wireless signal, like when you're in the subway or driving through the middle of the desert. Just tap the left menu button and select ""offline areas"" to begin. This is another one I'd never heard about. Google teamed up with a bunch of fitness providers to allow customers to schedule appointments right in Google Maps, though you need to use the web-based version. It works with Appointy, Front Desk, Full Slate, GenBook, MyTime and MINDBODY to let you find a class wherever you are in the U.S., whether you're at home or out on the road. This is a fairly new feature that launched only a few weeks ago, though Google has offered similar services for a while. You can share your real-time location – maybe while driving home during a snowstorm, for example – so your friends and family know you get some safe. You'll set how long the location is shared for, and who gets to view, and you can turn it off manually at any time. Just tap the menu button and then tap ""Share location"" to get started. If you're driving to work and decide you need just one more iced coffee before getting to the office, you can easily add a pit stop without messing with your original GPS route. Just tap search while driving and find a local point of interest, like a Dunkin' Donuts, and Maps will add the stop to your trip. ",Google Maps secrets you need to know about
Michelle Castillo,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"While Google and Facebook are the undisputed advertising leaders online, companies are increasingly looking for other digital ways to spend their marketing budgets, according to advertising and public relations company WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell. ""What our clients want and what our agencies want is more competition of the space, anything that gives more competition to the duopoly of Facebook and Google,"" Sorrell said to CNBC. The two tech giants account for about 75 percent of digital ad budgets, according to Sorrell. But, there are competitors ready to chip away at their dominance, including AOL and Yahoo's ad tech platforms and Snap. Even Amazon is becoming a threat, with its ad platform recently valued at $350 billion, he pointed out. ""Getting more than two solutions is important,"" he said. But while Google's issue of ads appearing next to questionable content is causing companies to pull dollars right now, Sorrell doesn't think the moves will be permanent because of how big of a presence the company has in digital adverting.

Christina Farr,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"That's according to developers who license the smart glasses technology from Google Glass' enterprise-focused ""Glass at Work"" program. Google unveiled the smart glasses at its I/O conference in April 2012 in a high-profile demonstration featuring skydivers, and rolled them out to developers a year later. But the product was pricey at $1,500, and not particularly stylish. Onlookers were also concerned about the glasses recording them without their knowledge, which led to several Glass-wearers being attacked in public. Google discontinued Glass as a consumer product in 2015. But a version for the workplace lives on. ""It's a big market today, and it will be an even bigger one in the future,"" said Brian Ballard, founder and chief executive officer at Upskill, a Google Glass partner that makes augmented reality apps for workers in the field. Its customers — and as of recently, its investors — include industrial giants like Boeing and GE. Upskill works with other smart glasses makers as well, like Intel, Microsoft and Vuzix. Ballard declined to comment on how many units it has deployed, but he did say it is targeting companies that will need ""thousands of these devices in the field to do one job."" Where Google could boost the business further and stand out from competitors, he says, is by adding advanced computing, like machine learning, to its offering. An example might be in incorporating computer vision technology so field workers simply have to snap photos for the purposes of documentation. Augmedix, a San Francisco-based start-up with nearly 1,000 employees, built its business off smart glasses. Unlike Upskill, the vast majority of its customers — doctors at large hospitals — are using Google Glass. CEO Ian Shakil said the company expects to deploy 1,000 Google Glass devices by the end of the year. Augmedix sells its application to 12 hospitals, including Dignity Health, Sutter Health and TriHealth, to help doctors transcribe notes from patient interactions. Doctors wear the glasses during consultations and transmit video to medical scribes, who take notes. That way, the doctors are freed up to focus on the patients. Shakil wouldn't tell us how much the company pays Google but says it's in the realm of $1,500, which is the price Google charged developers for the original product. Augmedix, which raised $23 million in December, is poised to triple its growth year over year, said Shakil. Thus far, he said, most patients seem open to their doctors wearing the device: ""We've already done tens of thousands of patient interactions."" ",Google Glass: becoming a surprise success
"Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com",04132017,CNBC,04062017,"For entrepreneurs planning to build a start-up the right way, no one has left a clearer trail of how-tos than Alphabet's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Once graduate students at Stanford University working on the Google search engine, they now run an internet conglomerate worth close to $600 billion. They learned to modify and expand upon their big idea, get needed management help without giving up control, and manage risk and reward on the road to becoming a more or less mature enterprise. They aren't perfect. The recent advertiser uproar over Alphabet's inability to identify offensive content on YouTube shows that even the Google founders are still learning. And the company also faces recent claims from the Department of Labor that a gender pay gap exists among its employees. But billionaires Page and Brin have shown a generation of wannabes in Silicon Valley and elsewhere how to do it right — and why their company fields millions of résumés annually. Here are some of the key lessons from the Google founders' early days. There were already a number of web search engines before Page and Brin got together in 1995 — they just weren't very good. The Google founders had two big ideas. One was to base web search on the citation-ranking system academics used to rate the quality of articles in academic journals, a notion that was natural to the two professors' sons. The other was that search results should be based on a relatively ""pure"" ranking system untainted by their business need to generate revenue. They believed that a purer ranking system would be more useful and that consumers would trust it and use it more. ""We believe a well-functioning society should have abundant, free and unbiased access to high-quality information,"" Brin and Page said in a 2004 letter to prospective shareholders. Google's founders referred to free, high-quality information as part of the company's ""responsibility to the world"" but by 2000 it was clear that the pure ratings weren't going to generate enough revenue to make Google a big, profitable company. So the task became to find ways to generate advertising revenue without compromising the search results. That led, ultimately, to the paid listings that run alongside Google search results, an idea that revolutionized marketing because they were both highly relevant and priced by the click. That gave Google the running room needed to keep its primary search results free of so-called ""paid inclusion"" ads that users eventually rejected. The decision also led to litigation, later settled, claiming that Google stole the idea for auction-based pay-per-click advertising from GoTo.com, a start-up later purchased by Google's one-time arch rival Yahoo. More from Upstart 25: Reviving the American dream in Puerto Rico through entrepreneurship4 tax reforms that can reinvigorate Main Street — and boost the economy 4 Chinese-backed electric-car start-ups planning a run at Tesla Recent headlines about Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick make this lesson abundantly clear. In 2001, Brin and Page hired Eric Schmidt to ""provide adult supervision, basically,"" as Brin put it in a PBS interview with Charlie Rose. As the structure had evolved by the time Google went public in 2004, the trio ran the company together, with most vice presidents reporting to Schmidt, while Page focused on product development and engineering, and Brin zeroed in on deals and engineering. The former CTO of Sun Microsystems helped the young entrepreneurs, then eventually gave way to Page as CEO in 2011. Another one for the new era of Travis: Google's top HR executive is also its chief culture officer, the person in charge of assuring Google lives up to the ""Don't be evil"" credo that dates to its early days. Former executives praise Google for everything from being progressive (by Silicon Valley standards) at identifying and promoting female executives, to an ongoing series of lectures and programs at the Googleplex headquarters and, of course, the infamous massages and free food. Put the culture together with nearly infinite resources, and it's little wonder the company fields a reported 2.5 million resumes annually. When Google went public in 2004, Brin and Page said it wouldn't be conventional and would be willing to sacrifice short-term results for growth. Sometimes, that has taken the form of deals that were criticized at the time, like the 2006 purchase of YouTube, which took years to justify its $1.6 billion purchase price but now generates an estimated $10 billion-plus billion in yearly revenue and is the heart of Google's newly-announced TV service. Sometimes it takes the form of moonshot in-house projects that are still years away from profitability. Sometimes a product may not reach initial expectations, and is even considered a flop, but does find a valuable niche: Google Glass is now popular in the medical and industrial fields. While the speculative bets have periodically hurt Google's stock price — Wall Street runs hot and cold on risk depending on how the rest of the business is doing — the approach is consistent with Brin and Page's promise to build their company for long-term wealth creation. In the 2004 IPO filing, they wrote: ""In our opinion, outside pressures too often tempt companies to sacrifice long-term opportunities to meet quarterly market expectations. In Warren Buffett's words, We won't 'smooth' quarterly or annual results: If earnings figures are lumpy when they reach headquarters, they will be lumpy when they reach you. … If opportunities arise that might cause us to sacrifice short term results but are in the best long term interest of our shareholders, we will take those opportunities."" The company's 2016 annual report noted reminded investors that the founders promised to make ""'smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.' From the start, the company has always strived to do more."" But a few years ago Google hired a Wall Street CFO, Ruth Porat, and made the decision to isolate the moonshot projects — from Google Fiber to Nest, self-driving cars and biotech start-ups — into an ""Other Bets"" segment which would clearly show how much they cost versus how much Google's core search business made. Other Bets lost $3.6 billion last year, but Alphabet as a whole had net income of $19.5 billion. Smaller companies that can't lose $3.6 billion may not be able to bet 4 percent of revenue, as Alphabet does, on longer-run ideas. The company also, of course, changed its publicly traded name to Alphabet, which had over $90 billion revenue last year. In Google's 2004 IPO filing, it listed annual revenue of $962 million and a net profit of $106 million. The key to the whole approach is consistency, according to a leading analyst. ""Google was growing approx. 20 percent on a $26 billion revenue run rate biz at the beginning of 2010 and is now growing 20 percent on a $104 billion run rate biz. Very rare,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney says. ""Profit margins are intrinsically high and free cash flow is very strong.

Both Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are trading near their all-time highs. Amazon's stock has climbed so much in the past 12 months, it's made its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos the second wealthiest person in the world, recently surpassing Warren Buffett and Amancio Ortega. Alphabet shares are up a modest 11%, compared with Amazon's 51% increase. But investors can't dwell too much on the past. They need to look to the future to determine which stocks offer the best opportunities for further gains. Today we'll compare the two tech giants head to head to determine which is a better buy: Amazon.com or Alphabet. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon's core retail business is strong. It generated $124 billion in revenue in 2016 across its North American and international retail segments. That's up 25% from $99 billion in 2015. Amazon's growth is fueled by increasing Prime membership, which acts as a huge incentive for both customers and merchants to use Amazon's marketplace before looking elsewhere. A survey from BloomReach found that 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com. But what's really driving Amazon's stock price higher is its more profitable operating segment, Amazon Web Services. AWS is Amazon's cloud computing service, which supports all sorts of web applications, from basic websites to huge data-consuming apps such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). AWS sales increased 55% last year to $12.2 billion. More importantly, the segment's operating profit of $3.1 billion is about three times as much as Amazon's retail business. Amazon is also expanding into other high-margin businesses. Its advertising business is growing rapidly, albeit on a small base. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowack estimates that Amazon's ad business could grow to $5 billion by next year and $7 billion by 2020. And those sales are high margin, which means that despite the relatively small revenue compared with the rest of Amazon's retail segment, Amazon could see significant profit growth. Nowack notes, however, that Amazon's ad revenue growth shouldn't cut into Google's core search ad sales. Alphabet may have changed its name to reflect its other bets besides Google, but the online advertising business is still its core business. Google accounted for 99% of the company's revenue and 118% of its operating income in 2016, while ""other bets"" produced an operating loss. Image source: Google Google is managing to expand its already dominant share of the search advertising market. eMarketer expects Google to expand its share by 16.1% to claim roughly 78% of the U.S. search market this year. Google growth is being fueled by its Android operating system, which recently became the most popular operating system across all devices. Google is also extremely popular across other mobile OSes, and consumers are turning to their smartphones more often to look up details on just about anything. That means more Google searches and more search ad revenue. YouTube is also a dominant force on mobile, with the average mobile viewer spending 40 minutes watching video per session as of mid-2015. YouTube is currently under scrutiny for displaying ads before objectionable content, but Google has quickly taken steps to counteract the issues. The negative impact on Google should be relatively small. The growth outlook for both Amazon and Alphabet is quite strong, so how can investors decide which to buy? Both companies have strong balance sheets with huge amounts of cash and relatively little debt. Alphabet's $86 billion in cash and equivalents, however, completely dwarfs Amazon's $26 billion. Alphabet even has less long-term debt than Amazon. Alphabet also produces more cash from operations -- $36 billion, versus $16 billion. That's not to say Amazon's struggling for cash, but Alphabet is in a better position. Perhaps more telling are the valuation multiples investors are putting on both companies. Amazon currently trades for a price-to-earnings multiple of 182.6. Alphabet (C shares) is comparatively cheap at 29.6 times earnings. But analysts are significantly more bullish on Amazon's earnings growth prospects, expecting an average of 72.7% earnings growth over the next five years, compared with just 19% for Alphabet. Google's growth is coming from the megatrend of advertisers who are shifting more ad dollars to digital while consumers spend more time searching and watching videos on their smartphones. Amazon's growth will come from AWS and the emergence of other high-margin categories such as advertising. Amazon is also working off a much smaller net-income base than Alphabet. Its growth is much less certain than Alphabet's, but it has the potential to pay off in the long run. If you can stomach the up-and-down nature of Amazon stock, I think it makes a better long-term buy despite its sky-high valuation. For more conservative growth investors, Alphabet is an excellent option. ","
      
    Better Buy: Amazon.com, Inc. vs Google -- The Motley Fool

It's a battle of the FANG stocks. Digital video veteran Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) takes on online search and advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), best know for its Google-branded operations. If you could only buy one of these today, which one's the better choice? Let's find out. Image source: Google. If you understand internet-based search and advertising, you understand the current iteration of Alphabet. In that space, Google holds unequaled market share and industry clout. Revenues are soaring, free cash flow growth has accelerated in recent quarters, and share prices more than doubled over the last three years. GOOGL data by YCharts. Business is good, but Alphabet will not fit that mold forever. Search ads brought the company this far, building a massive revenue base from which it can launch many new operations. Some will fail and fade; others are sure to catch on and start producing serious bottom-line profits. The best bets on the table so far include the Waymo self-driving car platform, the Calico medical research company, and an Internet of Things strategy built around the Nest line of smart home products. Alphabet is getting ready to go offline, becoming a conglomerate of wildly different operations in the process. That's how you build a business for the very, very long haul. Buy Alphabet if you don't want to worry about the ""sell"" button for several decades. Image source: Netflix. Unlike Alphabet, Netflix can't boast solid bottom-line results quite yet. Earnings are barely positive, cash flows are diving deep into red ink, and the stock is incredibly overvalued by nearly every traditional metric. Yet, I heartily recommend investors take a closer look at Netflix. All is not as it seems. The company announced and then executed a global rollout, installing streaming video services in nearly every nation on Earth. China remains a difficult nut to crack, and American businesses simply can't work in embargoed territories like North Korea and Syria, so it's not quite 100% coverage. Still, that ambitious, market-growing project is essentially complete. Without the budget pressures of a worldwide service installation to worry about, Netflix's management has promised to increase its bottom-line earnings in 2017 and beyond. Granted, cash flows will stay negative for a few more years. That's a side effect of the company's massive content production plans. The company has financed its production budget via new debt in recent years, and it will probably hit the debt market again in 2017 and 2018. But look at what Netflix will have built, just a couple of years down the road. A global content distribution network will be married to a first-class entertainment studio, creating a two-pronged video entertainment attack like nothing we've seen before. Meanwhile, the portion of humanity that has access to Netflix-grade network connections is growing explosively. Netflix hopes to establish itself as the player to beat in an expanding market, kind of like the Google we knew 15 years ago. The cash investments Netflix is making now are building an impressive content portfolio for the long run, which will continue to bring in and hold onto paying customers for years to come. This is the stock to pick if you're looking for exciting growth in the next 5 to 10 years. Beyond that, I have no idea where Netflix will go. Image source: Getty Images. Let me be clear: There are no bad choices, here. It's the ultimate cop-out, but I'll stand by it. Alphabet and Netflix are two fine long-term investments, but also dramatically different ones. I own both and plan to hold them for many more years. Netflix may need some attention in, say, 2025, as the mature company enters a new era. I could probably leave Alphabet leave alone until my kids graduate from elementary school, grow up, and retire. So, I understand that your mileage might vary, and Netflix certainly offers the bumpier ride. But you probably want to have a bit of both in your portfolio.

Finding winning stocks is tough. That's why we Fools tend to hold on tenaciously when we think we have bought a winner. So what stocks do we currently own that we plan on holding forever? We asked that very question to a team of Fools, and they picked Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY), and MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX). Image source: Getty Images. Anders Bylund (Alphabet): "" Never"" is a very long time, but I certainly don't have any plans to sell my holdings in Alphabet for the foreseeable future. The company is best known for its Google-branded range of online tools and services today. Through Google, Alphabet dominates the lucrative fields of online search and advertising. YouTube is another market-defining property under the Google umbrella. The Android platform for smartphones and tablets also dominates its industry on a global level, again under Google's aegis. It's safe to say that you know what the company does, and you probably use its services every day. The Google segment provided 99% of Alphabet's total revenue in the recently reported fourth quarter. But Alphabet won't look like that forever. The minuscule ""other bets"" segment is tiny and unprofitable today but represents Alphabet's long-term future. The internet as we know it may go away as quickly as it rose out of nowhere in the 1990s, replaced by whatever comes next. (No, I can't tell you what that might be. If I knew, I'd be getting rich developing that idea rather than talking about the current state of affairs. Sorry.) So Alphabet is getting ready for the day when online search and marketing no longer supports a strong business foundation. Other bets include self-driving cars, advanced medical research, the Google Fiber high-speed internet service, and the Nest line of smart thermostats. Beyond these familiar names, Alphabet is working up many more not-so-obvious business ideas out of the public eye. Any or all of these experiments may turn into profitable businesses one day, and the Alphabet company was designed to contain many long-term bets on the far future. Some of the so-called moonshots contain an online element, but others don't. In short, Alphabet is remaking itself as a whole new kind of industry-spanning conglomerate. With or without the internet, Alphabet will be around for the very long haul. The company is just getting started, using Google to kindle the fires under a brand new bundle of growth engines. Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Property Partners): I'm a firm believer that investors should hold some form of real estate for the long term. The numbers back up this view, as investors who added real estate or other alternatives to a portfolio of stocks and bonds have significantly outperformed those holding a more traditional portfolio over the long term. While there are plenty of good ways to get into real estate, the best, in my opinion, is by investing in Brookfield Property Partners. The real estate partnership owns a core portfolio of office properties in gateway cities around the world and a significant stake in leading U.S. mall owner General Growth Properties (NYSE:GGP). In addition, it has investments in several opportunistic real estate funds that hold stakes in a variety of other property classes, including multi-family, industrial, and hospitality. That makes it a one-stop shop for real estate investing. These real estate portfolios throw off very predictable cash flow, 80% of which Brookfield Property Partners distributes back to investors through a generous payout currently yielding 5.3%. Meanwhile, the company reinvests the other 20% into redevelopment projects to obtain higher rents. The upside from those redevelopment projects, when combined with rent escalations and development projects in the pipeline, provide Brookfield with the ability to increase its payout by 5% to 8% annually over the long term. That steadily growing payout, along with capital appreciation across its portfolio, should drive 12% to 15% annual returns for investors over the long term, which is why this is one stock I'd never consider selling. Brian Feroldi (MarketAxess Holdings): Did you know that the majority of fixed-income trading still takes place over the phone or by email? Given the ubiquity of electronic trading in the stock market, I was shocked to uncover this fact. But now MarketAxess is attempting to bring the bond markets into the 21st century. The company operates the biggest online bond-trading platform in the world, making it easy for its users to buy, sell, or research fixed-income securities. Not only does this platform make far more sense than holding one-on-one conversations to transact, but it also brings a whole new level of transparency to this market. Being the top dog in this small but growing niche provides MarketAxess with a big advantage. Just like every other marketplace, bond buyers and sellers will naturally gravitate toward the largest platform since it maximizes their chance of getting a good price on either side of the transaction. This network effect will make it nearly impossible for a potential rival to catch up. One big financial benefit of running an electronic trading platform is that it costs the company very little to add one more user. That means the company's margins can consistently expand over time, allowing profits to grow at a much faster rate than revenue. MKTX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Over time, I'm convinced that the benefits of trading electronically will persuade more and more market participants to sign on the company's platform. With plenty of market share left for MarketAxess' to capture, I think the company's torrid revenue and profit growth rates should only continue from here. That why I plan on holding on to my MarketAxess shares indefinitely. ","

Merck (NYSE:MRK) is known today as a pharmaceuticals industry leader with a market cap of over $170 billion and a solid dividend. But the stock didn't always claim the value that it does today. Through acquisitions, mergers, and nine stock splits along the way, the history of Merck stock has a lot of twists and turns. Here's a brief look at how Merck got to where it stands today as one of the top pharmaceutical stocks in the world -- from boom to bust to bouncing back. Image source: Merck. Merck's history dates all the way back to 1668, when Friedrich Jacob Merck bought an apothecary in Darmstadt, Germany. In 1827, Heinrich Merck transformed the company into a drugmaker. The company's American roots began in 1887, when a U.S. sales office was opened by E. Merck AG. The modern Merck that we know came into existence in 1917. When the U.S. entered World War I, the American business separated from its German parent. The company became known as Merck & Co. in the U.S., although E. Merck AG retained the rights to the Merck name outside of the U.S. Merck stock entered into a stretch of remarkable gains beginning in the mid-1980s. This winning streak extended into the end of the 20th century, with a few pullbacks along the way, most of them relatively short. MRK data by YCharts. Highlights of this boom period included the launch of congestive heart failure drug Vasotec in 1985. By 1988, Vasotec had become Merck's first drug to achieve annual sales of $1 billion. The company introduced cholesterol drug Zocor in 1992, which also went on to become a blockbuster for Merck. A couple of significant acquisitions and divestitures occurred during the period as well. In 1993, Merck bought drug distributor Medco. A few years later, in 1999, the company sold off its specialty chemicals businesses. Between 1985 and 2000, Merck stock soared more than 3,500%. Those tremendous gains didn't hold entirely, though. In the following decade, Merck's share price collapsed. MRK data by YCharts. Part of the problem was a decline in the overall market in the early 21st century following the bursting of the dot-com bubble. However, Merck also had its own unique challenges. Four of its top-selling drugs lost patent exclusivity in 2000 and 2001. Even worse, Merck had to withdraw blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx from the market in 2004 after studies found that the drug doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes in long-term users. Merck stock cratered 27% on the day of the Vioxx announcement. It was during this period (in 2003) that Merck spun off Medco as a separate company. Medco was eventually bought by Express Scripts in 2012 for $29.1 billion -- more than the entire market cap of Merck up until 1990. Merck also had some developments in the first decade of the new century that set the stage for an improved future. In 2006, diabetes drug Januvia won U.S. regulatory approval. That same year, HPV vaccine Gardasil gained approval. Both products would go on to become huge winners for Merck. And in 2009, Merck merged with Schering-Plough. When Merck acquired Schering-Plough, the crown jewels it inherited included international rights to autoimmune disease drugs Remicade and Simponi. However, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) thought the merger constituted a change of control that allowed it to take back ex-U.S. rights to the two drugs. The two companies agreed on a settlement in 2011 that allowed Merck to keep marketing the drugs in most of the territories that Schering-Plough held. Remicade and Simponi contributed to Merck's reversal of fortunes beginning in 2010. MRK data by YCharts. A little-known drug called pembrolizumab was also included in the pipeline that Merck gained with the Schering-Plough merger. Schering-Plough had taken ownership of pembrolizumab when it bought Organon in 2007. The drug is now known as Keytruda. Keytruda is the centerpiece of Merck's latest resurgence. The drug won approval in 2014 for treating advanced melanoma. In 2015, the FDA approved Keytruda as a second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Last year, the drug gained approval for treating head and neck cancer plus the biggest prize of all -- first-line treatment of lung cancer. More recently, in March 2017, the FDA granted approval to Keytruda for treating classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Analysts think Keytruda should reach peak annual sales of close to $8 billion. The potential for the drug has helped Merck stock climb nearly 20% since the beginning of 2016. Merck's pipeline could help boost the stock more down the road. The company claims 12 drugs in addition to Keytruda that are in late-stage clinical studies. After a history spanning nearly 350 years, the story of Merck stock has a long way to go. ","

Travis Hoium,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Every day at least one delivery truck from UPS (NYSE:UPS) and one from FedEx (NYSE:FDX) pulls up in front of my apartment building. A half dozen boxes, each, on average are loaded on a cart and wheeled into the building to be delivered to residents. These days, an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) driver periodically pulls up with a box or two as well, cutting UPS and FedEx out of the delivery process. It's no secret that Amazon is both the elephant in the room in online retail and shipping as well as building out its own delivery network. The company has leased planes, contracted with drivers to deliver packages, and even invested in delivery drones. And while Amazon may be trying to cut UPS and FedEx out of the equation, if they're smart they have a very bright future with other retailers. Image source: Getty Images. If you pay close attention to retail, you've noticed there's a fundamental shift in the way products are developed and sold today. Lots of new companies are foregoing trying to get the big sale to a big box retailer and going straight to consumers. Blue Apron, Meundies, Nature Box, Bombas, and many others are introducing products that are advertised online or on podcasts straight to consumers. Purchases are made with no middleman and UPS, FedEx, and the post office handle the delivery. Big brands like Nike, Apple, Samsung, and Disney are trying to cut out the retail channel altogether as well, building direct marketing campaigns. As they grow direct sales, they'll lean on UPS and FedEx to get products to customers, adding another growing customer base to the delivery companies. As more large brands go direct and direct sales product companies pop up, they'll be a growth market for UPS and FedEx. And many, like food delivery services, are recurring revenue businesses, not tied to the holiday season. They'll create a foundation of growth outside of Amazon's enormous shipping demands. What UPS and FedEx have to avoid is being a cheap peak demand shipper for Amazon's business, particularly during the holidays. Amazon wants to be able to build its own logistics operation it can run full steam, offloading peak demand to companies like UPS and FedEx. But if they're not compensated appropriately, they'll lose money building capacity to meet peak need that's then idle during slower seasons. But here's where the duopoly these two companies have in shipping may come in handy. They'll compete with each other for Amazon's business, but neither is desperate enough to make Amazon a loss leader as a customer. The risk of being disrupted is one of the biggest risk factors investors should watch for. And with Amazon building out its own delivery infrastructure and growing its online retail market share, it may appear that UPS and FedEx are going to be disrupted by one of their biggest customers. But as Amazon grows, so does the network of innovative product companies who will disrupt retail, going directly to customers, including big brands. And as that base of customers grows they'll lean more and more on UPS and FedEx to get their products out to the world. That's a great base to grow from and makes both stocks great buys long-term because the number of online direct-to-customer sales is only going up. ","

If you've ever looked at the details on your paycheck stub, you've probably run into the alphabet soup of deductions and withholdings that reduce the amount of money you get to take home on payday. One common item you might find on your paycheck is OASDI tax. OASDI stands for old age, survivors, and disability insurance tax, and the money that your employer collects goes to the federal government in order to fund the Social Security program. Even for those who earn too little to owe income tax, OASDI tax usually gets deducted from the first $1 of earnings you get from your job. The federal government collects OASDI tax from employees at a tax rate of 6.2%. Employers are responsible for withholding the 6.2% from their employees' pay and then sending it on to the government. Employers must also match the 6.2% with an additional 6.2% from their own funds. For self-employed individuals, the effective OASDI tax is 12.4%, because those who are self-employed have to pay both the employee and employer portions of the OASDI tax themselves. An income tax deduction for the employer portion of the self-employment OASDI tax is allowed in order to put self-employed individuals in the same tax position that employers enjoy. Image source: Getty Images. The OASDI tax only applies to wages or salary income up to a certain amount that changes from year to year. For 2017, the maximum amount on which OASDI tax gets applied is $127,200. That means that the most that you'll pay in OASDI tax is $7,886.40, or twice that if you're self-employed. Note, however, that you sometimes will have to work to get any overpaid OASDI tax back. For instance, if you work two different jobs whose total salaries add up to more than the $127,200 limit, then the employers might well withhold too much in OASDI tax. There's a space on your income tax return that you can use to claim excess paid OASDI tax, giving you a refund of the overpaid amount. Eligibility for Social Security retirement, survivors, and disability benefits hinges in large part on developing enough of a past earnings history to qualify for the program. That, in turn, requires workers to report and pay OASDI tax on enough income over time to meet the specific qualification requirements. Different benefits require different time periods. For retirement benefits, you'll typically need to collect 40 credits, which many can do within a 10-year period. Disability benefits can kick in sooner, depending on the age of the worker and the age of the workers at the time of disability. Survivor benefits depend on the work history of the person who dies, leaving some survivors with the benefit of getting monthly checks without actually having paid into the Social Security system themselves. Some policymakers have suggested that the 6.2% amount for the OASDI tax might not be enough to move ahead into the 21st century. For instance, the 2017 Social Security Trustees Report said that if the OASDI tax were raised to around 7.58%, it would be sufficient to keep the Social Security program solvent over the next 75 years. Otherwise, benefit cuts will be necessary in order to keep the program financially solvent. Nevertheless, the 6.2% rate has been in effect since the 1990s, and few seem excited about changing it. With most projections giving the government until the mid-2030s to resolve the Social Security funding issue before benefit cuts become necessary, it's likely that the OASDI tax will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. That's likely to stay the case until Washington lawmakers build up the momentum they need to tackle the politically contentious issue going forward. ","

Dan Caplinger,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Social Security pays benefits based on your work history, but there's a maximum amount that you can get from the program in monthly retirement payments. What that maximum is depends on several factors, including when you file for benefits. As the situations below make clear, the longer you wait to claim, the greater your maximum Social Security benefit can be. But sometimes, getting the biggest possible monthly check isn't the best way to make the most of Social Security. You can collect Social Security benefits as early as age 62, but to do so, you have to accept a reduction in your monthly payment compared to what you'd receive at full retirement age. For those born between 1943 and 1954, the reduction in benefits at age 62 was 25%, but that's in the process of climbing to 30% for those who were born in 1960 or later as the full retirement age rises from 66 to 67. To collect this maximum amount, you have to have worked for 35 years or longer and collected the maximum wages on which the government collects Social Security payroll taxes. Anything shy of that number, and you'll get a smaller benefit. However, for those who are fairly close to maximum-income earning during their careers, the size of monthly benefits doesn't drop as quickly as it does for lower- and middle-income earners. Image source: Getty Images. Age 65 used to be the full retirement age, but legislation in the 1980s made it technically another early retirement time for Social Security benefits. However, the reduction for taking benefits at age 65 is much smaller than for early benefits at age 62, and that's a big part of why the maximum benefit for 65-year-olds is almost $400 higher. In particular, the penalty for taking benefits about a year early is around 7%, leading to only a minimal reduction in one's base benefit. Keep in mind that in exchange for that extra $400 per month, you have to forego receiving three years' worth of benefits, which can be as high as $77,500. If you live long enough, you'll eventually catch up to and surpass that figure by receiving higher monthly payments, but it can take a long time. Wait an additional year, and you can boost your benefit another $145 to $2,687 per month. Until recently, this represented full retirement age, but starting with those born in 1955, a rise in the retirement age makes age 66 an early retirement date. By the mid-2020s, those who turn 66 will see a reduction of nearly 7% in their benefits compared to full retirement age. However, for now, the reduction is small, and it will grow only very slowly over time. The absolute maximum benefit comes for those who reach age 70, because they can claim delayed retirement credits of 30% or more depending on full retirement age. The $3,538 figure issued by the IRS is almost 32% higher than the age 66 number, reflecting the reward for waiting longer. Again, the longer you wait, the fewer checks you receive. However, with the maximum being almost $1,400 higher than claiming at age 62, it's easy to see the benefit of delaying as long as you can. Social Security benefits are important because they'll make up your most reliable income throughout your lifetime. By knowing the maximum you can get from Social Security, you'll be in the best position to get as much as the program will make available to you. Even if you can't earn enough to max out your Social Security, just bear in mind that the higher your earnings, the closer you'll get to the maximum amounts listed above. ","
      
    Here's the Most You Can Get From Social Security -- The Motley Fool

Most American seniors rely on Social Security for at least half their income. That makes Social Security an incredibly important part of nearly every American's retirement plans. Still, with the typical retiree receiving only around $1,364 per month, it's vitally important to have another source of income to have a reasonably comfortable retirement. if you expect to live for more than a handful of years in retirement, solid company stocks can play a role as part of your overall retirement plan. It's a bad idea to rely on selling stocks to cover your immediate retirement income, as an unfortunate turn in the market can force your accounts to run out of money before you run out of retirement. Still, for the stock portion of your plan, great stocks to consider are ones that pay dividends, have increased their dividends over time, and look capable of keeping up the trend. The three stocks we'll discuss here show potential along those lines and thus are worthy of consideration as part of a retiree's portfolio. Image source: Getty Images Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is the largest independent energy refiner in the United States. As a refiner, it takes in crude oil and turns it into useful products such as gasoline. What matters to refiners such as Valero is something known as the ""crack spread,"" the difference between what a barrel of oil costs and what the products refined from that oil fetch in the market. Generally speaking, when the price of oil is high, so is the price of gasoline, and when the price of oil is low, so is the price of gasoline, but the crack spread itself generally stays positive. So as long as Valero manages its operations efficiently and keeps its inventory levels low enough that it's not stuck with too much high-priced inventory at a time of crashing prices, it should be OK. Valero currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share, which it recently raised from $0.60. Its current yield is around 4.3%.  Even with that increased dividend, it only pays out about half its earnings as dividends, giving it room to continue raising those dividends as its earnings grow over time. Backing up that dividend strength is a balance sheet that hasn't abused leverage. A debt-to-equity ratio of 0.4 and a current ratio of around 2.0 give it financial maneuvering room to handle the volatility in oil prices and still wind up OK. Networking titan Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) may not have a long history as a dividend payer, but once it started paying dividends, it certainly took them seriously. It has increased its dividend every year since initiating one in 2011, and its dividend currently sits at $0.29 per share per quarter, for a yield of around 3.5%. Even with that dividend increase, Cisco pays around 54% of its earnings as dividends, giving it room to continue raising those dividends as its earnings grow over time. Cisco expects network traffic to grow substantially over the next several years as mobile, video, and gaming services continue to expand. That traffic growth translates into product and services growth opportunities for Cisco, which is already the largest networking company around. Cisco also has not overleveraged itself, with a debt-to-equity ratio below 0.6 and a current ratio above 3.6. Those solid measures help assure that Cisco has the financial strength to deal with economic uncertainty while continuing to build out the networks of tomorrow. Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) is a multibillion-dollar company that provides products and services to the healthcare industry with a focus on cost-effectiveness as well as quality. Whether you look at it from the perspective of an aging population that needs more healthcare services or the perspective of those who pay the bills and are looking for deals, it's a field that will remain in demand for quite some time. Cardinal Health's most recent quarterly dividend was $0.4489 per share. That was the company's fourth consecutive dividend at that level, and its recent trend is to increase its dividend annually, so we'll probably find out in the next month or so whether that trend will continue. With a payout ratio of around 42% of earnings, Cardinal Health has room to continue its trend if it so chooses. At recent prices, that represents a respectable yield of around 2.2%. With a debt-to-equity ratio of around 0.85 and a current ratio of about 1.1, Cardinal Health has a pretty solid balance sheet and looks capable of navigating economic cycles well. While healthcare services are largely in demand no matter what the economy is like, the company's solid balance sheet should help if its consumers are unable to make timely payments because of their own personal circumstances. Image source: Getty Images These three stocks can help bolster your retirement portfolio thanks to their solid balance sheets, histories of increasing their dividends, and likely ability to continue increasing their payments. Whether you choose to use those dividends to help replenish maturing bonds in your portfolio or the somewhat riskier path of directly spending your dividends in retirement, these companies deserve consideration as part of your overall plan.

There's no two ways about it: As an investor, you'd struggle to find an industry with a more appetizing long-term growth rate than legal marijuana. According to cannabis research firm ArcView, North American legal sales increased by 34%, to $6.9 billion in 2016, albeit black-market sales still totaled $46.4 billion. As more U.S. states push to legalize, and with Canada potentially on the precipice of legalization by 2018, the expectation is more that this $46 billion-plus in illicit sales will shift to the legal and regulated markets in the years to come. By 2026, investment firm Cowen & Co. anticipates total legal sales could reach $50 billion. If that's the case, we're talking about more than 23% annual growth for a decade. It's these figures that are attracting businesses and investors to marijuana stocks in droves. Image source: Getty Images. However, marijuana stocks, by themselves, are more often than not dangerous investments. The vast majority of marijuana stocks are losing money and are burning through their cash on hand. Also, most pot stocks are trading on the over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges as opposed to a more reputable and visible exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Even though the OTC exchanges have improved their reporting and listing standards in recent years, it can still be difficult to get accurate and up-to-date info on OTC-listed stocks. Most marijuana stocks are penny stocks, too, which means they're highly volatile and usually avoidable. What's more, many are facing two key disadvantages. For example, companies that sell federally illegal substances -- which includes cannabis, a schedule 1 drug at the federal level -- are disallowed from taking normal business deductions. This means that most weed companies are paying tax on their gross profits as opposed to net profits, leaving the few that are profitable with less capital left over to reinvest and hire more workers.

Financial institutions in the U.S. are often regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is a federal entity. If a bank supplies a line of credit, or even a checking account, to a marijuana company, it could be construed as money laundering, and set that financial institution up for fines and/or criminal charges. Within the U.S., there's also the potential for a recreational marijuana crackdown, as signaled by White House press secretary Sean Spicer back in February. Though the Obama administration was relatively lax with regard to allowing states to regulate their medicinal and recreational laws, the Trump administration seems to have signaled that it'll be tougher on pot, albeit we're not certain to what extent. However, with ardent marijuana opponent Jeff Sessions as U.S. attorney general, we can only assume that federal enforcement will be stepped up. In short, buying individual marijuana stocks has appeared like a far-too-risky strategy. However, this past week brought a first for the investment world -- a medical marijuana exchange-traded fund (ETF) made its debut. An ETF is a security that buys a basket of assets and gives investors the opportunity to effectively diversify their holdings without buying each and every stock, bond, or asset represented in a fund. The ETF, the Horizons Medical Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (TSE: HMMJ), debuted on the Toronto Stock Exchange this past Wednesday. Its objective is to mirror the return of the North American Medical Marijuana Index, net of expenses, and it's currently doing this with 14 marijuana stocks in its basket. Image source: Getty Images. Here are its current holdings, along with respective weighting: There are quite a few interesting aspects worth noting about this ETF. For starters, despite being a North American marijuana stock ETF, it actually has 11 Canadian-based companies and just three U.S.-based pot stocks. That's not necessarily a bad thing, with Canada possibly on the verge of legalizing recreational cannabis, but the recreational and medical market potential in the U.S. is considered to be much larger -- so the weighting is a bit odd. The ETF also isn't strictly comprised of medical marijuana stocks. Though there's clear cannabis product and oils representation with the likes of Canopy Growth, Aurora Cannabis, and Aphria, there are also biotechnology stocks in the mix, such as INSYS, Zynerba, and GW Pharmaceuticals, which focus on developing therapies based on cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. Along those same lines, some of the companies that comprise this ETF have little to do with medical marijuana. Scotts Miracle-Gro, for example, primarily earns its keep from professional lawn care, and is only in this ETF for its recent push into hydroponics. INSYS Therapeutics had the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approve its oral cannabinoid-based chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting medicine Syndros in July, but it generates practically every cent in sales right now from Subsys, a sublingual pain med that has nothing to do with cannabinoids or cannabis. In effect, it's a bit of an imperfect marijuana stock ETF. Image source: Getty Images. If you can buy, the next question is whether it's a good decision. On one hand, Horizons has done a good job of adding the few marijuana stocks that are generating positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- Canopy Growth and Aphria -- and the one that has the best chance of earning significant profits -- GW Pharmaceuticals -- into the mix. Canopy Growth and Aphria have both been working to expand their production capacity, with Canopy Growth doing so by acquisition and Aphria doing so organically. Canopy Growth recently completed its acquisition of Mettrum Health, which boosted its growing capacity, while Aphria began phase 3 of its expansion that's designed to add 200,000 square feet of space. These two positive EBITDA marijuana stocks could see even more benefits if Canada chooses to legalize recreational weed. GW Pharmaceuticals, which is arguably the premier cannabinoid drug researcher in the world, is relying on experimental cannabidiol-based drug Epidiolex to deliver significant profits. Epidiolex met its primary endpoint in two separate phase 3 trials, each for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, two rare childhood-onset forms of epilepsy). If approved by the FDA, Epidiolex has a shot, along with label expansion, at hitting $1 billion or more in annual peak sales, and pushing GW Pharmaceuticals safely into recurring profitability by the year 2020. Additionally, non-traditional cannabis stocks INSYS and Scotts Miracle-Gro are healthfully profitable. But the aforementioned tax, banking, and political disadvantages still remain, making an investment in a medical marijuana ETF pretty risky -- albeit seemingly less risky than buying any individual marijuana stock. If we were to see more of these companies turning healthy profits, or at least generating positive cash flow, there might be a case for consideration. However, with both the U.S. and Canada still viewing pot as illegal, your best bet as an investor is to remain safely on the sidelines until one or both of these countries definitively changes its stance on weed.

The fast-food giant on Wednesday launched an ingenious new 15-second commercial that attempted to hijack Google’s voice-activated Home device — as well as voice-activated Android phones and tablets — into essentially giving free advertising for its Whopper. “You’re watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich,” the commercial said. “But I got an idea. OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?” The utterance of “OK Google” activated Home devices, which then read a lengthy Wikipedia entry on the Whopper, the signature menu offering of Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc.

The change is likely to reassure some advertisers, though it could also upset many of its millions of creators. YouTube said the policy has been in the works since November and is designed to block channels that steal others’ content for revenue. The company has long allowed all video creators to apply to run ads on their videos, and many typically were approved. The open policy enabled advertisers to reach users on little-visited corners of the internet, while amateur video creators could earn a few dollars by posting their projects on YouTube. In some cases, YouTube has also given rise to full-fledged stars who can earn seven-figure salaries each year. But that system also caused some ads to appear alongside objectionable material, such as videos supporting terrorists or touting racist messages.

And investors need to wake up and realize Prime has the same explosive potential that Amazon Web Services showed a few years back — and that the core e-commerce business held over a decade ago. Here’s why Prime is likely to be the next big catalyst for Amazon, and proof that the company is intent on owning every corner of the internet: Triple the cash of Costco: According to Costco Wholesale Corp.’s

                                   latest 10-K annual filing, the warehouse retailer rakes in $2.6 billion annually in membership dues. But in a February 10-K filing, Amazon disclosed it generated $6.4 billion in “retail subscription services” across 2016 — described in a footnote as Amazon Prime membership as well as subscriptions to audio and e-book services. Not only is that triple Costco’s membership cash, it’s up an amazing 43% year-over-year from a tally of just under $4.5 billion in 2015 and up 130% from just under $2.8 billion in retail subscription services back in 2014. A reliable payday: Amazon is playing things close to the vest when it comes to Prime details, but third-party research has long been diving into the details of this lucrative arm of the business. For instance, a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners analysis reported that almost 1 in 5 Prime members don’t pay in a lump sum but rather in smaller, monthly amounts. What better story is there for a business than a service that has big scale, is growing fast and provides consistent monthly cash flow? If this is what we know now… What juicy details will Amazon divulge in future earnings reports that prompts the stock to surge? Think back to all the buzz around the stock and the potential of Amazon Web Services in 2014, and then how the stock soared 14% in a single day after reporting specifics for the first time in spring 2015. It was well-known that AWS was doing well, but seeing the real results in black and white — especially the profitability of this cloud-computing unit — helped this stock more than double in what was otherwise a flat year for the broader stock market. So much more than video: Prime gets a lot of attention as a competing service to Netflix after the recent NFL deal and the critical acclaim for its original series “Transparent” at last fall’s Emmys. But consider 2015 research from Millward Brown Digital that reported Prime customers who visit Amazon.com converted a staggering 74% of the time compared with 13% of non-Prime shoppers and a paltry 3% conversion rate for the top 500 e-commerce merchants writ large. Or consider an ITG analyst who estimated Prime members alone generated more than half of Amazon’s North American retail revenue — roughly $40 billion last year. Or how about a Weinstein report that showed those who joined Prime in 2014 spent an average of $2,147 on Amazon.com in 2015, or Deutsche Bank research that shows 70% of households with annual incomes over $112,000 have a Prime membership? There really is no better name for this subscription service, since these are indeed Amazon’s most prime customers. The sky’s the limit: As we’ve seen time and time again, Amazon is not content with the status quo. So you can be sure that things like Instant Video and free shipping perks are only the beginning of the vision that Jeff Bezos has for this lucrative arm of the business. One effort happening now and that could hold big potential is the ability for Prime customers to sign up for “subscriptions” to certain household goods, with regular re-orders happening automatically. Integration with personal assistant Alexa is also full of possibility, as is testing restaurant delivery in select urban areas. The reach of Prime is impressive and growing, but Amazon continues to explore ways to make this loyal base into even more frequent customers. There are lots of reasons for consumers to like Prime, but as an investor you should be a big believer. Whether it’s additional disclosures about the business when Amazon reports earnings in a few weeks or whether it’s another Prime Day success this summer that rakes in the revenue, sentiment should only improve for the stock and this fast-growing business unit in 2017.

                                   finished down 1.14 points at 5,877.81. For the week, the Dow industrials declined less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.6%. The Labor Department report showed that the U.S. created just 98,000 new jobs in March, marking the smallest gain in almost a year, as hiring cooled. Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted a 185,000 increase in nonfarm jobs. “This is a disappointing jobs report coming in well below consensus,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Financial Partners. “The jobs numbers are historically lumpy, so it’s possible to look past this month, but it’s a negative sign to be certain and should temper some of the risk-on trades that have tried to resume this week after a month of caution in March.” While the jobs report may have disappointed some, many people had been expecting a slowdown with severe March weather on the East Coast being a legitimate reason for retail and construction hiring to slow, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, in an interview. “It wasn’t exactly a disaster, maybe it backs off some of the ultrahawks [on the Fed] and we only get two rate hikes this year,” Stone said. Plus, with earnings season ramping up in the coming weeks, many investors want to sit tight until there’s more clarity, he said. In a bright spot for the labor report, however, the unemployment rate fell to 4.5% from 4.7%—the lowest level in almost 10 years. Meanwhile, the military action late Thursday put investors on edge on a day already loaded with market-sensitive events, including President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping’s closely followed diplomatic talks at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Given the number of geopolitical factors, it’s surprise the market was so calm, said Randy Frederick, managing director at Schwab Center for Financial Research.

The VIX is derived from the prices of S&P 500 index options 30-days in the future and is a barometer of expectations for stock-market turbulence. Market watchers may be betting that the U.S. strike against Syria will be limited and predictable and that it won’t lead to conflict with Syrian ally Russia. “We have been in conflict with somebody since 9/11, so the market has become less reactive to those moves, especially if it doesn’t affect oil,” PNC’s Stone said.

Strikes rattle investors: Nearly 60 Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched against a Syrian air base at dawn local time Friday by the U.S. Navy. Al-Masdar News, which backs the Syrian government, said the attacks caused heavy damage to the Shayrat air base and multiple casualties.

Hours worked totaled 34.3 a week, the same as in February. Separately, a report on wholesale inventories showed a climb in February of 0.4%.

Payless ShoeSource announced Tuesday that it has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and will restructure its operations in North America, including hundreds of store closures. The company is also restructuring its Hong Kong logistics and supply chain entities. Payless became highly leveraged in a 2012 buyout and its debt burden has crushed it during a period of weak sales and cash flow. The list of shuttering stores includes 389 locations across the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

                                   Many traditional retailers find themselves with far too many stores at a time when shopping activity is migrating online. “Everyone realizes that the retail industry is changing as consumers’ preferences are shifting and more people are shopping online, but when a major well-known brand goes into bankruptcy or folds, it makes it real,” said Diana Smith, associate director of retail and apparel at Mintel, a market research company. “The threat comes alive.

Mitch Tuchman,04132017,MarketWatch,04062017,"Published: Apr 7, 2017 10:14 a.m. ET Sometimes it’s about more than the money By What's the fastest way to become a millionaire? Start with a $1 billion and invest in real estate. It's an old joke, but in the case of Donald Trump there's something to it. We don't know the president's true net worth, other than broad estimates in public filings and his own bragging on Twitter. Trump talks up $10 billion. Forbes puts the number at $3.5 billion. Either way, he's rich. But could he have been far richer than even his claim of $10 billion just by diversifying. Forbes identifies real estate as the main driver of Trump's wealth. New York real estate he owns is worth $1.7 billion, Forbes reports. Non-New York real estate comes to $630 million. Tack on another $620 million in value for the golf clubs and resorts. Then $270 million in cash and personal assets, such as stocks and bonds. Finally, his brand business — you know, Trump University, Trump steaks, Trump ties and putting his name on other people's buildings — that's worth $230 million. Depending on who you ask and what day you ask, apparently. So what if Trump had put his money into stocks instead? Cash cow Let's start at the beginning. As the story goes, Trump inherited two things from his father, Fred Trump. One was a serious cash cow in the form of a government subsidy to build affordable housing in the outer boroughs of New York. The other was $200 million from those investments. Unfortunately for Donald, the government program ended soon after he inherited it in 1974. So young Donald went upscale, taking huge bets on Manhattan skyscrapers in a bid to turn his inheritance, already substantial, into a major fortune. He succeeded, yet in the 1990s Trump was threatened with bankruptcy after an ill-advised investment binge that included hotels, casinos, more big buildings and an airline. It's a testament to Trump's craftiness that he was able to convince his lenders to hold off or face years of litigation. Along the way he has made friends and, of course, enemies. By one count, he has been named in more than 4,000 lawsuits over the decades. So Trump spends a lot of money on lawyers. None of it seems to matter to him personally. As he once tweeted, ""Money was never a big motivation for me, expect as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game!"" Read: Dear Adviser: My client is panicking about Trump and wants to sell everything Excitement, wealth. That appears to be the point for someone like Trump. Yet he could have done it in an easier, less dramatic and, frankly, much more lucrative way. How? Just owning the stock market. Assume Trump inherited $1 in 1974, right on Jan. 1. If he had invested that dollar in the broad stock market and reinvested all dividends, by the end of 2016 he would have had $84.11. Scaled up, the $200 million in ""starter"" money from his father today would be worth $16.8 billion. That's a far cry from $3.5 billion. Compounding power Wait a minute, you might say, if he invested $200 million in 1974 and has $3.5 billion today, that's a return (over 43 years) of 6.9% per year. Not too shabby! Ah, but here's the magic of common stock investing using low-cost index funds. Because of reinvested dividends, the adjusted growth rate of stocks over all those years was 10.9% per year. That seemingly small difference, the gap between 6.9% and 10.9%, explains the huge difference in outcomes. The power of compounding creates a gain that's close to five times more money. If Trump had just bought the market and played golf, instead of being ranked 544 on the Forbes World's Richest List, he could have been at 54, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Ray Dalio and Carl Icahn. What's more, he wouldn't be spending so much time in court, nor would he have risked a massive, career-ending personal bankruptcy case along the way. Less ""excitement"" and more money. It's an easy decision, yet like Trump so many retirement investors remain determined to take risks they don't need to take. Investing is easy. It's risk that's hard to measure. Understanding that is the key to retiring with more. ","If Donald Trump had done this, he could have been five times richer - MarketWatch"
,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google will open up its popular Android mobile operating system to rival search engines in Russia as part of a deal to settle a two-year dispute with Russian competition authorities. The deal sets a new precedent for the tech giant, which faces multiple complaints worldwide that it is abusing its dominant position by imposing restrictions on manufacturers of Android-based devices in order to protect its share of the online search market. Russia’s competition watchdog, FAS, ruled in 2015 that Google was breaking the law by requiring the pre-installation of applications, including its own search tool, on mobile devices using Android, following a complaint by Russia’s Yandex. Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the pre-installation of rival search engines and other applications, as part of a deal with FAS, the regulator said on Monday. It will also develop a tool allowing users to choose a default search engine on their Android devices. “Users will be able to change settings at any time and choose the default search engine which suits their needs,” FAS said. Google confirmed the deal, saying it met the interests of all parties. It also said it had reached a commercial agreement with Yandex that “provides new opportunities for Yandex to promote its search service within Chrome (internet browser).” Alexander Shulgin, head of Yandex Russian operations, said he hoped the agreement will have implications for similar cases in Europe and elsewhere. Nasdaq-listed shares in Yandex were up 7.2 percent by 1534 GMT to $24.39 while Google was up 1.2 percent. The deal is for a term of six years and nine months and was approved by a Russian court earlier on Monday. Under the terms of the agreement, Google will still have to pay a total of 439 million roubles ($7.85 million) in fines. ","

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Thursday it suspended 30,000 accounts in France as the social network giant steps up efforts to stop the spread of fake news, misinformation and spam. The move, which comes 10 days before the first round of a hotly contested French presidential election, is among the most aggressive yet by Facebook to move against accounts that violate its terms of service, rather than simply respond to complaints. Facebook is under intense pressure in Europe as governments across the continent threaten new laws and fines unless the company moves quickly to remove extremist propaganda or other content that violates local laws. (reut.rs/2oBwHEO). The pressure on social media sites including Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Facebook has intensified in the run-up to the elections in France and Germany. Facebook already has a program in France to use outside fact-checkers to combat fake news in users’ feeds. Also on Thursday, Facebook took out full-page ads in Germany’s best-selling newspapers to educate readers on how to spot fake news. U.S. intelligence agencies have determined that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. election last year in order to help Donald Trump win the presidency. Officials say a similar campaign is under way in Europe to promote right-wing, nationalist parties and undermine the European Union. In a blog post, Facebook said it was acting against 30,000 fake accounts in France. It said its priority was to remove suspect accounts with high volumes of posting activity and the biggest audiences. Two people familiar with Facebook’s process said the company had strengthened its formula for detecting deceptive accounts being run by automated means. As an example, the new process considers accounts that have smaller circles of friends and that therefore had been less of a priority previously. A key motivator was the need to get tougher on misinformation ahead of the French elections, the people said, although the move also targets accounts that generated spam for financial gain. “We’ve made improvements to recognize these inauthentic accounts more easily by identifying patterns of activity — without assessing the content itself,” Shabnam Shaik, a Facebook security team manager, wrote in an official blog post. The company is using automated pattern-recognition to identify repeated posting of the same content and increases in messaging. Thursday’s action follows other moves by Facebook to make it easier for users to report potential fraud and hoaxes. ","

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"(Reuters) - Verily, Alphabet Inc’s life sciences business, said it was launching a four-year study with about 10,000 participants to understand how people transition from being healthy to becoming sick, and to identify additional risk factors for diseases. Verily is partnering with Duke University and Stanford Medicine in the United States to enroll participants from varying backgrounds at sites in California and North Carolina within the next few months. The study is the first initiative of Project Baseline, a broader effort to develop a reference, or a “baseline”, for what “health” refers to. The study will collect data, as well as biological samples such as blood and saliva. The sites will gather data from participants through repeat clinical visits, a wristwatch that monitors heart rate and activity levels, as well as participation in surveys and polls. “The Project Baseline study has the opportunity to significantly influence our current body of knowledge by better understanding the indicators of wellness,” Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association, said in a statement. “The outcome of this study could inspire a new generation of tools that are geared towards disease prevention versus just diagnosis and treatment,” she added. Beyond this initial study, the project will also test and develop new tools and technologies to access and organize health information. In September, pharmaceutical company Sanofi SA and Verily unveiled a $500 million investment in a joint venture which combined devices with services to improve diabetes care, an example of growing ties between the pharmaceutical and technology sectors. Verily also has several other medical projects in the works, including the development of a smart contact lens in partnership with Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes.

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"(Reuters) - Bose Corp spies on its wireless headphone customers by using an app that tracks the music, podcasts and other audio they listen to, and violates their privacy rights by selling the information without permission, a lawsuit charged. The complaint filed on Tuesday by Kyle Zak in federal court in Chicago seeks an injunction to stop Bose’s “wholesale disregard” for the privacy of customers who download its free Bose Connect app from Apple Inc or Google Play stores to their smartphones. MORE FROM REUTERS Reuters investigates: Lead poisons children in L.A., both rich and poor Verizon experiences subscribers' exodus Civil unrest rocks Venezuela “People should be uncomfortable with it,” Christopher Dore, a lawyer representing Zak, said in an interview. “People put headphones on their head because they think it’s private, but they can be giving out information they don’t want to share.” Bose did not respond on Wednesday to requests for comment on the proposed class action case. The Framingham, Massachusetts-based company has said annual sales top $3.5 billion. Zak’s lawsuit was the latest to accuse companies of trying to boost profit by quietly amassing customer information, and then selling it or using it to solicit more business. After paying $350 for his QuietComfort 35 headphones, Zak said he took Bose’s suggestion to “get the most out of your headphones” by downloading its app, and providing his name, email address and headphone serial number in the process. But the Illinois resident said he was surprised to learn that Bose sent “all available media information” from his smartphone to third parties such as Segment.io, whose website promises to collect customer data and “send it anywhere.” Audio choices offer “an incredible amount of insight” into customers’ personalities, behavior, politics and religious views, citing as an example that a person who listens to Muslim prayers might “very likely” be a Muslim, the complaint said. “Defendants’ conduct demonstrates a wholesale disregard for consumer privacy rights,” the complaint said. Zak is seeking millions of dollars of damages for buyers of headphones and speakers, including QuietComfort 35, QuietControl 30, SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II, SoundLink Color II, SoundSport Wireless and SoundSport Pulse Wireless. He also wants a halt to the data collection, which he said violates the federal Wiretap Act and Illinois laws against eavesdropping and consumer fraud. Dore, a partner at Edelson PC, said customers do not see the Bose app’s user service and privacy agreements when signing up, and the privacy agreement says nothing about data collection. Edelson specializes in suing technology companies over alleged privacy violations. The case is Zak v Bose Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 17-02928. ","

The Trump administration has put Indonesia on a list of 16 countries whose trade surpluses with the United States will be put under review. A series of disputes between Indonesia and American firms has also ruffled ties. “We will work with President Jokowi to reduce barriers to trade and investments and to create a truly level playing field where all our businesses have equal opportunity and market access,” Pence said. Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo. “The president and I spoke about that very candidly and very respectfully,” Pence told a roundtable discussion with business executives in Jakarta before flying to Australia on the last leg of his 10-day Asia-Pacific tour. Indonesia’s investments barriers include a lack of intellectual property protection, insufficient transparency with regulations and requiring local content for manufactured goods sold in the Indonesian market, Pence said. Indonesia’s Investment Coordinating Board chief Tom Lembong said Widodo agreed “we still have too many regulations, too many barriers to trade, and these are bad for local and international industries”. “I’m optimistic because President Jokowi and President Trump are both lifelong business people, and I think they are very focused on the practical issues that hinder business and investment,” Lembong told Reuters. “I feel that the Trump administration and the Jokowi administration are on the same wavelength.” Lembong said Indonesia needs both investment and imports from the United States, “especially productivity-enhancing products and services. You need imports to boost exports.” Neither side disclosed any discussions about the disputes Indonesia has had with American companies of late. Pence did, however, witness the signing of more than $10 billion in memoranda of understanding with U.S. companies in Indonesia on Friday. “We think there are opportunities to clear open the way for American companies to participate more greatly in Indonesia,” Pence said, adding the agreements would “draw our nations closer together and benefit both our people.” COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION Pence said in opening remarks to the roundtable that an attack in central Paris is the latest reminder terrorism can strike anywhere at anytime, and the United States would not relent in its efforts to end terrorism. “The people of Indonesia can be confident in the wake of this latest attack: We will not relent in our effort to end terrorism and the threat it presents to both of our peoples,” Pence said. A French policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded in central Paris on Thursday night in an attack carried out days before presidential elections and quickly claimed by the Islamic State militant group. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, has itself been hit by a series of deadly attacks over the past 15 years, led by militants affiliated with al Qaeda and more recently by Islamic State. Pence said Washington would continue working with Indonesia to combat terrorism. On Thursday, Pence toured the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, Southeast Asia’s largest, and said Indonesia’s moderate form of Islam should serve as an example to other nations. Indonesia has expressed concern about the Trump administration’s proposal to bar entry to citizens of some predominantly Muslim nations. That plan, however, remains stalled in courts. Pence on Thursday announced Trump would visit Southeast Asia in November for an annual series of regional summits. They include the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines. ","

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - IBM’s cloud provides little silver lining. Big Blue fell short of investor expectations and reported its 20th consecutive quarter of falling revenue. Boss Ginni Rometty keeps talking up artificial intelligence and remote servers and services. Competition, however, may prove too formidable. All the financial engineering in the world – and IBM has engaged in a lot of it over the past decade by selling businesses and borrowing to buy back stock – can’t hide that the $160 billion company has been caught short by big shifts in technology. The switch to cloud computing and programs has curbed demand for its consultants, hardware and traditional software. It has survived mass extinctions before, but there’s mounting skepticism it can thrive in the current climate. Over the past five years, the company’s shares have fallen 16 percent compared to a 68 percent increase for the S&P 500 Index. The future for IBM resides in what it calls “Strategic Imperatives.” These initiatives, which include the AI initiative Watson and cloud operations, grew 12 percent over the past year and now account for more than 40 percent of total revenue. Ongoing opacity makes it hard to say exactly what it means, though. IBM doesn’t break out Watson’s figures, for example, because it says it’s a “golden thread” weaving throughout the company. The Cognitive Solutions arm in which Watson is housed only grew 2 percent over the past year. All other divisions shrank. The outlines of IBM’s cloud business are similarly misty. It generated $14.6 billion of revenue – and the services parts of it are expanding at nearly a 60 percent annual clip. An “exit run rate” the company provides for this business, however, is fuzzy, and it’s also hard to discern if it’s additional revenue. By comparison, Amazon Web Services, which is widely considered the industry leader, reported $12.2 billion of sales. Google and Microsoft also are gunning hard to run the data centers and applications needed by companies big and small. The result is brutal price and technological competition. There’s no clear sign yet that IBM can keep up. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

(PYPL) have inked a partnership that enables Android Pay users to make payments using PayPal's app. According to a Bloomberg report, the partnership broadens ""PayPal’s reach into coffee stores, which [PayPal CEO Dan] Schulman sees as key to getting customers to use PayPal more frequently than the current average of two to three transactions per month."" PayPal, which started life as an online payments solution, is attempting to transform itself into a finance tool that can be used in a variety of circumstances, including transfers across borders and daily purchases. However, the deal might not result in a significant transaction uptick for PayPal. According to estimates,  7 percent of Android phone users had used the Android Pay app as of 2015. On the other hand, competitor Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) Apple Pay had 17 percent of its users using its payments app. (See also: Can Paypal Stock Still Pay in 2017?) The Bloomberg report has another take on the partnership. It states that the partnership could ""rekindle"" talk about a Google acquisition of PayPal, and the director of a research firm is cited as saying that the more closely both companies work together, the ""more potential there is for a future combination."" Google's cloud services already count PayPal as a customer. (See also: Alphabet Is Top PayPal Choice for Cloud Hosting.) Activist investor Carl Icahn first sparked this conversation in 2014, when he suggested that a merger between Google and eBay Inc. (EBAY), PayPal's owner at that time, would benefit the Mountain View, California-based company's foray into e-commerce and payments. Much has changed since then, and eBay and PayPal are now separate, publicly traded companies. To be sure, a PayPal acquisition would certainly help Google strengthen its Android ecosystem. PayPal reported revenue of $10.8 billion, up 21 percent on a yearly basis, last quarter.

Daniel Liberto,04202017,Investopedia,04132017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Alphabet Inc.'s Google (GOOG) is considering introducing an ad-blocking feature to its widely used Chrome internet browser in a bid to filter out commercial messages that hinder user web-surfing experiences. According to the Wall Street Journal, the ad-blocker, which is expected to be officially announced by Google in the next couple of weeks, is still in the development phase. Current details being mulled over include whether to block individual ads or all advertising that appears on offensive websites. The tool will reportedly be usable on desktop and mobile versions of Chrome and could be activated by default. The New-York-based newspaper added that Google is likely to consult with the Coalition for Better Ads to establish what type of external messages merit blocking. The industry group released a list of standards in March. In it, pop-up ads, auto-play video ads, prestitial ads with countdown timers and large sticky ads were identified as unacceptable. For mobile devices, it also outlawed flashing animated ads, full-screen scrollover ads and ads with a density greater than 30 percent. (See also: Are Adblockers Changing Internet Business Models?) Given Google’s reliance on advertising revenues — the company generated over $60 billion in revenue from online advertising last year — its decision to potentially block ads appears to be a strange move. It has also attracted some controversy, particularly as it would enable Google, whose Chrome browser is used by nearly 60 percent of the global population, to effectively control the market and cut off revenue from rivals. (See also: Google, Facebook Dominate Digital Ads in 2017.)  According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is building its own ad-blocker in an attempt to stop an increasing number of web users from installing tools offered by other companies. By providing its own solution, Google could, in theory, control which ads are blocked. Google has previously attracted criticism for paying the maker of Adblock Plus, one of the most popular ad-filtering brands, to not block advertisements on its website. However, if the company’s new tool abides by the standards introduced by the Coalition for Better Ads, it will effectively be forced to apply measures that do not necessarily favor its own advertising customers.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Google’s parent company Alphabet plans to build a data center at the private industrial park located just east of Reno, Nevada, in a bid to further beef up its rapidly expanding cloud computing muscle. Reno certainly represents an ideal location to achieve such goals, given its close proximity to Silicon Valley, low costs, lenient rules and ultra fast broadband capabilities — Switch recently hooked up the city with high-speed fiber-optic internet.

This extra revelation, coupled with the fact that 1,210 acres can comfortably house much more than a data center, has sparked speculation that Google’s intentions run much deeper. One of the biggest rumors currently doing the rounds is that Alphabet will use the land to build a testing track for its autonomous driving subsidiary Waymo. Given that Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval is in the process of easing regulations on the testing of self-driving vehicles, the state appears to offer a better environment than the company’s California home to develop autonomous cars. (See also: Alphabet Spins Off New Self-Driving Car Technology Company.) Under Sandoval's bill, which has been backed by companies such as Alphabet, Ford (F) and Uber, self-driving cars will be able to operate as taxis. However, the benefits of this favorable legislation may be of less importance now — Google, together with Apple (AAPL) and Tesla, have recently been given clearance to test autonomous cars in California. The land’s close proximity to Tesla’s huge battery factory also prompted talk that Google might be planning to team up with the electric car maker to develop autonomous driving solutions. Another potential scenario could see the pair join forces in developing clean energy or electric vehicle battery technology. Google refuted claims that it plans to use the site to build a test track.

Among the remaining Jay Z albums on Spotify are his 1997 records In My Lifetime Vol.1 and Reasonable Doubt, as well as 1998’s Vol. 2 Hard Knock Life. Jay Z has also left behind Collision Course, the 2004 album which he recorded with the band Linkin Park, and a few singles he recorded with Kanye West. What could explain this decision? Jay Z co-owns Tidal, a music streaming service that is in competition with Spotify, which has more of a focus on artist exclusives. Jay Z purchased Tidal in 2015 for $56 million with a promise to customers to be a platform with superior sound quality and better compensations for all artists who used it to host their music. Jay Z has also been a vocal critic of tech companies over the issue of compensating artists; in 2015 at an event in New York he had targeted Google, Spotify and Apple, saying they paid artists much less than what they deserved. This could explain his move from Spotify, a company he views as not being artist friendly. It is also worth noting that both Spotify and Apple music are still much larger Tidal. Indeed, they are the industry leaders. Spotify has about 100 million listeners, and 50 million paid subscribers while Apple Music has 20 million subscribers. In contrast, Tidal has less than 3 million. In fact, Tidal has been reported to inflate its subscriber numbers – in September 2015, the same month that Jay Z claimed Tidal had reached a million users, the Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv said it received internal reports from the company showing that it only had 350,000 subscribers. In March last year, Tidal claimed it had 3 million subscribers, while its monthly report to music labels stated it had only 1.2 million activated accounts and 850,000  subscribers. Tidal had also acknowledged that in the past these subscriber numbers had been inflated, and put the blame on past owners. Tidal’s subscriber numbers reached a peak after Beyoncé released Lemonade on the service in April 2016, after which they began to decline, reaching 1.1 million paying customers in October. Thus, this move could be part of a strategy to draw more customers to Tidal. Fortune reports that in response to this, Apple Music has started to offer exclusives of its own, including from Frank Ocean. Spotify in turn has argued that this fragmentation of content is harmful for the experience of music fans, and to the music industry. The Rolling Stones reported last October, that this trend and business of exclusives are/is starting to reshape the music industry, that fans could expect to see artist exclusives continue for the near future, and that music listeners could get used to the idea of having multiple music streaming subscriptions, since one may not have all of the music they want to listen to.

The researchers are recruiting some people in good health, and others who are at high risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease, and outfitting them with sophisticated health trackers and sequencing their genomes, among other things. The goal for the study, said Verily's chief medical officer Jessica Mega, is to ""create a map of human health.""

The Baseline researchers are hoping to find early warning signs for disease from all the data it is collecting, including on sleep, activity, heart rate, genomics and more, which might translate into new lifestyle or therapeutic interventions.

""With the exploding number of wearable trackers, we're gathering all these digital vital signs,"" says Daniel Kraft, faculty chair for the Medicine and Exponential Medicine program at Singularity University, and a practicing physician. ""We don't know what to do with all this data yet."" According to Kraft, Verily is building a ""Google Maps for health care,"" as it is connecting the dots in a similar fashion that the various mapping applications compiled street data, traffic, nearby restaurants, and so on. Part of Verily's role is to use its engineering talent to develop sensor-based technologies to capture a huge volume of health data. To that end, it recently developed its own smartwatch, called Study Watch, which participants will be asked to wear on a daily basis. The watch, which is not intended for consumers, includes features like an electrocardiagram, which might indicate abnormal heart rhythms, plus week-long battery life and large internal storage. Each participant will also get their whole genome sequenced, which costs several thousand dollars. The researchers are also aiming to study other molecular indicators, like the microbiome and proteomics (meaning the analysis of sets of proteins). This fields are still extremely nascent, and it remains to be seen whether such tests will benefit healthy people. These results will be returned to patients over the course of the study, said Adrian Hernandez, professor of medicine at Duke and a lead investigator for Baseline, especially if they require medical care. But Hernandez said it will be ""at least five years"" before the insights gleaned from the study are useful to the general population. The Baseline Project is modeling itself on prior efforts, like the Framingham Heart Study, which kicked off in the late 1940s with more than 5,000 participants. The results of that study showed the importance of regular exercise and a healthy diet in maintaining good health, as well as the deleterious effects of smoking. The new tools and datasets Verily is developing might prove attractive to the broader research community. Both Mega and Hernandez said they are already getting interest from outside researchers about the Study Watch. If it builds such tools for researchers, that would be in line with the plan outlined by Verily CEO Andy Conrad: A ""Google for medical information.""

Arjun Kharpal,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Baidu has opened up its driverless car technology for auto makers to use as it aims to be the default platform for autonomous driving in a bid to challenge the likes of Google and Tesla. The Chinese internet giant said on Wednesday that the new project named Apollo, will provide the tools carmakers would need to make autonomous vehicles. There would be reference designs and a complete software solution that includes cloud data services. Essentially, Baidu is trying to become to cars what Google's Android has become to smartphones – an operating system that will power a number of driverless vehicles. Baidu will open its autonomous driving technology for restricted environment driving in July and then share it for driverless cars running in simple urban road conditions towards the end of the year. By 2020, the company said that the technology will have the capabilities to allow cars to autonomously drive on highways and open city roads. The technology giant has been investing heavily in this area since 2015 and that same year tested fully autonomous cars on highways and roads in Beijing. But the company has also expanded to the U.S. where it received a driverless car test permit for California last year. ""An open, innovative industry ecosystem initiated by Baidu will accelerate the development of autonomous driving in the US and other developed automotive markets,"" Qi Lu, chief operating officer at Baidu, said in a press release. Baidu's move pits it against the likes of Waymo, Alphabet's driverless car company, Tesla and even Uber which is developing its own autonomous vehicles. By offering a suite of tools for carmakers to develop vehicles more easily, Baidu could become widespread in the industry. ","Baidu opens up driverless car tech to challenge Google, Tesla"

""If you're going to invest in artificial intelligence, as a theme there is one great horizontal play, and that's Google ... and there's a great vertical play, and that's IBM."" Shares of IBM took a beating on Wednesday, a day after the company reported its first-quarter sales fell short of Wall Street's expectations, marking five-straight years of declining year-over-year quarterly revenue. The company represents the fourth highest-priced stock in the price-weighted Dow Jones industrial average and is expected to shave nearly 60 points off the index on Wednesday. The disappointing quarterly report comes as the company transitions from its traditional business to one that includes cloud-based services, AI, data analytics and security software. Wang said the company's investment in research and development has been aggressive, spending about 4 percent of revenue on it consistently over the last few years.

Christina Farr,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Former Google executive Stephanie Tilenius recalls pitching an idea to Google X chief Astro Teller for a health-tracking smartwatch in 2012, but there wasn't much enthusiasm for the idea. At the time, she said, the major health projects on the research team included a prototype for a contact lens to measure blood sugar and a data initiative around mapping human genomes. ""If only I had waited 3 years,"" she joked. Today, Verily, a subsidiary of Google-parent company Alphabet, just unveiled a health-tracking smartwatch for research, and it integrates with a variety of consumer-oriented health devices via Android Wear. Smartwatches aside, Alphabet is embracing the $3 trillion health sector in a big way. Alphabet has more than a dozen teams focused on health across its different companies, ranging from anti-aging initiatives to bioelectronics. Tilenius, who joined a growing group of former Google employees in health by launching a health coaching app called Vida, noted that Teller's team went on to seed a number of other ambitious projects in health and life sciences. Many of these efforts, including the contact lens, were brought under the umbrella of Verily, Alphabet's primary life sciences arm. Other venture-backed health companies founded by former Google employees include Omada Health, Color Genomics, Forward, Cardiogram, Nuna, and Flatiron Health. Of Alphabet's ""other bets,"" which include Verily, at least five are investing in or developing products for the health sector. These include Sidewalk Labs, its urban planning subsidiary; Calico, an anti-aging effort; and its investment arms, GV and CapitalG. Google also has a variety of teams working internally on health software and services, such as DeepMind, a deep learning company it acquired in 2014; Google Brain, which is working on machine learning projects in health; and Google Cloud. It also has an ongoing effort within the search team to improve the accuracy of health results. According to former Google employees, some of these teams overlap by coordinating on projects and research. Others function independently from the rest of Alphabet, which is mostly by design. DeepMind and Google Brain actively compete for engineering talent to work on their health care initiatives, said Brandon Ballinger, cofounder of Cardiogram, a heart rate monitoring app. Ballinger, a former Googler, said he often comes up against these companies in recruiting battles. ""This competition is intentional to keep minds sharp,"" he said. Meanwhile, Calico and Verily have their own offices to help them function with their own management structures, although some staff were recruited from Google and still maintain close relationships, said several former Google employees. Google executive Larry Page once described at a conference Calico as ""pretty independent,"" implying that he did not want Google to focus on areas with complex regulations. ""It's a painful business to be in,"" he said. ""People are trying to think about how to do health care in a way that will give them more freedom,"" said Missy Krasner, a vice president of health and life sciences at Box and a former Google employee, who focused on health. ""The thinking seems to be to let innovative projects mushroom up."" During her five years at Google, Krasner worked on an effort to develop software for consumers to store their health records. That initiative, called Google Health, was shut down in 2011 after failing to gain traction. Despite some press reports, Krasner said that executives at the company did not sour on health care after the failure of Google Health. Instead, she hasn't noticed any dimming in the commitment to health, especially when it comes to leveraging its machine learning and AI expertise. As Roni Zeiger, the company's former chief health strategist, put it: ""I think a lens which Google has used for quite some time is by asking how much computing expertise, algorithms and bold creativity be used to impact an area like health.""

Marguerite Ward,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's former SVP of product, advises one of the most important tech CEOs on the planet, Larry Page of Alphabet, Google's parent company. He's also co-author, with executive chairman Eric Schmidt, of business tome ""How Google Works."" It's no surprise that someone with Rosenberg's schedule admits to having an ""addiction"" to his smartphone, something every professional can relate to. But even this busy exec makes a point of putting his phone away while at dinner and before bed. He says the simple habit helps him relax after a busy day and fall asleep. Scientific research says he's on to something. ""I know this is a shock,"" he tells CNBC, ""but I find that I can control my addiction by not using it at dinner, and be sort of human and social."" He also makes a point of not bringing his phone into his bedroom, so that he can fall asleep faster. He's not the only successful business person to encourage professionals to carve out phone-free time. Arianna Huffington, co-founder of The Huffington Post and author of ""The Sleep Revolution"" says that making time to be without your phone will boost your productivity and your overall happiness. While ditching your smartphone for dinner and bedtime may seem easy, it's actually challenging for many people. In a 2015 Bank of America Survey of 1,000 adults, some 36 percent of respondents said they constantly check their phone, and 71 percent said they fell asleep with their smartphone next to them. While keeping in contact with the office and up to date on the news may help you feel productive, constantly reaching for your phone could be doing more harm than good. A University of Illinois study found that frequent cellphone use was linked to  higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. A study published by the U.S. National Library of Medicine found that high mobile phone use was associated with sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression. According to sleep experts from  Harvard University and other research centers, staring at a smartphone at night disrupts your natural circadian rhythm. The specific type of light emitted by smartphones, tablets and laptops signals the brain to stay awake. By not bringing his phone into his bedroom, Rosenberg avoids the distraction and stimulation associated with using a phone at night. Not having your phone in bed with you increases the chances that you'll pick up an actual book and read, which has been shown to reduce stress, boost creative thinking and be part of a healthy sleep routine. ""[Smartphones, tablets and laptops] are incredibly addictive in a good way,"" Rosenberg says. ""But it's important to be able to turn them off periodically during the day and night.""

Sarah Whitten,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"McDonald's latest advertising campaign is missing one very important thing — the name of the restaurant. The burger chain's ""unbranded"" marketing campaign started last week and features actress Mindy Kaling sporting a yellow dress against a red backdrop asking people to do a good search for ""that place where Coke tastes so good."" ""I think it's subtle and appears to be aimed at younger generations,"" Darren Tristano, president of Technomic, told CNBC. ""I think they also want to showcase the fact that McDonald's is online... I think it's a nice gimmick and a strong testimonial from a celebrity. Very likely it won't move the needle, but it does represent a classy shift to a more focused advertising model."" The campaign was designed to cater to millennials who often use their phones while watching TV and will likely use a Google search engine to verify and discover new information, according to the New York Times. If you take Kaling up on her prompt and do the search, it does turn up a long-time discussion of theories some fans have about why they perceive the taste of Coke to be better at McDonald's than other places. The theories range from how the chain filters and chills its water, the freshness of the cola syrup and even the width of the straws, among other things. Deborah Wahl, chief marketing officer of McDonald's, told the Times that the company did not pay for any of the Google search results that praise the taste of its Coke products. ""I would guess that Coke funded this commercial since it heavily focuses on the partnership between McDonald's and Coca-Cola,"" Tristano said. The company currently has three different advertisements featuring Kaling posted to a non-affiliated McDonald's YouTube channel called ""That place where Coke tastes SO good."" Mindy Tweet 1 Kaling has long been a proponent of the Golden Arches, often tweeting about the chain and talking about it on talk shows. Mindy Tweet 2 McDonald's marketing campaign comes just a week after Burger King launched a campaign that attempted to trigger voice-activated Google devices to search for the burger chain. Google ultimately disabled this feature. The company said that Google Home will no longer respond if it hears the Burger King commercial ask ""What is the Whopper burger?"" The device will, however, respond to the user's inquiry. ""This ad is part of our beverage promotion, featuring $1 any size soft drinks and $2 small McCafé smoothies, frappés and shakes,"" McDonald's said in a statement. ""This is McDonald's first unbranded marketing campaign and we are letting the Internet conversation on people enjoying Coca-Cola at McDonald's speak for itself."" Coca-Cola declined to comment.

Ryan Browne,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Baidu Inc, China's biggest search engine, agreed to buy xPerception, a U.S. company that develops visual perception software and hardware, as it expands efforts to produce driverless cars. Often dubbed the 'Google' of China, the Chinese language search provider hopes that the acquisition will strengthen its previous ambitions. Baidu will house the company in its California-based research unit, which is currently developing AI and deep learning software. The company's latest move follows a series of ventures into artificial intelligence, virtual reality and driverless cars. Formed by two former engineers from U.S. augmented reality startup Magic Leap, xPerception's acquisition signaled a challenge from Baidu to Google - which introduced its own driverless car, Waymo, back in 2009. It also opens a window of opportunity for AI innovation from China, a developing field for the country. Rolling out driverless cars has been one of the top priorities for Silicon Valley for years – and it has become a heated race. Google last month took Uber to court alleging that the latter stole the trade secrets behind its driverless car unit. Michael Ramsey, transportation and mobility analyst for the research firm Gartner, explained that the acquisition could ""help push Baidu closer to the leaders"" but that it has a long way to go. ""Right now, the largest tech players are scrambling to catch Uber, which has a big head start on virtually everyone,"" Ramsey told CNBC in an email. ""That means that if you don't have the capability in-house, you have to acquire it. ""XPerception has expertise in processing and identifying images, an important part of the sensing for autonomous vehicles. The purchase may help push Baidu closer to the leaders, but it is just one piece."" Baidu hopes to harness the potential of xPerception's visual perception camera in its bid to develop autonomous cars. The camera's features include sophisticated tracking technology, three-dimensional obstacle detection, and object recognition.

"Elizabeth MacBride, special to CNBC.com",04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Investment legends Jack Bogle and Warren Buffet have a few things in common: They embrace low fees and index investing, and millions of people look to them for investing wisdom. One other thing: When it comes to investing, both are homebodies. Bogle dismisses international diversification. Buffett, meanwhile, says an index fund portfolio of 90 percent S&P 500 and 10 percent Treasurys is probably good enough for most investors — that's how he is recommending his wife invest. But the anti-international stance is the rare piece of investment advice over which many people dare to disagree with Bogle and Buffett. ""I would tend to disagree,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of equities for Charles Schwab Investment Management, who hews to the basic idea that the more diversification, the better. ""Maybe I am not a great investing mind!"" he added with a laugh. Bogle and Buffett don't cast this advice as stone-cold or research-driven. In fact, both say it is more a preference and perhaps geared for investors who need to keep it simple rather than those who want to generate the absolute highest returns for the lowest risk. Diversification is crucial for long-term investors because it tamps down risk, and Nobel Prize-winning science says the more, the better — if you don't pay too much for it. The crux of the case for not worrying about international diversification has always been that the multinationals that make up the S&P 500 generate a signification portion of their revenue from international markets. Holding an S&P index fund, where multinationals like Coca-Cola or Google are generating plenty of money from international sales, is a sort of shortcut to international diversification. Because an S&P 500 index fund is one of the cheapest investments around in terms of fees — the expense ratio on those funds is often under 0.1 percent — it's also a cheap way to diversify internationally. But is that enough in a changing world? If you've been relying on the S&P to capture much of the globe's economic growth as you can over the long term, it could be time to rethink, say a growing number of experts and evidence. The long-term fundamentals in international markets, especially in emerging markets, look good. Growing middle-class populations in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia are likely to propel some markets — most likely those with sound governance — to greater annual GDP growth than the United States. After the eight-year run-up in U.S. stocks, international developed and emerging markets look like relative bargains and are currently among the world's hottest trades. Tim McCarthy, author of The Safe Investor and former CEO of Tokyo-based Nikko Asset Management, said that in an increasingly uncertain world, investors looking for long-term growth with the lowest amount of risk possible should seize all their ""diversification dimensions."" Some advisors or portfolio managers who opt for the S&P shortcut may be doing so in part because they lack the experience or resources to invest internationally: ""To my mind, saying 'I get exposure only through buying the S&P' is like saying 'I get plenty of exposure, but I only buy company names that begin with A through M and don't buy any N through Z.' Why cut your universe of opportunities down so low?"" said McCarthy, who has also held positions at Schwab, Fidelity Investments and for financial firms based in Hong Kong and Seoul. Two of the broadest possibilities: Vanguard's VEA, a developed markets ETF with an expense ratio of 0.09 percent, and BlackRock's emerging markets IEMG, with an expense ratio of 0.14 percent. Five factors suggest direct international investment is worth a look if you've been relying on the S&P, or even if you're invested in international index funds but may have become underweight in recent years.   1. Investors need to be more picky about international diversification. In recent years, U.S. stocks have been gobbling up more of the global stock universe, unseen by many index fund investors. The MSCI All Country World Index weighting represented by U.S. stocks grew from 54.3 percent in 2013 to more than 60 percent last year. The MSCI World Index weighting represented by the United States has also risen — from 48.6 percent in 2013 to 53.8 percent in 2016, according to MSCI. When those markets boom, the upside can be tremendous. For instance, between 1998 and 2007, the MSCI emerging markets index generated an annualized 19.8 percent, according to Luciano Siracusano, chief investment strategist at New York-City based ETF asset manager WisdomTree. The past 10-year period have been a different story — the MSCI Emerging Markets Index ETF (EEM) is up roughly 1.5 percent, according to Morningstar data.  2. There's often an advantage to investing where other people aren't. ""There's a behavioral aspect that creates inefficiencies in the market,"" Aguilar said. Investors who recognize opportunities to diversify internationally may have a leg up, because so many other competing investors have a home bias. Despite the size of non-U.S. markets, U.S. mutual fund investors (excluding institutions) hold, on average, only 15.6 percent of their total equity allocation in overseas stocks, according to Morningstar. That's broken down between 9.8 percent in developed overseas markets and 5.8 percent in emerging markets stocks. 3. The S&P 500 shortcut does not look as good anymore. The percentage of products and services produced or sold by S&P 500 companies outside the United States equated to 44.3 percent in 2015, the lowest level since 2006. It was down from 47.8 percent in 2014 and the 46 percent average from 2009–2013, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That trend looks likely to continue. Multinationals have increasingly been relying on financial engineering, such as share buybacks, to generate returns, while their investment in emerging markets is falling. Developing world investment by multinationals, such as new factories and infrastructure, shrank to $440 billion from $460 billion in 2014–2015, according to the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development. Continuing a long-term trend, African foreign direct investment fell 20 percent, to $70 billion from $90 billion, during the same period, according to UNCTAD.  4. The S&P shortcut doesn't provide exposure to small company stocks in international markets. Some of the highest returns (and highest volatility) are generated by small company stocks, especially in emerging markets. Holding the S&P as your strategy for diversification doesn't give you exposure to any of that upside.   5. Keeping all your eggs in a U.S. stock basket could overexpose you to risks in the U.S. market, which does look a little risky now. ""Given the high value of the present U.S. market, especially with most all the good political news priced into this market, with little of possible bad news, having all your equity money in the United States doesn't feel so safe versus having broader direct international diversification,"" McCarthy said. Respected hedge fund manager Jeffrey Ubben of ValueAct recently returned more than $1 billion capital to shareholders saying the U.S. market valuation was too high for him to not make that move. The S&P 500 is trading at about 21 times trailing earnings, Siracusano said, compared with a 15 to 16 times earnings multiple in international developed markets, and a 13 to 14 times earnings multiple in emerging markets.  The 20th century — when Bogle and Buffett both came to own their respective corners of their investing world — was the American Century, with U.S.-based multinationals the kings of the global business world. The country was so dominant that holding its biggest companies' stocks was a justifiable proxy for holding the world. The question for the long-term investor in the 21st century is whether that will remain the case — and if not, what's the best, diversified portfolio to represent an increasingly level world? Index giant MSCI made the leap to include China A shares in indexes, but they're not the hottest Chinese stocks. Socially responsible funds may not beat traditional equity funds, but SRI funds are generating good enough performance. ETFs have taken in near-$500 billion in the past one-year period, doubling the rate from a year ago.

Anita Balakrishnan,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has done a complete about-face on the fear that artificial intelligence could ""take over"" humanity,  he told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Monday. ""I've totally changed my mind — We aren't talking about artificial intelligence that sits down and says, 'What is my life in the world? What do I have as obstacles? How do I solve them? What should I solve?',"" Wozniak said.  ""Only humans do that."" Wozniak's position is a reversal from his comments a couple of years ago, when he told The Australian Financial Review that there was ""no question"" that computers would take over from humans, and that such a prospect would be ""scary and very bad."" ""What we are talking about for artificial intelligence hasn't gotten to that level of brain functionality yet,"" Wozniak told CNBC on Monday, calling it more like ""semi-intelligence."" Despite swelling popularity of artificial intelligence, Apple hasn't made the splash with Siri that Amazon has made with Alexa, its artificially intelligent assistant. But Wozniak said Apple may be playing its cards close to the vest.

It's a battle of the FANG stocks. Digital video veteran Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) takes on online search and advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), best know for its Google-branded operations. If you could only buy one of these today, which one's the better choice? Let's find out. Image source: Google. If you understand internet-based search and advertising, you understand the current iteration of Alphabet. In that space, Google holds unequaled market share and industry clout. Revenues are soaring, free cash flow growth has accelerated in recent quarters, and share prices more than doubled over the last three years. GOOGL data by YCharts. Business is good, but Alphabet will not fit that mold forever. Search ads brought the company this far, building a massive revenue base from which it can launch many new operations. Some will fail and fade; others are sure to catch on and start producing serious bottom-line profits. The best bets on the table so far include the Waymo self-driving car platform, the Calico medical research company, and an Internet of Things strategy built around the Nest line of smart home products. Alphabet is getting ready to go offline, becoming a conglomerate of wildly different operations in the process. That's how you build a business for the very, very long haul. Buy Alphabet if you don't want to worry about the ""sell"" button for several decades. Image source: Netflix. Unlike Alphabet, Netflix can't boast solid bottom-line results quite yet. Earnings are barely positive, cash flows are diving deep into red ink, and the stock is incredibly overvalued by nearly every traditional metric. Yet, I heartily recommend investors take a closer look at Netflix. All is not as it seems. The company announced and then executed a global rollout, installing streaming video services in nearly every nation on Earth. China remains a difficult nut to crack, and American businesses simply can't work in embargoed territories like North Korea and Syria, so it's not quite 100% coverage. Still, that ambitious, market-growing project is essentially complete. Without the budget pressures of a worldwide service installation to worry about, Netflix's management has promised to increase its bottom-line earnings in 2017 and beyond. Granted, cash flows will stay negative for a few more years. That's a side effect of the company's massive content production plans. The company has financed its production budget via new debt in recent years, and it will probably hit the debt market again in 2017 and 2018. But look at what Netflix will have built, just a couple of years down the road. A global content distribution network will be married to a first-class entertainment studio, creating a two-pronged video entertainment attack like nothing we've seen before. Meanwhile, the portion of humanity that has access to Netflix-grade network connections is growing explosively. Netflix hopes to establish itself as the player to beat in an expanding market, kind of like the Google we knew 15 years ago. The cash investments Netflix is making now are building an impressive content portfolio for the long run, which will continue to bring in and hold onto paying customers for years to come. This is the stock to pick if you're looking for exciting growth in the next 5 to 10 years. Beyond that, I have no idea where Netflix will go. Image source: Getty Images. Let me be clear: There are no bad choices, here. It's the ultimate cop-out, but I'll stand by it. Alphabet and Netflix are two fine long-term investments, but also dramatically different ones. I own both and plan to hold them for many more years. Netflix may need some attention in, say, 2025, as the mature company enters a new era. I could probably leave Alphabet leave alone until my kids graduate from elementary school, grow up, and retire. So, I understand that your mileage might vary, and Netflix certainly offers the bumpier ride. But you probably want to have a bit of both in your portfolio.

Danny Vena,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google announced at its I/O Developers Conference in May 2016 that it had designed a new chip, called the tensor processing unit (TPU), specifically designed for the demands of training artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The company didn't divulge much at the time, but in a blog post that same week, hardware engineer Norm Jouppi revealed that Google had been running the TPU in the company's data centers for more than a year and... ... found them to deliver an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning. This is roughly equivalent to fast-forwarding technology about seven years into the future (three generations of Moore's Law). The chip was an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a microchip designed for a specific application. Little else was known about the enigmatic TPU, and the mystery continued until last week, when Google pulled back the curtain to reveal the inner workings of this new groundbreaking advancement for AI. Google's tensor processing unit could revolutionize AI processing. Image source: Google. The TPU underlies TensorFlow, Google's open-source machine learning framework, a collection of algorithms that power the company's deep neural networks. These AI systems are capable of teaching themselves by processing large amounts of data. Google tailored the TPU to meet the unique demands of training its AI systems, which had previously been run primarily on graphics processing units (GPUs) manufactured by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). While the company currently runs the TPU and GPU side by side (for now), this could have drastic implications for how AI systems are trained going forward. Google released a study -- authored by more than 70 contributors -- that provided a detailed analysis of the TPU. In a blog post earlier this month, Jouppi laid out the capabilities of the chip. He described how it processed AI production workloads 15 to 30 times faster than CPUs and GPUs performing the same task, and achieved a 30 to 80 times improvement in energy efficiency. Google realized several years ago that if customers were to use Google voice search for just three minutes each day, that would require the company to double its existing number of data centers. The company also credits the TPU with providing faster response times for search, acting as the linchpin for improvements in Google Translate, and was a key factor in its AI system's defeat of a world champion in the ancient Chinese game of Go. Companies are taking a variety of approaches to bring improvements to AI systems. Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ:INTC) recently acquired start-up Nervana has developed its own ASIC, the Nervana Engine, that eliminates components from the GPU not essential to the functions necessary for AI. The company also re-engineered the memory and believed it could realize 10 times the processing currently performed by GPUs. Intel is working to integrate this capability on its existing processor platforms to better compete with NVIDIA's offering. A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) processor can be reprogrammed after installation and is another chip being leveraged for gains in AI. FPGAs have increasingly been used in data centers to accelerate machine learning. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is widely believed to have installed this chip in its iPhone 7 to promote sophisticated AI advances locally on each phone. The company has emphasized not sacrificing user privacy to make advances in AI, so this would be a logical move for its smartphones. NVIDIA Tesla P100 powers Facebook's AI server. Image source: NVIDIA. Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) has taken a different approach in optimizing its recently released data center server named Big Basin. The company created a platform that utilizes eight NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU accelerators attached with NVLink connectors designed to reduce bottlenecks, in what it described as ""the most advanced data center GPU ever built."" The company revealed that this latest server is capable of training 30% larger machine learning data systems in about half the time. Facebook also indicated that the architecture was based NVIDIA's DGX-1 ""AI supercomputer in a box."" Though we have been hearing about almost daily breakthroughs in AI, it is important to remember that the science is still in its infancy and new developments will likely continue at a rapid pace. These advances provide for more efficient systems and lay the foundation for future progress in the field. These necessary advances will propel future innovation, but are difficult to quantify in terms of dollars and cents, as well as the potential effects on future revenue and profitability. ","

Brian Stoffel,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. They say that data is so valuable, it is the new oil. With it, you can offer advertisers the most targeted ads possible. Without it, you are drowning in a sea of competition with absolutely no edge. This is the true advantage that investors in search engines like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) enjoy. Aside from Facebook, no other companies have collected as much data, and managed to monetize it. Image source: Getty Images. But which is the better buy today? That's an impossible question to answer, especially because geo-politics can play an important role. Baidu operates almost entirely within the borders of China, and is at the behest of the Chinese government. But that alone shouldn't determine which is the better buy. Alphabet's moat began with Google's unique algorithm that spit out search results faster and more accurately than any other alternative. That algorithm was very popular; it's the reason we ""Google"" for information, instead of ""Altavista"" it. But Google's moat is wider than that: The company has six services in addition to search that have logged over 1 billion users: Google Play, YouTube, Chrome, Android, Gmail, and Maps. Combined, this ecosystem conveys two huge moats. First, Google has more information on user habits than anyone else. This means it can continually offer up products that people are looking for. Other wannabe search engines don't have this data advantage, and can never know for sure where the Next Big Product should be. Second, Google is slowly building out high switching costs. Because users can sign into a dizzying array of sites today just by being signed into their Google account, the switching costs to another search engine have slowly crept up. Who wants to go back and remember all those passwords if they decide against having a Google account? Just about everything I just said about Google applies to Baidu. Google has decided that it isn't going to compete actively in China due to government intervention. Although Baidu has had to deal with a few pesky upstarts, that decision has largely left the Middle Kingdom to Baidu. Baidu has two additional variables worth mentioning. As stated above, the ruling Communist Party in China can exert much more control over Baidu than any other government could on Google, and that's a risk worth considering. At the same time, because the Chinese populace is entering the Age of the Internet much later than Americans, Baidu is trying to capitalize on opportunities Google missed stateside -- namely through creating an Online-to-Offline (O2O) ecosystem, which you can read more about here. In the end, both companies have very wide moats. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see both Alphabet and Baidu start paying dividends before I retire (note: I'm 35 years old now). For now, however, investors want to see cash being poured into profitable new growth opportunities. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Alphabet $86 billion $4 billion $19.5 billion $25.8 billion Baidu $20 billion $5 billion $1.7 billion $2.6 billion Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF P/S PEG Ratio Alphabet 25 22 6.3 1.6 Baidu 38 23 5.9 2.3 Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, Nasdaq.com. P/E uses figures from non-GAAP earnings. Here again we have a very close battle. While Baidu appears to be much more expensive on an earnings basis, the companies are virtually identical in terms of free cash flow -- a metric I give more credence to. In terms of growth -- measured via the PEG Ratio -- Alphabet trades at a 30% discount to Baidu. That's largely because investments in O2O will be holding down Baidu's earnings for the foreseeable future. While it's not a huge difference, we need a tiebreaker here, and it will go to Alphabet. So there you have it, by the thinnest of margins, Alphabet comes out ahead. It has a more developed business line and more favorable valuation. At the same time, Baidu's O2O aspirations could prove to be an enormous boon to investors -- but it's just too early to know for sure. ","

Danny Vena,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Almost everyone with a smartphone is familiar with some of the capabilities of voice-controlled virtual assistants. Siri from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the first out of the gate and may be the most well known. Google Assistant from Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the search giant's latest version of Google Now. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) gave us Alexa, though she is mostly limited to home speakers. Until the release of these virtual helpers, home automation was primarily the dominion of expensive professionally installed systems that controlled everything, or managed services that provided monthly monitoring of things like alarm systems. Both are still available, but the revolution in the smart-home market is playing out in the individual components and smart devices that homeowners can purchase and control with these ubiquitous virtual assistants. One thing to be aware of: Each virtual assistant has advantages and drawbacks, with no clear winner -- yet. Virtual assistants will drive smart-home adoption. Image source: Getty images. Siri is the backbone for Apple's HomeKit, the smartphone app that can be used to control a variety of smart-home products. This platform provides a variety of helpful features to simplify the process of adding devices and labeling ""Favorites."" You can also organize the various components by ""Rooms"" and create ""Scenes"" that will control multiple devices with one command. Another feature is that you can automate certain functions to occur at a specific time of day, or when you leave home. The best feature of HomeKit, in typical Apple fashion, is its ease of operation -- and it can be controlled by the app, or using voice control. A key point is that HomeKit-compatible devices have been reviewed and vetted by Apple, providing end-to-end security. This limits the number of available devices, but will likely prevent you from being hacked. On the downside, Apple lacks a home speaker system. Amazon's Alexa powers the Echo, Echo Dot, and Tap smart-home speakers, but lacks a dedicated smartphone app. Amazon has integrated access to Alexa via its Amazon shopping app on the iPhone by tapping the microphone button in the app. Alexa's advantage is in the number of things she can do -- she accepts over 10,000 commands, called ""skills,"" though they require remembering the very specific wording of each command. These skills address a variety of areas, not just the smart home, though the system integrates with dozens of smart-home devices that work directly with Alexa, and hundreds that operate using a variety of manufacturer-specific apps. Integrating many of these products requires a special If This Then That (IFTTT) device to connect them and to set up routines to control multiple components with a single command. There's also no independent verification regarding device security. Smart homes powered by virtual assistants. Image source: Pixabay. Google recently introduced Home, a smart-home speaker similar to Amazon's Echo. It's powered by a Google Assistant, though not the same Assistant that operates on Google's Android phones or the Allo messaging app -- and they aren't integrated as of this writing. The Assistant on Home works with components from four smart-home partners currently (Nest, Philips Hue, IFTTT, and SmartThings) -- far fewer than Alexa. Google plans to add additional partners over time, though those currently available cover the most used home-automation components. Integrating multiple smart-home products through Home requires an IFTTT device to connect them to each other and set up routines, similar to Alexa. Also similar to Alexa, there's no independent verification of device security, which varies by manufacturer. Home has Google search at its heart, so it understands detailed questions and requests rather than the specific skills commands required by Alexa. Some consumers will be drawn to Echo or Home by the novelty factor, or for the variety of other capabilities, and adding smart-home products will be an unintended result of ownership. Each system has advantages and downfalls regarding its home-automation capabilities. No one has yet developed a ""killer app."" At this point, smart-home products seem to represent more of a hobby than something designed to produce significant revenue growth for any of these companies. However, the team of Alexa and Echo has an advantage for Amazon not available to Apple or Google. A recent analyst note by Jim Shaughnessy and Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets reported that 17% of current users of the Echo family of products placed orders to Amazon.com with their devices, which could result in additional sales of $10 billion in both products and devices annually by 2020. While the hardware war is being waged, Amazon might enjoy a nice little boost on the e-commerce side. ","

"Jason Hall, Brian Stoffel, and Brian Feroldi",04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the best investing stories ever. To date, anyone smart -- and lucky -- enough to have bought shares the first day of trading and held them would be up a remarkable 45,900%. That's a life-changing investment, turning every $1,000 invested in the company into $459,000. Investment opportunities like that don't happen very often. And while we'll be the first to admit that it's almost impossible to really know which stocks out there right now will deliver Amazon-like returns, that doesn't mean you shouldn't look for companies with the same kind of potential. And our contributors have identified three stocks with traits that could lead to life-changing returns for investors. Image source: Getty Images. Keep reading to learn why e-commerce specialist Shopify Inc. (US) (NYSE:SHOP), online-only bank BofI Holding, Inc. (NYSE:AX), and senior housing and rehab property owner Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE) have Amazon-like potential. Brian Stoffel (Shopify): When I think about finding the next Amazon.com, I think about finding companies that share a few key traits: In all three of those respects, Shopify fits the bill. Shopify is a leading provider of e-commerce solutions to small and medium-sized businesses throughout the world. The company offers up its platform with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model. CEO Tobias Lutke founded Shopify in 2004. Combined with his leadership team, Lutke and company own 14 million shares of Shopify, worth about $1 billion and representing almost 60% of voting rights. Furthermore, Shopify is a wide-moat business. Small and medium-sized businesses can't survive without an e-commerce presence in the age of the Internet. But these very same businesses can't afford to spend all their time worrying about e-commerce -- they need to focus on the things that make their products and services valuable and unique. That's why once a vendor is signed on to Shopify's platform, the switching costs -- in terms of money spent, downtime, retraining, and headaches in general -- are high. Finally, the company is growing at amazing rates. Take a look at how sales and gross profit have jumped since 2012. Data source: SEC filings. But perhaps most important, Shopify has gotten a huge vote of confidence from... Amazon. After trying to design its own e-commerce platform that vendors could use, Amazon decided it was best to partner with Shopify rather than compete against it. That speaks volumes. Brian Feroldi (BofI Holding): There are plenty of numbers to watch in the banking sector, but one of the most important is the efficiency ratio. This figure measures the percentage of a bank's total revenue that's consumed by operating costs. The lower the figure is, the better. In the banking industry, an efficiency ratio below 60% is considered to be good, while the best big banks regularly put up numbers in the low to mid-50s. However, those numbers are still not even in the same ballpark as BofI Holding's recent efficiency ratio of 36%. BofI has used its extreme cost advantage to offer attractive rates to consumers -- I saw the difference myself when I recently refinanced my home mortgage. In turn, the company has grown at a breathtaking rate, taking shareholders on a profitable ride. BOFI Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT): Much of Amazon's success is a product of timing. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos saw a tremendous opportunity to leverage the burgeoning internet as a marketplace, just as tens of millions of Americans were getting online for the first time. Fast-forward 20 years, and shopping online -- especially on Amazon -- has for millions replaced going to the mall. Caretrust could be another company in the right place at the right time. Just as millions of people were first getting online 20 years ago, millions of Americans are reaching retirement age every year now -- a trend that's set to continue for decades, as we live longer and more active lives. A growing elderly population will require more care facilities. Image source: Getty Images. That's where Caretrust comes in. As a small operator with just over 150 properties, there's a significant opportunity to grow. The 65-plus population is expected to increase from around 47 million in 2015 to more than 81 million by 2040. Considering there are fewer senior nursing facilities operating today than there were in 2000, this is undoubtedly a growth industry. And like Amazon, Caretrust is founder-led, with CEO Greg Stapley playing a key role in building Caretrust when it was spun out of Ensign Group (which he also co-founded) in 2014. ","
      
    3 Stocks With Promising, Amazon-Like Growth Potential -- The Motley Fool

Travis Hoium,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Every day at least one delivery truck from UPS (NYSE:UPS) and one from FedEx (NYSE:FDX) pulls up in front of my apartment building. A half dozen boxes, each, on average are loaded on a cart and wheeled into the building to be delivered to residents. These days, an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) driver periodically pulls up with a box or two as well, cutting UPS and FedEx out of the delivery process. It's no secret that Amazon is both the elephant in the room in online retail and shipping as well as building out its own delivery network. The company has leased planes, contracted with drivers to deliver packages, and even invested in delivery drones. And while Amazon may be trying to cut UPS and FedEx out of the equation, if they're smart they have a very bright future with other retailers. Image source: Getty Images. If you pay close attention to retail, you've noticed there's a fundamental shift in the way products are developed and sold today. Lots of new companies are foregoing trying to get the big sale to a big box retailer and going straight to consumers. Blue Apron, Meundies, Nature Box, Bombas, and many others are introducing products that are advertised online or on podcasts straight to consumers. Purchases are made with no middleman and UPS, FedEx, and the post office handle the delivery. Big brands like Nike, Apple, Samsung, and Disney are trying to cut out the retail channel altogether as well, building direct marketing campaigns. As they grow direct sales, they'll lean on UPS and FedEx to get products to customers, adding another growing customer base to the delivery companies. As more large brands go direct and direct sales product companies pop up, they'll be a growth market for UPS and FedEx. And many, like food delivery services, are recurring revenue businesses, not tied to the holiday season. They'll create a foundation of growth outside of Amazon's enormous shipping demands. What UPS and FedEx have to avoid is being a cheap peak demand shipper for Amazon's business, particularly during the holidays. Amazon wants to be able to build its own logistics operation it can run full steam, offloading peak demand to companies like UPS and FedEx. But if they're not compensated appropriately, they'll lose money building capacity to meet peak need that's then idle during slower seasons. But here's where the duopoly these two companies have in shipping may come in handy. They'll compete with each other for Amazon's business, but neither is desperate enough to make Amazon a loss leader as a customer. The risk of being disrupted is one of the biggest risk factors investors should watch for. And with Amazon building out its own delivery infrastructure and growing its online retail market share, it may appear that UPS and FedEx are going to be disrupted by one of their biggest customers. But as Amazon grows, so does the network of innovative product companies who will disrupt retail, going directly to customers, including big brands. And as that base of customers grows they'll lean more and more on UPS and FedEx to get their products out to the world. That's a great base to grow from and makes both stocks great buys long-term because the number of online direct-to-customer sales is only going up. ","

After the bombshell that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dropped on current graphics technology supplier Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF), analysts with Bankhaus Lampe said (by way of Reuters) that Apple is working on a custom power-management integrated circuit (PMIC). Such a chip would replace the PMICs that Dialog Semiconductor (NASDAQOTH:DLGNF) currently sells to Apple. Image source :Dialog. That would be extremely bad news for Dialog -- potentially game-ending, in fact -- because in its fiscal year 2016, sales to Apple made up more than 74% of its total revenue, according to its most recent annual report. Reuters, citing a ""source familiar with the matter,"" reports that Apple is, at the very least, ""recruiting top Dialog engineers in Munich"" and even quoted that source as saying that ""They [Apple] are poaching like crazy."" I set out to try to gather some evidence myself. One of the best ways to do that was to stroll over to Apple's job boards to see what the company is hiring for. I did a search for ""PMIC,"" and sure enough I found a listing for a ""Chip Architect"" position in Munich, Germany. The job summary reads: ""Technical leadership of Mixed Signal Power Management IC for battery operated portable devices."" The iPhone is, quite clearly, such a device. The job description also says that this engineer will work to ""define optimum chip architecture for mixed signal IC in cooperation with power management system team"" and will ""collaborate with system architect and system team to specify overall requirements for overall PMIC system."" A search for the broader term ""power management"" on Apple's job board, including looking for positions in Germany, revealed nine job postings that appear to be related to the development of PMICs or related subsystems. It seems reasonably likely that Apple is cooking up something. Dialog issued a press release following the public dissemination of the key contents of the Bankhaus Lampe report. In that release, Dialog said that it ""knows of no business reason for this movement [in the stock price] and confirms that it remains comfortable with its guidance for the first quarter and its prospects for the year."" Dialog also said that it its ""level of visibility into the design cycle of its leading customers remains unchanged"" and that the ""business relationships are in line with the normal course of business."" Investors were apparently soothed by this response as Dialog's stock price, after initially tanking, made up some (though not all) of the ground that it lost following the Bankhaus Lampe report. Image source: Google Finance. Dialog reaffirmed its guidance for the current quarter and for the rest of the year and even offered some comforting words about its ""level of visibility"" into upcoming product designs at its ""leading customers,: which presumably, includes Apple. That probably means Dialog is safe for at least a couple of product generations, an argument that analysts with RBC made in defending the stock. That's good, but here's the thing: Apple had been building up its graphics chops for years, dating at least to 2013, and it wasn't until a couple of weeks ago that Apple told Imagination Technologies that it'd be designed out of future Apple processors within 15 to 24 months. My purpose in pointing this out isn't to necessarily say that Dialog will necessarily lose Apple's business in the near to medium term, but to make the point that the lead time between when Apple starts staffing up to try to ""roll its own"" components and when those components wind up in devices can be quite long -- well outside a supplier's level of visibility. For that reason, it's important to be a bit cautious when investing in companies with large portions of revenue coming from a handful of customers. ","

Possibly no other consumer technology is getting as much attention as virtual reality (VR) right now. Tech companies are spending billions of dollars to develop new VR tech, or acquire it, and some, like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), believe that it could be the next major computing platform. VR's market is poised to skyrocket over the next few years, jumping from $13.9 billion in 2017 to an estimated $143.3 billion in 2020. Part of this early growth will be fueled by VR headsets, which are expected to hit worldwide sales of 200 million for the six-year period ending in 2020, according to Tractica. Image source: Getty Images. All of these stats point to potentially good times ahead for companies focusing on VR. The question, then, is which companies are beginning to dominate the space. A recent survey released by ReportLinker sheds some light on the subject, and shows that Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Gear VR headset is already the most recognizable VR headset among consumers, and shows no signs of slowing down. Samsung released its virtual reality headset, called the Gear VR, back in 2015, and, according to ReportLinker, the company's device is synonymous with virtual reality more than any other company's offering. ""More respondents quoted Samsung as a player in the new virtual reality industry: three out of ten respondents spontaneously mentioned the brand. There were less than 10% who could, last September,"" the survey said. When respondents were asked which brand first came to mind when thinking about virtual reality headsets, 28% named Samsung, followed by just 11% for Sony (NYSE:SNE), 10% for Facebook's Oculus, 5% for Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, and just 2% for HTC. And when asked which VR headset respondents had heard about, survey respondents overwhelmingly chose Samsung's Gear VR. Take a look: Image source: ReportLinker. Let's take a moment to recap these stats. Samsung's brand is two times more recognizable for VR headsets than Sony or Oculus, and consumers have heard of its Gear VR headset at nearly double the rate that they've heard of the Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard. In the consumer market, that's a slam dunk for Samsung. Nailing down why Samsung is the most recognizable VR brand and why its Gear VR is the most well-known device isn't an exact science. The ReportLinker survey suggests that increased marketing efforts over this past holiday season were a major factor: ""With marketers' efforts and the availability of VR headsets in stores before Christmas, more respondents were able to try them, which explains better awareness of the VR technology and brands,"" the survey said. Samsung may be benefiting the most because its Gear VR headset launched over two years ago, which was earlier than both the Oculus Rift and Sony's Playstation VR, though it launched after Google's Cardboard. Samsung continues to aggressively market the Gear VR, and has recently started giving away a free headset when consumers pre-order its Galaxy S8 phone. The bigger question for Samsung and its competitors is if, and when, VR will become profitable. Research firm IDC says that software and services -- and not hardware -- will eventually be the most profitable part of VR, but companies need to first get hardware into people's hands, of course. Samsung might be dominating the VR headset name-recognition space right now, but investors should also keep a close eye on which companies are taking the lead in software and services. In that light, Google, Facebook and Sony could prove to be better long-term buys in virtual reality. ","

Neha Chamaria,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Predictions of gold and gold stocks falling as interest rates rise are proving to be quite far off the mark. Gold prices just hit five-month highs, and most gold stocks are turning out to be outperformers this year, thanks to gold's flight-to-safety appeal. Donald Trump's presidency has come with its fair share of unpredictability, and Brexit and geo-political events like the Syrian strike have created the perfect environment for gold -- and everything related, such as gold mining stocks -- to thrive. For investors, the timing couldn't be better to invest in gold stocks, and the industry is still abuzz with plenty of golden opportunities. But before I tell you the top gold stocks to buy for 2017, take a look at how the biggest names have fared so far. Data source: Google Finance. *As of April 12, 2017. Among these, I believe the following three gold stocks are the best you can buy today given their growth potential. Given how volatile gold prices can be, cost is perhaps the most important determinant of a gold miner's profits. Barrick leads the pack, with its stunning transformation in 2016 making it a top gold stock to buy. There's never a wrong time to buy gold stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Barrick not only slashed its all-in-sustaining costs (AISC) by 12% to $730 per ounce, it also reduced debt by $2 billion and generated record $1.5 billion in free cash flow last year. For shareholders, Barrick's turnaround has meant a two-way gain: the appreciation in stock price, and the recent (huge) 50% hike in dividends that came after several years of hiatus. Having taken care of a better part of its non-core assets and debt, Barrick is now shifting focus on growth. It recently extended a partnership with Goldcorp to jointly operate its Cerro Casale mine at Chile, and it also joined hands with China's leading gold miner to explore the high-potential El Indio Gold Belt on the Argentina-Chile border. While these moves should ensure Barrick's reserves last decades, its immediate goals to slash debt further by $2.9 billion by next year, remain FCF-positive at gold prices of $1,000 per ounce, and maintain AISC below $770 per ounce through 2019 should bring in rich rewards for shareholders. Given the offbeat, high-margin nature of the precious metal streaming business, it's only fair to include a streaming stock on my top gold stock picks for 2017. Between Franco-Nevada and Royal Gold, the latter offers greater dividend security, but Franco-Nevada's growth catalysts are stronger. Franco-Nevada's 2016 revenue source. Image source: Company's April, 2017 corporate presentation. Franco-Nevada has grown its profits, cash flows, and dividends at a strong pace in recent years thanks to large exposure to gold and a diversified portfolio, as you can see in the picture on the right. As a royalty and stream company, Franco-Nevada buys metal stream from traditional miners at low costs in exchange for upfront financing. Some of its top mining partners today include Barrick, Teck Resources, Glencore, and Coeur Mining. Franco-Nevada's projected gold equivalent ounces production of 515,000 to 540,000 by 2021 represents roughly 14% growth over 2016, which itself was a record production year for the company. The other interesting thing is the exposure to oil that Franco-Nevada offers. Its impending acquisition of $110 million worth of oil and gas royalty rights in the Midland Permian Basin combined with its recent $100 million investment in the STACK play in Oklahoma should leverage Franco-Nevada to growth opportunities in eight out of the top 20 active oil counties in the U.S. The company believes it could triple its oil and gas revenues in the next decade. Given its growth prospects, Franco-Nevada looks poised to be a winning gold stock in the long run. Goldcorp, one of the largest gold miners in the world, has just come off a year of restructuring that helped it lower AISC by roughly 4% to $856 an ounce and swing to profits from losses in 2015. But it's the miner's recent growth moves -- including its acquisition of a 25% stake each from Barrick and Kinross to become a part-owner in Cerro Casale -- that should get investors excited. Meanwhile, Goldcorp expects to bring down its AISC to $700 per ounce and increase gold production by 20% in the next five years. This balanced approach to growth and costs should be rewarding to shareholders in the long run. Goldcorp stock is still down about 11% in the past year and hugely lagging Barrick, offering investors in gold a great entry point right now. ","
      
    3 Top Gold Stocks to Buy in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Wendy Connick,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When a business wants to raise money by attracting investors, it can do so by issuing stock in one of two flavors: common stock or preferred stock. Both types of stock are offered for sale on the various stock exchanges. Ticker symbols for preferred stocks usually (but not always) have a P at the end, depending on which stock market ticker you're looking at. Both common stock and preferred stock are worthwhile investments, but depending on your needs, one class of stock may be a better choice for you than the other. Understanding what each of the stock classes has to offer can allow you to choose the one that has the best chance of fulfilling your highest priorities. Common stock is what most people think of when they think ""stock."" Common stock allows its holders to make a profit through rising share prices and dividend payments. Holders of common stock also get to vote on corporate issues, such as electing new directors to the corporation's board. However, should the company end up in bankruptcy, holders of common stock are last on the list to get their money back -- after regular creditors, bondholders, and holders of preferred stock. If you hold common stock and the company goes bust, you are unlikely to get any of your capital back. Preferred stock also represents owning a share of the company, but it works a bit differently than common stock. Preferred stock pays a predetermined dividend, whereas the dividends paid to common shareholders tend to vary according to the company's fortunes. Dividends on preferred stock are often larger than those on either common stock or the company's bonds. Holders of preferred stock do not get a vote on company matters. And if a company's assets are liquidated, the preferred stockholders get to redeem their shares before common stockholders do, giving them a better chance of getting at least some of their money back. Image source: Getty Images. Preferred stock generally pays a higher dividend than common stock, but in certain circumstances this can change. Because preferred stock dividends are set at the time the stock is issued, if the company should decide to issue a larger dividend than it originally planned, the dividends on common stock will go up (and can rise above those for preferred stock), but the dividends on preferred stock will not. In some ways, preferred stock is like a cross between a bond and common stock. Preferred stockholders get some of the best of both types of investments, but they also get the drawbacks. Preferred stock is typically far more volatile than a bond -- in fact, it can be nearly as volatile as common stock, though its fixed dividends lend it a bit more stability. And shares of preferred stock, like bonds, are sometimes callable, meaning that the corporation has the right to buy back those shares at a set price any time it chooses. The voting rights that holders of common stock enjoy are generally of little benefit unless you own a significant percentage of the company's stock. While the dividends are typically lower than those paid by preferred stock shares, the value of common stock tends to rise more quickly than the value of preferred stock when the company thrives (and fall faster when the company runs into trouble). For most investors, common stock is a better deal. It's slightly riskier than preferred stock, but will usually show a slightly higher return as well. If you want to enjoy the potentially high returns of a stock investment but want to minimize your investment's volatility or your exposure to company-specific risk, preferred stock might be a better choice. Preferred stock may also be better if you're looking for a source of income you can depend on, as the dividends paid on such stock are fixed. But whichever class of stock you choose, be sure that it's an investment you'll feel comfortable holding over the long haul. ","

Shares of Alphabet soared 1.8% to close at $855.13 on Monday. They’ve increased 3.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the S&P 500. Amazon, Apple and Facebook have all outperformed over same time period, gaining 11%, 18% and 10.5%, respectively. The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $982.26, according to a FactSet survey. In a note to clients released Monday morning, Credit Suisse increased its cloud revenue estimate, added in additional revenue Google is expected to make from the newly-announced YouTube TV streaming service and forecast a larger-than-expected contribution from Google’s non-search business, including Google Cloud and Google Play. See also:  YouTube TV promises 50 major broadcast, cable channels for $35 a month Among the problem areas are larger investments to enhance its cloud services business, which have weighed on profit growth and margins. Another worry that has dampened investor sentiment has been the deceleration of Google’s established search business, though Ju said that has caused investors to overlook some of the fast-growing aspects of Google’s business, such as the cloud. YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud, while often are overshadowed by Google Search, are expected to make up one-third of Alphabet’s total revenue within three years, according to Credit Suisse. Last quarter, Google’s web sites raked in nearly $18 billion in revenue, comprising 85% of total sales.

Meanwhile, GM said Thursday it plans to invest $14 million and create more than 1,000 jobs in a California facility to advance its self-driving car technology and zero-emissions vehicles. Ford, which has beefed up its presence in Silicon Valley, said last year it could sell a driverless car in five years. Apple reportedly has been working on a driverless car for several years under the code name Project Titan, but has never publicly disclosed the effort despite issuing opinions about regulations for driverless cars. Such efforts have excited some observers who believe Apple needs to add another big-ticket item to continue to grow as its iPhone sales level out. Not everyone believes the company can succeed in the field, however. Shares of Apple have gained 22% so far this year, which compares with 4% gains for the S&P 500 index.

New York Post,04202017,MarketWatch,04132017,"Published: Apr 20, 2017 1:53 p.m. ET By Tin-foil hats might not protect you from this threat. Audio giant Bose has been spying on customers that use its wireless headphones via an app that tracks the music, podcasts and other audio they listen to, a lawsuit charged. Bose, in turn, has been violating customers’ privacy rights by selling their info without permission, according to the federal suit filed Tuesday in Chicago. The complaint filed by Kyle Zak seeks an injunction to stop Bose’s “wholesale disregard” for the privacy of customers who download its free Bose Connect app from Apple or Google Play stores to their smartphones. “People should be uncomfortable with it,” Christopher Dore, a lawyer representing Zak, said in an interview. “People put headphones on their head because they think it’s private, but they can be giving out information they don’t want to share.” Bose did not respond on Wednesday to requests for comment on the proposed class action. The Framingham, Mass.–based company has said annual sales top $3.5 billion. Zak is seeking millions of dollars of damages for buyers of headphones and speakers, including QuietComfort 35, QuietControl 30, SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II, SoundLink Color II, SoundSport Wireless and SoundSport Pulse Wireless. He also wants a halt to the data collection, which he said violates the federal Wiretap Act and Illinois laws against eavesdropping and consumer fraud. Dore, a partner at Edelson PC, said customers do not see the Bose app’s user service and privacy agreements when signing up, and the privacy agreement says nothing about data collection.

Oracle has taken another step to enlarge its data capabilities, announcing Tuesday that it has agreed to buy ad verification firm Moat. Moat specializes in viewability, brand safety and detecting non-human traffic. Oracle said it will remain independent, providing analytics to brands like Nestlé and to publishers like NBCUniversal and ESPN. Deal terms were not made public. Pund-IT analyst Charles King told me that he wasn’t surprised by the acquisition, which he described as “an incremental improvement” in Oracle’s quest to build cloud-based services for enterprise customers. Moat is frequently mentioned in conjunction with competitor Integral Ad Sciences (IAS), such as in their recent involvement as third-party verification for Facebook. IAS CEO Scott Knoll said that Moat’s new status as part of Oracle’s large marketing and data ecosystem “doesn’t change things at all.” He added that there isn’t another marketing/data platform that owns such a vendor. When asked if this relationship created problems for Moat, since Oracle has access to targeting and other data that impacts online ads, Knoll acknowledged that “some people may be concerned by [the possibility of] bias,” although he added that he saw no obvious conflict. He pointed out that IAS is “completely independent.” Jay Friedman, COO of programmatic media and planning firm Goodway Group, told me that this acquisition “gives Oracle a pervasive pixel on all impressions.” In other words, he argued, Oracle has been able to offer targeting data to advertisers so they could find, say, online users who might like sport drinks. But now they can also see which sports drinks ads were served — and possibly make a pitch to sports drink advertisers that they could have had better targeting data if only they had used Oracle’s Data Cloud. “This enables them to get much smarter about who is using their data, who could use more, and where advertisers are getting users they wanted anyway without paying for the data.” The latter situation, he said, might be when the advertisers just buy site inventory without user targeting, such as inventory on the ESPN site to reach sports drinkers. Andrew Frank, VP at research firm Gartner, noted that Oracle has pointed out it has “three pillars” in its Data Cloud — a Device Graph for cross-identifying users with their devices, 360-degree profiles of customers and measurement. The latter capability had previously been secured by, say, ad attribution via Oracle’s Datalogix acquisition, but now it is boosted by Moat. He added that Moat now gives Oracle an opportunity to enter “currency metrics,” meaning the data — such as which ads are delivered where — on which ad contracts are based. Frank also pointed out that Moat also provides Oracle with a measurement service that has been accredited by the Media Rating Council.

Caroline Baum,04202017,MarketWatch,04132017,"Published: Apr 17, 2017 9:22 a.m. ET Four ideas to make paying taxes less painful By April 15 means one thing, and one thing only, to Americans, (even if the 15th falls on the 18th as it does this year): tax-filing day. The daffodils are in bloom, the birds are chirping as they scout possible venues for nest-building, and we humans are stuck inside with endless forms and incomprehensible schedules, which more often than not forces us to seek the help of a tax professional. What better time for Congress to attempt real tax reform than now, when the public is fed up with the cost — time and money — of complying with an increasingly complex tax code? As I wrote last month, tax reform is complicated. The concept is a winner with almost everyone, tax attorneys notwithstanding. The problem is the execution: the reduction or elimination of tax breaks required to facilitate a simpler, flatter tax code. Is there a way to make the dreaded April 15 tax deadline just another day in the calendar year? Here are some possible solutions. 1. Move the date One problem with April 15 is its timing. Americans go to the polls in early November. They pay their federal and state income taxes five months later. The two events are disconnected. By the time April 15 rolls around, the cost of government (taxes) is totally divorced from the benefits we receive, as determined by our elected representatives. Maybe it’s time to link costs and benefits in the minds of taxpaying voters. A decade ago, Roscoe Bartlett, a Republican congressman from Maryland, tried to do just that. Bartlett, who fashioned himself as a citizen legislator, introduced H.R. 77 in January 2007. The bill proposed to change the tax-filing deadline from April 15 to the first Monday in November, which happens to be the day before Election Day. Bartlett believed taxes should be a top priority for Americans and wanted to re-establish the connection between what we pay and who earns our vote. Congress has the authority to change tax-filing day, but it is not costless. When Bartlett introduced his bill in 2007, the National Taxpayers Union estimated that changing the date would cost the federal government $3 billion: notifying taxpayers, updating computers and, most importantly, finding a source of revenue to carry the government from April until November. Our tax system uses an array of gimmicks to distract us from our true tax burden. Income taxes are automatically withheld from our paychecks. Payroll taxes are withheld for Social Security and Medicare (employee and employer share the burden). Some people pay estimated taxes four times a year. About 70% of taxpayers will receive a refund this year, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Many of them treat it as some kind of “gift,” which makes no sense. What it is, is an interest-free loan to the U.S. Treasury. While it’s true that the Treasury has been able to borrow for the last eight years at negligible rates of interest, it still makes no sense to let the government have free use of your money. At minimum, buy some T-bills. 2. A flat tax The flat tax, as originally conceived by economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka in 1981, would tax income once, and only once, at a flat rate of 19%. That rate was chosen because it was found to produce the same amount of revenue as the prevailing tax system. Workers would pay tax on wages, salary and pension distributions. Businesses would pay taxes on sales after deductions for wages, salary, pension contributions, materials costs and capital investment. No deductions, no double-taxation, no 1099 forms. To make the system more progressive, only earnings above a per-family allowance would be taxed. Some economists view the flat tax as a backdoor route to a consumption tax. (You can read the explanation here because I have never been able to grasp the connection.) They agree that, absent the inefficient allocation of resources encouraged by loopholes in the current tax code, the economy would be better off. It’s hard to argue with the simplicity of the flat tax. Add up a few numbers, multiply by 0.19, then go out and smell the flowers on April 15. 3. A national retail sales tax A group known as Americans for Fair Taxation has been promoting a true consumption tax, known as the FairTax, since 1995. A bill to replace the current tax code with a national consumption tax is regularly introduced in Congress. What would it cost? Advocates of the FairTax talk about a 23% “inclusive rate,” or the amount of tax that the seller remits to the government. The true mark-up rate — the rate that the customer pays at the register — is 30%. People swoon when they hear that. A can of soda that normally sells for $1.50 would cost $1.95. What they forget is: no income tax, no payroll tax, no IRS. That’s it. And there is a “prebate” for low-income households. Fair and simple. 4. Avoidance Don’t pay your taxes. You will not be alone. Last year, the IRS reported that the average annual tax gap — the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid on time — was $458 billion in years 2008-2010. That’s 18% of the total tax liability. The IRS recovered $52 billion, leaving a net tax gap of $406 billion, most of which is owed by individuals. IRS enforcement has declined in recent years as budget cuts stretched available resources. So you may just get away with being a tax scofflaw. Even if you are caught and convicted of tax evasion, you still won’t have to worry about April 15. Tax day is not a big day in the Big House. It’s the other 364 days you have to worry about. ",How to make Tax Day just another day on the calendar - MarketWatch
 ,04202017,MarketWatch,04132017,"Last week, Facebook announced that Messenger now has 1.2 billion monthly users, making it one of the most popular messaging apps in the world. With so many users on its platform, it's no surprise that businesses have been clamoring to be on Messenger as well. At last count, 60 million businesses are on Facebook, and 80 percent of them have messaging enabled. The idea is that be it with a real-life human or a simple chatbot, the direct Messenger conversations between businesses and consumers will make users' lives ""more seamless and fun."" With Messenger Platform 2.0, Facebook hopes to realize this even further with a new Discovery tab, chat extensions, smart replies, an AI-driven delivery service and more. One of Facebook's main goals is to make businesses more successful at using Messenger. Facebook attempted to do so last year with the introduction of chatbots, but that has been a little slow to take off. ""Chatbots were always a means to an end, not an end,"" says Stan Chudnovsky, head of product at Messenger. ""Our goal was always to enable meaningful and useful conversations between people and businesses. Bots were a means to achieve that goal."" So at F8 2017, the focus is more on helping people find these businesses in the first place. ""The number one thing businesses want is to be discovered,"" says Chudnovsky. ""So we are connecting the White Pages, the people's directory, with the Yellow Pages, which is the business directory."" That's why one of Messenger 2.0's new features is a Discover tab just for businesses. Tap the hexagon icon on the bottom right and you'll see a list of Featured businesses along with popular bots, what's nearby and a bunch of categories like Food & Drink, Entertainment and News. From there you can find out more information about any business, book an appointment or simply start a conversation. There's also a search field if you want to talk to a specific store. But that doesn't mean Facebook has given up on bots. In fact, it's making them easier to access than ever thanks to Chat Extensions, which is a way for multiple people to chat with the same business at the same time. So if you're in a group conversation with friends and you want to share the latest Kendrick Lamar album, you can just tap the plus button, choose Spotify, enter in the name of the song, hit ""Send to Group"" and it'll drop in a Spotify music bot in the thread. Tap the play button and you'll hear a short preview clip; if you're already a Spotify user, however, you'll hear the whole song. The same experience goes with other bots too, like OpenTable (make dinner reservations with a bunch of your pals), Kayak (arrange those group travel plans) or the NBA (discuss the scores of last night's game). (Update: David Marcus said on stage at F8 that there'll be an Apple Music chat extension coming as well) Oh, and remember the ""M Suggestions"" personal assistant feature that Messenger rolled out a couple of weeks ago? Well there's going to be one more update to that, and that's integration with delivery.com. So if you're chatting with your friends about what to have for dinner, M might pop up a suggestion to place an order from your favorite restaurant. And then you can do just that -- all the way from picking what you want (maybe a pizza with pepperoni?) to paying for your meal. This is the first third-party business to get access to Facebook's AI layer, so it's a little bit of a test for Facebook. ""All of that AI complexity, all of that neural network stuff, will be built for developers as well,"" says Chudnovsky. Like M, delivery.com suggestions will get better over time as it learns more about you. Eventually, Facebook plans to open up M suggestions to even more third-party developers, so stay tuned to see more integrations like this going forward. Oh, and M Suggestions will start recommending Chat Extensions too. If you're a business who doesn't necessarily want a full-on chatbot but still wants an easy way to communicate with customers, there's a new AI-enabled feature for you too. It's called Smart Replies, and it's really just a way to enable automated answers to frequently asked questions. So if customers ask ""When are you open?"", you don't have to keep answering ""From 8 to 5;"" you can just program Smart Replies to do that for you. Of course if the customer asks for more than that, Messenger will prompt you to reply just like you usually would. And hey, bots aren't just all work and no play. At F8, Facebook is also announcing additional features for game bots and ""rich gameplay"" for turn-by-turn games like Words with Friends. The games are integrated right into Messenger thanks to a new Games tab, so now you can challenge your buddies to a duel while trash talking them at the same time. Last but not least, Facebook is also rolling out Messenger Codes to businesses and bots (It introduced them as a way to find your friends last year). The idea here is that if you see one of these parametric QR codes at a baseball game, for example, you can just scan it to add the related bot to Messenger. With all of these features in Messenger, it's easy to see why many people are calling the app bloated these days. But Facebook really wants Messenger to be your one-stop-shop of communicating with the world, be it for chatting with your friends or ordering a pair of shoes. Whether or not it succeeds, however, is another story. Click here to catch up on the latest news from F8 2017!

If it can turn Messenger into the Yellow Pages of the internet, that could bring the type of revenue that the Yellow Pages provided for decades. “When you come to think of it, Messenger has become the de facto white pages without having any phone numbers,” David Marcus, Facebook’s Vice President of messaging products, said Tuesday. “We have a shot of becoming the Yellow Pages of messaging too.” Read: Mark Zuckerberg sees augmented reality shaping Facebook’s future Also see: Facebook’s AR Studio could kill a core Snap ad product At F8 in San Jose, Calif., Facebook said it was creating a version of an app store within the social network’s messaging service called Discovery, to help consumers find a bot, similar in the way they can find apps in Apple’s App Store or in Google Play. This will let consumers chat with a business, which will send automated responses using some artificial intelligence, and Facebook will presumably receive a fee from the businesses that take part in the program. “The thesis is that Facebook will charge companies fees and a percentage of sales using Messenger,” said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy. This is not much different than previous stated efforts with bots in Messenger, a major theme at last year’s F8, but Marcus said Facebook has learned from its early forays into the business and has figured out how to make it work. “Last year was all about creating the foundation, and learning a lot and iterating,” Marcus said. “This year is the year of scale.” The company has partnered with hundreds of companies, including OpenTable, Fandango and others, to help consumers set up dining reservations, buy movie tickets, order food, etc. Music services such as Spotify AB and Apple Inc.’s

Facebook noted Tuesday that Messenger now has 1.2 billion users, but it has yet to generate much, if any, direct revenue. Facebook’s fast-growing revenue mostly comes from ads and video ads posted on its social network, and increasingly on its Instagram photo-sharing service, which did not receive much attention in Tuesday’s event. In fact, the only declining revenue source for Facebook is the one in which Messenger may have the greatest effect, and which Marcus was expected to help when he came to Facebook from PayPal Holdings Inc.

Any or all of these features must first prove popular before any chance of monetization. The only other potential revenue generator was mentioned so briefly that many may have missed it: Facebook’s attempt to get into enterprise software, called Workplace. The enterprise software sector is far too competitive, and requires too large of a sales force, to believe that this will quickly become a moneymaker for Facebook, however. For Facebook stock to continue its torrid pace, it will need to find a new path to revenue growth, as executives have been blunt about not putting many more ads in its core offerings. Facebook stock has gained 10.2% in the past three months and 27.6% in the past year despite those warnings, while the S&P 500 index has added 3.1% and 11.8% in those periods. For investors looking for reasons to believe Facebook can continue to grow revenue at its current mind-boggling rate, the only potential reason for optimism to take from Tuesday’s event is Marcus’s promise that Messenger has figured out how to use bots in a way that will attract human users. But even that plan creates doubts. “The major assumption here is that consumers want to interact and do business over Messenger versus an app, web, phone, or in-person,” Moorhead said. “I like the concept of having a real human on the other side of the chat, as has been successful in China with WeChat, but am skeptical that using AI as a fake human will work.” If Facebook wants to start showing the ability to make money in anything but advertising on its core social network and Instagram in the near-term, it has to hope that others don’t feel the same way. Facebook shares have gained 23% in 2017, while the S&P 500

Ryan Vlastelica,04202017,MarketWatch,04132017,"Published: Apr 17, 2017 1:33 p.m. ET Fund manager claimed share class wouldn’t lose value, but investors would have to maintain stake for a decade, report alleges By Believe it or not, an investment that guaranteed it would never decline in value may be too good to be true. According to Bloomberg, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Statim Holdings Inc., an investment manager that promised its investors that its flagship fund, Arjun, wouldn’t lose money. The report claims that Joseph Meyer, who runs the company, told investors that Arjun’s main share class wouldn’t lose money, though investors would have to maintain their investment for 10 years. If they redeemed early, they would lose half of their principal. Bloomberg’s report cited people familiar with the matter, including an investor who showed his contract to a reporter. Statim couldn’t be reached for a comment, and the SEC said it could neither confirm nor deny reports about ongoing investigations. Statim is based in Atlanta, and Georgia regulators have been looking into the firm since 2015, according to the report, with the probe beginning after the company failed to submit to a surprise audit. In July, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told Bloomberg he had discovered “multiple irregularities” involving the firm and Arjun. A spokeswoman for Kemp confirmed to Bloomberg that the investigation was still ongoing, and that state regulators had been working with the SEC. Just because a company is under investigation doesn’t mean it will face legal action, and neither Statim nor Meyer have been accused of any wrongdoing. While the performance of hedge funds depend on their specific strategy, the broad category has been struggling for years, underperforming the broader market. More than 1,000 funds were closed last year, the highest number since the financial crisis in 2008.

In his first public statements since the lawsuit was originally filed in 2014, Manning denied he conspired with the Giants to pass off fake game-worn collectibles. An email obtained last week by The New York Post reignited interest in the case — and stoked Manning’s animated response on Thursday. “Just more angry than anything, having to deal with this and knowing that I’ve done nothing wrong and still being attacked,” Manning said Thursday at the Giants' practice facility."" “It’ll all work out, and when it all does, I’ll be cleared of this and everybody will see I’ve done nothing wrong.” MORE COVERAGE: Finding Charles Rogers Life and death of Aaron Hernandez: 'There was so much anger' The Giants and Manning were sued by sports collector Eric Inselberg in 2014.

Jason Notte,04202017,MarketWatch,04132017,"Published: Apr 20, 2017 9:14 a.m. ET The New York Giants quarterback, accused of memorabilia fraud, just informed America that nothing is sacred By Regardless of what Eli Manning does with memorabilia from this point on, his signature and those of other athletes are about to be rendered meaningless. Last week, the New York Giants quarterback handed over an email that plaintiffs in a three-year lawsuit against him claim links him to widespread memorabilia fraud. As first reported in The New York Post, the email that Manning sent on April 27, 2010, to Giants equipment manager Joe Skiba asked for “2 helmets that can pass as game used.” The helmets had been requested by Manning’s marketing agent, Alan Zucker. Twenty minutes later, Manning sent Zucker an email, saying, “Should be able to get them for tomorrow.” The Post describes that email as a “smoking gun” in the lawsuit, but there’s a strong chance that said gun was only used to shoot those filing the lawsuit in the foot. These are collectors Eric Inselberg, Michael Jakab (who paid $4,300 for one of Manning’s game-worn helmets) and Sean Godown (who bought the helmet on eBay, but later sold it to Jakab). The trio alleges that Manning has been passing off regular memorabilia as game-used to his memorabilia dealer, Steiner Sports, to fulfill his contract with Steiner while keeping game-used memorabilia for himself. Game-used items fetch a substantial premium over standard and even signed items, so it isn’t a minor distinction. The collectors have filed a civil racketeering suit against the Giants, Manning, Skiba, Steiner, Giants CEO John Mara and others alleging a grand cover-up of memorabilia fraud. Yet, in 2011, it was Inselberg and five other memorabilia dealers who were charged with selling fake game-used jerseys. While the other defendants all pleaded guilty, Inselberg had the indictment against him dismissed by arguing that Skiba and other Giants employees lied to the grand jury to cover up what Inselberg alleged were their own fake memorabilia sales. However, none of those Giants employees were charged with perjury, and Inselberg hasn’t exactly had success pleading his case back in Jersey. Though New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vociferously sided with Inselberg, the courts haven’t. Not only did a federal court kick his case against the Giants down to the state level, but it refused his claim that the Giants should pay his attorney fees. According to NJ.com sportswriter A.J. Perez, those fees set Inselberg back $301.74. He’s also been dueling in court over media-related patents that are also loosely tied to the Giants. One of Manning’s former teammates had game-worn memorabilia problems, but voiced support for Manning, as did the Giants organization. Then again, the controversy over game-worn memorabilia authenticity is nearly moot. According to a survey by online memorabilia dealer SportsMemorabilia.com, the market for licensed (unsigned) sports merchandise is $12 billion. Meanwhile, the autograph market is estimated to be $1.5 billion. While signed collectibles are typically authenticated by one of three agencies (Professional Sports Authenticator, James Spence Authentication and Global Authentics), those more lucrative unsigned products have been tougher to vouch for. Both are problems for the NFL, whose items make up 34% of all signed memorabilia. A day before the news about Manning broke, an email from a representative for former Dallas Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith made it into my editor Steve Kutz’s inbox. Smith’s company, PROVA, has created a scannable smart chip that it sews into jerseys, footballs and other memorabilia. When a fan scans the chip with a smartphone, a mobile app confirms the item’s authenticity, the game it was worn in, the records set during that game and the number of pieces (if it’s a cut-up jersey, for instance) that it was cut into. PROVA chips were sewn into every Dallas Cowboys uniform during the 2016-17 season and were recently added to trading card company Panini America’s 10-card, $1,500 set teeming with signatures, jerseys, footballs and other memorabilia. For game-worn jerseys, having the proof of authenticity sewn right into the material and digitized (so long as nobody’s able to hack it) would eliminate scenarios in which it’s the word of a memorabilia dealer versus that of an equipment manager, player or team. Smith says he launched PROVA after a memorabilia dealer was selling signed Emmitt Smith helmets that he clearly hadn’t signed, and notes that certificates of authenticity are often worth about as much as the paper or cardboard they’re printed on. By Professional Sports Authenticator’s own estimates, up to half of popular autographs are fake. The FBI regularly reminds consumers about fake memorabilia. A signature on its own is already worthless, but authentication technology that contains a helmet or jersey’s entire back story has the potential to become a far more sought-after signature.
