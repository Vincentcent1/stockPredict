 ,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Randal Quarles, the top Federal Reserve official tasked with policing Wall Street, said on Friday that he would recuse himself from any matters concerning Wells Fargo & Co, the nation’s third largest bank. Wells Fargo, which last year paid $190 million to settle a phony accounts scandal, is under investigation by two other financial agencies over whether the bank charged its customers too much for auto insurance and mortgages. Quarles, who joined the Fed on October 13, is regarded as the country’s top banking regulator and will be a critical voice as the central bank rethinks how it approaches bank supervision. He said in a memo that he and his family had sold their financial interests in Wells Fargo, and repaid a business loan to the bank - meaning he was legally allowed to oversee the lender. But the former Wall Street lawyer and private equity investor said he would still bow out from all Fed decisions on the bank. “I have made this decision in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict,” Quarles wrote the Fed’s chief counsel Mark Van Der Weide. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on Quarles’ recusal. Quarles has ties to Wells Fargo through his father-in-law, Spencer Eccles. Eccles was the head of First Security Corporation when the Utah bank was bought out by Wells Fargo in a $2.9 billion deal in 2000. Since then, Eccles has held a non-executive position with Wells Fargo, according to several online biographies. “Mr. Eccles is Chairman Emeritus of the Intermountain Banking Region of Wells Fargo & Co.”, according to an online biography of trustees for Intermountain Healthcare, a nonprofit based in Salt Lake City. The Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to make any comment on the position of chairman emeritus. A Federal Reserve spokesman said the emeritus title was honorary and that Eccles has no formal role at the bank. In September, the New York Federal Reserve faulted its president William Dudley for not disclosing that his sister-in-law worked for Wells Fargo. Conflicts of interest have long been a point of contention between those who argue regulators benefit from hiring people with real-world experience, and critics who say the revolving door makes it impossible to regulate effectively. That debate has heightened under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has stocked his administration with former business executives, and pledged to slash regulations. ","

 ,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) introduced the rule early this year to ensure that banks entrusted with customer deposits do not bet on price swings of metals. Wells Fargo would do the deal on behalf of an energy company and charge a fee for the service, said three people familiar with the request who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. A green light could help Wells Fargo grow a business catering to industrial clients even as the bank grapples with several scandals in its retail division. Like other large lenders, the San Francisco-based company may already perform metal trades through a non-bank affiliate that does not rely on federally-backed deposits. The U.S. Federal Reserve oversees those entities. Wells Fargo said such business already exists. “Metals leasing is a common and effective financing approach for many companies that use precious metals in their products,” said a company spokesman. However, Wells Fargo has asked whether some of that business could reside in the banking division, sources said. Doing so could be less costly because it is able to tap cheaper financing than the non-bank unit, and therefore may allow Wells to offer more competitive terms for clients. Wells Fargo declined to comment about its request to the OCC. The OCC rule strictly prohibits banks from speculating in metals markets but does allow banks to accept metals as collateral for ordinary loans. The OCC has said it would review loans on a case-by-case basis. The regulator left room for exceptions and its guidance in this case could be an indication of how it plans to enforce the rule under its new chief, Joseph Otting. The OCC is now reviewing Wells Fargo’s request, the sources said. Wells earned $6.5 billion from the wholesale banking business in the first three quarters of the year, up 8.4 percent from the same period in 2016. It represented 41 percent of its total net income. As Wells Fargo awaits the regulator’s response, it is also facing more scrutiny related to the long-running sales scandal, primarily in its consumer bank. The bank reached a $190 million settlement with the OCC and other agencies in September 2016 after revelations that thousands of employees have opened phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. As many 3.5 million accounts may have been affected. Since then, Wells has found troubles in other businesses including auto lending and mortgages, which the OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are examining for more possible penalties. The transaction Wells inquired about involves buying platinum from a supplier and leasing it to a refiner that can use it to turn crude oil into high quality fuel, people familiar with the deal said. At the end of a refining process, the platinum is recovered and can be returned. The bank could try to offset its exposure to platinum price swings while the metal is on its books through financial contracts that act as insurance, the sources said. There is no guarantee those hedges would be effective. Elise Bean, a former Congressional investigator, said banks face enough risk lending to the commodity industry without adding actual commodities to their balance sheets. “There is no reason for a bank to take on commodity price risk when they do this stuff,” said Bean, who was chief counsel to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

Mack, a 33-year veteran of Wells Fargo, will continue to serve on the lender’s operating committee and report to Chief Executive Tim Sloan, the bank said on Monday. She has led community banking since July 2016.

Mack took over as head of community banking from Carrie Tolstedt, a central figure in a sales scandal that has tarnished the bank’s reputation. Under her watch, thousands of retail bank employees created as many as 3.5 million phony accounts in customers’ names to hit aggressive sales targets.

 ,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial advisers and accountants are working overtime as many U.S. taxpayers scramble to pay the rest of their 2017 taxes before Jan. 1 when the proposed Republican tax overhaul would sharply cut the amount they can deduct on federal tax bills. The tax legislation, which top U.S. Republicans said on Sunday they expected Congress to pass this week, caps the amount of state, local and property taxes individuals can deduct from their federal tax bills at $10,000. The average American who itemized his or her tax bill in 2015 claimed more than $27,000 in deductions. While taxpayers have until Jan. 15 to pay the final installment of their 2017 taxes, Tom Holly of the accounting firm PwC said he received dozens of calls over the weekend from concerned clients eager to pay sooner. “It’s going to be a very busy holiday season for advisers,” said Holly, who heads the firm’s wealth and asset management division. Lisa Featherngill, managing director of wealth planning at Wells Fargo’s Abbot Downing, said she was skipping a family trip to the Valero Alamo Bowl football game in Texas on Dec. 28 in order to work. Featherngill said wealthy clients and their accountants were not just trying to figure out if it makes sense to estimate and  pay the rest of their 2017 itemized taxes this year, but also working to see if they should itemize at all. Some taxpayers, particularly those in high-tax states who have income above $100,000, may end up paying the alternative minimum tax, which limits the deductions a person can take against his or her federal income tax. “People really have to run the numbers because ... if they are subject to alternative minimum tax, some of those taxes wouldn’t be deductible anyway,” said Featherngill. Last week, according to media reports, state officials in New York received calls from residents asking to pay their 2018 state, local and property taxes before Jan. 1 in an effort to claim the higher amount of deductions before the Republican tax bill takes effect. In response, the U.S. Treasury Department issued guidance over the weekend saying that any pre-payments for 2018 tax liabilities would not be deductible on federal tax bills. If passed, the tax bill would be the biggest U.S. tax rewrite since 1986. The legislation would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent but offer a mixed bag for individuals, including middle-class workers, by roughly doubling a standard deduction that does not require itemization, but eliminating or scaling back other popular itemized deductions and exemptions.

 ,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval to the tax bill on Wednesday, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, and sent it to U.S. President Donald Trump for his signature. The companies’ announcements gave at least some support to claims by Trump and fellow Republicans that their tax bill would lead to more investment by U.S. companies with the money they save. AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier, said it will pay $1,000 bonuses to more than 200,000 employees and invest an additional $1 billion in the United States in 2018, once the tax reform bill is signed into law. An AT&T spokesman said the bonuses were unrelated to the $1,000 that 20,000 AT&T Mobility employees will receive as part of an agreement with the Communications Workers of America announced last week. Employees eligible for the bonus are all “union-represented, non-management and front-line managers,” AT&T said in a statement. The company has more than 250,000 employees in all. The bonuses will cost the company at least $200 million, but the precise amount is not yet known, the company said. The company said it expected to distribute the bonuses by year-end, assuming Trump signs the bill by Christmas – which is not certain - and that the pay increases would go into effect once the bill became law. Republican senators, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump praised the announcements. “Within hours of passing #taxreform, we’re already seeing announcements that companies plan to give back to their employees and invest more at home,” said Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia on Twitter. “Good news for workers and the economy!” Democrats, who opposed the bill, offered no congratulations. Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York criticized AT&T on the Senate floor. “AT&T - big American company, fine American company – their tax rate over the last 10 years was a mere 8 percent, and they cut 80,000 jobs,” he said. “That one statistic belies all this trickle-down bunk that our Republican colleagues still cling to even though it’s outdated and disproven.” AT&T is in the process of acquiring Time Warner Inc TWX.N for $85.4 billion, but the U.S. Department of Justice has sued AT&T to block the deal, saying it could raise prices for rivals and hamper development of online video.

 ,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sweeping U.S. tax legislation appears to be on the verge of approval, lifting the prospects in particular for banks, telecoms, transports and other industries that stand to gain the most from lower corporate tax rates. The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives hit a last-minute snag on Tuesday in their drive to approve the legislation favored by President Donald Trump. The plan on Capitol Hill was for the Senate to delete three offending provisions in the House version and vote on the bill, then send it back to the House for a vote on Wednesday. The bill slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. That would boost overall earnings for S&P 500 companies by 9.1 percent, according to UBS equity strategists. For an interactive graphic on how the bill ripples through industries: tmsnrt.rs/2kf26gx Momentum behind the tax bill over the past month has helped propel the stock market, which had already rallied sharply this year, to fresh record highs. The S&P 500 has climbed about 5 percent since mid-November when the House of Representatives passed its tax overhaul bill. But the bill, which also includes a one-time tax on profits held overseas and industry-specific measures, would benefit some stocks, industries and sectors more than others. The industries that stand to benefit most from the lower rates are telecoms, transportation, retail and banks, analysts said. But for some groups, such as tech and healthcare, the impact is more mixed. Domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services are poised to benefit from the lower tax rate. Hospital operator Universal Health Services Inc, lab-testing company Quest Diagnostics Inc and drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc are among the service companies set to benefit the most, according to Mizuho Securities. “We believe tax reform should be a significant positive cash flow event, especially for healthcare services companies that tend to have limited international exposure and significant capital expenditures,” Mizuho analysts said in a research note. While many large drugmakers already report adjusted tax rates in the low 20 percent range, a number of companies would benefit from the ability to bring back overseas cash, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a recent note. According to Schott, Pfizer Inc, with $160 billion in offshore earnings, and Merck & Co Inc, with $70 billion, are particularly poised to gain from repatriating overseas funds. Banks are expected to be among the biggest winners from a lower tax rate. The S&P 500 banks index has soared 9 percent since mid-November as the tax bill began moving swiftly through Congress. Of the major S&P sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates. Large U.S. banks will see an average 13 percent increase to earnings per share from the lower rate, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, with Wells Fargo & Co and PNC Financial Services Group having the biggest gains. Citizens Financial Group, Regions Financial Corp and M&T Bank Corp would see sizable earnings benefits and are also poised to be relative winners among large bank stocks, UBS analyst Saul Martinez said in a recent note. Banks could benefit indirectly if the tax bill provides an economic boost that spurs increased lending and higher interest rates. The technology sector, which had led the market’s rally for most of 2017, has underperformed the S&P 500 as the tax bill moved forward in Congress. Tech is expected to benefit less than most other sectors from a drop in the corporate rate, with an earnings boost of 5.3 percent, according to UBS. Semiconductors, whose shares have had a particularly rough ride in the past month, are expected to see earnings drop by 3.3 percent due to the overall bill, according to UBS. “Many chip companies have extensive international operations and relatively low blended tax rates,” Wells Fargo analysts said in a recent note. “We see the possibility of changes in the U.S. tax rules as a potential risk for such companies.” One area where large tech companies could benefit is by spending cash held overseas for uses such as stock buybacks that boost earnings per share. UBS points to Cisco Systems Inc and Qualcomm Inc as companies that could see among the biggest buyback boosts. “The tech sector would certainly be among the largest beneficiaries if cash stashed overseas can be repatriated at a low rate and presumably used for stock buybacks or dividends,” according to a recent note from Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research.

 ,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is taking aim at budget chief Mick Mulvaney’s plan to fill the ranks of the U.S. consumer financial watchdog with political allies, according to letters seen by Reuters, the latest salvo in a broader battle over who should run the bureau. President Donald Trump last month appointed Mulvaney as acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), though the decision is being legally challenged by the agency’s deputy director, Leandra English, who says she is the rightful interim head. Mulvaney told reporters earlier this month he planned to bring in several political appointees to help overhaul the agency, but Warren warned in a pair of letters sent Monday to Mulvaney and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which oversees federal hiring, that doing so was inappropriate and potentially illegal. The CFPB is meant to be an independent agency staffed primarily by non-political employees. Hiring political appointees could violate civil service laws designed to protect such employees from undue political pressure and discrimination, Warren said. “Your naked effort to politicize the consumer agency runs counter to the agency’s mission to be an independent voice for consumers with the power to stand up to Wall Street banks,” Warren, who helped create the CFPB, wrote to Mulvaney. In a separate letter, Warren asked the OPM to review Mulvaney’s “unprecedented and unjustified” plans. In a third letter sent to Mulvaney and English, Warren asked for information about a review of ongoing enforcement actions at the CFPB. Reuters reported earlier this month that a potential multimillion-dollar settlement with Wells Fargo is among the enforcement actions under review amid the change in CFPB leadership. Spokespeople for Mulvaney and the OPM did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mulvaney, who also serves directly under Trump as the head of his Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said in the long term he would like to see professional staff alongisde political appointees, mirroring an arrangement in place at the OMB. “We will be staffing up with more permanent political people so the professional staff here have a better feel for where the administration wants to take the bureau,” Mulvaney said. But Warren said such an arrangement, though understandable for bureaus like the OMB which sit directly beneath the White House, was not suitable for independent financial regulators. The leadership of the CFPB has been in question since the agency’s first director, Richard Cordray, resigned in November. ","

 ,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The surprise victory by Democrats in Tuesday’s Alabama election for a U.S. senator is prompting fund managers to prepare for more losses by the Republican party in the 2018 mid-term Congressional elections. Fund managers from Federated Investors, Wells Fargo, James Funds and LPL Financial are among those that are moving into the shares of retailers, banks, industrials and technology firms that may benefit from strong global economic growth abroad and tax cuts for high income wage earners at home, even if the Democratic party makes gains in next year’s elections. “Tax reform was the big thing from an economic perspective, and if I’ve got it then I’ve got it. If this (next year’s election) makes it harder for Republicans to pass an immigration bill or trade restrictions then that’s even better” because it reduces threats to global economic growth, said Steven Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, which has $363 billion in assets under management. “You are going to have more money in the pockets of both consumers and of corporations, and these companies are most exposed to where that money will be spent,” he said. Historically, the U.S. stock market has done well during periods when opposing political parties have control of the presidency and at least one house of Congress. This time, however, the more influential factor looks to be the strength of the global economy. In the U.S, the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years during the third quarter this year, while the economy of the eurozone is on pace for its largest expansion in a decade. In October, the International Monetary Fund raised its outlook for global economic growth to a rate of 3.7 percent in 2018, helping to push emerging market stocks up to six-year highs. “We haven’t had anything like this on a global growth scale since 2010,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, which has $560 billion in assets under management. “Against that backdrop, more gridlock in Washington is not a bad thing, because you won’t have any extreme moves one way or another.” Detrick expects cyclical value stocks, especially financials and industrials, to outpace the market in the year ahead as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates and corporations start to increase their capital expenditures. The move to invest in stocks that might benefit from gridlock in Washington D.C., if the Democrats regain at least one house in Congress next year, is a reversal from a year ago, when fund managers piled into infrastructure, defense and small-capitalization stocks in anticipation of Republican legislative victories in the 2016 elections. Dubbed the ‘Trump Trade’ last year, the move helped push the U.S. dollar up to multi-year highs and sent the broad S&P 500 index up more than 10 percent between November and March this year. Now, however, fund managers are looking at companies that can benefit even if Republicans are not able to legislate in Congress. He expects that Democrats will win at least at least one house of Congress in 2018, limiting the impact of Washington on the stock market until the presidential election in 2020. “It’s looking more and more like the tax plan will be the one legislative victory that Republicans will have, and there won’t be anything else out of Washington unless it is truly bi-partisan,” he said.

Nebeus, a startup based in London, claims to have already arranged 1,000 such loans using bitcoin and ether. The impetus for using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as collateral is their phenomenal fortune this year. Bitcoin is up by more than 1,600 percent this year.

The loans at Salt Lending do not require a credit check or much paperwork. But they are expensive. For example, a $100,000 cash loan would require $200,000 of bitcoin holdings as collateral and an interest rate of 12 percent to 20 percent at Salt. Typically, unsecured loans for a similar amount from an institution like Wells Fargo have interest rates of between 7 percent to 20 percent. Given the steep swings in bitcoin’s prices, it is not clear how the startup will cope with a precipitous drop in bitcoin’s prices. (See also: 8 Possible Risks From Unsecured Loans.) The Bloomberg report states that the loans may be useful to miners to defray electricity costs for operating energy-intensive ASIC machines for mining. The loans might also make their way to mainstream institutions, as Salt Lending is in talks to launch a similar product at a financial institution “within weeks,” according to Bloomberg. CoinLoan has implemented a peer-to-peer model for bitcoin holders to use their cryptos as collateral for loans from people willing to lend cash. It aims to make money by generating fees from transactions on its platform. The loans serve another purpose for the startups. They provide utility to cryptocurrencies being used within the platform. CoinLoan plans to issue CLT tokens for its platform. Similarly, Salt Lending uses SALT tokens as currency within its site. The tokens can be used to pay back interest value on loans. At 5:19 UTC, SALT had a market capitalization of $4.2 billion on Coinmarketcap.com and was trading at $8.41. But their price within Salt’s platform is $25.

In the five days up to December 4, ""cheap U.S. stocks beat those with faster earnings growth by 3.7 percentage points, the most in such a period since the 2007-09 recession ended in the summer of 2009,"" The Wall Street Journal reported on December 7, calling this a ""phenomenal"" rotation. Indeed, much of the recent gains registered by the individual value stocks listed above were made in this narrower time frame. The Journal also cited research indicating that ""value stocks beat pricey stocks by the most since 2009 within sectors."" Moreover, the Journal concluded that this rotation was driven by more than just the improving prospects for a cut in the federal corporate income tax rate. If that were true, most stocks in high-tax sectors should have risen. Instead, the Journal notes, value stocks generally rose across the board, whether in high tax or low tax sectors. However, while the Journal cites traditional retail as a prime example of a sector that investors have ""given up on"" due to ""disruption from new technology,"" a recent surge in retail stock prices indicates quite the contrary, at least temporarily. (For more, see also: 5 Retail Stocks That May Ruin Your New Year.) Going forward, the Journal indicates that faster economic growth, higher inflation and, most crucially, higher interest rates would be positive for value compared to growth. The main reason: growth companies, especially those in tech, tend to have expected profits way off into the future. Higher interest rates mean higher discount rates for those far-off earnings, making them less valuable in today's money. By contrast, value stocks tend to be generating profits, and paying dividends, in the here and now. Part of Bernstein's case against value stocks is that they expect reflation to happen slowly, per Bloomberg. Meanwhile, earlier this month, strategists at JPMorgan Chase saw the improved prospects for tax reform as a cause in itself for a rotation out of growth and into value, CNBC reported on December 4.

Patti Domm,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"Expect a stampede of companies handing out bonuses, raising pay, spending on capital projects and giving to charities, with the windfall from the massive corporate tax cuts passed Wednesday. In the hours after Congress approved the GOP tax cut plan, a handful of companies jumped to announce plans to share some of the proceeds on their employees and spend on infrastructure. Boeing was first out of the gate, followed by AT&T, which said it would give more than 200,000 unionized employees a special bonus of $1,000 once the tax bill is signed. The company also said it would increase its capital expenditures by $1 billion. Both Fifth Third Bancorp and Wells Fargo followed, saying they would raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour. Fifth Third said it would also give workers a bonus, and Wells Fargo said it would give $400 million to community and nonprofit organizations next year. Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, said it would pay 100,000 frontline and non-executive employees special $1,000 bonuses. The company also said it is making the move because of the FCC's recent change in broadband rules and tax reform. It also said it plans to spend well in excess of $50 billion over the next five years on infrastructure improvements. ""This is exciting stuff. This is good. This is not just a whole bunch of guys saying I can buy back a lot of stock here and jazz up my numbers through financial engineering. This is a bunch of business leaders saying we can use this tax benefit to grow our company, keep our loyal employees and assist the community,"" said Dick Bove, banking analyst at Vertical Group. The corporate tax rate is being cut to 21 percent from 35 percent. Bove said banks pay an average 31 percent tax rate. Bove said he now expects the other banks to follow with similar announcements. ""It looks like they are going to use that money to stimulate more employee loyalty by increasing spending. They are also going to get more liberal with their stock programs. They are going to increase philanthropic activity because it's one of the ways they stimulate business,"" he said. ""I was convinced they were going to cut prices and go to war with each other, which I'm sure they will still do."" Boeing also announced $300 million in employee-related spending and charitable donations. FedEx, when it announced earnings, said it expects U.S. GDP could increase materially next year as a result of tax reform. It said it would likely then increase its capital expenditures and hire to accommodate the additional volumes triggered by higher growth. The announcements were met by some cynicism by Wall Streeters, especially since the Justice Department has sued to block AT&T's acquisition ofTime Warner. Time Warner stock ended the day higher, after AT&T made the announcement, and President Donald Trump praised the company's action during a celebratory event with Republican members of congress. But overall, the announcements were seen as positive steps for companies that are not only seeing the tax rate fall but benefiting from important changes in how they account for capital spending. Yet companies have also been spending on stock buybacks — with $86 billion announced so far this month, the most since June, according to Trim Tabs. Democrats have said the bill favors only business and the rich, and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer's office circulated a list of companies that announced buybacks. Schumer criticized the AT&T announcement, and said the company paid a low tax rate over the last decade. ""They have 80,000 fewer employees today than they had then,"" he said. Also, companies raising minimum wage may be forced to do so anyway. There are 18 states and some cities where the minimum wage was going to rise in 2018. New York City will have a rate of $15 an hour. But Bove said the fact companies have immediately given money to workers is a positive surprise, and it could boost the economy if enough do it. ""You'll see more companies doing this,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ""It's excellent PR after all the mantra across the aisle that it's just a tax plan for the rich and for corporate America and for people who own stocks. ... It's a good PR move, giving back to the folks in the company."" ""It affects the psychology of the moment. Giving back to your workers. This was a major victory for corporate America,"" she said of the tax cuts. She also expects to see more banks making announcements since they are a major beneficiary of not only the tax cuts, but also deregulation. ""It's good PR. It's good corporate citizenship,"" said Jack Ablin, CIO of BMO Private Bank. ""It's Christmastime. It's the holidays. It's spreading the good cheer around. It's probably from a communications and PR perspective smart, and probably proactive because they're going to get pressure. They might as well do it ahead of time."" Ablin said companies will feel pressured if their competitors make announcements on pay and bonuses. The industries that see the biggest advantage in the tax law are expected to spread some of the proceeds around. Industrial companies are among the winners, as are media and retailers. Tech is the sector that will gain the least from tax reform, since the average tax rate is about 24 percent. ""It would be smart for utilities to say they're going to cut their rates because regulators will probably force them to do it anyway,"" said Ablin. ",This is just the start of companies increasing spending
Liz Moyer,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"Fifth Third Bancorp will pay more than 13,500 employees a bonus and raise the minimum wage of its workforce to $15 an hour after the passage of the Republican tax plan that will cut the bank's corporate tax rate. Fifth Third is yet another company to announce a bonus for employees because of the tax plan. AT&T said earlier Wednesday that it would pay more than 200,000 U.S. employees $1,000 each and increase its capital spending budget by $1 billion. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, also said it would be boosting its minimum wage for employees to $15 an hour, which was prompted by the tax plan. The San Francisco-based bank also said it would target $400 million in donations to community and nonprofit organizations next year. Cincinnati-based Fifth Third, the fifteenth largest U.S. bank by asset size, said the tax cut allowed it to re-evaluate its employee pay and pass along some of the windfall. Nearly 3,000 workers will see hourly wages rise to $15. The $1,000 one-time bonus is expected to be paid by the end of this year, the bank said, assuming President Donald Trump signs the bill into law by Christmas.

Ari Levy,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"Earlier this year, Juul Labs quietly spun out of vaping company Pax Labs and quickly catapulted up the charts to become the top e-cigarette producer on the market. Now, the San Francisco-based company is raising $150 million in its first financing as an independent company. The separation allowed Juul to focus on people seeking an alternative to cigarettes, while Pax, which lets users pack their own loose leaves, exists in a hybrid world between nicotine and various sorts of plants. Last week, Juul hired Kevin Burns from Chobani to be CEO. And now the company is raising money. It's already reeled in $111.5 million from 23 investors, according to a filing with the SEC on Tuesday. In what's described as a convertible note, the company still has $38.5 million left to raise. While they've formally separated, the relationship between Pax and Juul is complicated. Tyler Goldman became CEO of Pax in August 2016 and held the top position at both companies after the split. With the Burns announcement on Dec. 11, Juul said that Goldman ""intends to pursue new entrepreneurial opportunities."" Goldman has also left Pax. That company, which expects to announce a new CEO soon, declined to comment for this story. James Monsees and Adam Bowen, the co-founders of Pax, have left that company as well: Monsees' LinkedIn page says he left Pax in July, while Bowen's profile indicates he left a month earlier. Both are are now top executives and board members at Juul. Meanwhile, Juul is in rapid growth mode. Juul's flat rectangular devices, shaped like USB sticks, hit the market in mid-2015 and have surpassed similar devices from the tobacco giants. Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote in a report last month, citing Nielsen data over the prior four weeks, that Juul controls 32.9 percent of the market, ahead of British American Tobacco at 27.4 percent and Altria at 15.2 percent. According to the Nielsen data, Juul has generated revenue growth of almost 700 percent to $224.6 million in the past year, as of the November report. The total e-cigarette market expanded 40 percent to $1.16 billion. Juul claims that its mission is to eliminate cigarette usage by providing the 1 billion smokers worldwide ""with a better alternative to combustible cigarettes."" Ex-CEO Goldman told CNBC in October that the company was struggling to meet its mission because it was supply constrained. He said that every month the company produces 20 million products, including devices and cartridges, but that it wasn't producing pods, which contain the nicotine, quickly enough to meet demand. ""To achieve our mission, we really need to make sure that we have enough pods per device,"" Goldman said. ""If we're not getting enough devices out into the marketplace, it means we're not giving people the option to switch to Juul."" A Juul customer, Staci Starnes, also told CNBC at the time that about six months after she started using the product, she began experiencing problems with pods leaking into the device and her mouth. Starnes, from Charlotte, North Carolina, said she'd switched to a different brand. Given that Juul is in the nicotine business, controversy is inevitable. A study earlier this month in the American Journal of Medicine found that among young adults who didn't smoke cigarettes, those who used e-cigarettes were more than four times as likely than non-vapers to start smoking traditional cigarettes within 18 months. There's also the ongoing competitive and regulatory risk. In May, the Food and Drug Administration started a year-long scientific review of a new type of so-called heat-not-burn product from Philip Morris. The system called IQOS (I quit ordinary smoking) is currently available in about 30 countries, including Canada and many countries in Europe. Wells Fargo's Herzog said in her November report that IQOS is a ""superior technology"" and ""we expect customers to shift from e-cig/ vapor to next-generation reduced-risk products"" like IQOS. Other Juul board members, according to Tuesday's filing, include billionaire Nicholas Pritzker, Riaz Valani of Global Asset Capital and health-care investor Hoyoung Huh.

Nyshka Chandran,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"Washington's newly-approved tax reform bill will lead to more share buybacks, not higher wages, according to Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer. After the tax plan received passage on Capitol Hill, AT&T and Comcast announced they would give $1,000 bonuses to thousands of U.S. employees. Other companies lined up with their own announcements: Fifth Third Bancorp said it will also hand out employee bonuses and raise the minimum wage, while Wells Fargo announced it is raising its minimum wage. Still, it's wrong to assume Republican tax reform will create jobs and higher wages, Schumer's office wrote in a statement released Wednesday. AT&T ""is the exception, not the rule, when it comes to the biggest corporations spending their windfall,"" the statement said. ""Over the past several weeks, major companies have announced an astonishing $83.7 billion in share buybacks, anticipating the passage of tax reform."" Since the start of the month, at least 32 U.S. companies have announced share buybacks of $100 million or more, according to the statement. Those include Home Depot's $15 billion plan that was announced on Dec. 6, Oracle's $12 billion, which was unveiled just last week, and Pfizer's $10 billion buyback that was revealed on Tuesday.

Pippa Stevens,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"Traders are making bullish bets using options on Mircon, Red Hat and Paychex ahead of earnings next week. Chipmaker Micron reports earnings on Tuesday after the bell. In the past week investors have bought more than 11,000 calls with a December 48 strike price in Micron, according to Jon Najarian, Najarian Family Office co-founder and ""Halftime Report"" contributor. These calls expire next Friday, so it's a relatively short-term bet. Micron closed at $42.24 on Thursday, so the stock would have to pop nearly 14 percent to hit $48 by next Friday. Traders can use call options to capitalize on a stock's move higher while simultaneously limiting their downside risk. If Micron doesn't hit $48 by next Friday the traders will only lose the price they paid for the call option - typically a fraction of what it would cost to buy the stock - plus the commission fee. On the flip side, should Micron blow past $48, the call-option gives traders the right to buy the stock at $48 instead of the higher level. Najarian spotted other interesting options activity in software company Red Hat, which also reports earnings on Tuesday after the bell. This month traders bought more than four thousand January 130 calls that expire on January 19. As of Thursday's close Red Hat was trading at $126.13, so to hit $130 it would have to rise 3 percent. Shares of the Raleigh, North Carolina-based company are up more than 80 percent this year. Traders are also predicting that Paychex moves higher after reporting positive earnings. This month traders have bought nearly 27,000 calls at the January 70 strike price, according to Najarian. The payroll-processing company reports earnings on Thursday before the bell, and according to FactSet estimates, analysts are expecting earnings per share of 59 cents on $823.5 million in revenue. These calls, which expire January 18, were trading at $0.57 at the start of the month. As of Thursday's close, they were at $1.38. Elsewhere in the market, Najarian and his brother Pete Najarian, Investitute co-founder, have seen heavy options activity in AT&T and Wells Fargo. Last Tuesday bulls piled into Wells Fargo calls at the February 60 strike price. As of Thursday's close the stock was up more than 3 percent since Pete Najarian highlighted the options moves on the ""Halftime Report."" AT&T is another recent trade that has worked for Najarian.

Elizabeth Gurdus,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"When two callers asked CNBC's Jim Cramer about the stock of Penumbra, he told them that it was for speculation only and they should wait for a better entry point to buy. But there's one problem: ""Penumbra hasn't given you many entry points,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. The first time Cramer was asked about Penumbra's stock was Nov. 2016, when it was at $65. The second time was in March 2017, when the stock was at $82. By Nov. 2017, it had run up to $116, where it peaked. Since then, shares of Penumbra have pulled back roughly 20 percent. ""Given that this is an audience name that's made some of our viewers a lot of mula, I think we've got to figure out whether we're dealing with a buyable dip or if this is just the beginning of a larger, more painful decline,"" Cramer said. ""It's not always easy to tell."" It's worth understanding the business to understand the dip, Cramer said. Penumbra makes medical devices that treat neurovascular conditions like strokes and aneurysms. The company's products help doctors do minimally invasive procedures to remove blood clots. Part of the reason why Cramer and his callers were so taken by Penumbra's stock was because the company kept reporting strong earnings, hitting Wall Street with beat after beat. Since May, the company has reported several earnings losses, but the Street didn't seem to care. Revenues — one of the few metrics that matter to small, high-growth companies like Penumbra — were still growing, and management remained bullish, driving shares higher. But since Penumbra's peak in November, its shares have backtracked, sliding to $94.40 as of Tuesday's close. ""And you know what the worst part is? Sometimes, you've got to own this: I can't really tell you why it went down,"" Cramer said. ""To my admittedly unrefined eye, all of the news seems to have been good news. But that's obviously not how the market saw things."" Still, Cramer tried to break it down. The first leg down came just after the post-earnings rally, which could have been run-of-the-mill profit-taking after a big earnings win, he said. The second leg could have been attributed to the New England Journal of Medicine, which published a positive piece on Stryker, one of Penumbra's competitors. But it was positive for Penumbra, too: the gist of the piece was that patients can wait up to 24 hours (instead of the widely accepted six hours) after having a stroke to remove the blood clot, theoretically raising demand for both Stryker's and Penumbra's devices. Penumbra's stock initially rallied, but gave up its gains within a few days. The last leg lower came after BMO analysts downgraded Penumbra to ""hold"" from ""buy"" because of its valuation. All in all, it seemed to Cramer that Penumbra's decline was a textbook example of investors bowing out of a stock after seeing a reasonable amount of success. Even though Penumbra would not be a huge beneficiary of the GOP tax overhaul, which would justify some selling, most of it was probably shifty investors worried about the decline, he said. ""The bottom line? I've been telling you to watch out for a pullback in Penumbra since last year. Am I going to run from it now that we got one?"" Cramer said. ""I think it's a broken stock, not a broken company, and the ax in this name — a fellow by the name of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo — remains pretty darned bullish. And you know what? So am I. The recent weakness in Penumbra, I think, is a gift, and for those who like these high-growth super stocks, I'd take it!"" Questions for Cramer?

Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) didn't have a great year in 2017. The fake-accounts scandal affected 1.5 million more people than was originally expected, and the bank faced several other ""mini-scandals"" in 2017. After 2017's poor performance, is Wells Fargo stock a buy? A full transcript follows the video. Michael Douglass: Story No. 4: Wells Fargo. This is not a particularly happy story, because Wells Fargo has had a pretty darn rough 2017. Matt Frankel: This is technically a 2016 story, because that's when the news of their wrongdoing -- in Elizabeth Warren's phrase, a scam -- first came to light. Whether you think the bank was completely at fault or it was a bunch of rogue employees, that's another discussion for another day. But one of my favorite Warren Buffett lines is, ""you'll find that when you turn the lights on, there's not just one cockroach in the kitchen."" And this really applies here. First of all, the number of people affected by the fake-account scandal during 2017 grew from the 2 million that were originally disclosed to about 3.5 million. Not only that, there were a bunch of other mini-scandals that were brought to light. In one, Wells Fargo was charging 800,000 customers for auto insurance they didn't need. In one they were caught improperly raising mortgage rates for certain customers that they hadn't properly disclosed that they were going up for a rate increase. And there were a couple more. They were making unauthorized changes to people's mortgages. So you see all of these scandals snowballing, and it's pretty much because regulators, the investing media decided to take a closer look at Wells Fargo and scrutinize them a little more. So even though this was brought to light in 2016, it turned into a bad 2017. 2016 was OK for Wells Fargo in that they did initial damage control, in my opinion, pretty well. But in 2017, it's just been one thing after another, and it's really been weighing on the company's results and, as a result, its stock price. Douglass: Right. I think when we take a step back, one of the things that Wells Fargo was really well known for was its aggressive sales culture. [Former] CEO John Stumpf used to say that ""eight is great."" What that meant was, let's try and get each Wells customer into at least eight products. With that being the expectation, employees were under a great deal of pressure and pretty clearly cheated. Not saying, to be clear, that all Wells Fargo employees cheated. That's certainly not the case. But a significant proportion did, and we're seeing issues across a number of different departments. So that's been a really rough drip-drip-drip of bad news for Wells Fargo. And as you noted, across the board the bank is reeling. Their efficiency ratio, which is a measure of core profitability and their ability to control expenses, has climbed. That's bad. You want a smaller efficiency ratio. It's above 65% in the most recent quarter. Historically speaking, Wells Fargo has generally been in the mid-to-upper 50s, and that's kind of where you want to see a big bank. And revenue and earnings per share are both down year over year, because frankly, there's a trust deficit, and I think understandably so. It's interesting. I don't know what I think about Wells Fargo going forward in a lot of ways. What I do know is, the sales culture was supposedly the one thing that really made Wells really different from the other big banks. And sure, there were other things too, to be clear. But that was one of the really big pieces of any investing thesis. Now that that is, at least for the moment, gone -- and again, to be clear, rightfully so. Is the stock undervalued? Possibly. But by the same token, for me, when I'm looking for investments, I'm looking for companies that can distinguish themselves in some way. And I don't see a lot in Wells that really breaks it out differently, at least for me as an investor. And frankly, I want to beat the market. I'm not looking to match the market's return, or buy, essentially, a high-cost ETF of big bank stocks. I'm looking for the best investments. And Wells just doesn't fit that criteria for me. Frankel: Yeah. As Buffett would say, they lost one of their most durable competitive advantages in terms of the cross-selling ability. They never really stopped to think whether or not people needed eight different baking products. I read somewhere that the average person has less than 10 banking products total between all the banks and credit card companies and everybody they deal with. That was a pretty lofty goal, so it's not surprising that it led to wrongdoing. ","

In the banking world, you don't get much bigger than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). These sprawling financials are exactly half of the ""big four"" group of U.S. banks, the other 50% being Bank of America and Citigroup. Both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase are sprawling financials that are active in almost every aspect of banking and finance. But of course, not all things in this world are created equal, and one of those companies provides the superior bang for our investing buck. Here's which one I think it is. Although the distinctions between the pair have blurred somewhat over the years, we can still point out a few differences. California-based Wells Fargo is a domestic operator with a particularly strong presence in the West and has a very large mortgage banking operation. In fact, it's by far the top mortgage lender in the country. Image source: Wells Fargo New York-based but internationally active, JPMorgan Chase has traditionally been strong in the up-and-down world of investment banking. That's not to say it lacks a presence elsewhere in the U.S., though, or isn't active in other banking segments. Its 2008 buyout of Washington Mutual beefed up its Western operations, and it's No. 2 on the market, albeit distantly, in mortgages. At the moment, the U.S. economy continues to motor along. Interest rates, although rising steadily, are still low enough for companies and individuals to take out loans. These factors are lifting the results of most banks; most of the significant American ones did quite well in this year's calendar Q3. But not all. Wells Fargo saw a slight (2%) year-over-year decline in revenue, and a much steeper (18%) fall in net profit, missing the average analyst estimates for both line items. It's troubling that the bank stumbled while its peers jumped ahead. Some have attributed this performance to the ever-lengthening series of scandals that have plagued the company since last year. It's hard to say for sure how these mistakes have affected results; regardless, they surely haven't helped. JPMorgan Chase, by contrast, has managed to stay more or less clean across that stretch of time. It seems to be too busy taking advantage of the favorable environment to get embroiled in a major scandal. In its own Q3, the bank saw its revenue increase by 3% and its net profit rise 7% -- to $25 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. Deposits and total loans also saw decent growth, by a respective 5% and 3%. Image source: JPMorgan Chase Not surprisingly given these results, JPMorgan Chase's stock has been a favorite of investors recently, while Wells Fargo has lagged behind. The former's shares are up 23% since the beginning of the year, well above the latter's 9%. Recent fundamentals and stock price don't tell the whole story, of course. Let's look at some of the valuations, and the expectations for future periods: Data sources: JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo! Finance, YCharts.* Tangible book value.** Price/earnings to growth. The two figures that show a significant difference between the two banks are the efficiency ratio, and the average analyst projection for one-year forward earnings growth. Both clearly favor JPMorgan Chase, while the remaining numbers are more or less in the same ballpark. JPMorgan Chase isn't a winner on this alone. But I'd say its good recent performance -- anticipated to continue on those favorable macroeconomic factors -- and the comparatively smooth way it's been managed both put it into the winner's circle. Wells Fargo is still a very profitable enterprise; don't get me wrong. But those revenue and profit declines are a concern, as is management's apparent inability to stem the flow of scandal. So for this contest, JPMorgan Chase is the clear victor for me. ","

Over the past year, the company's stock has risen by only 7% -- well under the 25%-plus increases of the other three in the big four. Some of this has to do with lingering investor mistrust following the ugly accounts scandal at the bank last year (plus a clutch of subsequent controversies). Compounding this, Wells Fargo's fundamentals haven't improved as much as many of its peers'. These banks have benefited from being at a favorable point on the economic cycle, and gradually rising interest rates. Wells Fargo's third quarter is a good example -- in contrast to the same quarter for the rest of the big four, total revenue slumped on a year-over-year basis (by 2% to $21.9 billion), while net profit declined by almost 20% to $4.6 billion. Both results fell short of analyst expectations. Berkshire, meanwhile, has also had its hiccups during the year. There was the company's failed bid for utility Oncor Electric Delivery, for example. Subsequent to that, its $15 billion commitment to another big portfolio holding, food conglomerate Kraft Heinz, to acquire consumer goods megalith Unilever came to nought. But those negatives were more than offset by numerous positives for the company. Most spectacularly, it cashed out on a whopping 700 million common shares of Bank of America, the culmination of a financing deal it inked with the bank in 2011. These days, Bank of America is in far better shape than it was back then, hence its share price appreciation of over 200% from then to now. When Berkshire pulled the trigger on those warrants, it booked an immediate paper profit of $12 billion. All in all, Berkshire continues to do well with its portfolio. Between the end of the company's fiscal 2016 and the conclusion of its Q3 2017, the total market value of its equity holdings increased from $129 billion to almost $190 billion. Wells Fargo certainly isn't the flavor of the moment for bank investors, but we should keep in mind that it's still very profitable and has a commanding lead in the all-important mortgage segment. It certainly has some value as an investment, although I'm concerned that it doesn't seem to be stemming the flow of scandal. This suggests deeper problems in management and corporate culture that might take some time to correct. Berkshire, meanwhile, is largely a reflection of its leader. Buffett is a straightforward, meat-and-potatoes value investor with a long history of solid profitability. That alone would make me more confident in Berkshire stock. But of course the main reason is the company's sustained overperformance. Wells Fargo might eventually put the recent scandalous past behind it and kick up some meaningful growth. I don't see enough signs of this happening yet, though, so Berkshire is my pick in this contest. ","
      
    Better Buy: Berkshire Hathaway vs. Wells Fargo -- The Motley Fool

Rich Smith,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The new year is almost upon us, and a new tax law has just been passed in Congress and signed by the president. It's time to buy some bank stocks -- or so says Wall Street. This morning, analysts at Buckingham Research announced they are upgrading shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Both of these bank stocks are receiving new buy ratings. Wells Fargo's price target goes to $75 a share (a 31.5% hike), while JPMorgan Chase's target goes up 35% to $135 a share. At the same time, at Wedbush Securities they've added a third banking stock to the list -- this time a regional bank, Regions Financial (NYSE:RF). Regions gets an outperform rating (similar to buy) and a price target of $20, up 25% from Wedbush's previous target of $16. Thanks to tax reform, 2018 could be a good year to buy banks. Image source: Getty Images. Let's begin at the top with Buckingham's pick of Wells Fargo to outperform. As explained in a write-up on TheFly.com today, the analyst's positive opinion of Wells Fargo depends on three primary factors. First and foremost, Buckingham believes that Wells Fargo will benefit from sizable earnings leverage from Congress' move to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Granted, not all corporations were paying 35% even before tax reform passed in Congress -- but some were still paying a lot. Last year, S&P Global Market Intelligence data show Wells Fargo paid income taxes of $10.1 billion on pre-tax income of $32.1 billion -- a 31% tax rate. Cutting 10 percentage points off that rate should add about $3.2 billion in windfall profits to Wells Fargo's bottom-line profit (which was $21.9 billion last year), benefiting shareholders mightily. And yet, Buckingham argues that despite the positive prospects, ""expectations"" are ""low"" for Wells Fargo going forward, while its valuation is attractive. S&P Global estimates show analysts projecting no more than a 7.7% annualized long-term growth rate for Wells Fargo. The tax reform windfall could grow Wells' annual profit by roughly 15% -- which equates to about 3% improvement in annual profits when spread out over five years, and suggests Wells Fargo's profits might now actually grow at nearly 11% annually over the next five years. Combined with the stock's 2.1% dividend yield, that gives you a total return approaching 13% -- not bad for a stock selling for just 14 times trailing earnings. Speaking of tax reform, Buckingham's argument in favor of buying JPMorgan Chase stock is similar: Tax reform will yield ""'sizable' earnings leverage"" to this bank's bottom line as well, reports TheFly.com. Share buybacks permitted by banking regulatory reform will further accelerate earnings growth. On top of all this, Buckingham views JPMorgan as the ""best-in-class franchise"" in banking, which makes the stock's 13.7 times earnings valuation even more attractive than the 14 times earnings cost of Wells Fargo stock. But is Buckingham right to prefer JPMorgan Chase? I'm not so sure. Start with the tax savings. In contrast to Wells Fargo's 31% tax rate, JPMorgan Chase paid only $9.8 billion in taxes last year -- just 28% of its $34.5 billion in pre-tax income. As such, a reduction in its tax rate to 21% would save only 7 percentage points, and add $2.4 billion to Chase's bottom line, boosting last year's net income of $24.7 billion to $27.1 billion -- a 10% improvement, or about 2% per year when spread over five years. Added to the 5% growth rate that analysts were already expecting from JPMorgan, that works out to 7% annual growth. Plus a 2.1% dividend yield, the total return on JPMorgan stock over the next five years might be 9% or so -- too low to justify even a valuation of 13.7 times earnings, in my view. Last but not least, Wedbush Securities' pick: Regions Financial. Rather than fixate on tax reform as Buckingham does, Wedbush outlines an argument for rising interest rates, cost cutting, and ""capital optimization"" positioning Regions stock for ""above average earnings growth over the next two years."" That's not to say that Regions will be totally left out in the cold by tax reform, however -- far from it. Last year, Regions paid $514 million in taxes on $1.7 billion in pre-tax income -- a 31% tax rate similar to Wells Fargo's -- with a net profit of $1.2 billion. Cut 10 percentage points worth of taxes for Regions, and the bank's profits would grow by $167 million, bulking up the bottom line to more than $1.3 billion. Take that 14% one-time increase in profits and average it over five years, and it adds just under 3 percentage points to the 11.8% growth rate that analysts were already expecting Regions to achieve -- putting the stock within spitting distance of a 15% growth rate. Now add a 2.1% dividend yield, and the total return on Regions stock could approach 17% annually over the next five years. With Regions stock now selling for 16.4 times earnings, I'd argue this makes Regions the best bargain of the bunch. While I agree with the analysts that tax reform makes all three of these stocks more attractive today than they were as recently as Wednesday, if asked to rank the prospects, I'd say that Regions looks like the best bargain, Wells Fargo second, and JPMorgan last.

    Analyst Picks: 3 Bank Stocks to Buy in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Matthew Frankel, CFP",12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Matt Frankel: Always good to be here! Douglass: Fantastic. Let's hop right in. We're going to be talking about five major stories in financials this year. Story No. 1: Jerome Powell as the new Fed chair. Frankel: This was not unexpected. President Trump did not renominate Janet Yellen, which set off a big wave of speculation -- is he going to nominate somebody more conservative or dovish, I guess you would say. But he nominated Jerome Powell, who's pretty much, it was his best choice for making a change without actually making a change, is the best way I could put it. Nothing really changed in terms of expectations. Before he was nominated, the markets expected three interest rate hikes in 2018, for example. They still expect that. Not much has changed, which is a good thing. If it's not broke, don't fix it. But this was President Trump's way of putting a little bit of a change at the Federal Reserve without actually making too much of a ruckus about it. Douglass: Yes. Yellen and Powell, I think they can best be characterized as centrist and a little dovish. And by that what I mean is, doves tend to be very measured about raising interest rates, sometimes even want more fiscal stimulus, whereas the hawks tend to be more in favor of raising interest rates to keep up with American economic growth. So Yellen, and now Powell, have tended to say, yes, we're going to do some interest rate increases, but they're going to be very slow and very measured. We do not want to disrupt this economic recovery. Frankel: Yeah, definitely. Basically, they don't want to add to any uncertainty that already exists. Between tax reform, things like North Korea, there are a lot of things that could cause volatility in 2018, but the Fed probably won't be one of them. Douglass: Right. And when thinking about this story, that's probably the key investing takeaway: The Fed is not going to be contributing to volatility next year, as far as we can tell. Of course, no one can predict the future, etc. But we have no reason, based on Jerome Powell's history, to think that the Fed is going to be anything but a stabilizing force next year and in the years to come. Story No. 2: interest rates. Because, of course, it ties right into the Fed. The Fed increases interest rates when the economy is doing well, so they control inflation. Of course, they tend to drop interest rates when the economy needs a little bit of an extra nudge. The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year, and it's now going to be up to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%. And they have signaled three more interest rate increases next year, two in 2019, and two more in 2020. Frankel: That's really the key story. The interest rate hike that just happened and the few that have already happened to this year were pretty expected. There were no big surprises anywhere. The real thing that can move markets is what the Fed expects to do in the future. For example, if we wind up getting four rate hikes next year instead of three, things like that could really move the market, because these tend to be priced in ahead of time. One of the key sectors this could move is banks, which tend to profit more when interest rates get higher. And the stock prices from an investment standpoint are based on what the market expects to happen. Right now, for example, we're expecting three interest rate hikes next year, two more in 2019, and two more in 2020. This is somewhat reflected in stock prices right now. If we get surprises, that's when you're going to see changes. Douglass: Yes. Also, it's worth noting, we're in a historically low interest rate environment, even right now, even with this year's three increases. And that's been because the global economic recovery and the U.S. economic recovery have looked, in a lot of ways, pretty fragile. But Janet Yellen, at her most recent press conference, gave us this quote. She said, ""The global economy is doing well. We're in a synchronized expansion. This is the first time in many years we've seen this."" I think, if you're concerned about the American economy -- and I suspect that if you're listening to this or if you're anyone in the world, you're probably concerned about the American economy, given how much of a driver of the global economy it is -- that's good news, and that speaks well to the overall global recovery. I think one of the other things that's worth noting is, this historically low interest rate environment is likely one of the reasons we've seen so many acquisitions in the last few years. A lot of folks are locking in low interest rate debt while they can. And frankly, also because the economy hasn't been doing that well, in a lot of ways, one of the easier ways to get growth has been to buy it. Frankel: Yeah, definitely. Like you said, this is more of a normalization than it is interest rate hikes. You've also seen companies in a rush to refinance existing debt for this reason, to take advantage of the low environment. And the recovery has looked kind of fragile recently, but not over the last year or two, which, to tell you the truth, kind of makes me nervous as an investor, that things aren't looking like we need to maintain quite as much. But, generally, this is good for banks, bad for high-dividend stocks, and bad for anyone who wants to take on debt as interest rates are rising. Douglass: Right. The reason this is bad for high-dividend stocks is because those dividends come with some risk. When interest rates increase, bond rates also increase, meaning that, let's just say, for example, you have a stock that yields 5%, and you're in that stock for 5% because bonds are all yielding lower than that. Well, if bonds suddenly started yielding 6% or 7%, then from a stock-price standpoint, it's not going to be so great for those dividend stocks, as many of their income investors flee to bonds. But, from an underlying-business standpoint, and I think this is the key investing takeaway for any Foolish investor, that doesn't matter. What really matters is what this is going to do to underlying businesses. This is going to be great for banks, as you pointed out, Matt. They're going to be able to arbitrage more effectively the higher interest rates are. We'll all see, hopefully, our savings account yields increase a little bit -- won't be by nearly as much as [banks] are increasing yields on their loan book, so they'll be doing just fine. It's going to be a little bit troublesome for REITs (real estate investment trusts), which basically take on a lot of debt so they can purchase properties and lease them out. You're probably going to see them suffer, and their spreads narrow, and therefore their businesses be a little bit more threatened. And of course, as you noted, any business looking to take on a lot of debt or that has a lot of variable debt could also be affected. Frankel: Yeah. And it's actually worth pointing out that this has been bitcoin's third best year. This isn't even the highest performance percentage-wise. I could tell you from personal experience, I wish I had back the 20 bitcoins I owned in 2015 when they were worth $200. Douglass: Yeah, oof. [laughs] Frankel: Wouldn't we all? I also wish I would have played the winning lottery numbers last night. But that brings me to the point I wanted to make for investors. This is very much a speculative investment at this point. Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency for that matter, or any company that's involved in cryptocurrencies, any financial firm that's placing big bets on cryptocurrencies in their technology, these are all very speculative things at this point. Don't confuse a long-term investment with gambling. Douglass: And I think this is an important point. It's been very interesting, particularly in the last month, watching so many people who have never thought much about investing suddenly get really excited about bitcoin and talk about trading bitcoin and making money in bitcoin. It brings back to me that timeless bit of wisdom from Warren Buffett, ""be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" I'm seeing a lot of greed, and I'm seeing a lot of people really really excited about this, and I think excited beyond what is reasonable, and that as an investor makes me afraid. So that's why I'm very firmly outside of the cryptocurrency space and likely to remain so. Frankel: If you think back to the dot-com boom, the point when you really needed to start worrying was when people who, like you said, never were interested in investing before were suddenly buying mom and pop's dot-com. And just like any other boom, like the tech boom, a lot of money will be made here, a lot of money will be lost here. They just recently started trading bitcoin futures on two major futures exchanges. This should help bring a little stability, theoretically, to the price of bitcoin, but it also adds an interesting dynamic in that it allows institutions to short bitcoin, which has never been an option before. So this could be kind of a stabilizing mechanism, as well as downward pressure at the same time. It'll be interesting to watch how the bitcoin futures introduction plays out. That might be one of our big stories of 2018. Douglass: I suspect so. I've received a few emails from folks who are interested in having us do a couple of deep dives on cryptocurrencies. I want you all to know that I have a book, and I'm planning to read it and do some more research, and definitely very much on our list for 2018. Matt is actually one of our big cryptocurrency writers, so we'll have a lot to talk about. But I want to make sure that we have the time to really put together some really great episodes before we hop into that. So, just to let you all know, it's coming. It'll come sometime in 2018, probably in the first quarter. Alright, story No. 4: Wells Fargo. This is not a particularly happy story, because Wells Fargo has had a pretty darn rough 2017. Frankel: This is technically a 2016 story, because that's when the news of their wrongdoing -- in Elizabeth Warren's phrase, a scam -- first came to light. Whether you think the bank was completely at fault or it was a bunch of rogue employees, that's another discussion for another day. But one of my favorite Warren Buffett lines is, ""you'll find that when you turn the lights on, there's not just one cockroach in the kitchen."" And this really applies here. First of all, the number of people affected by the fake-account scandal during 2017 grew from the 2 million that were originally disclosed to about 3.5 million. Not only that, there were a bunch of other mini-scandals that were brought to light. In one, Wells Fargo was charging 800,000 customers for auto insurance they didn't need. In one they were caught improperly raising mortgage rates for certain customers that they hadn't properly disclosed that they were going up for a rate increase. And there were a couple more. They were making unauthorized changes to people's mortgages. So you see all of these scandals snowballing, and it's pretty much because regulators, the investing media decided to take a closer look at Wells Fargo and scrutinize them a little more. So even though this was brought to light in 2016, it turned into a bad 2017. 2016 was OK for Wells Fargo in that they did initial damage control, in my opinion, pretty well. But in 2017, it's just been one thing after another, and it's really been weighing on the company's results and, as a result, its stock price. Douglass: Right. I think when we take a step back, one of the things that Wells Fargo was really well known for was its aggressive sales culture. [Former] CEO John Stumpf used to say that ""eight is great."" What that meant was, let's try and get each Wells customer into at least eight products. With that being the expectation, employees were under a great deal of pressure and pretty clearly cheated. Not saying, to be clear, that all Wells Fargo employees cheated. That's certainly not the case. But a significant proportion did, and we're seeing issues across a number of different departments. So that's been a really rough drip-drip-drip of bad news for Wells Fargo. And as you noted, across the board the bank is reeling. Their efficiency ratio, which is a measure of core profitability and their ability to control expenses, has climbed. That's bad. You want a smaller efficiency ratio. It's above 65% in the most recent quarter. Historically speaking, Wells Fargo has generally been in the mid-to-upper 50s, and that's kind of where you want to see a big bank. And revenue and earnings per share are both down year over year, because frankly, there's a trust deficit, and I think understandably so. It's interesting. I don't know what I think about Wells Fargo going forward in a lot of ways. What I do know is, the sales culture was supposedly the one thing that really made Wells really different from the other big banks. And sure, there were other things too, to be clear. But that was one of the really big pieces of any investing thesis. Now that that is, at least for the moment, gone -- and again, to be clear, rightfully so. Is the stock undervalued? Possibly. But by the same token, for me, when I'm looking for investments, I'm looking for companies that can distinguish themselves in some way. And I don't see a lot in Wells that really breaks it out differently, at least for me as an investor. And frankly, I want to beat the market. I'm not looking to match the market's return, or buy, essentially, a high-cost ETF of big bank stocks. I'm looking for the best investments. And Wells just doesn't fit that criteria for me. Frankel: Yeah. As Buffett would say, they lost one of their most durable competitive advantages in terms of the cross-selling ability. They never really stopped to think whether or not people needed eight different baking products. I read somewhere that the average person has less than 10 banking products total between all the banks and credit card companies and everybody they deal with. That was a pretty lofty goal, so it's not surprising that it led to wrongdoing. Douglass: No. 5, and perhaps in a lot of ways the biggest story of the year, the Equifax account hacking scandal. 143 million accounts hacked, yours truly potentially included. It's been quite the year for Equifax. Frankel: Yeah. I look at this as kind of the biggest story of the year from a consumer point of view, not necessarily from an investor point of view. I personally wouldn't touch Equifax's stock. But I don't really foresee this affecting their bottom line on a long-term basis, simply because consumers aren't the ones who generate most of their revenue. They depend on consumers and their personal information for the revenue, but generally speaking, they're paid by companies. So I don't see this as a big investing story. I do see this as a big story from the personal side, as in the three main credit bureaus, their existence is predicated on the fact that they're good at handling people's personal information. So this highlights the need for people to protect their own identity, not necessarily by taking advantage of the credit monitoring service Equifax is offering customers as compensation, but just in general, monitoring your own credit, knowing how to freeze your credit if you need to, putting out a fraud alert. We actually had a lot of coverage come out about this around that time. I'm sure Michael would be able to send you any of our tips lists if you're concerned about your own -- what to look out for and what to do, what it means that your identity was compromised. But, like I said, I see this as the biggest story of the year from a consumer standpoint. Douglass: Yes, I would be perfectly happy to send it along. If you have any credit concerns, drop us a note -- industryfocus@fool.com -- and I'll be happy to send you along some of the content that we have. I think, thinking about this from a really broad standpoint, we've all known to some extent that companies and governments have been waging a defensive war against hackers for years. And frankly, the hacks are getting bigger and more frequent. It's been a real struggle for Equifax, for plenty of insurers and hospital systems. This is a problem that really crosses industry boundaries. And I suspect that it's going to get worse before it gets better. Of course, no one can predict the future, but it looks pretty rough. Personally, I was never that excited about Equifax as a business, so I'm a stay-away. Certainly, the hacking scandal didn't really endear them to me any extra. ","
      
    5 Top Financial Sector Stories of 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Bank stocks have consistently performed well since bottoming out in the wake of the financial crisis. But this past year was nevertheless one to remember for people who hold bank stocks in their portfolios. If you go back to before the presidential election last year, the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap bank stocks, has handily outperformed the broader market. All told, the KBW Bank Index has surged 42% since the week before the election. The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 26% over the same stretch. KBWB data by YCharts. With the benefit of hindsight, it's clear that there were two catalysts for the growth in bank stocks. The first was then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's vows on the campaign trail to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in 2010 to address the causes of the banking crisis two years earlier. If regulations in the bank industry are relaxed, compliance costs at banks would drop, which would bolster their bottom lines. An easing of regulations would also, there is reason to believe, encourage more innovation in the financial industry, as there would be less fear of regulatory blowback for mistakes and errors uncovered in the early stages of a new product or service. Image source: Getty Images. The flip side of this, of course, is that an easing of regulations could chip away at important safeguards put into place by the Dodd-Frank Act that add to the safety and soundness of the bank industry. This includes things like the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from proprietary trading -- acting, in a sense, like a hedge fund. Moreover, the recent moves at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, most importantly the appointment of a new leader at the agency, could encourage less scrupulous companies on the periphery of finance -- payday lenders, for instance -- to employ unsavory practices to boost revenue and earnings at the expense of consumers. The second catalyst that fueled the growth in bank stocks this year is the hope for a corporate tax cut. President Trump campaigned on the promise to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%. As the legislation has taken shape, however, it looks increasingly likely that the rate will be closer to 20%. This would be especially beneficial to banks, which explains why the KBW Bank Index has rallied so much in the past 13 months. The reason banks would benefit so much is because they pay a lot in taxes. In fact, three out of the top five S&P 500 companies that pay the most in taxes are all banks: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. This goes a long way toward explaining why shares of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, in particular, have seen their stocks perform so well since the beginning of November 2016. Bank of America is up 74% over this stretch. JPMorgan Chase has climbed 53%. Wells Fargo, by contrast, is a bit of an exception. The California-based bank has struggled to put a multiyear fake-account scandal behind it. The news was first widely reported in September 2016, when the CFPB announced that it was fining Wells Fargo for opening accounts for customers without their approval to do so. Since then, there's been a regular drip of news about similar practices in other areas of Wells Fargo's operations. The net result is that the nation's third-biggest bank by assets has seen its shares lag its peer group, up 30% since before the presidential election. It still remains to be seen whether the tax bill will actually be able to get the votes it needs to pass. Republicans are in the process of reconciling the House and Senate bills into a joint final version, which will then be voted on again. With Republican Sen. Bob Corker already signaling that he won't support the bill, that narrows the margin for error down to only two votes, given the current split in the Senate. The market is reflecting confidence that the tax bill will pass, as stocks have rallied throughout the year. But there are still a handful of hurdles ahead, including the recent news that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has said that he will vote against the bill unless it expands the child tax credit. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) has taken a similar position, which explains why he remains undecided on whether to vote in favor of the final version of the bill. Ultimately, the outcome of the tax bill seems like it's the largest catalyst on the horizon right now. Stocks may not surge if it passes, as much of the gain already seems to be incorporated into stock prices given the performance of the market over the past 13 months, but they could go in the other direction if the bill fails.

    Here's Why Bank Stocks Had a Stellar 2017 -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Matthew Frankel, CFP",12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: The Motley Fool. The majority of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio was hand-selected by CEO Warren Buffett himself. This is especially true of the portfolio's largest stock positions. With that in mind, here are Berkshire's 10 largest positions, according to the latest available information -- and why Warren Buffett might like each one. Image Source: Kraft Heinz. Berkshire's $25.5 billion, 325.6 million-share Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) position is a result of the merger of Heinz (which Berkshire owned) with Kraft Foods. Berkshire's stake represents 26.7% ownership of the combined operation. Buffett is likely a fan of the synergies created by combining two giant food companies, as well as the portfolio of high-value brand names owned by Kraft Heinz, including Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House, and Lunchables, in addition to its two namesake brands. Image source: Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) remains one of Berkshire's largest stock positions, even after the infamous fake-accounts scandal that sent many investors running for the exits. With 464.2 million shares worth $27.5 billion, Berkshire owns about 9% of the banking giant. Berkshire has actually reduced its Wells Fargo position in recent quarters, but this was more of a regulatory compliance issue than anything related to the business. Despite the numerous scandals plaguing the bank, Buffett has called Wells Fargo an ""incredible institution"" and says that it's still a good long-term investment. Image Source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a relatively new addition to Berkshire's portfolio, as the position has been built up within the past two years. As of the end of 2017's third quarter, Berkshire owns 134.1 million shares of Apple with a market value of $22.7 billion. While Buffett has traditionally avoided tech stocks, it's not difficult to see why he might like Apple. The company has a fantastic balance sheet, one of the world's most valuable brand names, and extremely ""sticky"" products, meaning that Apple customers tend to remain Apple customers. Image Source: Coca-Cola. A longtime Buffett favorite, both as an investment and as a product, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is Berkshire's fourth largest investment. The 400 million shares in Berkshire's portfolio are worth about $18.1 billion. Coca-Cola has numerous competitive advantages that Buffett loves. To name a couple, the company's world-famous brand gives it pricing power, and its vast distribution network gives it cost advantages unmatched by competitors. Plus, the business is easy to understand and easy to run-- two other qualities Buffett loves. In fact, Buffett has said that a ham sandwich could run Coca-Cola. Image Source: Bank of America. While Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is technically the newest addition to Berkshire's stock portfolio out of these 10, it's important to mention that Buffett actually invested in the bank several years ago. However, the original investment was in the form of preferred stock and warrants to buy common shares, which were recently exercised. Berkshire now owns 679 million shares of Bank of America, worth $19.7 billion as of this writing. Image source: American Express. American Express (NYSE:AXP) is a longtime Buffett favorite. Berkshire currently owns 151.6 million shares of the credit card giant, with a total market value of $14.9 billion. American Express has a valuable brand, an affluent cardholder base that gives it pricing power over its rivals, and a closed-loop payment network that allows it to profit from transaction fees as well as interest from its cardholder balances. Image source: Phillips 66. A relatively new entry to Berkshire's portfolio, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) is Buffett's largest energy bet. With 80.7 million shares worth $8.1 billion, Berkshire owns nearly 16% of Phillips 66. Unlike many oil companies, Phillips 66 is a downstream operator, meaning it makes its money by refining, marketing, and processing petroleum products. Because of this, its profits aren't too dependent on the price of crude oil, which has allowed the company to thrive even as oil prices have remained depressed for several years. Image source: IBM. IBM (NYSE:IBM) was a much larger position in Berkshire's portfolio until recently. Over the past couple of years, Berkshire has chosen to reduce its exposure to IBM from 81 million shares just a couple of years ago to 37 million shares today. Still, with a market value of more than $5.7 billion, Berkshire's stake in IBM remains one of its biggest. While Buffett likes IBM's business model and the high switching costs incurred by its customers, competition in the industry has heated up, and Buffett has reportedly revalued the stock downward. Image Source: Getty Images. You may have noticed that Buffett's stock portfolio is bank-heavy. The fourth financial stock in the top 10, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) makes up $4.7 billion of Berkshire's portfolio value with an 85.1 million share position. There's not much to dislike about U.S. Bancorp. The bank has a well-established track record of smart risk management, which allowed it to emerge from the financial crisis even stronger than it went in, and it's consistently the most profitable of the big U.S. banks. Image source: Getty Images. Finishing off the top 10 is credit rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO). Berkshire's 24.7 million-share position is worth almost $3.8 billion, representing a 12.9% stake in the company. Buffett loves the high barriers to entry in Moody's business, which have resulted in few competitors and strong pricing power. Also, the business generates lots of capital and requires little money to grow -- a combination Buffett loves. ","
      
    Warren Buffett's 10 Largest Current Stock Bets -- The Motley Fool

Diversification is a simple way to protect your investments during market corrections, and failing to do so can lead to disaster. In investing terms, diversification means spreading your money across a wide range of different investments to make a well-rounded portfolio. The benefit of diversification is that no matter how the stock market or the economy is doing, at least some of your investments will be thriving -- and if a single investment tanks, it won't drag your entire portfolio down with it. Diversification lowers your risk and also gives you more options in the event you need to sell off some investments to generate cash. Image source: Getty Images. Different types of investments (known as ""asset classes"" in investor-speak) tend to react differently to the same conditions. For example, take stocks and bonds. When everything's going smoothly, both types of investments tend to prosper. However, when the economy starts to shift in one direction or another, stocks and bonds often react in opposite ways. On the other hand, when the economy slows down and starts looking like it's on the brink of a recession, the Fed will generally try to spur business by lowering interest rates, which makes it easier for companies to borrow money and therefore to start growing and expanding again. The kind of economic behavior that will generate this reaction also tends to drag down stock prices, as stocks are based on businesses. The drop in stock prices will inspire many investors to sell out of stocks and buy bonds instead, driving up bond values. And when the Fed does lower interest rates, existing bonds become even more valuable, as they're still paying interest at the former rate. Stocks and bonds aren't the only assets available, though a savvy investor can do an excellent job of diversifying with just those two types of investments. If you'd like to range further afield, you could also purchase real estate (in the form of actual property or shares in a real estate investment trust), cash or cash equivalents such as CDs, or commodities such as gold. That's why it's important to buy widely differing investments in each asset class. The simplest way to diversify your stock and bond holdings is to buy shares of stock and bond index funds. Many of these index funds are already quite diversified for you. For stocks, an S&P 500 index fund is a great way to start, because it will automatically invest you in hundreds of large, established companies. If you want to be even more diversified, you can go for a total stock market fund, which buys shares of everything on the entire U.S. market. Bond funds allow you to invest in bonds that are grouped by term (short-term, intermediate, or long-term), type (Federal, corporate, municipal), and other qualities. As with stock funds, you can also choose an extremely broad bond index fund that will pick bonds from each and every one of these categories. Another excellent way to diversify is to purchase some foreign investments. After all, a market crash here in the U.S. may not affect China's stock market at all. Some wide-ranging stock and bond funds include a few foreign holdings; you can also choose to purchase shares of one domestic index fund and one foreign index fund. If you choose the latter approach, be careful to select a foreign fund that includes investments from more than one country. Once you've diversified your portfolio, you'll have a much better chance of riding out any economic turmoil that occurs in the future. Market downturns are inevitable, but while certain investments are sinking, others will help to keep your portfolio afloat. ","

Image source: The Motley Fool. Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Casey's General Stores (CASY) Second-Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press * and then 0 on your touchtone telephone. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Bill inveWalljasper, chief financial officer. Sir, you may begin. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss CASY's results for the quarter ended October 31. I'm Bill Walljasper, CFO. Terry Handley, president, and chief executive officer, is also here. Before we begin, I'll remind you that certain statements made by us during this investor's call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1985. These forward-looking statements including statements relating to our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, growth opportunities, and performance improvements at our stores. There are a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements, which are also described in our most recent annual report on form 10-K and co-reports on form 10-Q as filed with the SEC and available on our website. Any forward-looking statements made during this call reflect our current views as of today with respect to future events and CASY's disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. We'll take a few minutes to summarize the results of the second quarter then afterwards open for questions about results. I'm now going to turn the call over to Terry to discuss our results. Terry Handley, President and Chief Executive Officer -- Thank you, Bill, and good morning everyone. As most of you have already seen, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.28 compared to $1.44 a year ago. The quarter started off with strong sales during the month of August. Unfortunately, we were unable to maintain that pace throughout the remainder of the quarter as we experienced softer traffic in the back half of the period which adversely impacted sales. Year to date, diluted earnings per share were $2.75 compared to $3.14 in the same period last year. In the fuel category, our retail pricing strategy allowed us to achieve an increase in same-store gallons sold of 1.9%, which continues to outpace miles driven reported by the United States Department of Transportation and our publicly traded peers. Total gallons sold for the quarter rose 5.7% to 562 million. The average retail price of fuel during this period was $2.33 a gallon compared to $2.10 last year. During the quarter we experienced an increase in wholesale fuel cost volatility, primarily due to the hurricane activity. As a result, the average fuel margin in the quarter was $0.197 per gallon. Year to date, the fuel margin was $0.195 per gallon, which is at the high end of our annual guidance. The second-quarter margin benefited from the sale of renewable fuel credits, commonly known as RINS. During the quarter, we sold 17.3 million RINS for $14.5 million. RINS are currently trading around $0.90. For comparison purposes going forward, last year in the third quarter the average RIN sold for approximately $0.89. Same-store gallons sold year to date were up 1.8%, which is the top of our annual guidance. [Audio gap] total gallons sold for the year up 5.6% to 1.1 billion. Due to the higher fuel margin in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago and increased gallons sold, gross profit dollars in the fuel category grew 11.7% to $110.7 million. Total sales in the grocery and other merchandise category were up 5% to $572.2 million in the second quarter. Same-store sales were up 2.5% during the quarter, which was toward the lower end of our guidance due to slower traffic in October that we believe was attributable to multiple adverse weather patterns throughout the month. However, we continue to outpace market data in our operating region. The average margin in the quarter was 32%, consistent with a year ago in the same period and at the top end of our annual guidance. As a result, gross profit for the quarter in the category was up nearly 5% to $183 million. For the year, same-store sales were up 2.8%, with total sales up 5.3% to $1.2 billion. The average margin year to date was 31.9%. We're pleased with the gains in the category in light of the current environment that we are currently experiencing, and we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities as we benefit from the continued roll-out of major remodels, replacement stores, and new-store openings. In the prepared food and fountain category, total sales were up 5.5% to $262 million for the quarter. Same-store sales were up 2.1%, which fell below our annual guidance. After starting the quarter off strong in the month of August, this category was the most affected in the back half of the quarter, especially in October with the previously mentioned adverse weather patterns that drove negative same-store customer account for the month. We recognize that our customers continue to be value-conscious, and we have seen how well the fuel-saver program has resonated with them over the years. Beginning December 1, we kicked off a ""Pizza-to-Pump"" promotion. The program offers a $0.10 per-gallon coupon on up to 20 gallons of fuel for the purchase of any large pizza. We have offered this promotion in the past in select areas of a market with great success. As retail fuel prices have risen recently we believe this offer will lessen the strain on our consumers. The average margin for the second quarter was 61.3%, down 160 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to an increase in sales and higher input costs. The average cost of cheese has locked in at our Ankeny distribution center through December 2017 at $1.86 per pound. The market has recently been favorable for a cheese pricing, giving us the opportunity to enter into a new forward-buy of cheese. We are currently locked in for nearly all of our cheese through December 2018, at a price of approximately $1.87 per pound. In the quarter, prepared-food gross profit dollars rose 2.7% to $160.5 million. Year to date, same-store sales were up 2.9% with an average margin of 61.9%. Based on our year-to-date results we have revised our annual same-store sales guidance range down from 4% to 6% to 2% to 4%. We are encouraged about our long-term growth outlook in this area as we continue to benefit from the roll-out of our growth programs, new-store openings, and the implementation of price optimization, as well as the new digital engagement platform. At the six-month mark, operating expenses were up 9.7%. For the quarter, operating expenses increased 9.4% to $322.9 million. Approximately 60% of this increase was due to a rise in wages and payroll taxes primarily related to operating more stores compared to a year ago in the same period. In addition, we experienced a combined increase of $4.1 million in credit card fees and fuel expense primarily due to increased retail fuel prices in the quarter. This had a 140 basis-point adverse impact to the quarterly operating increase. We continue to make gains in controlling our operating expenses.Store-level operating expenses for open stores not impacted by any of the growth programs were up approximately 3.7% in the second quarter. Without the impact from the increase of store manager salaries stemming from the proposed change by the Department of Labor a year ago, store-level expenses would have been up approximately 2.7%. The unchanged numbers include the adverse impacts of the higher credit card fees mentioned previously. Operating expenses will continue to be an area of focus throughout the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill to discuss the financial statements. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- On the income statement, total revenue in the quarter was up over 12% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to an 11% increase in the retail price of fuel from the second quarter last year and increased sales gains mentioned previously, as well as increased number of stores in operation this quarter compared to the same period a year ago. Depreciation was up 11.3 %. We expect depreciation increase in the second half of the year, as we accelerate the number of new-store openings. Year-to-date total revenues up 9.2%. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.9%, up 80 basis points primarily due to a decrease in favorable permanent differences and the change in the Illinois state tax rate that went into effect during the first quarter. Recently we received a number of inquiries regarding the potential impact to Casey's with the new tax reform bill. There are many aspects to this reform and the provisions are still being debated and reconciled between the Senate and House. However, as it stands currently, taking into account all the changes in the new tax law, we anticipate it will have a significant one-time favorable impact on earnings per share when it becomes effective as Casey's will reset our deferred tax liability at the new lower tax rate. Going forward in future years, the company will benefit from the substantially lower corporate effective tax rate. Our balance sheet continues to be strong. At October 31, cash and cash equivalents were $285.2 million, up from $76.7 million at the end of the fiscal year, primarily due to the additional debt we secured for future growth offset by share repurchases. Long-term debt net of [Inaudible] maturities was $1.3 billion. At the six-month mark, we generated $242 million in cash flow from operations, and capital expenditures were $271.6 million compared to $209.2 million a year ago in the same period. We expect capital expenditures to increase as new-store construction accelerates, we close on additional acquisitions, and we complete more major remodels during the second half of our fiscal year. Lastly, I would like to give you an update on the progress of the share-repurchase program. As a reminder, the program authorized purchases of up to $300 million of common stock over the course of two years. As the press release indicated, during the second fiscal quarter we repurchased over 510,000 shares for approximately $55 million. Since the start of the program, we have repurchased nearly 1.7 million shares. We continue to believe a share-repurchase program is an important tool in providing shareholder value. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Terry to talk about our unit growth and an update on our growth programs. Terry? Terry Handley, President and Chief Executive Officer -- Thanks, Bill. This quarter we opened 10 new store constructions and completed 13 replacement stores. We acquired 11 stores and have 16 additional acquisitions stores under agreement to purchase. We also completed 17 major remodels in the quarter. In addition to all this activity, we currently have 66 new stores, 18 replacement stores, and 14 major remodels under construction. Currently, we have 134 sites under agreement for new builds. We are also encouraged by the increase in acquisition activity. We believe this is in part related to the continued challenges in the economic environment in our marketing territory. Our store count at the end of this quarter was 2,003. Given our strong balance sheet and expanded geography, we're positioned very well for future growth. We are also excited to celebrate the milestone of opening of our 2,000th store, in Russellville, Kentucky. Growth programs continue to be a key part of our long-term strategy. In the first six months, we converted 65 locations to a 24-hour format and 75 stores to the pizza-delivery format. In addition to these conversions, we have also completed 28 major remodels. For the fiscal year, we are planning to complete 75 major remodels. Currently, we have a total of 1,062 stores that are open 24 hours, 655 stores that deliver pizza, and 492 stores that have been remodeled. In addition to these programs, we were encouraged by the performance of our online ordering program. Total downloads of the mobile app have now exceeded 1 million. The amount of pizza orders completed online has climbed to 16% and the basket bring of an online order continues to be around 20% higher compared to a telephonic order. At this time I would like to update you on the progress of our price-optimization and digital-engagement programs mentioned in our previous earnings call. Since that time, we've engaged separate consultants for each program. Each consultant is currently going through an assessment phase, which will clarify our present state and provide a road map and timeline associated with the development and integration of each program. This assessment phase will be completed in January. We will update all of you in more detail at our earnings call in March. We believe that these programs will give us the opportunity to widen our customer base with better insight to our customer needs and buying habits. We will also have an opportunity to take advantage of differences in market conditions related to pricing of certain products, allowing us the ability to drive incremental growth profit dollars. In closing, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities. The steps we have taken over the past year has put the company in a position to have consistent and sustained unit growth over the next several years at higher levels than we have experienced in the past. We will look to augment our new-store construction activity with acquisitions in both new and existing markets. Keep in mind that we will always have return on invested capital as a top priority. As we look ahead to the remaining part of the fiscal year and into Fiscal 2019 and beyond, we feel we have the opportunity to drive significant long-term shareholder value. We will now take your questions. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time if you have a question please press the * and the No. 1 key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered and you want to remove yourself from the queue, please press the # key. And our first question comes from the line of Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Hey guys, just wanted to circle back on the prepared foods. Obviously, you guys were running pretty strong in August and then, you called out October, I guess was weather? Could you just help us kind of understand kind of how the cadence, traffic, and average ticket was throughout the quarter and how you guys are doing thus far in the third quarter? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yeah, absolutely, Shane, I'll go ahead and field that question, and you're exactly right. In the last earnings call, we certainly called out the month of August at that time, and we certainly were performing what we consider to be relatively strong in the month of August. At that time gallons were certainly trending above the current guidance at that time and as you may recall, Shane, that we did make some comments that both prepared food and grocery and general merchandise were trending toward the higher end of the range. And so as you move through the quarter, the month of October really was kind of the call-out as far as, kind of the downward trend there. As we alluded to, we had negative customer account on a same-store basis in the month of October. One of the comments there that Terry made had to do with adverse weather patterns, and so in the month of August, excuse me, in the month of October throughout the majority of our area, we experienced on the weekends significant thunderstorm activity and rainstorms. That may not sound like a severe weather pattern but when roughly about half to 60% of our pizza sales run through the weekends and you have customers that just don't get out and about because of the weather patterns that will affect a short-term basis and that's what we're referring to there. Really, October was the month that really was kind of the anomaly in the quarter when we look at it. Does that answer all your questions, Shane? Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- So does that indicate that, I mean obviously you guys brought your guidance down a little bit for the for the full-year call, but it seems to imply that comps are at least stabilizing and maybe getting slightly better for the remainder of the year. I know you guys talked about the promotion that you guys just launched. Did November's trends give you guys some additional confidence that you guys can hit even the midpoint of the new range in the back half? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yea, and I think the latter part of your question is, kind of this quarter quarter-date here in Q3, kind of where we're trending at, I think that might answer your question, so with respect to the fuel gallons, we are trending ahead of our guidance, quarter to date. With respect to grocery and general merchandise and prepared foods, we would be in line with how we finished the second-quarter results. And, again, we just kicked off that pizza-to-pump promotion that Terry mentioned just about a week ago. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- OK, great. And then just on the margins. Obviously, margins were down a bit in the prepared foods. You guys did reaffirm the margin guidance for the year. Can you just give us some color as to some of the puts and takes for this quarter and as we look into the back half? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Sure, coming into the fiscal year, one of the gray areas or the unknowns was the back half of the fiscal year, because at that point time we were only locked in on our cheese through December 2017 and so, as we mentioned, we were fortunate that the pricing environment became favorable and we were able to lock in our cheese costs for the back half of the year. So that gives us some confidence to keep that guidance still intact on the margin side of the equation. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- Any changes to call out in terms of the competitive environment from any the pizza chains or any of your other prepared-food competitors? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- I don't think there's any changes that we would call out relative to what we've already called out in the past two quarters. We haven't seen necessarily any type of an acceleration in that competitive landscape. Obviously it still remains competitive but kind of stable competitive if you wanna call it that. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- Just one housekeeping. On your inventories were up about 16%, is that a reflection of the unit growth that you guys have for the back half of the year? Can you just help me understand the uptick in the inventories? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yea, there are really two things there. One would be the cigarettes, we had a price increase in cigarettes and so you saw a significant rise there, and also with the rising fuel, you would see that in the inventory category, as well. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- Got it. All right. That's it for me. I'll get back in the queue, thanks. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- You bet. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gilligan of Barclays. Your line is open. Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Hi Ryan, how you doing? Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- Good, thanks. On the digital-engagement and price-optimization projects, have you had enough time to size the opportunities yet and when do you think these initiatives can start to roll out? Terry Handley, President and Chief Executive Officer -- Yea, Ryan, this is Terry. I think we're, we had our first roll-up meeting with the digital team actually just yesterday and the price optimization, first meeting with those folks in terms of the role-up first assessment will be here later in the month so we're not ready to share with you exactly what we have planned. We want to see actually through some future discussion here what the work plan will actually look like and certainly as we've indicated in the call here so far is that we're looking at the end January to have an understanding of where we're going forward and what tools or platforms may be required to us off to the right start and we will certainly bring you more clarity on that in the Q3 call. Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- And how should we think about the cadence of unit growth for the rest of the year? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Those 66 stores that we have under construction, roughly about two-thirds of those that we anticipate closing in the fourth quarter, and so a third obviously coming here in Q3. As far as the acquisitions I would say most of it, that's kind of right on the bubble. I would push those ones that we have under agreement into the fourth quarter so definitely there will be an acceleration in the back half of the year. So we fully anticipate to be somewhere close to opening roughly 80 new-store constructions and at least as of the information we presented, we're going to have about 30 new acquisitions rolling through. Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- Do you anticipate tax reform potentially changing your appetite for doing larger deals? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Well we always have an appetite to look any type of acquisition, and certainly whether that's small or large, certainly the tax reform as it sits now stands to be a benefit to us, and so we'll have to evaluate how the final bill rolls up from House and Senate. But certainly that is a possibility. I would say this, Ryan, along the M&A front: We definitely have seen an uptick in M&A activity that's indicative by what we were report, obviously. Right now we have 14 acquired stores and 16 under agreement, that alone probably combined for last two fiscal years together, and certainly we are seen many more people willing to have conversations about selling their business. We believe certainly a reflection of the environment that we have we been talking about and that they are pretty much feeling the type of strain that we are on a slower pace, so we're encouraged by that area. Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- That makes sense and just quickly, the credit card fees for the quarter? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- The credit card fees were $31.6 million. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- I just wanted to circle back on your prepared-food margins in the guidance that you did maintain. I just really want to understand your ability to hit these targets, just thinking in context of the stepped-up promos on your pizza business that you mentioned. So I just want to understand what kind of impact that could have on your margins and maybe any other initiatives that you might have in the works in the last couple of quarters for the year that could possibly negatively impact margins. Just trying to think through that. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Just a couple thoughts around the prepared-food margin for you, Bonnie, as I mentioned, we are locked into cheese for the remaining part of this fiscal year so we're encouraged by that and that will stabilize probably the biggest variable when it comes to be prepared-food margin. The other side of the equation, one of things that affected us in the second quarter, was the weather patterns that happened to hit just about every week in the month of October. We obviously have production planners that we were scheduled to meet the demands of our customers, and obviously we have a high demand on the weekends and so when an activity like that happens on a repeat basis, we we tend to have product that in our warmers that we end up staling, so there was a little bit of an anomaly coming through there, so we think that we have opportunity to to accelerate from that point on. Also keep in mind we are locked in on our coffee, as well, well into the summer. And with respect to your question on the pizza-to-pump promotion, that actually is a coupon for fuel and so that will run through the cost of goods sold in the fuel category not the prepared-food margin category. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- So, you're still feeling pretty darn confident that the margins will be, you'll achieve them, obviously, based on what you just mentioned. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Based on the information we know of today, we didn't see a reason to change that. Some of the other categories we also maintained. Obviously the unit growth right now, the low side of that's 90, and if you go through the math that we just talked about you were tracking it around 110 and maybe a little higher than that units for this year, so that's one that looks like we're pushing toward the higher edge of that guidance. The same holds true on the fuel gallon guidance, as well. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- I imagine you're on the upper end of your margin and guidance there, closer to 20 CPG. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Obviously by what we reported we are certainly on the upper end there, as well as the same-store gallon movement. And, as we mentioned, at least through this conference call, we are trending above the same-store gallon guidance currently. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- Then I wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the key merchandise categories. I might've missed it, but if you could drill down a little bit on package beverages and you did mention, of course, the cig price increase that occurred and how your tobacco business performed, and did that in any way have any impact on some of the softer traffic you mentioned? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Well, I will say this: We think it's the weather that is causing more of the softer traffic right there, and when we have a slower traffic pattern, whether that is lower single digits or even negative, it does permeate across all lines of our business. and so I would say the takeaway there in the month of October we would have reported higher results throughout every line of our business if it hadn't been for those somewhat of anomalies there. So drilling down to your question with respect to the grocery and general merchandise category, you may have picked up that we made a comment that we believe we're gaining market share within this category. Part of the reason that we believe that is now we obviously get market data similar to what you do with IRI, Nielsen Data, also what we call supplier-shipment data, and so we are trending above all of that in the cigarette category, which obviously dominates the grocery and general merchandise category. One of the things to point out more specifically, you probably heard us in the past conference calls talk about the beer category and how promotional that's been? Here in the second quarter, I think we started late in the second quarter, we went off of a lot of promotion activity and so we definitely have seen a margin uptick in the beer category. Our liquor sales are doing exceptionally well. We continue to look for opportunities to add more liquor to our stores. That seems to be a trend, especially in some of the younger consumers that we have. Look for us to continue to increase the liquor offerings that we have. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- OK. Just one final question on the traffic, which, again, you just mentioned, that you really think a lot of it had to do with the the weak weather but then I'm trying to understand with you know your stores and the locations, it's pretty widely spread. So curious if you could give us a sense of maybe the traffic patterns across your portfolio. I'm just wondering if you didn't see any pockets of traffic growth in some areas where maybe weather was better. Just trying to really get an understanding of what happened and if you're seeing signs of improvement. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- So the magnitude of the weather, and it seems odd to talk about rain, but when heavy rain falls on the weekend it can impact us, especially if it is a broad, sweeping weather pattern. For us, the three states that would be impactful the most, as you might know, are Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois, and that's where the weather patterns hit, that represents about 75% of our store base. Typically in the winter months those storms that we get will be probably more isolated to the northern part of our region. This one just happened to be a little bit further sweeping. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- And you're already feeling better about the traffic patterns so far in this next quarter? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yea, definitely the traffic patterns are moving upward from the month of October. Operator Our next question is from the line of Ryan Domyancic of William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Domyancic -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst -- Hey, Bill, good morning and thank you for taking my question. So not to get into the traffic again, but you talked about the negative traffic attacking the prepared-food side, but gallon growth, which I assume is a pretty good proxy to traffic, has been on the high end of the guidance range for the past two quarters. So I guess can you help us understand and reconcile why gallon growth has been meeting expectations but there's some issues inside the store with that prepared-food comp? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yeah, there's probably a lot of things going on in the gallon area. Obviously in our market area there is really no alternative for public transportation so customers continue to have to go to and from work, we continue to add stores in key locations, which I think is taking market share for us. Obviously we have a fuel-saver program that's different than some of our peers that's also helping out, but we noticed that same type of what would appear to be a disconnect in central gallon movement with respect to the transition or conversion inside, and that's kind of one of the beauties of the pizza-to-pump promotion. One of the thoughts, Ryan, in order to redeem that coupon, a customer will have to go inside the store. So they buy a large pizza and get that coupon, they'll redeem that coupon at some future date, but to do so, as I just mentioned, they're forced to come into the store. So we're trying to create more touch points with consumer inside the store to convert into some type of additional sales above and beyond just the fuel, so that's one of the thought processes behind that promotion. Ryan Domyancic -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst -- All right, that's helpful. And then results to date demonstrates that you've made progress in [Inaudible] the OPEX growth in the past two quarters, but the OPEX guide was reiterated. If you have the managers' salary increases in December, are there any other costs that are going to be backfilling kind of that costs that you're lapping that would cause the OPEX growth to maintain its current trajectory instead of slow down? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- One of the things to think about, and I think Bonnie or somebody else might have asked the question about the cadence of new store roll-outs. And so obviously as we add more stores into the mix that will obviously add more operating expenses, and so that's one of things -- we did discuss whether or not we should move that guidance down, obviously we were trending to the low end of that guidance. Once we cycle over that Department of Labor, that will be one of those things that we might actually be slightly below but probably a little bit cautious from our perspective. especially after having reduced the prepared-food same-store guidance now for two quarters in a row. Just trying to take maybe a little bit of a conservative approach there. Ryan Domyancic -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst -- That makes sense. Very helpful, thank you for your time today. Operator Thank you and our next question is from the line of Irene Nattel of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just thinking about your commentary around the value-conscious consumers -- wondering what promotional activity you might have planned incrementally either in-store or above and beyond just that pizza-and-a-pump linkage to really get at that because with farm income once again having been depressed for this year, that behavior is unlikely to change as we you know get into after even after F '19. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yeah, I'll tell you this: We have a series of promotional activities throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. As we get into the latter part you'll start a frame up and think about Fiscal '19. We tend not to talk about what those are in advance -- we don't want to give our competitors any type of forewarning of what we might promote coming up. But definitely your comments ring very true here, certainly there is a value-conscious customer, we don't think that's going to change in the near term, and so we are looking for ways to bring about some value propositions for the consumer at the same time trying to drive him inside of our stores. So that's kind of what the promotional activity's about. Now to Terry's comments earlier, as well, I think when we look at the digital-engagement side of that and start kicking that off as we head into Fiscal '19 I think that'll give us some really keen insight on our consumer behavior and buying habits that we then can at that point individual promotions specific to a customer rather than just a blanket promotion that would go throughout the entire corporate territory. Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- Absolutely and, again, presumably this a lot of these initiatives really are geared to strengthen your most loyal customers but at the same time drive your top line through more effective promotions? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Yes. Yes, that's exactly right . Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- OK. I'm just on the OPEX side, I guess the last fella that was asking questions sort of was trying to get at this, but the programs that you've implemented to date, have the results been better than you anticipated? In other words, I guess I'm really trying to get at is the OPEX gains, are they bigger than you expected? Could the size of that pie be larger than what you've already disclosed? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I would characterize it this way, Irene: The ones that we have rolled out are performing as expected, but we had we have several that we just rolled out here in the last fiscal quarter that really are not part of the results that we've reported. I'd be happy to walk through some of those. The one that we first did it was changing the automatic raise of $0.25 an hour after 90 days, and we did that and that that resulted in Q1 and Q2, that's performing as expected. Also, we have taken a more a tactical approach in our advertising spend. You might recall that we did increase advertising pretty significantly in Fiscal 2017, so right now advertising spend is down and tracking to where we we believe it was expected to track at. Several things that are just out that I think will have an impact in the back half of the year. We did, as I mentioned in last call, we did establish a kind of 3% merit increase kind of target, as you might recall. We've been tracking prior to this at about 4% to 5% merit increase, which may not seem like a lot but in a 1% to 2% movement is a pretty big number. Now that one takes a course of time really to see that benefit. It is tracking right where we think it is but, keep in mind. not everybody has the same anniversary date in the company, so it takes at least a full year to kind of cycle through that to see that full benefit. We just implemented here recently what I'll call -- I'm going to characterize as an increased focus on clocking in, clocking out, primarily focused on the clocking-in side of it, and that's simply put is, we'll have hourly employees that might be scheduled, say, 9 to 5, well they come in at 8:45, clock in, and everybody thinks they're a hard worker. At the end of the day, we're paying them unscheduled labor hours, so there's a little more keen focus there and not allowing them to check in anytime sooner than when they're scheduled. So that just got kicked off the ground, so you're not seeing that in the fiscal quarter. Also, we made a change in the shift differential hours here in the second quarter . We used to have a shift differential that would pay people through 8 a.m. We pulled back several hours and that will be a benefit moving forward here into fiscal Q3, for us. And then one of the things that I know store operations has done a great job of, is taking a look at our budgeted hours and obviously when you're having maybe a slower pace of revenue in customer traffic, there might be opportunities to pull back some of the hours, and so we are tracking, that's probably the biggest reason you're seeing that unchanged store base come down. So there's a number of things like that and we can continue to look at the budget-hours calculator, as well, so just a few nuggets for you there. Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- That's really helpful, thank you. And one final question, if I may, on the proposed tax reform. A lot of what I hear says on a blended basis it would likely come in around 25%, so I guess that my question is twofold, No. 1) based on your sort of state mix is it the right level? And, No. 2) is it really as simple as taking your tax rate down from, let's call it that 35 to 36 rate level, to the 25ish level or is there something else we need to take into, keep in mind? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- To answer your first part, when you adjust for all the potential changes, and granted these changes could move here, but when you adjust for different things, some give and takes in the tax reform, that blended rate is basically what you just mentioned. Our effective tax rate right now is around 37% and I think it has the opportunity to be somewhere that, I'm gonna give you a range of 22 to 27%. I don't know when it's going to be in effect whether it's going to be 1/1/19 or how they kind of reconcile that. Then the one-time effect, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the reset of the deferred tax liabilities; think about that. That's a pretty good number that's well over a $100 million of a reset that will hit the income statement on a one-time basis. Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- Very helpful. Thank you. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- You're welcome. Operator Thank you, our next question on the line is Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Your line is open Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- Yes, thanks guys, this is actually Daniel Imbro on for Ben. Thanks for taking our questions. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- You bet. Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- So I know it's been discussed but I did want to start on the prepared-food guidance. Given we're halfway through the year, the implied range for prepared-food comps in the back half looks to be pretty wide. Is that an indication of the volatility you guys are seeing in your markets or kind of any color there on why back-half implications are still pretty wide range would be great. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Well, yea, it's still a pretty wide range predominantly because of the Pizza-at-the-Pump promotion. Obviously there's an opportunity to accelerate from where we're at. So we decided to keep it at a relatively large range at this point time. Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- OK, great. Kind of shifting gears a little bit here, with the OPEX being well -controlled can you talk about the employee reaction to some of your labor management decreased wages increases, have there been any kind of meaningful change in turnover or employee retention with those changes? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- No, we haven't seen anything. That's a great question because it's a common question we get and one we were concerned about. Right now we haven't seen any type of significant or larger spread concern over some of the changes we've made that's something that we're going to continue to monitor, especially when we start reducing hours. Obviously that creates a strain on store operations and certainly don't want to cause any adverse or unintended consequences like additional turnover from reduced hours at the store that puts pressure maybe a managerial staff person. A great question. Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- Great. Then one last one for me if I could, kind of a clarifier, I think you called out credit card fees, if I heard you right, were 140 bps of the OPEX growth in the quarter? Your OPEX growth guidance of 9 to 11, are you assuming any contribution of that from credit card fees if we see gasoline prices continue to rise? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Well that's a great question. Obviously, if fuel prices rise significant in the back half of the year, that would be one area that you will see spike up and so keep in mind that credit card fee, that $4.1 million that we referenced, that would be a combination of credit card fees and our own fuel expense to run our fleet. So it's twofold there. Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- Ok, thanks and best of luck. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- You bet. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. Your line is open. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just curious on the prepared-food comps. It sounds like the beginning of the quarter was maybe tracking over 5 and possibly flat to negative in October. I guess the weather is a big factor there but it just seems like a pretty big swing for weather so just curious if there's anything else that you think is going on? Any comparisons, any other market conditions, or just how much analysis went into kind of looking at that and how that compares to historical weather pattern? And then also if you look at kind of the trends within grocery versus prepared food, are you seeing any different or the same signs of price sensitivity or trade up or trade down or does it depend on the category? Just trying to get a understanding of really where your consumer's mindset is. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Yeah, I'll try to get all of those answers. If I miss one, Kelly, please circle back with me on that. But with respect to the prepared-food comps you're correct, I mean we were trending certainly north of 5 in the month of August for prepared food and fountain, and so it really started really kind of the back half of September, and moved right into almost the entire month of October. So the analytics that we did, we started looking at weekdays, weekend days, things of that nature, understanding to the best of our knowledge whether there's any other factors that are impacting us. We felt there were no other incremental factors that were impacting us either in September or October that we didn't already see in the month of August, and so, as I mentioned, 50% to 60% of all of our pizza sales happen on the weekends. Take it a step further, about 45% of all our inside sales happen on the weekends. So when you have weather patterns or any other events for that matter that would affect traffic on those periods of time, it will have a significantly higher impact, adverse impact, especially in a short period of time. So when you look at that you're talking about almost a 200% increase in precipitation, significant across those three major states that we talked about And so, when we look at thee data that's kind of how it rolls up. And so the back half of the question you have to reiterate for me, Kelly. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- Just curious if within the prepared-food category versus the grocery category are you seeing the same trends in terms of price sensitivity, trade up, trade down? I think you also mentioned you raised some cigarette prices, I think some of the prepared food price increases are falling off, just I think in November, so just curious about how you feel about those kind of signs and prices and your consumer willingness to accept those? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Yeah, no you're right, we did have a price increase that fell off in November. We chose not to have that type of price increase moving forward because that value-conscious commentary we gave. You know, with respect to some of the trends that we are seeing are like, for instance, cigarettes, we definitely continue to see a continued move toward more pack purchasing, albeit it's been slow and gradual over the last 12 to 18 months, but people continue gravitate to packs more than cartons and more to a value brand then a premium brand. And those are signs that certainly the consumer is continuing to be strained. Now the basket bring inside the store, excluding fuel, is relatively consistent to where it was in the past three quarters so that we have some stabilization there, so I think that's encouraging. Farm income, there is some reports out there from the USDA that they expect an upward movement in farm income as we head into Calendar '18. Things don't turn around overnight but those are all positive signs for us. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- I'm sorry, did you mention where quarter to date the comps are? Because I think you had a very warm November last year and I don't know if I missed that, so just curious with all those dynamics how you're cycling that. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- A good memory, Kelly. Yeah we had, actually the first half of November last year was unseasonably warm and so there was a little bit of pressure. You might recall we made some comments about November last year -- that was our strongest prepared-food comp month of the year. I think it may have been the strongest grocery and general-merchandise month of the year, as well. A lot of it had to do with the very unseasonably hot weather. The first part of November. Now the back half of November last year actually changed and we actually saw in the back after November this year some very unseasonably warm weather, so we definitely saw a pickup in the back half of November, and certainly so far in December, the weather patterns seem to be favorable. You asked a question about quarter-to-date numbers? I think you did? The commentary we gave for a quarter to date -- in the fuel category we're trending above our guidance; in the grocery and general merchandise and prepared-food category we are trending very similar quarter to date what we finished in the second quarter. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- OK, so you're expecting continued improvement, I guess, in the prepared-foods category as you cycle those comparisons, would that be fair? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Yeah, that would be fair. Obviously, with the Pizza-to-Pump promotion, we anticipate certainly a benefit there not only in the prepared-food category but also on the gallon movement. In addition, I will point out that we look at a potential tailwind going forward here for Q4, you might recall that we had some adverse impacts from some deep discount promotions that we ran in the fourth quarter that did not resonate with the customer, so we will be countering against some lighter numbers as we head into the back half of the year. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- And can you help us understand what you meant that you've tested this Pizza-to-Pump promotion -- what kind of results? What you learned from that? What we can expect in terms of elasticity from that and how that impacts your fuel margins? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- So the last time we did this was, so I think it was back in the state of Indiana back in 2014, and the reason we did it back then, obviously we saw behavior in the state of Indiana that we wanted to change, and so we wanted to get more presence and impact in our prepared-food category and increase that brand recognition. So we ran that for a short period of time with great success. Comps were probably two to three times higher than the unchained store base in the state of Indiana. The more positive takeaway from that program back in 2014, is after we shut it off, those comps continued to be relatively robust, so there wasn't a drop-off. So I think it did what it was intended to do. So now we're in a situation where we're trying to maybe change consumer behavior or play upon some of the value-conscious thought processes of our consumer, and so we decided at this point, let's try to do this corporatewide, understanding we're not going to have maybe as big of an impact because obviously we we have a strong brand recognition but the idea is to shift the consumer behavior to think about that value proposition to leverage several pieces of our business together -- that would be the pizza category as well fuel category. Especially as we see retail fuel prices rise, we see how the fuel-saver programs have resonated over the years with our consumers. We feel we have an opportunity to kind of leverage both aspects of that, and, as I mentioned in one of the earlier answers to the questions, one of the nice things about the program, in order to redeem the coupon it does push the customer inside the store, which gives us more opportunities to do a selective-sale proposition. At this point, it would be hard for me to gauge what the impact might be on the fuel margin side. A lot of it has to do with the redemption of the coupon. if I recall back in 2014, we roughly had about a 50% redemption rate of that coupon. That's very helpful and then just one more? I just wanted to ask about the performance of new stores, how that's tracking relative to your expectation and how many of the smaller stores you opened so far and how that's going? Yea, well, the stores are trending as expected for us. We monitor that relatively closely, looking at not only movement of revenue ramp-up in all three of our major categories, but also cash-flow ramp up. And so we haven't seen any discernible change that would would give us pause in that program. With respect, I think you're asking about the small format, 3,600-square-foot facility, This last fiscal year I think we're doing about a third of our stores with that smaller footprint, continuing to look for opportunities, We obviously continue to always tweak that store design to make sure that we're trying to meet the needs of the customer. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Brownlow of Raymond James. Ben Brownlow -- Raymond James -- Analyst -- Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. You mentioned the fuel pricing strategy earlier on. I'm just trying to get my hands a little bit better around the conversion issues. Have you changed that fuel pricing strategy at all over the past few months and aside from the promotion-linked coupons that you plan on running? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I wouldn't say we changed it over the last few months, I would probably characterize it as an increased focus on the movement of our competitors and an increased focus on the movement of wholesale gas. I mentioned in the last conference call we did that I had a great opportunity to hire a young man from Murphy to come in and be our director of fuels and so we definitely, he has brought certainly a sharper light on that area. I wouldn't say, however, that has changed the strategy at this point, it's just a continued focus on that area. Gallon movement is probably also related to some things I mentioned in the previous answers. I would say this, though, that when when Terry talks about price optimization, fuel is part of that program and so that's something that we are are looking at to refine to see if there's an opportunity. Ben Brownlow -- Raymond James -- Analyst -- OK, so that's helpful and so, in effect you're being more active, around, as opposed to following, you're being a little bit more active in some of those markets on on trying to lead price? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I'm not sure I'd call it lead price, but certainly make sure that we are as responsive as we should be to the changing issues within the fuel category by demographic. Ben Brownlow -- Raymond James -- Analyst -- That's helpful. And on the tax reform, just given that the industry is historically pass-through expense savings, and kind of thinking of tax as obviously an expense, how do you see that playing out over a quarter, even 12 months? Do you see that being passed through to the consumer in lower prices? And also how should we think about the impact to the cash stacks, just given [Inaudible] that one-time kind of reset in the deferred tax expense, but that's been keeping your cash stacks around 17% to 20% over the past few years, so how should we think about that given the reform? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Well, I'll probably defer the first cash tax question until we know exactly how the bill's going to play out, so that might be a follow-up question, Ben, in the March conference call. But with respect to to speak to your other questions, we've never had this type of broad, sweeping tax change, at least in my time with the company. I can't sit here and tell you whether we pass through or not. Really right now I believe it will probably not be completely passed through to the consumer and be retained at the corporate levels. Especially when you think about, at least our market area, Ben, you think about our market area and the kind of the economic environment that we're in. A lot of people are, have a slower pace in their operation and there may be a likelihood for them to retain that as opposed to pass it on, but I guess that the competitive landscape will have to play out here as we move forward, but that's a great question. Operator Thank you, and as a reminder, if you have a question at this time, please press the ^ key and the No. 1 key in your touchtone telephone. And the next question is from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski of Sidoti and Company. Your line is open. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- Yes, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. All right so I was just looking again at the prepared-food and fountain category. When [Inaudible] in that segment, was there any notable divergence between that, or was it consistent? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I gotta apologize. You cut out several times there so I didn't quite hear your question. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- I'll repeat it, so just looking at the prepared-food and fountain category, if I were to look at just the pizza sales versus the other products within that category, was it consistent or was there some divergence between, for sales performance there? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I would say that if you look at all three categories rolled out there was definitely a more adverse impact on the pizza line than the other categories and those other categories, by way of reference, would be your bakery and your fountain category. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- Great, thank you for that. And also you mentioned before that your liquor sales are doing well and I think there's plans to expand that, so do you mean to have more stores offering liquor or [Inaudible] just offering within your store [Inaudible] how many of your stories actually sell liquor nowadays? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- The answer there would be looking to add more stores with that product line as opposed to changing the product mix inside the existing stores. We have roughly about 1,100, a little less than 1,100 stores, that sell liquor, 872, I'm told. Sorry. And so opportunities there, I guess you know that'll be a state-by-state basis but there are hundreds and hundreds of opportunities we think we'd like to put liquor in. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- Switching gears, so to just looking at the number of RINS actually sold ithe quarter, on a year-over-year basis, was down 17.3 versus 17.8. Can you say whether this was some timing issue or something else going on? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- No, it wasn't a timing issue, probably just the movement of fuel at that particular time. I don't necessarily see that was a huge difference there but nothing nothing to point out at this time. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- Got it, got it, OK, and just say the housekeeping question, as far as store closing plans or anything for Q3 and Q4 that we should think about when we update our models? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Well we wouldn't be able to give you any, I guess, forward-looking comments on stores to close, but we are always looking at opportunities to close stores that are underperforming or we might have a replacement store that we might close one or two stores, but I would anticipate the run rate to be similar to last year. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- OK. All right. Thank you. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- You bet. Operator Thank you, and that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Walljasper for any closing remarks. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- I'd just like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Great questions. I wish all of you and your families a great holiday season. Thanks. Duration: 59 minutes William J.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to you, Sanjay. Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon. Micron's record first-quarter results demonstrate the company's continued strong execution, a market environment that reflects the strategic importance of memory and flash storage, and healthy supply and demand fundamentals. During the quarter, we continue to enhance our cost competitiveness, achieving these maturity on both 1X DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND. We improved our mix of high-value solutions, delivering record SSD revenues and further increasing our SSD share. More recently, we began shipping our first 64-layer NAND consumer SSD. We also introduced the industry's fastest high-density 32-gigabyte NVDIMM-N, which combines Micron's DRAM and NAND to deliver a persistent memory solution that addresses intense data analytics workloads. We have garnered solid interest from enterprise and cloud customers, and customer qualifications are underway. And we strengthened our talent bench with the recent addition of Manish Bhatia, who leads our global operations. Manish brings extensive experience in managing end-to-end operations and is focused on driving manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies to reduce costs and improve our agility. Finally, we improved our financial foundation with the retirement of $2.4 billion of debt. I'm pleased with our accomplishments and believe our focus on speed and execution better position Micron to deliver value to our customers and capture the increasing number of end-market opportunities. I will now discuss trends and results in each of our major markets. Cloud and traditional enterprise data center trends are continuing to drive robust demand for memory and flash storage solutions. Our Q1 SSD revenue to cloud and enterprise customers increased 50% sequentially. We recovered from the flash component issue discussed in our September earnings call that impacted last quarter's SSD sales. On the compute side, we have solid sequential DRAM revenue growth into data center markets, driven primarily by enterprise sales. DRAM bench shipments to both cloud and enterprise customers were up by more than 50% year over year, underscoring the data center's growing need for memory and our strong execution in this market. Our 1X nanometer designs have been well-received by cloud customers, with more than a quarter of our cloud revenue in Q1 coming from our 1X technology. Fast qualification and production ramp by our cloud customers of new technology-node products is a significant benefit, and it diversifies and accelerates our customer traction and market reach during early stages of production deployment of these advanced nodes. The need to assess, analyze, and store data extends well beyond the cloud. This is perhaps most evident in the mobile market. Smartphone capabilities have surpassed simple communication and web browsing. They help us navigate, monitor, and interact with the world around us. New cameras capture precious moments with amazing fidelity, and emerging applications like AR have tremendous promise. This increase in functionality is driving the use of higher-capacity memory solutions and increased storage in mobile devices. These trends, along with our solid execution, drove record mobile revenue in F Q1. We are strengthening our offerings and continue to diversify our portfolio of LPDRAM, MCP and discrete/managed storage solutions to meet the growing needs of our customers. We are accelerating our progress to expand our portfolio of low-power solutions, with the release of new products, such as our 1X LPDRAM designs. We also shared initial samples of our 64-layer NAND discrete UFS solution to chipset partners and customers with very promising results. Home automation and edge computing devices continue to drive strong revenues in consumer and industrial market segments, which require a wide variety of memory and managed storage products. As more edge devices begin to integrate machine learning and intelligence, we see opportunities to provide higher-performance memory and flash storage solutions in these markets. We have also seen rapidly growing demand for our graphics products. The graphics market continues to be fueled by the ever-growing popularity of gaming and eSports. Although smaller in size, recent interest in cryptocurrency mining has put further pressure on graphics memory supply. Our tools customer relationships and leading product portfolio helps drive record graphics revenue, up more than 75% year over year. We sampled industry-leading 16 gigabit-per-second GDDR6 products to key customers and are seeing significant interest in automotive and networking applications that meet the high bandwidth this memory provides. We plan to ramp GDDR6 to production in early calendar 2018 for the graphics market, followed by other high-performance applications, such as automotive and networking. The rapid innovation in automotive technology toward autonomous driving continues to create significant demand for higher memory capacities and greater performance. We secured the key design win in an important autonomous driving platform this quarter and are focused on replicating our success to retain our leading-edge share in that market. Automotive customers are moving more rapidly to new memory technologies than they have in the past, and our announcement of the fastest 1X LPDDR4 and GDDR6 products for autonomous driving applications will ensure we continue to support this shift to leading-edge technologies. We also set record revenues supplying the networking applications that serve data centers and edge devices, as our repetition for consistency and innovation drives strong ties with networking customers. These diversified growth drivers and structural market trends are generating tremendous opportunity for Micron. We are uniquely positioned in these markets with a broad portfolio of both DRAM and NAND solutions, excellent quality, and comprehensive customer ecosystem engagement. We are focused on developing the right products, deepening our customer relationships, and enriching our revenue mix to capitalize on these opportunities. Turning now to manufacturing and technology. Our ability to execute our technology road map and drive cost competitiveness are foundational to our ongoing success. In terms of wafer manufacturing plans, we still expect to achieve better output crossover on 64-layer NAND during the second half of fiscal 2018 and expect to achieve better output crossover on 1X DRAM by the end of calendar 2018. We are outfitting our new back-end factory in Taichung, Taiwan, to ramp assembly and test capacity and expect meaningful output from the facility before the end of the fiscal year. Our capital investments are tracking with our deployment plans, and we are seeing good traction in improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our operations through these investments. Both 1Y DRAM and third-generation 3D NAND development are progressing well, and we remain on track for the initial output of both in the second half of calendar 2018. We continue to make good progress with our 3D XPoint technology. Historically, Micron's efforts on 3D XPoint have been largely focused on technology development and early manufacturing ramp. But given our increased focus on high-value product solutions, we have recently resourced a product development team to address the opportunity ahead of us. Simultaneously, we are working with various players in the ecosystem to assess market and enablement opportunities, and we will provide further details of our views regarding these opportunities during our upcoming analyst event. We will also continue to have the opportunity to sell our 3D XPoint output to our partner, as this market develops. Switching to our industry outlook. Our supply and demand projections remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. DRAM industry supply bit growth is expected to be about 20% in calendar 2018, and we expect a healthy market environment driven by the ongoing enterprise data center, cloud, and mobile trends, as we just discussed. We expect the industry bit growth for NAND to approach 50% in calendar 2018 as the industry continues to ramp 64-layer designs into volume production. SSD adoption in client computing and data center applications continues to increase and will expand further as more supply becomes available over time. Against that backdrop, projections for our own bit growth remain unchanged. The effect our DRAM bit growth to be slightly below the industry, and we expect our NAND bit growth to be somewhat above the industry for fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018, we are focusing on technology transitions for both DRAM and NAND without any additions to our total vehicle capacity and on improving our mix of high-value solutions to enhance our revenue share. For fiscal 2019 and beyond, we continue to assess scenarios for the fab cleanroom space required to implement technology transitions to future, more advanced DRAM, and 3D NAND nodes. I'll now turn it over to Ernie to provide details on our first-quarter results by business unit. Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Sanjay, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. We had a very strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding guidance across all financial metrics, driven by strong execution, a continued robust market environment, and further progress on our technology migrations. For fiscal Q1, total company revenue was $6.8 billion, up 11% from the prior quarter and up 71% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 55%, up 4 percentage points from Q4 and 29 percentage points from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 46%, up from 41% in the prior quarter and up 35 percentage points from the year-ago period. We continue to prudently manage spending with non-GAAP operating expenses totaling $612 million for the quarter, up 2% from Q4, with both SG&A and R&D remaining relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. Non-GAAP net income increased to 44% of revenue and totaled approximately $3 billion or $2.45 per share. This performance compares with $2.4 billion or $2.02 per share in Q4 and $335 million or $0.32 per share from the year-ago period. Turning to performance by business unit. The compute and networking business unit reported F Q1 revenue of $3.2 billion, up 13% sequentially, and more than double year-ago levels. Our record performance was driven by increasing server memory content, which drove higher sales to enterprise customers together with strong demand for graphics processing. Operating income was 60% compared to 56% in F Q4 and 14% in F Q1 2017. Q1 storage business unit revenues increased 7% sequentially to $1.4 billion, driven by strong growth in SSD sales. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 61%, driven by increasing market share in SSDs. In fact, sales of SSDs reached record levels in the quarter, with double-digit sequential growth across consumer, client and enterprise, and cloud markets. SBU operating margins increased to 29% from 19% in the prior quarter and negative 5% in fiscal Q1 '17. These results reflect a higher-value product mix and continued market acceptance of our TLC 3D NAND-based products. The mobile business unit reported $1.4 billion in revenue, up 16% sequentially and up 32% year over year. We are seeing strong acceptance of our LPDRAM products and continue to enhance our portfolio of managed NAND offerings. The solid demand environment, combined with the traction we've made with our latest generation products, led to operating income of 37%, up from 31% in F Q4 and 9% in F Q1 2017. The embedded business unit reported revenue of $830 million in F Q1, in line with the prior quarter and up 44% year over year. Operating margin was 41%, essentially flat from the prior quarter, and up 10 percentage points year over year. As Sanjay noted earlier, we continue to see exciting demand trends across each of the underlying embedded markets with evolving end-market requirements ranging from high-performance memory for autonomous driving to ultra-high-density storage solutions for edge devices, such as video surveillance cameras. We are focused on building upon our existing leadership position to capture these growth opportunities. Turning to results by product line. DRAM represented 67% of overall company revenue in fiscal Q1. Demand for client PCs, solid exposure to new flagship smartphones, and ongoing strength from servers, particularly in cloud and hyperscale data centers, drove DRAM revenue higher during the quarter, up 13% sequentially and up 88% year over year. Sequentially, shipment quantities increased in the upper single-digit range, while ASPs increased in the mid-single-digit range. DRAM non-GAAP gross margin was 61.5% in F Q1, up 2 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 33 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Revenue from trade NAND increased 2% sequentially and represented 27% of overall company revenue in fiscal Q1. Trade NAND revenue was up 47% year over year, driven by our strong growth and market share gains in the SSD market and robust demand from the mobile and embedded markets. On a sequential basis, shipment quantities increased in the mid-single-digit range, while ASPs declined in the low single-digit range. Trade NAND non-GAAP gross margin was 49% in F Q1, up 9 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 26 percentage points from the year-ago quarter, reflecting a richer mix of sales into high-value end markets. As Sanjay noted in his prepared remarks, we are making strong progress on the rollout of our 1X nanometer DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND deployment. The rollout of these technologies will enable meaningful levels of ongoing cost per bit reduction as we make progress throughout fiscal '18. For DRAM, our bit output growth will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year, while NAND bit output growth will be relatively greater in the second half of the fiscal year. The company generated operating cash flow of $3.6 billion in fiscal Q1 compared to $1.1 billion in the year-ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions. We continue to expect FY '18 CAPEX in the range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%, fairly balanced between the first and second halves of the fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion compared to negative free cash flow in the year-ago period. We continued to pursue our plans to strengthen our balance sheet and lower debt. During fiscal Q1, we raised $1.4 billion from an equity offering and repurchased or converted $2.4 billion in principal amount of our debt. Total face value of debt was $9.3 billion as of the end of F Q1, and we currently expect to exit FY '18 with approximately $8 billion in face value debt. We expect the interest savings from these deleveraging actions, combined with higher interest income from larger cash balances and the anti-dilutive effects of selling converts for cash, to materially offset the dilutive impacts associated with the equity offering. Exiting FY '18, we foresee non-GAAP net interest expense of $25 million to $30 million per quarter versus $100 million per quarter in F Q4 of '17. We ended the first quarter with cash, marketable investments, and restricted cash of approximately $6.6 billion and continued to see the opportunity to exit FY '18 in a positive net cash position. Moving on to guidance for fiscal Q2 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: revenue in the range of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion; gross margin in the range of 54% to 58%; operating expenses between $625 million and $675 million; operating income ranging between $3.25 billion and $3.45 billion; and EPS ranging between $2.51 and $2.65 per share, based on 1.241 million diluted shares. Finally, a word about tax reform. As drafted, the legislation would have no significant impact to our FY '18 tax rate, which we continue to expect to be in the mid-single-digit range. In FY '19 and beyond, we would expect some impact to our non-GAAP tax rate with an offsetting benefit of more flexibility in deploying our global cash balances. As further clarity around this legislation develops, we will provide appropriate updates. With that, I will turn it back to Sanjay. Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Ernie. As we close out calendar 2017 and look to 2018, we see increasing opportunities for Micron to play a larger role in the technology trends shaping modern life. We will be hosting an Analyst Conference in May, where we plan to elaborate on our view of these trends and how Micron envisions our technologies shaping the world in the years to come. We believe that our technologies, capabilities, and team talent place us in a unique position in the market. Memory and flash storage are strategic assets that put Micron at the intersection of the biggest growth trends in technology, and we cannot be more excited about our future. Our customers increasingly view us as an essential partner in early design discussions due to the differentiation our solutions can provide. We are focused on increasing this value, and I look forward to sharing the results of that focus throughout 2018. We will now open for questions. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time please press the * and then the No. 1 key on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue please press the # key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated. Thank you, and our first question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is open. Srini Pajjuri -- Macquarie Securities -- Analyst Thank you and congrats on the great quarter, guys. A couple of questions on the NAND side. Sanjay, at least among the investor community, there seems to be some concerns that there's going to be a flood of self-supply coming online into the industry in the first half. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about what your view is about the supply demand balance as we head into the first half. And then, for Ernie, the NAND gross margin improvement is 900 basis points, sequentially. I know you mentioned mix healthy there, but I'm just curious if you could provide some color as to exactly what's driving that, and how sustainable that is going forward? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer So in terms of the industry demand-supply environment, let me just say that with respect to the industry supply growth in the calendar year 2018, we have said that the industry supply growth would be approaching 50%. While that is more than what the calendar year '17 supply growth is in the range of 35% to 40%, the -- overall, what you have to look at is the demand requirements. In calendar year '17, of course, supply has been tight. There has been pent-up demand, particularly in the areas of client SSDs and the client PC, notebook PC environments. The march toward high-density SSDs in notebook PCs was somewhat slowed down given the overall tightness of supply in calendar year '17. When I look ahead at calendar year '18, I see strong demand trends with respect to attach rate of SSDs and client PCs continue to increase. The applications related to cloud and data centers, enterprise data centers continuing to drive higher average capacities, usage in cloud and data center applications as well. And certainly, in mobile applications also, the average capacities of NAND content continue to increase. And these are all increasing because of the trends, right? I mean, attach rate in notebook PCs in calendar year '17, about 35% going toward over the course of next several years by 2020 time frame, getting to 75% attach rates. So lowered off HDD, there is still to be replaced with SSDs. And same trends are continuing in all markets for NAND. Average capacities are continuing to increase. So the demand trends continues to be very robust. For flash, yes, more supply environment, but we are very focused on continuing to strengthen our product portfolio and increase our share with respect to SSD markets as well as with more managed NAND solutions to address the mobile markets. Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer And relative to the question about margins, I think there are two pieces of that. One, we are making progress toward a mix -- a higher value-added mix of solutions, and those typically carry the opportunity for higher margins. Also, we continue to make progress on the cost side with respect to increasing amounts of 3D NAND as well as TLC, and you had a good quarter for cost reduction as well. So it's a combination of both market facing with the higher value-add solutions, and then, a good quarter from an operational perspective relative to cost. Srini Pajjuri -- Macquarie Securities -- Analyst Thank you, and then, maybe just one follow-up, Ernie, on the balance sheet. I think you previously said your gross debt target is about $8 billion, which you said you're going to reach, I guess, next quarter. Given -- assuming that the tax bill will pass, is there any change to that target? And then, if you can talk about, again, assuming that the tax bill will pass, what's your priorities for cash going forward? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I don't think we've said that we've reached that gross debt target in F Q2. We said, by the end of our fiscal year. And so I wouldn't expect that we would achieve that level in fiscal Q2. The tax bill, as we understand it, would not necessarily change the priorities, which are always to continue to make sure we have the best technology we can in production and to be able to transition that at a time that makes sense for us. And then, for fiscal year '18, certainly, getting the balance sheet in shape relative to these aggregate levels of debt. Srini Pajjuri -- Macquarie Securities -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid execution. On the DRAM side, you've got Intel ramping Skylake. You've got AMD ramping up deck on the server CPU side. Cloud and hyperscale CAPEX spending looks to grow about 30% next year. Given all of this, do you guys anticipate continued momentum and mix in your server and cloud business in DRAM to continue to move higher next year? And then, from an industry perspective, does the server and cloud segment become a bigger part of the DRAM consumption mix over the next two to three years overtaking mobile? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Absolutely. Cloud and server, data center enterprise, as well as cloud data centers absolutely will continue to be the biggest growth drivers at large volumes for the DRAM industry. And we have very strong penetration in these markets. And actually, we do expect to continue to build momentum in these markets going forward. Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst Great. And Sanjay, you talked about semi and fully autonomous wins in the quarter. All of the major auto OEMs and self-systems guys are focused on this. We talked to one of the leading guys that's focused on sensors and processor technology required for these types of vehicles. They're talking about 25, 30 gigabytes of DRAM and one terabyte SSDs per car for level four and level five fully autonomous. That's a pretty significant step up in DRAM and NAND content. Is that consistent with how you see the content trends in automotive over the next kind of three to five years? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer It absolutely is. I mean, when you look at autonomous vehicles, they really are level five autonomous vehicles in the future are projected to have about 40 gigabyte of DRAM content in them. And when you think about it, that is very similar to the average capacity that's associated with servers -- in the server workstations, right? So these cars will be really very powerful computers in the future, and they are not only going to be driving tremendous amount of DRAM content usage, but they will also drive NAND Flash usage. They will be generating, using data to make millions of real-time split-second decisions to make sure that the passengers in the autonomous vehicles can be transported effortlessly and safely to their destination. There will be sensors from sonar to camera that will be generating billions of signals, and all of that data will have to be processed, accessed in order to make fast decisions. So you're absolutely right to note that this is really a secular trend here in front of us in terms of driving continued usage of memory and storage. Earlier, we talked about cloud and data center applications. And again, those are growing faster than the rest of the industry. Our autonomous vehicles will be another big driver in the future. And Micron is uniquely positioned with a strong portfolio of solutions, both with flash solutions as well as DRAM memory solutions to address these fast-growing market trends. Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst Thanks, Sanjay. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks for the question, congrats as well. A couple of questions. Maybe on DRAM, can you just go back to -- the servers been a huge driver, and that's really been without Intel's Purley [Inaudible] minority. Can you just maybe talk about content per server? How much that increased this year? And then, as you look into next year, how much of the driver is Purley as you look in the second half, and that being more meaningful? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer So in terms of content for server, I think 2017, if you look at flash, attach rate, it's about managed capacity around 2.5 -- 2,500 gigabytes. And when you look at projection over 2018 time frame going to anywhere above 3,000 gigabyte average capacity continues to march ahead by 2021 time frame, almost tripling from the 2017 levels, well above 8,000 gigabytes as well. So that is on the SSD side. And similarly, on the DRAM side, average capacities continue to increase nicely there as well. In 2017, time frame about 145 gigabytes per server average capacity estimated, and industry reports are showing that by 2021 time frame going to about 350. So very strong solid and year-over-year increases, not just in near term, but again, as I say, these are secular trends here. Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst Excellent. And then, just on the NAND side, I just want to go back to that prior question. Obviously, you see a crossover a 64. How do you think about the cost trajectory here as you then start to ramp third gen as you look to fiscal year, is there any sort of -- what's the slope of that cost curve as one is going up, another one's going down? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer You know, as we introduce third-generation 3D NAND, we would continue to expect that, that technology of mature yield have -- or has favorable cost dynamics relative to 64-layer. We don't believe that it will have a significant positive or negative impact in our FY '18 results as we will just be implementing that as we get into the last quarter of the fiscal year. So it won't be material enough either way to change the fundamental dynamic that we're going to see this year, which is largely driven by our 64-layer TLC NAND. Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst [Inaudible] Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open. Kevin Cassidy -- Stifel -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. You had mentioned when you gave your guidance for CAPEX for the year about adding more value-added into your DRAMs and flash. Can you say what percentage right now would you call it a value-added group? And what's the goal for that? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, in the value-added solution category, we count our SSDs index, and in fiscal Q1, we had really solid increase in our SSD revenues. We gained shares in the market as well. In the mobile space, managed NAND solutions are also -- and discrete NAND solutions we consider as value-add as well. Our share in those markets today is relatively low, low single digits, but we see tremendous opportunity as we are continuing to diversify our product portfolio. And as we execute on that product road map in the quarters to come, we expect to be gaining -- making substantial progress. And of course, in the DRAM side, applications such as automotive, such as graphics, high-performance applications as they all contribute toward the value-add solutions. We are not providing you any specifics at this point. We'll discuss more details at our Analyst Day in May. Kevin Cassidy -- Stifel -- Analyst OK. Great. Maybe just as one follow-up because especially a DRAM market had been such a commodity market, are you getting any pushback from your customers that they want you to move more toward a commodity? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer And let me just point out, in response to your previous question, that while we will provide more detail in May, but on a year-over-year basis, certainly, we are increasing our value-add solution mix substantially and very pleased with the progress that we are making. Regarding your second question on DRAM. DRAM really is a strategic enabler today in diversity of markets and the megatrends we talk about, whether it is data centers, cloud applications, being the fuel for AI engine, helping make decisions for various search algorithms as well as various activities in all verticals that are being pursued, leveraging AI in mobile space as more and more applications go toward augmented reality type of features in mobile requires more DRAM. DRAM is highly strategic. Even in the future, when you look at notebook computers, they will require the form factor and the low-power aspects, even in PCs of LPDRAM in future years to come. So you see -- and of course, we just talked about automotive as well. So now DRAM is addressing diversity of markets. I mean, several large diverse markets. Product portfolio, meeting the needs of these markets is becoming differentiated. And when that happens, that always gives you stronger opportunities to drive profitable growth in that market. And our customers, when we have an engagement with them, when we have dialogues with them, they are talking to us how memory, DRAM memory, is really now helping them solve the bottlenecks in their applications. So DRAM today is very different, as I said many times before, from the DRAM and the PC-era only or the latest merges PC and mobile. Today, it is about many more applications of DRAM and really providing a very strategic enabling role in creating all these applications that are truly transforming the world right before our eyes. Kevin Cassidy -- Stifel -- Analyst All right. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you and our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. David Wong -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst Thanks very much. I'm not sure if you said it, but on the November quarter, how much of your total NAND production was 3D NAND? And as you transition to 64-layer in the February and May quarter next year, does your NAND production drop or grow sequentially? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer So that 80% of our output for the quarter just completed was on 3D. And over the course of the balance of fiscal '18, we'd expect that number to grow to about 95%. We expect it will have some measure of bit growth, as we said. Each and every quarter, we said it would be, in the prepared remarks, a little more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. David Wong -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst But you'd, nevertheless, will grow in the first half? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. David Wong -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst OK. Great. Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. That output for the quarter was up in the low single-digit range. David Wong -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst Excellent. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse -- Evercore -- Analyst Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on DRAM. You talked about 20% bit supply for the industry in '18, which would suggest continued tightness throughout the whole year. So curious how customers are reacting to that reality. What kind of visibility are you seeing to pricing as well as extensions and contracts? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer We work very closely with our customers, and we certainly work hard in terms of gaining visibility to their future requirements of DRAM and how their applications are shaping up so that we can make sure that our technology and product road map is addressing their needs. And this varies from customer to customer. Some customers tend to be more on a month-by-month basis, some more quarter, and some, certainly, longer-term engagements as well. And you're right to note that, yes, I mean, that the industry supply growing about 20% and demand likely to be somewhat higher. We do expect a healthy DRAM industry supply and-demand environment and continue to work very closely to drive strategic growth of our revenue mix going forward. C.J. Muse -- Evercore -- Analyst Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, on the NAND side, you're talking around 50% bit growth or approaching that for the industry. One or two of the other players in the market are expecting lower type of bit growth. So it would appear that you're making assumptions around the 64-layer ramp that might be a little bit more robust than your competitors. So curious, how are you thinking about that ramp? And clearly, I think you'd agree the risk is probably lower than 50%, how would you kind of, I guess, put a probability around where do you think it truly ends up? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer So of course, in terms of projecting our industry bit growth estimates here, we, of course, are taking into consideration our estimate of the ramp of 64-layer technology in the industry and our assumptions around ramp of wafer production as well as the ramp of that technology. And along with other mix of technologies in the industry as well. But you're right to note that the dominant factor of the supply bit growth in the industry will be with 64 layers here. And we continually look at our estimates and we review it, based on all the intelligence that we may have as well as we may collect from third-party reports, we define our models on an ongoing basis. And if we have any changes on this, we will share them with you. C.J. Muse -- Evercore -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you very much. I wonder, I know you don't want to get too far ahead of yourself on this, but when you get to sort of net cash neutral and you get to investment grade, what's next from a prioritization of free cash flow? And how do you just qualitatively think about cash return versus maintaining cash for more strategic uses? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer I think that we will continue to prioritize the -- supporting our latest-generation technology in production. As we've talked about for fiscal '18, clearly focused on getting aggregate debt down in that $8 billion range. Those things will lead to, we believe, over time, improved rating. I think how we think about deploying cash is not wholly dependent upon the achievement of any particular ratings grade. We just think these are things that will be worked in parallel. And at the appropriate time, I think we're very open to thinking about broader uses of cash, including shareholder return programs, so those do have a place in the hierarchy of thinking about uses of our cash. But until we get to the point where we have completed or substantively completed our work on this technology, deployment and regaining cost competitiveness and also getting our aggregate debt levels to the -- to a level that we are more comfortable with, certainly, those will continue to remain our priority. Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. And then, I wondered, the disparity between the 60% operating margins and your compute business and mobile, which are still quite high, I guess, to me, sort of you can see that PC DRAM still quite a bit more profitable than mobile. How do you think about that going forward in terms of your allocation of mix? Obviously, mobile gives you more stability down the road versus the upside that you can get from PCs. How are you thinking about that balance? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Don't forget that the compute and networking business unit includes a wide array of products, which includes both client, but also includes data center, mobile -- I'm sorry, not mobile, but networking and other products as well. So it isn't just a statement about the client compute environment. And many of those subsegments within the compute and networking business unit we would also consider as strategically important. These are relationships where we have the opportunity to deploy both DRAM and NAND. And certainly, mobile continues to be important. So I wouldn't necessarily presume that the margin performance out of our compute and networking business unit is largely driven by the performance of client. Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Romit Shah -- Nomura Instinet -- Analyst Yes, thank you. Sanjay, some of your equipment -- some eCAP equipment suppliers have -- this is like over the last three months, have been raising their spending forecast for 2018, driven in part by higher DRAM investments. And my question is, what's the risk that your competitors, perhaps, are going more aggressively for share and that the 20% growth assumption you laid out for next year may actually end up proving conservative? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think, again, our estimates based -- for DRAM as well, are based on all the information from various sources and reports that we gather and we have put that here. I do think that even when you look at estimates by other suppliers, we are all pointing to fairly close, tightly aligned, industry supply growth estimate here. And -- but this is our estimate. We will, as I said before for NAND, same thing. We routinely look at this very, very closely. And just also remember that the technology transitions in the industry today certainly are becoming increasingly complex, and they have greater capital intensity. As well as with advanced technology nodes, you are actually getting less bits on a per-wafer basis even at mature yields compared to prior-generation nodes. Again, given the scaling challenges, the increased complexity. So all of these trends are actually increased technology complexity and increased capital intensity have a moderating effect on the supply growth. Romit Shah -- Nomura Instinet -- Analyst Thank you. And then, just on the February quarter, I don't know if you guys look at your individual periods on a seasonal basis, but it seems like the February quarter typically is a down quarter and you're guiding to sequential growth off of a better-than-expected November period. What's driving the better-than-normal seasonality for you? Is it pricing or other factors as well? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I think, Sanjay mentioned earlier the diversification of the DRAM demand stream. And certainly, that is also true on the NAND side. And in the context of that diversified demand stream, for example, automobile tends to be far less seasonal than client PCs. And if you look at data center deployments among all of the key players, there's certainly a specific pattern per customers. But when you put them all together, there is no macro seasonality pattern that emerges when you look at that. So as we've transitioned to these diversify demand drivers, the concept of seasonality, I think, has been redefined and is perhaps less impactive on a quarter-by-quarter basis than it may have been in the past. Romit Shah -- Nomura Instinet -- Analyst Interesting. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Summit Redstone. Your line is open. Jagadish Iyer -- Summit Redstone -- Analyst Yes. Thanks for taking my question, Sanjay. Two questions. First, if NAND ASPs continue to decline from rising supply, do you expect cost reduction to keep pace with the ASP decline as we look at fiscal '18? And then, I have a follow-up. Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer I mean, we are certainly not projecting pricing for fiscal year '18 here. But again, what I'll point to you is that if you look at the history of NAND, increase in technology capabilities, technology advances, which leads to cost reductions, ultimately enable opening up of many new market application and drive the elasticity in many of these markets as well and drive the demand environment. So I consider it as healthy if the cost declines are greater than the price declines in the industry. That's a healthy industry environment. And while we don't get into the projection of pricing, again, when we look at all the demand drivers that are ahead of us, I spoke about it repeatedly in the call today, multitude of demand drivers and in each of the large market segments, again, whether it is about cloud, data center, enterprise data center, mobile, smartphones, client notebook, automotive, applications, all of these are continuing to drive strong demand trends for NAND Flash application. Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I think the one thing I would add to that as well is if you think about our statements around industry bit growth, which are approaching 50%, those would be associated, typically, with fairly healthy levels of cost reduction. We're not going to get into the specifics of what that might be, but it is important to remember that, that bit growth usually would be accompanied by some good cost reduction as well. Jagadish Iyer -- Summit Redstone -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. Then, on 3D XPoint, I was wondering how much are you earmarking for spending in fiscal '18? And has there been customers who have identified? And how should we think, generally, on a big picture, about pricing there? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer So this is Ernie. The 3D XPoint CAPEX and any associated R&D expenses, the CAPEX piece is embedded in our nonvolatile estimates for the year, which we said was between 35% and 45% of our total spending. And as we look at that product, we're going to have to see how the markets develop, as Sanjay mentioned, before we provide any broader perspective on that. Jagadish Iyer -- Summit Redstone -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- Analyst Thanks. Good afternoon. Two quick questions for me. First of all, you mentioned the market share gains and SSDs and I assumed some of that was related to fixing the component issue. But can you sort of give us some more color on where you think specifically you had most success in gaining share? And then, secondly, I know you're not going to talk specifically about pricing for the upcoming quarter, but if you could, maybe, qualify some more how you get to your sales guidance in terms of pricing and mix, that would be helpful. Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer In terms of SSD share gain during the quarter, we believe we gained share both in client applications as well as enterprise and cloud data center applications. Really, our targets did very well there. And at this point, our offerings are with SATA drive. And next year, we'll bring out our NVMe solution sometime during calendar year '18, and that should help us expand our portfolio and give us opportunities to continue to gain share in this market. And regarding our guidance that we have given you, of course, we have certain assumptions related to total demand. And our pricing assumptions are baked in there as well. But obviously, for competitive reasons, we do not get into discussions of pricing on the call. Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- Analyst Understood. Thought I'd give it a shot. Thank you. Congratulations Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on a strong results. Ernie, maybe I can ask the gross margin question around NAND a little bit differently. I'm just kind of curious, given that you guys had significant gross margin upside on pricing down low single digits sequentially, under a scenario where pricing continues to decline, let's say, at a low single-digit rate sequentially, is there enough mix and cost opportunity for you to maintain and/or grow gross margins from here? Or how should we think about the parameters that you're able -- being able to maintain or grow gross margins relative to your cost and mix availability from here? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So if we're framing the scenario in the future as we continue to see sort of marginally declining pricing environment, a couple of points per quarter or so, I think there's ample room for gross margin expansion, both as a result of our cost reduction as well as the ongoing transition to high-value solutions, which would include redirecting -- continuing to redirect component sales into higher value-added solutions as well as some of our partner contracts wind down over the course of our fiscal '18 and into 2019. So I think in that pricing scenario that you've set forth, we believe there's reasonable room for gross margin expansion. John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst That's helpful. And a similar question on the DRAM front. You mentioned in your prepared comments that you expect more DRAM bit growth in the first half of your fiscal year than the second half. As we transition into the second half, how much -- how many levers do you have on the mix side in DRAM to be able to progress sort of gross margins higher from here? Ernie Maddock -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I think, again, the same general story with respect to continuing to move toward higher value-add solutions. You heard Sanjay speak to, for example, increasing the breadth of our managed NAND offerings. If you look at server, that's certainly a very, very strong growth pattern here as well as automotive. So I think there are a number of segments where we would continue to expect to be able to optimize our bit output toward that would give us the best gross margin opportunity. And of course, even though our bit output growth is going to be lower in DRAM than NAND, we'd still expect to deliver some meaningful cost reduction there, as I articulated in the prepared remarks. John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Ok. Thanks and congratulations. Operator Thank you. And we'll take our final question from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein. Your line is open. Mark Newman -- Bernstein -- Analyst All right. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question on CAPEX and capacity. So Micron -- you spent on top of the CAPEX quite a bit this year from previous years. But still, quite significantly spending some of the rivals, particularly Samsung. My question, actually, is about how is Micron thinking about the need for fabs longer term. This is more of a kind of longer-term question, because both Samsung and Hynix are building brand-new greenfield fabs as we speak. What is the status right now for Micron in both DRAM and NAND in terms of how much space you have available to you in DRAM and NAND? And I understand your goal is to keep wafer capacity roughly flat and grow gigabytes from technology migration. What point do you need more fab space to keep that fab capacity roughly flat? Or it is, of course, more layers. You'd probably use more fab space, and of course, as you shrink DRAM, you also need more fab space as well. So do you have any plans for new fabs? What would be the plan? And how are you thinking about that? Sanjay Mehrotra -- President and Chief Executive Officer So like you noted, in order to realize the technology transitions, you, of course, do need a space in your cleanroom to deploy the tools that are required to implement the advanced technology nodes. So our fabs have had space here in terms of deploying the technology transitions, for example, in Singapore going from 32-layer to 64-layer. And in the past, in Singapore fab for NAND, going from planar to 3D nodes as well. And similarly, cleanroom space is something we look very carefully for DRAMs as well because, as I just said, I mean, more cleanroom space is needed for technology transitions. So as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we do continue to assess the scenarios that are needed for future technology transitions, and I continue to assess our cleanroom space requirements. Fiscal year '18, we are not looking at any new wafer capacity additions. We are not looking at any new -- any meaningful new cleanroom space required to implement our technology transition plans in fiscal year '18. And as I said in my remarks, going beyond that, we continue to assess various scenarios to implement the requirements for technology transitions, both in DRAM as well as in NAND. No plans firmed up yet. And as and when we look at it, we will share it. Do you think -- remember, any time you build a new cleanroom, it takes several months to build, construct the building. And it takes a few months then to roll in equipment into the new cleanroom and to deploy the equipment, qualify it, and build products. So these are things that are to be looked at for the longer-term horizon, and we are evaluating those scenarios. Mark Newman -- Bernstein -- Analyst OK. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed Republicans’ massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul into law on Friday, cementing the biggest legislative victory of his first year in office, and also approved a short-term spending bill that averts a possible government shutdown. Trump said he wanted to sign the tax bill before leaving Washington on Friday for his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, rather than stage a more formal ceremony in January, so he could keep his promise to finish work before Christmas. “I didn’t want you folks to say I wasn’t keeping my promise. I’m keeping my promise,” he told reporters in the White House. The two pieces of legislation represent Trump’s most significant accomplishment with Congress since taking office in January, as well as a sign of what awaits when he returns from Florida after the Christmas holiday. The tax package, the largest such overhaul since the 1980s, slashes the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. Trump praised several companies that have announced employee bonuses in the wake of the bill’s passage, naming AT&T, Boeing, Wells Fargo, Comcast  and Sinclair Broadcast Group. “Corporations are literally going wild over this,” he said. Democrats had opposed the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt during the next decade. The spending bill extends federal funding through Jan. 19, largely at current levels. It does nothing to resolve broader disputes over immigration, healthcare and military spending. Republicans also are divided over whether to follow up their sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code with a dramatic restructuring of federal benefit programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he would like to revamp welfare and health programs but Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told National Public Radio on Monday that he was not interested in cutting those programs without Democratic support. Trump’s year also closes with significant turnover of many top staffers who had been in the White House since early in his term. On Friday, the White House confirmed Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn and Jeremy Katz, who worked under White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, were leaving. ","

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending accelerated in November and shipments of key capital goods orders increased for the 10th straight month, data showed on Friday, the latest signs of strong momentum in the economy as the year winds down. But the bullish growth picture was dimmed somewhat as the figures also showed household savings dropped last month to the lowest level in more than nine years. Low savings could hurt consumer spending, though economists are optimistic wage growth will pick up in the new year. Economists see a modest lift to consumer spending from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress this week, in the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. “Consumers are still out there spending, but their purchases are being supplemented by low energy costs, credit and a reduction in savings rather than organic income growth,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago. “Without sustained improvement in wages, consumers will struggle to maintain even today’s moderate pace of consumption.” The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6 percent last month after gaining 0.2 percent in October. Spending last month was buoyed by an increase in demand for motor vehicles, recreational goods and utilities. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased 0.4 percent in November from unchanged in the prior month. Personal income rose 0.3 percent last month, with wages increasing 0.4 percent. As a result, households dipped into their savings, which fell to $426.2 billion - the lowest level since August 2008 and down from $466.9 billion in October. The saving rate dropped to a 10-year low of 2.9 percent from 3.2 percent in October. In addition to savings, consumer spending is being driven by record household wealth, thanks to a booming stock market and rising home prices. With the U.S. economy near full employment, economists argue that the tax cuts will only provide a modest boost to growth. President Donald Trump signed the tax legislation into law on Friday. It slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and offers tax cuts for individuals. The Trump administration argues that the tax cuts will boost both business and consumer spending. But the individual income tax cuts are skewed toward higher-income households, which economists say have a low propensity to consume. Economists also believe companies will use much of the windfall on stock buybacks and debt reduction. The dollar was trading slightly higher against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasury yields rose modestly. Stocks on Wall Street slipped. [MKTS/GLOB] Despite the increase in spending, monthly inflation remained benign in November. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.1 percent in November after gaining 0.2 percent in October. The so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through November, picking up from 1.4 percent in October. It has undershot the Fed’s 2 percent target since mid-2012 and its progress could determine the pace at which the U.S. central bank raises interest rates next year. The Fed increased borrowing costs three times this year and has forecast three rate hikes in 2018. “There is little doubt that structural shifts, including increased global competition, the growth in online retailing and new technologies that enable consumers to find the best price instantly and at little cost, are playing a role in holding down prices,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. In a second report on Friday, the Commerce Department said shipments of non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft - a closely watched proxy for business spending - rose 0.3 percent after surging 1.3 percent in October. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s gross domestic product measurement. They have risen every month since February, the longest stretch since the series started in 1992. The increase in core capital goods shipments over the last two months suggested a strong pace of increase in business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter. Business investment in equipment rose at its fastest pace in three years in the third quarter, but the momentum could be slowing. Core capital goods orders slipped 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.8 percent in October. “Real equipment spending has been on a very strong run in recent quarters, but the recent cooling in the orders data signals that there could be some softening to come,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. In a third report, the Commerce Department said new home sales jumped 17.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units last month. That was the highest level since July 2007. New home sales surged 26.6 percent from a year ago. ","

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"路透华盛顿12月22日 - 周五公布的数据显示，11月份美国消费者支出加速上升，主要资本财订单连续第10个月增长，这是显示美国经济年底增长势头强劲的最新迹象。 但是这些数据也显示，上个月家庭储蓄下降到逾九年来的最低水平，给乐观的经济成长形势带来一丝阴影。低储蓄可能损及消费者支出，不过经济学家乐观地认为，新一年的薪资增长将会加快。 经济学家认为，美国国会本周批准的1.5万亿美元减税计划将温和提振消费者支出。这是美国30年来最大规模的税改行动。 “消费者仍在支出，但他们靠的是低能源成本、信贷及减少储蓄来支应，而非自身的所得成长，”芝加哥Stifel Fixed Income首席分析师Lindsey Piegza表示。“薪资若未持续改善，消费者甚至将难以维持当前温和消费的步调。” 商务部表示，11月消费者支出增加0.6%，10月为上升0.2%。消费者支出占美国经济活动比重超过三分之二。对汽车、休闲娱乐用品及公共事业需求增加提振11月支出。 11月经通胀调整的消费者支出增加0.4%，10月为持平。11月个人所得增加0.3%，薪资成长0.4%。 如此一来，家庭支出动用储蓄资金，导致储蓄降至4,262亿美元，为2008年8月以来低位，且低于10月4,669亿美元的水平。11月储蓄率降至10年低位2.9%，10月则为3.2%。 除储蓄外，消费者支出还受到创纪录家庭财富的支撑，这得益于股市繁荣和房价上涨。 美国经济接近充分就业，分析师认为减税只会给经济增长带来温和提振。美国总统特朗普周五将税改议案签署成为法律。该法案将公司税税率从35%降至21%，还包括针对个人的减税措施。 特朗普政府主张，减税将提振企业和消费者支出。但个人所得税的减税措施向较高收入家庭倾斜，分析师称此类家庭消费积极性较低。 分析师还认为，企业将把减税节约下来的开支主要用于回购股份和减少债务。 美元兑一篮子货币略微走强，美国公债收益率温和上升。美股下跌。 **通胀低迷** 尽管支出增加，但11月通胀率依然表现平平。美国联邦储备理事会(FED/美联储)重视的通胀指标--扣除食品和能源的核心个人消费支出(PCE)物价指数11月上升0.1%，10月份为上升0.2%。 11月核心PCE同比上升1.5%，10月份为上升1.4%。该指标自2012年年中以来一直低于美联储2%的目标水平，其走势或将决定美联储明年的加息节奏。 美联储今年三次加息，预计2018年还将加息三次。 “全球性竞争加剧，网上零售增加，新技术使得消费者可以以极低成本迅速发现最佳价格，这些结构性转变正在压抑物价，这一点几乎毋庸置疑，”Wells Fargo Securities驻北卡罗来纳州夏洛特的资深分析师Mark Vitner称。 美国商务部周五在第二份报告中称，11月扣除飞机的非国防资本财订单出货量上升0.3%，10月为上升1.3%。该数据是衡量企业支出的一个备受关注的指标。 核心资本财出货被用于计算政府国内生产总值(GDP)指标中的设备支出。此出货数据自2月以来月月增长，创1992年开始汇整该数据以来最长连续增长期。 过去两个月核心资本财出货的增加显示，第四季企业设备支出增速强劲。 第三季时企业设备支出创三年来最快增速，但增长动能可能正在减缓。核心资本财订单继10月增长0.8%后，11月下滑0.1%。 “最近几季实际设备支出势头强劲，但近来订单数据降温暗示，未来可能出现一些低潮。”摩根大通驻纽约的经济分析师Daniel Silver称。 商务部在第三份报告中称，美国11月新屋销售较前月跳涨17.5%，经季节性调整后年率为73.3万户，为2007年7月来最高水准。11月新屋销售较上年同期增长26.6%。 图表： 美国耐久财订单：tmsnrt.rs/2o0iZOm 美国PCE数据：tmsnrt.rs/2dUoEgr (完) ","
