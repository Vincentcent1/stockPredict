,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"The project, details of which have not been reported before, would allow Kuwait to diversify its gas imports in the wake a political crisis between Gulf states and major supplier Qatar. “Iraq needs to urgently reduce gas flaring as it trails behind all targets it has promised the World Bank,” said a senior industry source working on the project but not allowed to discuss it publicly. “The Kuwaiti gas project is a quick fix and an easy way to monetize gas resources.” The World Bank, which has repeatedly made reducing gas flaring a condition of lending to Baghdad, did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Toyo is proposing to construct a gas pipeline and start deliveries after 2019, industry sources said. Toyo’s chief financial officer, Kensuke Waki, told Reuters that talks about a pipeline and a petrochemical plant were ongoing but a final investment decision had not yet been made. Kuwait is very keen on the project and has offered a sovereign guarantee for up to 80 percent of the costs, industry sources said. No total cost has been announced. Kuwait’s oil ministry did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Oil minister Issam Al-Marzouq said last month that talks between Kuwait and Iraq were focused on a proposal to use gas to help pay Baghdad’s final $4.6 billion in war compensation payments. Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said talks were focusing on price and confirmed that supplies could be used to help pay off reparations. Industry sources told Reuters the talks have faltered over price, however. They said Kuwait is pushing for a price of less than $3 per mbtu (million British thermal unit), in line with U.S. Henry Hub prices. But that is less than half what Iraq pays in the north when importing gas from neighboring Iran. “The price of gas remains the key sticking point for now,” one of the sources said. He also said both Iraq and Kuwait were pushing to have the petrochemical plant built on their territory to further capitalize on gas deliveries. Iraq used to supply Kuwait with gas from Rumaila. Volumes reached as much as 400 mcf per day but stopped shortly after the 1990 invasion. More than a million claimants in Kuwait have been paid as part of Baghdad’s $52.4 billion reparations bill for the invasion. But Iraq, hurt by the 2014 fall in oil prices and its war with Islamic State militants, requested a delay on the last and largest tranche, which is due this year. Kuwait, although one of OPEC’s leading oil producers, has struggled to meet growing domestic gas demand. The shortfall has been estimated at 500 million cubic feet per day and is being covered mainly by LNG imports, including from Qatar. A decade ago Kuwait tried to build a pipeline from Qatar, but the move was blocked by Saudi Arabia. With relations between Riyadh and Doha worsening this year, Kuwait is looking to diversify its gas imports. Last year, Kuwait said it would be ready to buy up to 200 mcf/day of gas from Baghdad. Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Jihad said volumes could start at 50 mcf/d rising gradually to 200 mcf/d. Iraq’s gas reserves of 3.7 trillion cubic meters rank as 12th largest in the world but represent only a tenth of those of Iran, the world’s largest. It extracts large quantities of gas together with oil, however, and that gas is currently being flared. “Shell’s main aim was always to develop an LNG terminal and ultimately a petchem complex in Iraq,” said a Shell insider who worked on the gas project. With Iraq refusing to agree on a gas price with Shell, the project has hit a major impasse, industry sources said. Talks have also been complicated by Shell pulling out of the Majnoon oil fields earlier this year. “Iraq is furious at Shell and prospects don’t look that great for the Basra gas company,” one Iraqi industry source said. Asked about the negotiations, both Shell and the Iraqi oil ministry said discussions were ongoing and both sides remained committed to the project. ","

This sector includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling and refining, or integrated power utility companies including renewable energy and coal. ​The energy sector is a large and all encompassing term that describes a complex and inter-related network of companies directly and indirectly involved in the production and distribution of energy needed to power the economy and facilitate the means of production and transportation. Performance in the sector is largely driven by the supply and demand for worldwide energy. Oil and gas producers will do very well during times of high oil and gas prices, but will earn less when the value of the commodity drops. Oil refiners, on the other hand, benefit from the falling cost of feedstock to produce petroleum products like gasoline when crude oil prices drop. Furthermore, this sector is sensitive to political events, which historically have driven changes in the price of oil. Some of the largest companies in the U.S. energy sector include Exxon Mobil and Chevron, both of which are large international integrated oil companies. Duke Energy Corporation is one of America's largest electricity providers as measured by number of customers, and Peabody Energy is America's largest coal producer measured by tons of output. All these companies are part of what is commonly known as the energy sector. ​There are a number of energy-related exchange traded funds (ETFs) that afford retail investors exposure to the sector. Investors can vary which part of the value chain they want exposure to with any number of funds. For example, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) gives investors exposure to the upstream oil and gas exploration companies, while the VanEck Vectors Coal ETF (KOL) gives investors access to the coal industry. Investors wanting access to alternative energy can invest in the Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN). There are many different ways for investors to gain exposure to the energy sector, depending on their preferences and specific views about the growth and earnings prospects across the value chain. The energy sector is bigger and more diversified than just the oil and gas industry. Many investors feel renewable and alternative energy sources will be important in the future as the popularity of electric cars grows. Traditional hydrocarbon producers seem to be falling out of favor for the time being. ",Energy Sector | Investopedia

"Tyler Crowe, Matthew DiLallo, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The oil and gas market has been a tough nut to crack over the past few years. After the incredible collapse in oil prices from 2014 to early 2016, the industry has been slowly creeping back at a pace that many investors have ignored. There's no doubt that today's oil prices in the $50- to $60-per-barrel range isn't anywhere near the $100 or more we saw a few years ago, but the companies producing the stuff have made incredible strides to become profitable at these much lower prices. As a result, there are some rather attractive-looking investments in the oil and gas industry today. So we asked three of our investing contributors to each highlight an oil investment they see as a great buy now. Here's why they picked Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), U.S. Silica Holdings (NYSE:SLCA), and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Image source: Getty Images. Matt DiLallo (Marathon Oil): During the oil market downturn, Marathon Oil put together a simple playbook so it could start winning again at lower oil prices. The first few plays consisted mostly of blocking and tackling, such as strengthening its balance sheet, relentlessly focusing on costs, and simplifying and concentrating its portfolio. The company felt that if it could do those things well, then it could profitably grow within cash flows at lower oil prices, which would enable it to score gains for investors. Marathon has completed most of its more defensive-focused moves by selling higher-cost assets and using that cash to shore up its finances as well as bulk up its shale position. As a result, it can now generate enough cash flow at $50 oil to grow production by a 10% to 12% compound annual growth rate through 2021. Further, it can achieve that double-digit growth while also paying its current dividend. That ability to deliver healthy production growth within cash flow at $50 oil puts Marathon in an elite group. It's one of the few oil companies that can still create value for investors even if oil prices slip a bit while retaining uncapped upside if they continue recovering. That combination of a lower risk profile and high reward potential makes it an exceptional oil stock to consider buying, since it could still run up a big score for investors even if crude doesn't recover any further. Tyler Crowe (U.S. Silica Holdings): The frack sand market has been extremely volatile over the past few years. Back in 2014, it looked as if the industry could do no wrong, and then it became one of the hardest hit industries as the price of oil crashed and drilling activity in North America came to a grinding halt. Over the past year, though, the industry has picked back up in a big way. Just about every major frack sand supplier is running at full capacity and is in the process of expanding operations with new mines. There does appear to be some skepticism from Wall Street that all these new mines are needed. All this additional capacity could lead to another oversupply that kills margin. While that is a valid opinion, it may help boost the argument for U.S. Silica in the coming years. U.S. Silica has the most ambitious growth plans of its frack sand peers. Between acquisitions and greenfield projects, the company has either completed or is constructing facilities to expand production by 9 million tons per year, or a 70% increase from its production capacity from a year ago. Adding that much capacity sounds risky, but management is de-risking some of these projects by signing up customers to long-term takeaway contracts that ensure a high level of demand. According to management, the company has already secured takeaway contracts for 1.2 million tons of its recently announced 2.6 million ton-per-year facility near Midland, Texas, that also includes cash pre-payments to help fund the mine. Moves like this suggest the company's growth plans aren't as risky as they sound. If we assume that last quarter's results can be replicated in the coming quarters -- it seems reasonable as it expands capacity and grows margin through its logistics business -- then perhaps today's price-to-earnings ratio of 42 might not reflect the value in U.S. Silica's shares. MRO data by YCharts Reuben Gregg Brewer (ExxonMobil Corporation): Exxon is one of the world's largest integrated oil majors. It has historically traded at a premium to its peers, which it continues to do today. Only BP plc's (NYSE:BP) price to tangible book value is anywhere near Exxon's. But the other oil majors have been closing the gap. This is an interesting dynamic. In fact, Exxon's price to tangible book value sits near a 10-year low. That suggests that, relative to its own history, Exxon is cheap. Most of its peers appear either fairly valued (trading around the midpoint of their historical range) or even expensive (BP's ratio has moved notably higher this year) on this metric after stock price advances that have, basically, left Exxon behind. Exxon is down around 8% so far this year, while Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-B) tops the advancers at a roughly 13% gain. However, Exxon continues to be a top performer when it comes to putting shareholder money to work, as measured by return on capital employed. Recovering oil prices have led to improvement at all of the majors on this metric, but only ENI (NYSE:E) has excelled to the point where its returns are notably higher than Exxon's. Exxon continues to perform well as a business. In short, Exxon looks cheap on a relative basis compared to its history despite an improving industry outlook that's lifted the market's view of its peers. If you're looking for a good value in big oil, Exxon may be the right choice for you. ","

,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods is reorganizing the company’s refining operations, part of a push to boost profits amid volatile oil and natural gas prices, the company said on Monday. The changes at the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer are the most sweeping to date by Woods, who became chief executive in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state. Woods has moved first to reshape the parts of the businesses he knows best, according to sources familiar with the matter. Before taking the helm at Exxon, Woods ran Exxon’s refining operations. Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker confirmed the downstream business overhaul in a statement, adding the company expects it will “improve decision making and enhance performance in the market.” The parts of the business impacted were refining and marketing divisions, said spokesman Scott Silvestri. Company sources told Reuters Exxon’s chemical operation also has been restructured, but Silvestri denied this. It was not immediately clear if the changes will involve job cuts or executive departures. Exxon’s Huffaker said she could not say if there would be any impact on jobs. The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the downstream business as the company works to improve its exploration and production operations, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices. The downstream restructuring, disclosed internally last month, will combine the fuels and lubricants division with the supply and refining divisions. Financial responsibility for the merged operation will rest with country and regional chiefs who report to Exxon’s Irving, Texas, headquarters rather than divisional bosses as previously, according to people familiar with the matter. The changes are designed to simplify operations and increase accountability for profitability, the sources said. Exxon’s refining and chemical operations have grown in stature under Woods, delivering steady earnings compared with its oil and gas production. Exxon operates 22 refineries in 14 countries, processing nearly 5 million barrels of oil per day. The firm builds chemical and refining plants in the same location, allowing managers to shift production between fuels or chemicals based on demand. The changes come as Exxon expands the refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year’s results were affected by sharply lower crude prices. In some quarters, Exxon would not have made any money were it not for its refineries. This year, the company’s oil and gas business bounced back to a $5 billion profit during the first nine months on stronger crude prices. Refining earnings were $4.03 billion and chemicals $3.25 billion, respectively, for the first three quarters this year. Some staff members have raised questions as to whether there is any need to alter a system seen as largely successful, said the sources who declined to be identified. It was unclear if the changes would impact an internal accounting practice known as general interest principle. That rule permits certain transactions to be loss-making for a local division if they are beneficial for the corporation as a whole. Exxon did not comment on any potential accounting changes. ","

,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) BANGKOK, November 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings (Thailand) has affirmed the National Short-Term Rating on ESSO (Thailand) Public Company Limited's (Esso) bills of exchange revolving programme of up to THB12 billion at 'F1(tha)'. The maturity of each series of bills is no more than 270 days under the programme. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Parent Support: Fitch believes Esso has strong financial support from its ultimate parent, Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil). This was evident from the increase in inter-company loans from the parent group during the period of high financial leverage in 2014, in addition to the THB54 billion in standby credit facilities and the THB12 billion revolving loan facility from the parent group. Since then, the proportion of inter-group financing has remained high at 60%-65% of total financing, although Esso's total debt and financial leverage have decreased substantially. This has helped Esso to reduce its exposure to external debt. Esso is also able to leverage its parent's worldwide procurement network for crude oil and refined products, and use ExxonMobil's technology and engineering services, human resources and R&D to improve its operational efficiency. Higher Rating Headroom: Esso's financial buffer against drops in refining margins has increased, as its debt has decreased significantly for the past two and a half years thanks to strong operating cash flows and low capex. Esso's debt fell to THB16.9 billion at end-September 2017, the lowest level in 10 years, from THB35.7 billion at end-2014. Its leverage, as measured by FFO adjusted net leverage, decreased to 1.6x in the 12 months to end-September 2017. Fitch expects Esso's debt to continue falling in 2017-2018 due to a lack of major capex. However, leverage is likely to increase moderately in 2017-2018, as Fitch expects Esso's operating cash flows to soften and oil prices to gradually recover. Moderate Capex: Esso does not plan a major expansion or large investments in the next two to three years. The company aims to improve its production efficiency and increase its use of challenged crudes to control costs and improve margins, as well as enhance its retail network. These are small projects with low capex requirements. Esso's capex has been moderate at THB900 million to THB1.4 billion a year for the past four years, and is likely to remain at these levels in the next two to three years. Nevertheless, Esso may need to make a large investment to improve its refinery to comply with potential changes in emission standards, following the Euro V emission standard, although the government's plan to revise the standards remains undecided. Integrated Refiners: The rating also reflects Esso's complex refinery capacity, its favourable access to raw materials and established brand name. The integration of paraxylene (PX) production widens Esso's output range, optimises its product lines, and helps to reduce the volatility of the company's refining margins, although excess regional PX capacity has weakened margins. Esso also has a strong position in fuel retailing as Thailand's third-largest fuel retailer by volume in 2016 with 542 retail stations. Highly Cyclical Business: Esso's credit profile is tempered by its high vulnerability to oil prices, refining margins and petrochemical product-to-feed margins, as well as high working-capital volatility, which can significantly affect its earnings and cash-flow generation. The company is also exposed to single-production-site risk. DERIVATION SUMMARY Esso's rating reflects the integration of its refinery, petrochemical production and oil retailing businesses. Esso's business profile is moderate relative to Thai downstream oil and gas peers with its leverage relatively higher than most of its peers. Esso's operating scale is smaller than that of IRPC Public Company Limited  , while its financial leverage similar. IRPC has larger refinery and petrochemical operations and generates more EBITDA from the petrochemical business, resulting in higher margins. However, we view Esso as having stronger linkages with its ultimate parent, ExxonMobil. Esso has much smaller operating scale than PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited and Thai Oil Public Company Limited and higher leverage than these two companies. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Crude oil prices (Brent) of USD52.5 per barrel in 2018, USD55 per barrel in 2019, and USD57.5 thereafter, with Esso's crude procurement costs adjusted for applicable premiums - High gross refining margin in 2017, and softer margin in  2018 and thereafter - PX product-to-feed margin to gradually increase in 2019-2021 - Maintenance capex and small efficiency improvement projects in 2017-2021 - Dividend payment in 2018 and thereafter RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A significant strengthening of its links with ExxonMobil group Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Weakening ownership and support from ExxonMobil group - Weaker access to bank loans and debt capital market - Sustained high financial leverage exceeding 6.5x (measured by FFO adjusted net leverage) LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Esso had outstanding debt of THB16.9 billion at end-September 2017. Most of the THB10.4 billion of debt due to mature within 12 months was short-term debt. This will be supported by cash and cash equivalents of THB776 million, estimated free cash flow of THB1.8 billion in 2018 and the available undrawn revolving loan facilities from the ExxonMobil group totalling THB66.0 billion at end-September 2017 as well as available uncommitted facilities of THB32.4 billion from financial institutions.

It’s widely regarded as the best single measure of large-cap U.S. stocks, and, like the Dow, has become synonymous with “the market.” The index includes 500 top U.S. companies in leading industries, and captures about 80% coverage of available market capitalization. Created in 1957, it was the first U.S. market-cap-weighted stock market index. While the Dow used to be the main gauge of economic health in the U.S., the S&P 500 has become the leading stock index because of its broader scope. The index covers all major sectors of the market, and some of its top constituents (by index weight) include Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway B, Johnson & Johnson, ExxonMobil and J.P. Morgan Chase (current as of Oct. 23, 2017). Although the S&P 500 contains 500 constituents, it may contain greater than 500 “constituent trading lines” since some companies are represented by multiple share classes.  Created By: Created by Standard & Poor’s in 1957. Currently maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Number of Companies: 500 large-cap companies (market cap of $6.1 billion or greater) Types of Companies: The S&P 500 tries to cover all major areas of the U.S. economy. Selection Criteria: Components are chosen by the U.S. Index Committee and rebalanced quarterly. How it's Calculated: The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index.  Advantages: The S&P 500 is one of the best benchmarks in the world for large-cap stocks. By including 500 companies, it offers great diversification and accounts for approximately 80% of the U.S. market. The performance of the S&P 500 is considered one of the best overall indicators of market performance and many investors and fund managers attempt to outperform the index. Disadvantages: The index contains only large-cap U.S. companies. As such, may not be the best benchmark for investors who own small-cap stocks and/or foreign companies. Also, the top 50 companies by market capitalization account for about 50% of the index’s value – so they have a larger impact on the index calculation. Investing: There are several index funds that track the S&P 500, including the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), or “Spider” – the most actively traded ETF by trading volume. You can also trade the e-mini S&P futures contract (ticker symbol ES). (For more, see SPY: SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF.) ",Index Investing: The Standard & Poor's 500 Index

There's nothing quite like a good, solid oil dividend, right? Anyone looking for a strong dividend payout backed by torrential cash flows must surely be impressed by ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield and 34 years of uninterrupted annual dividend increases. Exxon is indeed a great income stock, but there are many dividend stocks out there that offer even better policies than the oil giant. You don't even have to stick within the energy market. A panel of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool has put together a handful of stocks with better yields than ExxonMobil. Read on to see how Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) can beat the big oil stocks from the perspective of a dividend hunter. You can do better than Exxon. Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (Spirit Realty Capital): Shares of this retail-focused REIT are too cheap to ignore. Though the company has struggled under the weight of its largest single tenant, Shopko, investors are pricing the stock as if its portfolio were filled to the brim with similarly weak tenants. That's not the case, in my view. To be sure, Shopko is a large tenant for Spirit Realty, making up about 7.8% of contractual rent, compared with 2.6% and 2.4% for its second- and third-largest tenants, respectively. But the portfolio, which includes more than 2,400 properties, is generally leased on a triple-net basis to high-quality restaurants, pharmacies, convenience stores, and movie theaters, all of which derive benefits from proximity to their customers (they can't just move to lower-cost locations). I suspect that an upcoming spin-off that will push Shopko assets into a new REIT will help investors better understand the value of the remaining assets, particularly its triple-net lease portfolio. With a current yield of 8.5%, the company yields nearly twice as much as other triple-net lease REITs, including Realty Income Corporation and National Retail Properties. The market is pricing Spirit as if there are several more Shopkos to come. At the current share price, I think it makes sense to take the other side of the trade. Chris Neiger (Verizon): It's nearly impossible to put together a list of dividend stocks with high yields and not mention Verizon. The telecom giant currently has a trailing annual dividend yield of 4.9% and has a 10-year history of raising it every year. The company's wireless business drives its top line, and increasing competition from its rivals has kept Verizon on its toes lately. Wireless revenue of $21.6 billion fell more than 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2017, but there isn't much for investors to worry about over the long term. Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    3 Dividend Stocks With Better Yields Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

"Jamal Carnette, CFA",11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's been a tough time for value investors. Earlier this year, a research report from Goldman Sachs noted that value investing -- selling higher-valued stocks and buying undervalued ones -- no longer provided investors with the same overperformance as it once had. In fact, the strategy would have resulted in a cumulative loss of 15% over the prior decade, while the S&P 500 has nearly doubled. That's a significant shift: In 1997, Professors Eugene Fama, a Nobel prize winner widely considered the father of modern finance, along with Kenneth French, published a research study showing that during the 20-year period ended 1995, the difference between investing in low book-to-market multiples (value stocks) versus high multiples (growth stocks) was 7.6% per year. Image source: Getty Images Amazon's most valuable assets at its 2017 robotics challenge. Image source: Amazon.com. Both Einhorn and cable mogul John Malone have identified the culprit that's destroyed traditional value investing: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). After jokingly calling the company the ""Death Star,"" Malone noted that the richly valued company would disrupt every industry on the planet. Einhorn wrote, ""Our view is that just because Amazon can disrupt somebody else's profit stream, it doesn't mean that Amazon earns that profit stream. For the moment, the market doesn't agree."" Traditional value isn't dead, but rather the definition of value has changed. Fama and French used price-to-book as their dominant metric. Broadly, this favors more ""stuff"" on the books -- assets such as plants, machines, equipment, and buildings. A report from 13D research, by way of The Reformed Broker, noted that the five largest companies by market capitalization in 2007 were mostly in asset-heavy industries: PetroChina, ExxonMobil, General Electric, China Mobile, and Bank of China, and were worth a collective $2.3 trillion. Today, the top five companies are Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon, which are now worth $3 trillion with fewer assets (excluding cash) and 44% fewer employees. The issue for value investors is it's hard to measure non-tangible assets and employee quality, but it's necessary. In 2013, Bloomberg noted that as little as 7% of the value of large corporations is from tangible assets, with intangibles such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights accounting for more than 90%. Unfortunately, generally accepted accounting rules do a poor job of accounting for intangible assets on both the balance sheet and the income statement. Employees are not a bookable asset, and using the price-to-earnings ratio is a poor metric to value companies with high intangible assets, because the internal costs of patent development are mostly expensed as occurred -- not capitalized, where they appear on the balance sheet -- while the economic benefits often occur later and over multiple periods. Value investors need to incorporate intangible assets into their analysis, because these trends are only accelerating. It isn't that value investing is dead -- it's just the definition of value has changed, and investors need to change along with it. ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"A lawyer for Exxon told justices on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that his arguments were focused only on whether Attorney General Maura Healey had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the oil company misled consumers and investors. “We are not asking this court to weigh in on the causes of climate change,” Justin Anderson, Exxon’s lawyer, said. But Anderson said Healey was improperly trying to establish jurisdiction in part based on more than 300 Exxon-branded gas stations in Massachusetts operated by franchisees to justify probing the Texas-based company’s actions elsewhere. “They can only be held to account here for what they’ve done here,” Anderson said. Richard Johnston, Healey’s chief legal counsel, countered that Exxon had control over the franchisees’ marketing and  conducted advertising on their behalf. “We should be able to find out whether they knew about impact of fossil fuels on global warming so they should have said more in those advertisements,” Johnston said. He urged the court to allow Healey to carry on her probe into whether Exxon failed to disclose what it knew to consumers and investors and engaged in a campaign to sow doubts about the science of climate change. Healey, a Democrat, and New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought records following news reports in 2015 how Exxon’s own scientists determined that reducing fossil fuel combustion was needed to mitigate the impact of climate change. Those reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon contends that the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions. After Healey issued a demand for documents in April 2016, Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the records request and another case in federal court challenging her and Schneiderman’s investigations. Tuesday’s hearing came after Exxon appealed a lower-court judge’s January ruling denying its request to avoid handing over the documents. While the six justices gave no indication how they would rule, some expressed skepticism that the 300 stations could not create jurisdiction, even if consumers bought gas from a franchisee. “They believe they’re buying Exxon gas,” Justice Elspeth Cypher said. “The citizens of this state believe that’s what they’re buying.” (This version of the story has been refiled to add dropped word “of” in 3rd paragraph, removes extra “if” in seventh paragraph) ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"Neil Chapman, the head of its global chemicals operations, was named to the company’s management committee, a board-elected panel that typically serves as a stepping stone for future chief executives, Exxon said on Friday. Chapman, 55, joins CEO Woods and four other senior vice presidents on the committee, which oversees the company’s global operations. The president of ExxonMobil Chemical Co also was promoted to corporate senior vice president. The merger of the world’s largest publicly-traded oil producer’s refining and marketing operations will take place in the first quarter, the company said. Bryan Milton, 53, president of Exxon’s fuels, lubricants & specialties marketing business, was named president of the new ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Co effective Jan. 1. Dennis Wascom, president of Exxon’s refining and supply subsidiary, will become vice president of operational excellence, safety, security, health and environment, said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri. Woods took over the top job in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state. The merging of refining, lubricants and marketing is the first major move by Woods since replacing Tillerson and is in the company’s downstream operations, which he used to lead before taking over as CEO. The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the fuel and lubricant businesses as the company works to improve its exploration and production operation, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices. The company’s downstream sector has grown in prominence since Woods took over leadership of Exxon. The changes come as Exxon expands its refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year’s results were affected by sharply lower crude prices. ","

Alan Farley,12072017,Investopedia,11302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Dow components Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Chevron Corporation (CVX) have underperformed throughout 2017 but could lift into market leadership in 2018, underpinned by a resilient crude oil market and strong U.S. economy, supercharged by tax cuts and deregulation. However, buying these stocks too early could be hazardous to your bottom line because end-of-year tax selling may inhibit buying power until the calendar flips in January. The WTI crude oil contract has lifted to a two-year high and could soon test resistance in the lower $60s. Meanwhile, OPEC and Russia have just agreed to extend oil output curbs through the end of 2018, allowing U.S. energy companies to benefit from higher commodity prices as well as ramped-up production levels because our government has not agreed to similar cuts. Taken together, energy stocks at all capitalization levels could finally enter bull market advances. (See also: A Guide to Investing in Oil Markets.) Exxon Mobil shares broke out above the 2008 high at $95.64 in December 2013 and hit an all-time high at $104.76 in July 2014. A steep downturn accelerated in the second quarter of 2015, finally coming to rest at a five-year low in the mid-$60s in August. The subsequent recovery posted two broad rally impulses, lifting the stock into the closely-aligned 786 Fibonacci sell-off retracement and failed breakout levels in July 2016. A shallow but persistent correction off that resistance level finally ended in the mid-$70s in August, giving way to a bounce that mounted the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) in October. The stock has been crisscrossing the moving average for the past two months, trying to build support, while price action since February 2017 has carved a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern. This potent combination predicts that a breakout above the neckline at $84 will generate a test at long-term resistance in the mid-$90s. On-balance volume (OBV) bottomed out in August 2015 and lifted into a 52-week high in July 2016. A sideways chop into the second half of 2017 signaled a delicate balance between bulls and bears, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reached a two-year high in October. This renewed buying interest could mark a tradable low ahead of superior 2018 performance. Even so, it is likely that positions taken in the mid-$80s following an inverse head and shoulders breakout will require a relatively long-term holding period to build sizable profits. (For more, see: Exxon, Chevron and Oil Are Breaking Out.) Chevron stock has carved a stronger price pattern than its Dow rival, but significant technical challenges remain. It broke out above the 2008 high at $104.63 in 2011 and entered a rising wedge pattern that persisted into the July 2014 all-time high at $135.10. The subsequent downturn broke wedge support in October and failed the multi-year breakout in June 2015, triggering a decline that continued into August, when it bottomed out at a five-year low near $70. A healthy uptick through 2016 unfolded through three rally waves that stalled near $120 in December. Loyal shareholders suffered through a persistent decline in the first half of 2017, with strong support at $102 finally taking hold in July. The stock rallied back to the 2016 high in October and dropped into a narrow trading range that may now complete the handle in a cup and handle pattern. A breakout should bring the 2014 high into play, with that level marking the final barrier ahead of a bull market advance that could add many points in the coming years. Meanwhile, OBV has just lifted above the December 2016 recovery high and reached a three-year high, predicting that price will play catch-up in coming months. Even so, the stock has gained less than two points to far in 2017, increasing the odds that tax selling pressure will inhibit buying power into early 2018. (See also: The Top 3 Chevron Shareholders.) Big oil price action has improved greatly in the second half of 2017, lifting major players into price levels that could support healthy 2018 upside. Chevron looks like a better bet than Exxon Mobil in this bullish scenario, set to test this decade's bull market high after it mounts resistance at $119.

Fred Imbert,12072017,CNBC,11302017,"Mark Fisher, one of the most well-known traders on Wall Street, has put together an alternative index to the 120-year-old Dow Jones industrial average. Fisher, CEO of MBF Clearing, launched the ""Essential 40"" index earlier this year,  an index that includes Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Visa and UnitedHealth, among others. KKM Financial launched a mutual fund on Monday, the Essential 40 Stock Fund (ESSIX), which tracks the index. ""It's today's version of the Dow Jones,"" Fisher told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Tuesday. ""It's the 40 most essential names to the way you live."" ""Without these names your life is blank,"" he said jokingly. Below is a chart of the 40 stocks in the Essential 40 index and how they have performed in 2017: Throughout its history, the Dow has been the go-to benchmark of the U.S. stock market for Main Street market watchers. The biggest difference between the Dow and Fisher's Essential 40 index — aside from the number of stocks in them and how long they've been around — is how they are weighted. The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning stocks with a higher price will have a bigger sway on the index's overall direction. Stocks in the Essential 40 index, meanwhile, all have a 2.5 percent weight on the index. Fisher is one of the most wildly followed commodities traders on Wall Street, being known for making calls on oil and energy. He has also worked with the likes of legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. Oil prices are up about 7 percent in 2017, following a year where they shot up 45 percent. But at current levels, Fisher thinks crude is ""trapped."" ""I think the upside is limited to $60-$63 and the downside is capped around the high $40s,"" he said. ""I think that, if we go up much more, what will happen is you'll see a lot more rigs come online."" Fisher also said that a lot of people in OPEC and Russia are comfortable with crude trading at these levels. U.S. oil gained 0.37 percent to trade at $57.68 per barrel on Tuesday. Fisher also said he likes shares of Barrick Gold here on the dip. The stock is down 14 percent for the year. ",Legendary trader Mark Fisher launches a 'modern day' version of the Dow average

ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) seems like it should be one of the best dividend stocks on the market. The company makes a commodity that isn't going to be replaced anytime soon and is one of the biggest names in energy today. But peek under the hood of ExxonMobil's business and the picture gets dark pretty quickly. Oil's future is in question, the company isn't investing in its own production, and the dividend payout ratio is already at a troubling level. Here's why investors should be concerned about ExxonMobil's dividend in the long term. Image source: Getty Images. It's tough to argue that the oil business is a long-term growth business long-term in 2017. The chart below shows that ExxonMobil's revenue and net income are both in decline over the past five years -- largely because of falling oil prices -- and the future doesn't look much better. XOM Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Electric vehicles (EVs) are beginning to be viable for millions of auto consumers and automakers are planning a massive expansion in their EV fleets. According to the International Energy Agency, 2 million electric vehicles were on the road at the end of 2016. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) optimistic view of EVs has over 20 million EVs on the road in 2020 and over 200 million in 2030. Even the bearish view estimates that nearly 60 million EVs will be on the road in 2030. No matter how you look at it, EVs will be a sizable chunk of the vehicles on the road, which stands at 1.3 billion vehicles today. Each vehicle built with batteries rather than an internal combustion engine is a vehicle that's replacing a source of oil and gasoline demand. Since oil is priced at the margin (meaning the last barrel produced is really what determines price), that'll put pressure on oil prices, revenue, and earnings at ExxonMobil. Another flaw in ExxonMobil right now is that the company has been investing less in its own assets for years now. You can see below that capital expenditures are less than half of what they were five years ago, and without the reduction in spending, free cash flow would be underwater. XOM Capital Expenditures (TTM) data by YCharts. The oil and natural gas business are all about replacing production with new reserves, which requires investment in capital expenses. And ExxonMobil isn't doing that right now. Between the end of 2015 and the end of 2016 proved reserves dropped 19.3% to 19.97 billion barrels, driven by falling oil prices and the drop in investment. Eventually, the well will run dry and ExxonMobil will shrink simply because it isn't investing in projects that will generate returns in the future. I've mentioned some flaws in ExxonMobil's business, but the chart below shows that its dividend is already on thin ice. Companies want to be generating more free cash flow than they pay out in dividends, and over the last three years, ExxonMobil hasn't done that. The result is using debt to fund the dividend, which increases long-term risk for investors. XOM Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. Borrowing to keep the dividend afloat may be a reasonable idea if the future looked bright for ExxonMobil, but it doesn't. Fossil fuels are being disrupted by renewable energy and EVs and that makes this a tough dividend to bet on today. I'm so confident that ExxonMobil will underperform the market that I'm giving it an underperform call on My CAPS page. ","

Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    3 Dividend Stocks With Better Yields Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

  "
Jason Hall,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Surprisingly enough, a huge portion of that value is derived from a very small group of companies. Of the thousands of publicly traded companies operating today, the 30 largest ones are worth almost $10 trillion -- about one-third of the entire market's value. Here is a closer look at each of the 30 biggest companies on the stock market. (Note: All market data as of Nov. 30, 2017.) Apple's iPhone X is just the latest tech marvel from the world's most valuable -- and profitable -- company. Image source: Apple. With a market capitalization of $868.8 billion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made for one of the greatest investing stories in history. And not once, but twice. Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, the early success of its Apple I, Apple II, and Macintosh computers made it a huge financial success for anyone who invested in the company after its 1980 IPO. But a number of challenges and a power struggle led to the departure of Jobs in 1985. After years of steady loss of market share to another company on this list, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple brought Jobs back in 1997, when the company was on the brink of failure. Following his return, Apple went on to develop the iMac, iPod (and subsequently iTunes), and the product that has made it the most valuable public company on Earth: the iPhone in 2007. The company is on track to ship 30 million of its new iPhone X smartphones in the current quarter. Given their price of $999 to $1,149 each, the company should command more than $30 billion in sales this quarter from this single product. Image source: Google. The parent company of Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is worth $720.8 billion. But unlike Apple, which makes a living selling high-end tech devices, Alphabet doesn't charge its users much or anything at all for most of its services. YouTube, Google search, Gmail, Google Drive cloud storage, and Documents productivity software are all free at their basic levels, while some premium services -- like additional storage and ad-free content on YouTube -- are available for a modest fee. And Alphabet uses those massive profits to invest in even more innovation. The company is a leader in self-driving vehicle technology, clean energy, and connecting more of the world to the internet. Image source: Microsoft. Like Apple, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) played a big role in the advent of affordable personal computing. But while Apple developed a fully integrated software and hardware system, Microsoft is all about software. It also was a big reason why Apple lost the home PC wars in the late 1980s, while Microsoft, with its ""Wintel"" duopoly with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) (which is also on this list) went on to command virtually the entire personal computer market for decades. However, Microsoft has all but missed out on the smartphone revolution, with its Windows Phone never really garnering much commercial success. However, this lack of success with handheld devices hasn't kept Big Softy from being wildly profitable and still a growth company. After all, the company's operating systems and other software are still critically important to running the infrastructure that powers much of the world's computing power. Microsoft has become a major player in cloud computing, a huge growth market. The company increased its market share last year, growing segment revenue 14% to $7 billion last quarter alone. Microsoft may have lost out to Apple in mobile computing, but it's not going to miss out on the cloud. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of few companies to emerge from the late 1990s tech bubble a success. And with a market cap of $560 billion, it easily qualifies as the biggest. Started by Jeff Bezos as an online bookstore, Amazon sells just about everything today, and tens of millions of people subscribe to its Prime membership program for free shipping, free TV, and free movie streaming. Prime members count on Amazon as their first -- and often only -- stop for online shopping. The company's sales are growing strongly: Last quarter alone, revenue was up 34% to $44 billion. E-commerce isn't the only nascent industry Amazon is dominating, either. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the company's cloud computing provider, and Amazon commands substantial market share in this space as one of the lowest-cost providers. Last quarter, AWS generated almost $1.2 billion in operating income for Amazon, and it's set for potentially years of growth to come. Image source: Getty Images. The dominant social media platform, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), is worth $508.9 billion. Founded by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and several other Harvard students in 2004, it was initially available only to fellow Harvard classmates and then a few other colleges. More than 26% of humanity regularly uses Facebook. That's a stunning figure, but it also means about three-fourths of us don't. Facebook's management would tell you that's room for growth. Image source: The Motley Fool. Led by legendary investor and CEO Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) is worth $468.4 billion. Since Buffett took over the company 50 years ago -- it was a struggling textile manufacturer at the time -- and converted it into a holding company for his various other investments, Berkshire has created enormous wealth for tens of thousands of shareholders. Today, Berkshire is a sprawling conglomerate, with subsidiaries engaged in insurance, railways, candy making, manufacturing, electricity production, and too many other businesses to name here. Much of Berkshire's value also owes to its stock portfolio, which includes a number of the other companies on this list. At last count, Berkshire's stock holdings were worth about $180 billion, an amount that's likely to grow for years to come. Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma. Image source: Alibabagroup.com. Alibaba Group has rocketed up the top 30 list on expectations that its growth is just getting started. This year, the stock price has climbed 90%, even after a recent 9% drop. With China's middle class on track to crack 500 million people within a few years, Alibaba's best days could well be ahead. Image source: Johnson & Johnson. More than 130 years after its founding, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is still one of the biggest innovators in the healthcare industry, as reflected by its $375 million market value. Best-known for consumer brands including Band-Aid and Tylenol, the healthcare giant is also a major medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturer. Last quarter, its pharmaceutical segment generated almost half of sales, while medical devices were worth twice as much revenue as the consumer-goods segment. Looking ahead, JNJ's management is banking on the need for more healthcare spending as a significant portion of the world's population gets older. Life expectancies are increasing, but it will require significant medical support to care for a growing aging population. Even after 130 years of success, the company's future still looks bright. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has its roots as far back as 1799, with the founding of one of its predecessors, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. After dozens of acquisitions and mergers in the many years since, today's JPMorgan Chase is America's biggest bank, and one of the world's largest by total assets. It's worth $360 million at recent share prices. Since the Great Recession, JPMorgan Chase, under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, has built up a fortress-like balance sheet and developed some of the most conservative lending practices in the industry. So, even as one of the biggest banks out there, it is also considered one of the safest for investors to own. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $348.6 billion, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is similar to JPMorgan Chase in that it's a product of numerous acquisitions and mergers over the years. It also has its roots in the early days of the American oil industry, directly descended from multiple companies that were part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. A true integrated ""supermajor,"" ExxonMobil participates in every aspect of the oil and gas value chain, including exploration and production, distribution, refining and chemical manufacturing, and selling refined products. Last quarter, this generated $66 billion in sales and $4 billion in profits -- better than recent quarters thanks to higher oil prices. But at the same time, there are growing concerns that the advent of cheaper renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles will start making fossil fuels irrelevant sooner than many expect. Image source: Bank of America. With a market cap of $295.7 billion, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) is second to JPMorgan Chase among the most valuable U.S. banks. It's also the nation's second-biggest bank by assets as well. Unlike many of its megabank peers, Bank of America's roots aren't in New York: The company started with the founding of the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in 1904 to serve the large immigrant community in the city, which faced discrimination by other banks at the time. By the late 1920s, Bank of Italy was renamed Bank of America and Italy, and it would merge with another California-based bank named -- you guessed it -- Bank of America. Now headquartered in North Carolina, B of A was one of the banks hit hardest by the financial crisis, with two major acquisitions -- Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch -- leading to billions of dollars in losses, as well as tens of billions in fines and penalties related to Countrywide's mortgage practices. But today, Bank of America has emerged strong and profitable under the solid leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Wal-Mart stores. Even as e-commerce becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the pie, brick-and-mortar behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) remains a retail giant, with a market cap of $289.8 billion. Founded by Sam Walton in the early 1960s, Wal-Mart now operates more than 11,600 stores, it sold $486 billion in merchandise last year, and it employs 2.3 million people around the world. And don't count the discount retailer out of the retail future, either. The company has aggressively invested in growing its e-commerce business, and it's paying off. Last quarter, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales increased 50%, helping drive total sales up 4.2%. The ""death of retail"" may be grossly exaggerated, at least when it comes to Wal-Mart. Image source: Wells Fargo. The third bank to make the first half of our top 30, Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) makes the list at $279.3 billion. Founded in 1852 in San Francisco early during the gold rush, it not only offered banking services, but also express service to deliver gold and other valuables quickly. And while the modern Wells Fargo is the product -- like almost every big bank -- of numerous mergers and acquisitions over the years, its success has generally been a product of conservative management and lending practices that have kept it out of trouble during the numerous banking crises over the past 150-plus years. But that story may be changing. More recently, Wells' results have trailed its peers' as the effects of the fake accounts scandal play out. Last quarter, Wells was the only big bank to report a decline in its revenue, and it also saw earnings per share fall more than 10% from the year-ago quarter. In short, there's evidence that customers are avoiding Wells, and choosing instead to bank with its competitors. Over time, it's likely that this will change as long as the company can get its act together. But in the meantime, its tarnished reputation is hurting its bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $271.9 billion, Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B) is the second-most valuable public energy company on the U.S. market, behind only ExxonMobil. Also like ExxonMobil, Shell is an integrated supermajor, engaging in the full range of oil and gas industry businesses. But Shell is a bit different from ExxonMobil in its strategy. Following its acquisition of BG Group in 2016, management launched a strategic shift toward natural gas, where it sees greater long-term demand growth versus oil. The company has also made reducing debt -- which ballooned to over $95 billion at the peak -- and expenses a priority, as well as taking steps to increase the return on its investments. Shell has only just begun chipping away at its debt, but over the past year, profits and cash flows have surged on improved operating results, as well as higher oil prices. Shell is still exposed to many of the same risks as ExxonMobil when it comes to disruption from renewables, but that's one of the reasons management has prioritized natural gas, which produces fewer emissions and serves more industrial uses than oil. Image source: Visa. It may surprise you to know that electronic payments network giant Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), with a market cap of $249.8 billion, has only been a public company for about 10 years. Started in 1958 as part of Bank of America and called BankAmericard, it would not become a separate company until 1970, and even then, it was largely under the control of the many banks that issued BankAmericards. In 1968, it would formally change its name -- and the name of the cards issued on its network -- to Visa, but it would remain privately held until finally going public in March 2008. Visa's IPO, which was for half of the company's shares, raised $19.1 billion, making it the biggest-ever IPO at the time. Even with its massive size, Visa still has strong growth prospects. Electronic payments are only a small fraction of global transactions, but that's quickly changing as mobile computing and the global middle class converge. As a trusted name that merchants, financial institutions, and customers all count on, Visa is positioned for many more years of growth. Image source: Procter & Gamble. With a market cap of $226.8 billion, Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG) is one of the most valuable makers of branded consumer products in the world. There's a  good chance you have at least one P&G product in your home right now -- and more likely several. The company's most recognizable brands include Bounty, Crest, Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Vicks, but that's just a handful of the more than 60 brands the company makes and sells in over 180 countries. Founded in 1837, the company has spent the past 180 years developing and acquiring products that people use in their daily lives, many of which were major innovations at the time. More recently, the company has struggled to grow, having already expanded into just about every global market, and also facing stiff competition in many of its core segments. This has led management to streamline its brands and focus more intently on its most important businesses. Since 2013, the company has reduced its brand portfolio by more than half. Sales have fallen almost $15 billion since then, but earnings have improved since bottoming out in 2015. This is helping the company continue its track record of dividend growth. P&G has increased its dividend annually for 61 straight years. Image source: Anheuser-Busch Inbev. Image source: Getty Images. The biggest and most valuable telecommunications company on the U.S. market, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is worth $224 billion. When Alexander Graham Bell founded AT&T in 1885, he probably didn't have any idea how much his company would transform over the next 130 years, while also staying remarkably the same. AT&T is still the largest provider of fixed-line telephone access in the U.S., but it's also the second-largest cellphone cellphone service provider, and the largest pay-TV operator in the U.S., through its U-Verse cable and DirecTV satellite subsidiaries. The company is looking to get even bigger, with a pending acquisition for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) in the works. However, the U.S. Department of Justice is threatening to sue over the proposed acquisition, creating some uncertainty (and a lot of drama thanks to the political implications). Image source: Getty Images. The third integrated super-major on this list, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is worth $222.6 billion. The company's roots go all the way back to 1879, with the founding of Pacific Coast Oil Co. in San Francisco and developing some of the state's earliest oil discoveries in Southern California. Coast oil would be acquired by Standard Oil in 1900 and consolidate its operations and take the Standard name in 1906. In 1911, it once again became a separate company when the federal government's antitrust suit led to the breakup of Rockefeller's Standard Oil behemoth. Following decades of growth and expansion both in the U.S. and abroad, the company finally changed its name to Chevron in 1977 as part of its move to merge six domestic operations into one. Today, Chevron is solidly profitable, but its earnings and cash flows are still far below its historical levels, as it just isn't getting the same kinds of returns on its investments at recent oil prices. However, its results have improved over the past year as oil prices have risen. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $216 billion, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is the second-most valuable healthcare company and the most valuable health insurer and managed care provider in the United States. Founded in 1974 as Charter Med Incorporated, UnitedHealthCare Corporation was created in 1977 as the parent company and taken public in 1984. In the 40 years since its founding, the Minnesota-based healthcare giant has steadily grown by expanding into new markets and acquiring companies in markets it wanted to enter. It also expanded its services to include prescription management and mail-order services, among others. At last count, the company insures 49 million people, and it generated more than $50 billion in revenue and $4.1 billion in operating income in its most recent quarter. Image source: Pfizer. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is the third-most valuable healthcare company on this list, with a $215.8 billion market cap. Founded by Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in New York City in 1849, Pfizer found early success as a so-called ""fine chemicals"" maker for most of the first century of its existence. In the early 1950s, Pfizer scientists would discover and develop the antibiotic Terramycin, one of the first steps that began shifting its focus to research and development of pharmaceuticals. Over the past couple of decades, Pfizer has largely grown via acquisition of competitors including Warner-Lambert in 2000 and Wyeth in 2009, both of which have produced mixed results. Going forward, management continues to consider acquisitions to help augment its in-house R&D pipeline for new medicines. Image source: Roche. The third healthcare company in a row on this list, Switzerland-based Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY), is worth $214.5 billion. Founded in 1986 by young entrepreneur Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, Roche's roots are in the industrial manufacture of medicines. Fast-forward 130 years, and Roche is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the pharmaceutical industry, with a major pipeline of potential cancer treatments, including immunotherapies. Roche is also one of the biggest R&D spenders in the healthcare space, having spent nearly $9 billion to develop new medicines and treatments last year alone. Image source: Getty Images. With nearly 875 million subscribers on its network, China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:CHL) is easily one of the world's biggest wireless providers, and it's worth $208.9 billion. One would expect it to carry a higher value, perhaps, due to its size and potential for growth. However, China Mobile -- and its biggest competitors -- are pretty much controlled by the Chinese government, which heavily regulates the wireless market in the country. Even with that reality, China Mobile is likely to grow in value as China's middle class continues to expand and mobile use becomes more prevalent. Mobile data consumption is also likely to increase across both consumer and business customers in the coming years, and that could be a catalyst for further growth for the Chinese wireless giant. Image source: Getty Images. Founded in 1979 with the opening of two stores in metro Atlanta, Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) is worth $207 billion, only trailing Wal-Mart for U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers in market value. It's also very different from Wal-Mart and other general merchandise retailers, with many of the products it sells being highly resistant to infringement from e-commerce. This includes products like lumber, which carpenters and builders often prefer to hand select, as well as items customers want to choose in person, such as tile, flooring, paint, cabinets, fixtures, and other big-ticket items you have to live with every day. It's certainly played out that way. While many other big-box retailers struggle just to keep the doors open, Home Depot's sales have increased 6% so far this year, and earnings are on track to grow 14%. Image source: Intel. The other half of the ""Wintel"" duopoly with Microsoft that dominated personal computing for more than two decades, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was founded in 1968 and is worth $205.7 billion today, making it the the most valuable stand-alone semiconductor manufacturer in the world. Also like Microsoft, Intel has had middling success in mobile computing while remaining incredibly strong in the data centers that drive cloud computing and corporate infrastructures. However, there's some concern that the company's fortress-like competitive position in the data center could be weakening. If that proves to be true, and competitors start taking market share, that would seriously crimp Intel's future prospects. But with a half-century of successful innovation in microprocessors, and one of the biggest R&D budgets in the space, I wouldn't count Intel out just yet. Image source: Getty Images. Like Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM) is a leader in the manufacture of microprocessors, and it has a similar market value of $204.4 billion. However, it's also a very different company, since Intel designs and develops nearly all of the processors it makes, while Taiwan Semiconductor primarily contracts with so-called ""fabless"" semiconductor designers -- companies like Apple -- to manufacture chips for them. The upside is the company doesn't have to spend nearly as much on R&D -- it spent $11 billion less than Intel over the past year -- and instead focuses on high-quality, low-cost manufacturing while its customers invest in chip design. The downside? Maintaining a competitive advantage to keep those fabless chip designers coming to you for chip fabrication. It's certainly worked well for Taiwan Semiconductor, which has seen its earnings and market value grow more than 250% over the past decade, better than Intel over the same period. Image source: Verizon. With a market cap of $203.6 billion, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is the second-biggest telecommunications company in the U.S. behind AT&T. Verizon leads the U.S. wireless market with 149 million customers, and it also has one of the biggest land-line operators. The company has also increased the size of its wireline internet business in recent years and says it now has 5.8 million customers using its Fios fiber-optic internet service. But where Verizon trails AT&T is in pay-TV subscribers, a gap that's likely to grow even wider when AT&T completes its acquisition of Time Warner. Will Verizon make an acquisition of its own to narrow the gap? It's unclear, but the company is certainly investing in next-generation wireless technology, with plans to begin testing a 5G network in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Business software specialist Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is worth $202.4 billion. Like almost every other tech company that's been successful for many years, Oracle has spent decades out-innovating (or sometimes acquiring) its disruptors. In recent years, this has included a shift to subscription models for software -- something Oracle is still working through -- and now the company is facing stiff competition from the likes of Amazon and other cloud-computing providers. Going forward, Oracle may have to prove its mettle all over again in the ever-important enterprise database segment it has dominated for years. The early results offer promise, but it's in the very early innings as the company's customers -- almost 40% of the market for enterprise database software -- begin to compare in-house systems to cloud-hosted alternatives. Image source: Citigroup. With a market cap of $198.4 billion, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is the last bank in the top 30 and the fourth-most valuable bank behind JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. With over 200 million global customers and 219,000 employees, Citigroup does business in 160 countries around the world. With its roots in the founding of City Bank of New York in 1812, it underwent a series of name changes over the next 160 years before finally becoming Citibank in 1976. The current Citigroup was formed when Citicorp -- Citibank's holding company -- merged with Travelers Group in 1998. Citigroup was one of the hardest-hit banks during the subprime crisis and Great Recession, with its significant exposure to bad mortgages -- both directly through its lending and through its investment in collateralized debt obligations -- which led to substantial losses, and eventually required federal government intervention to keep the bank from failing. This intervention and investment essentially wiped out investors in the company. Even after a pretty big recovery in the past decade, Citigroup investors from right before the financial crisis are still down about 75%. On the other side of the coin, anyone savvy -- or lucky -- enough to have invested in the company in March of 2009 and held their shares has seen a fourfold return on their investment. Image source: Novartis. Another Swiss pharmaceutical company on the list, Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) rounds out the top 30 with a market cap of $198.2 billion. But unlike Roche, which was founded more than a century ago, Novartis is the result of multiple corporate mergers, though several of its legacy companies do date back to the 1800s. However, Novartis is similar to Roche in several regards. The company spent $7.9 billion on pharmaceutical research and development last year, second only to Roche in pharmaceutical R&D investment. Much of that spending is on development of biologics and immunotherapies, two of the areas of medicine with the most promise for treatments with fewer side effects and better results. With expectations that the company will file for approval of five new molecules in 2018, Novartis's R&D investments seem to be paying off. ","

24/7 Wall St.,12072017,MarketWatch,11302017,"Published: Dec 2, 2017 9:25 a.m. ET By It’s that time of year again, the time when all the top firms that we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. start to make their stock picks and prognostications for 2018. This not only gives investors a bit of a head start on year-end portfolio reshuffling, but it also gives them a look at what the overall macro thoughts for the coming year are at the big brokerages and banks. After another stellar year for the equity markets, the economy perking up, and the potential for growth the best in years, many investors are interested in the top picks for 2018 as the market has become very expensive. A new report from Merrill Lynch unveils the firm's top picks for 2018. All are good choices for growth accounts with a degree of risk tolerance, and are investment picks for the full year, as opposed to trading ideas. This large cap refining play could have big upside for 2018. Andeavor (NYSE: ANDV) is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products. The company operates seven refineries concentrated in the Western United States with throughput capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day. The company’s retail marketing system sells gasoline and diesel fuel through retail stations, as well as through third-party dealers and distributors. This segment operates a network of 2,492 retail stations under the ARCO, Shell, Exxon, Mobil, USA Gasoline, Rebel, Thrifty and Tesoro brands. The company was formerly known as Tesoro and changed its name to Andeavor in August 2017. Shareholders receive a 2.23% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $119. The Wall Street consensus price target is $122.94. The shares traded at $104.43 by the end of Friday's session. Many on Wall Street love this firm's growth potential near term and especially long term. BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK) is the largest asset manager in the world, with roughly $4.9 trillion in assets under management. Its acquisitions of Merrill Lynch Investment Management (MLIM) and iShares transformed it from a fixed income manager into a multi-product and multi-channel giant, with roughly 40% of its assets under management overseas. It has leading franchises in exchange traded funds, institutional fixed income, alternatives and cash. It also operates Solutions, a leader in risk analytics. The company’s strong historical and prospective dividend growth is underpinned by the high-quality and diversified business model. Dividends have increased 18% annually over the past 10 years.

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said it would publish new details about how climate change could affect its business in a move aimed at appeasing critics and forestalling another proxy fight next year. The largest U.S. oil and gas producer said in a filing to U.S. securities regulators that its board agreed to provide shareholders with information on “energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future.” Scientists have warned that world temperatures are likely to rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (35.6°F) this century, surpassing a “tipping point” that a global climate deal aims to avert. Exxon’s statement, which came three days before the deadline for its 2018 annual meeting resolution submissions, said additional information would be released in the near future, but did not provide details. The company’s board originally opposed providing shareholders with a report outlining the potential impact of global warming on Exxon’s long-term outlook. Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York state’s comptroller, heads one the two lead sponsors of a shareholder resolution calling for Exxon to issue a climate-impact report. He called Monday’s  decision “a win for shareholders and for the company’s ability to manage risk.” However, another sponsor noted the lack of specificity in the company’s statement. “This is giving no detail,” said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, a co-filer of last spring’s resolution. He said Exxon’s statement “needs to be expanded to assure shareowners that they’re responsive to last year’s request.” An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing. Some 50 shareholder and climate activists earlier this year  demanded the company produce an annual report on the risks to its business from extreme climate and government policies seeking to reduce carbon emissions. The resolution was backed by 62 percent of shares voted in Exxon’s May annual meeting. Other energy companies already have begun detailing their view of climate-related risks to their businesses. Refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp recently published a report, “Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,” meant partly to address suggestions from the global Financial Stability Board about how to measure and respond to such risks. Members of the shareholder group had said they were considering refiling had Exxon not agreed to a detailed plan. Big investors including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group  backed the May resolution and have made climate change a priority in their governance efforts. BlackRock and Vanguard representatives last week declined to comment on their outreach to Exxon. The report will carry weight beyond the company’s next shareholder meeting. Exxon faces investigations by the Massachusetts and New York attorneys general into whether it has misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has described the probes as politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change. The big funds would likely cast more critical votes in 2018 if Exxon did not respond adequately to the resolution, Jason Malinowski, chief investment officer for the Seattle City Employees’ Retirement System, which has about 115,000 Exxon shares, said on Friday. Malinowski’s agency and leaders of two other pension funds separately have asked Exxon director Steven Reinemund to discuss governance reforms, such as changing pay programs and bringing in directors with “climate-competent” perspectives.

""Buy and hold"" is a great axiom on Wall Street, but it can be harder to pull off than many investors expect. That's because human nature has a bad habit of giving in to the temptations of the market. But if you step back and focus on owning great companies that pay you to own them, then you increase your chances of sticking it out through good times and bad. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Hormel Foods Corp (NYSE:HRL) are two companies that you can buy today at good prices and collect  dividends while you hold them for at least the next decade. Integrated energy giant ExxonMobil's shares have fallen about 8% this year. Many of its peers are actually up. That suggests that something is wrong at Exxon, which simply isn't true. The company continues to chug along just like it always has. The best example of that is the fact that its dividend was raised again in the second quarter. Its streak of annual increases is up to 35 years -- an incredible record given the highly volatile nature of the energy business. Don't confuse the price of a stock with the value of what you're getting. Image source: Getty Images. In fact, no other major oil company has a dividend record that can match what Exxon has done. Most peers hit the pause button on dividend growth, or cut their dividends, after oil hit the skids in mid-2014. While dividends give you something to hold on to in the tough times, they aren't the entire story here. For example, Exxon continues to be toward the top of the pack when it comes to return on invested capital, a metric that tracks how well a company manages the money of its investors. But the company's astute financial stewardship goes beyond that. The balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry as well, with less leverage than its peers. That's true despite Exxon making a huge increase in its debt during the downturn to help support its capital investment plans and the dividend. But, even at the worst, long-term debt only made up about 15% of the capital structure. That's down to around 12% as of the third quarter, since recovering oil prices have allowed Exxon to start paring its debt levels. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. But here's the best part: Exxon's yield is a pleasing 3.7% today. And it's trading near its lowest price to tangible book value in a decade. So now looks like a good time to step aboard what remains one of the best-run companies in the energy industry. Next up is protein-focused Hormel, a food company that's probably best known for making Spam. But don't let that iconic name fool you, Hormel does a lot more than make potted meat. Its business spans the retail sector (roughly 65% of sales), the food service space (27%), and increasingly, foreign markets (5%). And it has the No. 1 or 2 position in 35 grocery categories across the entire store. Hormel makes more products than you might think. Image source: Hormel Foods Corp. Hormel's dividend, meanwhile, has been increased annually for over 50 consecutive years. That's a record that few public companies can match, let alone Hormel's direct peers. The stock has rebounded lately, but it's still down around 15% from its early 2016 highs. The yield is around 2%, which is toward the high end of its historical range. Concerns about shifting consumer preferences are largely to blame for the stock's troubles -- but that's an industrywide issue (Hormel's sales were down 4% in fiscal 2017). Hormel, however, is taking significant steps to keep up with the changes. Over the last few years it has sold assets that weren't living up to growth expectations (like its salt business) and bought ones that have brighter futures or complement its existing assets. The list here includes the acquisitions of Wholly Guacamole, Skippy Peanut Butter, and Columbus in the retail segment; Fontanini in the food service space; and Ceratti to expand its business into South America. It recently completed a major facility expansion in China, as well. This is not a company that's sitting still. And it has a track record of success, highlighted by that incredible dividend streak. Over the near term I would expect lingering weakness in sales and for debt levels to move higher because of the recent acquisition activity. But if you can handle that near-term uncertainty, this Dividend Aristocrat looks like it's trading at a fair price today. There's no question that Exxon and Hormel are facing headwinds, but both are managing them well -- just like they always have. Their impressive dividend streaks are all the proof you need of that. And while the stocks are down, that's actually an opportunity here for you to pick up great companies that you can own for at least the next decade. Focus on collecting all of those quarterly dividend checks (or reinvesting them) while everyone else worries about the gyrations of the market that don't change the fundamental stories for these stocks..

  "
24/7 Wall St.,12142017,MarketWatch,12072017,"Published: Dec 8, 2017 7:45 a.m. ET By Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) has been a serious Dow Jones Industrial Average laggard in 2017. The fall from grace has been monumental considering that Exxon has a market value of close to $350 billion and that it is one of the top oil and gas players in the world. It is the largest in the United States by far, and investors need to be considering how they should evaluate the company ahead. 24/7 Wall St. has recently conducted preliminary 2018 reviews for what to expect ahead. Exxon was one of five surprise Dow winners for 2018. With its shares trading at $82.50, Exxon's consensus analyst target price of $84.68 does not exactly scream ""Buy me, please!"" But if you add in Exxon’s 3.7% dividend, the implied total return forecast for the coming 12 months would only be about 6%. Investing in oil comes with many risks. The obvious one is the debate over climate change. And regardless of that debate, the trends toward higher electric and hybrid vehicle use are expected to grow more each year in the future. And nations like China and the United Kingdom have pledged to reach the end of the combustion engine out in 2040 or so. Exxon shares have been range-bound for years, and the bulk of the past five years has seen a range of $80 to $90. There are no assurances that Exxon will emerge as a top performing Dow stock in 2018. It could even trade lower, particularly if oil prices begin to head lower again. But what if all the caution and concerns can be overcome? Most investors ended up being disappointed after Exxon spent $31 billion for its acquisition of XTO Energy. This gave Exxon a deep footing into natural gas, and natural gas development has finally been coming back after years of stagnation. That has not yet been a positive for Exxon in general, even in 2017. But that may be close to a change. Natural gas production is now forecast to continue growing in the United States in 2018, led by strong export demand and utilities. This non-event valuation for XTO of the $31 billion purchase price is almost 10% of the company's entire total value. What if natural gas finally becomes a big contributor for Exxon in the years ahead? Exxon's energy outlook out to 2040 shows rising natural gas demand. The firm projected that liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports around the globe will increase by 170% from current levels by 2040. And the United States is expected to lead the share of that growth with a 30% share. Also worth noting as a development ahead is that Exxon is set to merge its refining and marketing companies into ExxonMobil Fuels &amp; Lubricants Company. That move is planned for the first quarter of 2018. 24/7 Wall St. looked over the most recent analyst calls on Exxon. it is interesting that the consensus price target of analysts from Thomson Reuters has risen of late. The current $84.68 consensus target price was up from $84.00 a month earlier and from just under $83 two months ago. That might not sound very aggressive by today's bull market standards, but when analysts start raising their price targets then that consensus estimate tends to keep rising until something changes in the overall picture. Still, Exxon has undershot its 2017 Bull/Bear Outlook. The current street-high price target for Exxon is $100. In an effort to show both sides of the coin, we have included recent analyst calls that show positive views and cautious views on Exxon. Barclays kept its price target on Exxon north of $90. The firm noted that, after a long absence from Brazil, Exxon has plunged back in and recently won 12 exploration blocks of about 2 million gross acres in September. It and Petrobras were the biggest winners. Merrill Lynch still has a Buy rating and $94 price objective. The firm's assumption assumes long-term Brent at $53 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate at $55 per barrel. In November, RBC Capital Markets lowered Exxon's target price to $85 from $90. The firm noted that the dividend may be attractive versus the market, but it argued that this is not the full picture. RBC noted that cash flow generation has been resilient but peers have seen the same. The upside risk for capital spending also was shown to be a risk to future stock buybacks. Societe Generale issued its report on Exxon after the most recent earnings report with a Buy rating and a $95 price target. While that target had been handily over $100 in years past, the firm believes that Wall Street is not giving it a fair value for the Permian and Bakken, operating and lease captures, and technical capabilities. The downstream and chemicals business was also highlighted as a positive. Early in November, HSBC lowered Exxon to Reduce from Hold. The firm favored rival Shell in its call. While CFRA (S&amp;P) only has a Hold rating, the firm noted that it sees operating earnings of $3.53 per share in 2017, improving to $3.64 in 2018. These estimates compare with 2016 operating earnings of $2.36 per share. Another caveat in evaluating Exxon and any other large integrated oil and gas companies in 2018 is something taking place a few thousand miles away. The huge Saudi Aramco IPO will bring a lot of attention, and if it is really going to be valued at $1 trillion or more, then some oil and gas investors may decide to use at least a portion of their other oil and gas stock bets as a source of funds. Again, there are no assurances that Exxon (and other oil and gas giants) will do well in 2018. But considering that its stock has been range-bound for so long and that the current consensus target is rising, some investors might want to take a closer look here. Exxon Mobil shares have a 52-week trading range of $76.05 to $93.22. ",How Exxon Mobil Could Return as a Top Dow Stock in 2018 - MarketWatch

Examples of biofuels include ethanol (often made from corn in the United States and sugarcane in Brazil), biodiesel (vegetable oils and liquid animal fats), green diesel (derived from algae and other plant sources) and biogas (methane derived from animal manure and other digested organic material). Biofuels are most useful in liquid or gas form because they are easier to transport, deliver and burn cleanly. Many in the energy industry view biofuel as vitally important to future energy production because of its clean and renewable properties. Ironically, most of the major oil companies are investing millions of dollars in advanced biofuel research. America's largest oil company, ExxonMobil, says they are funding a broad portfolio of biofuels research programs including ongoing efforts on algae as well as programs on converting alternative, non-food-based biomass feedstocks, i.e., cellulosic biomass, to advanced biofuels. They warn, however, that fundamental technology improvements and scientific breakthroughs are still necessary in both biomass optimization and the processing of biomass into viable fuels. (For more, read The Biofuels Debate Heats Up.) Individuals concerned about energy security and carbon dioxide emissions see biofuels as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. However, biofuels also have shortcomings. For example, it takes more ethanol than gasoline to produce the same amount of energy, and critics contend that ethanol use is extremely wasteful because the production of ethanol actually creates a net energy loss while also increasing food prices. Biofuels have also become a point of contention for conservation groups that argue bio-crops would go to better use as a source of food rather than fuel. Specific concerns center around the use of large amounts of arable land that are required to produce bio-crops, leading to problems such as soil erosion, deforestation, fertilizer run-off and salinity. To help mitigate the problem of large arable land use, companies like ExxonMobil are turning to water-based solutions in the form of algae production. Exxon claims that algae can be cultivated on land unsuitable for other purposes with water that can’t be used for food production. In addition to using non-arable land and not requiring the use of fresh water, algae could potentially yield greater volumes of biofuels per acre than other sources. The other advantage to using algae over other bio-sources is that the algae can be used to manufacture biofuels similar in composition to today’s transportation fuels. This would go a long way to replacing the conventional fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel used today. ",Biofuel

Rebecca Ungarino,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"A handful of names in this year's so-called dogs of the Dow collection strike some strategists as buys. The classic investment strategy works like this: investors ought to buy the 10 Dow stocks carrying the highest dividend yields, and hold on to them for one year. High dividend yields traditionally point to falling prices, thus the ""dog"" moniker. This year, the names topping the list are Verizon, IBM, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Pfizer; Merck, Coca-Cola, Cisco, Procter & Gamble and General Electric finish off the list. Notably, shares of GE have fallen more than 40 percent this year, and its dividend sits at 2.7 percent. At this juncture, Chevron and Exxon Mobil are attractive picks to David Seaburg of Cowen. ""I'm not saying rotate in massively, but I do think ... you're going to start to see some generalist money flow in there, which could keep those names elevated or actually help them work out. Good dividend, solid cash flow; those are two names that I would probably take a swing at,"" Seaburg said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Chevron has risen nearly 3 percent year to date, vastly underperforming the broader market. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil has fallen 8 percent in the same period. Procter & Gamble, which boasts a dividend yield of 3 percent, is one attractive ""dog,"" said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. ""Not only has this been a dog of the Dow this year, but it's been underperforming for two years in a row,"" Maley said Tuesday on ""Trading Nation."" Indeed, while the S&P 500 has climbed nearly 20 percent this year, Procter & Gamble has risen 9 percent. ""On a technical basis, the stock is getting back up to its $194, $195 level. That's kind of its double-top from late 2014 and earlier this year. If that can break above that level, that's going to be very positive on a technical basis,"" he said. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. Social stocks have gotten slammed, but one has survived the social media meltdown: Twitter. The charts could be setting up for an even bigger pop for the social network. The bears devoured the Apple trade this week, but one technician isn't sweating the sell-off. Should you buy the dip? Some say that's no longer the viable strategy it once was. Wells Fargo's Pravit Chintawongvanich says investors can't assume buying every dip will pay off. Small-cap stocks just entered the dreaded death cross, a technical development that traditionally suggests weakness ahead for an asset. And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market. Apple shares just dipped into bear market territory. “I don’t think that we’ll see a recovery before the end of 2018,” according to tech investor Paul Meeks. Social stocks are in a slump, but one is flying above the rest: Twitter. Bill Baruch of Blue Line Futures and Michael Bapis of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management discuss whether the stock is a social safety trade. Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global says a North Korean attack, should one occur, isn't likely to cause significant long-term market impact.

"Tyler Crowe, Sean O'Reilly, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Here's something crazy to consider. In 2017, the average price per barrel of Brent crude oil -- the international benchmark price -- is up more than 15%. At the same time, though, the oil and gas industry as a whole is one of the worst-performing sectors this year. If that sounds odd to you, you aren't the only one. While there are some reasons this may be the case -- domestic crude prices are only up 6% over the same time frame -- it is still hard to imagine that the industry as a whole would suffer when the price of its most precious commodity has risen so much. With this in mind, it seems like it's a good time for investors to start digging into the oil and gas industry for possible stock ideas. So, we asked three of our investing contributors which stocks they like right now. Here's why they picked Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and Transocean (NYSE:RIG). Image source: Getty Images. Sean O'Reilly (Diamondback Energy): What a difference a year makes. Last Thanksgiving, OPEC finally relented and cut production in an attempt to balance the oil market. The cartel even moved to extend production cuts through the end of 2018. This landmark reversal, made in partnership with Russia, marks a tectonic shift. The sun may be about to shine on the oil industry once again. And that makes hyperefficient oil companies like Diamondback Energy compelling investments today. Diamondback is one of the major players in the Permian Basin of West Texas. This particularly fertile geologic basin has been a favorite of the oil industry. Its proximity to the Port of Houston, and its bountiful, low-cost reserves, make it ""ground zero"" of the shale revolution. Diamondback is not only one of the most prominent owners of oil leases there, but is one of the lowest-cost producers. Over the past three years, Diamondback has cut its cash operating expenses per barrel of production by over 35%. On average, it can now produce a barrel of oil for less than $9. Diamondback Energy will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of an oil rebound. While many have been selling assets and cutting costs to survive, Diamondback has used the past four years to expand. It has done so by buying up assets and focusing on reducing costs; Diamondback could not have managed the energy downturn of the last four years any better. With its stock at just 18 times forward earnings estimates, and with industry-leading efficiency, Diamondback Energy is a fantastic oil stock to buy this December. Reuben Gregg Brewer (ExxonMobil Corporation): Shares of integrated energy giant Exxon are down around 7% so far this year. Many of its peers, on the other hand, are up for the year, some in the low double digits. But it's not like Exxon is suddenly struggling. In fact, it's doing just fine, with third-quarter earnings of $0.93 a share. But that's really par for the course; while many of Exxon's competitors were bleeding red ink during the oil downturn, this industry giant remained in the black. Now that oil prices have risen from their lows to above the $50-per-barrel level, Exxon looks like it's being left behind. However, there have been no material fundamental changes at the company, and investors seem to be overlooking growth opportunities like its efforts in the Permian Basin and offshore Guyana. In fact, at this point, Exxon is trading near its lowest ratio of price to tangible net worth in roughly a decade. Meanwhile, Exxon was one of the few oil companies to manage through the energy downturn with its streak of annual dividend increases intact (it's now up to 35 years). It also maintains one of the least leveraged balance sheets, with long-term debt at just 12% (or so) of the capital structure. And while peers are starting to close the gap with regard to return on invested capital, it's still at the high end of the group. Exxon looks cheap today, but I don't expect that to last as investors realize that this industry stalwart continues to perform at the top of its game. Brent Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts. Tyler Crowe (Transocean): Even though the oil and gas industry has been slowly recovering over the past year or so, much of the recovery has happened in North American shale. At current prices, companies can at least break even, and in some cases make a respectable return. This has spurred an uptick in spending for land drilling, and all the associated services and equipment for this particular part of the market. Outside land drilling, there hasn't been much progress. Even though some companies are learning how to develop offshore sources for less money and faster than ever before, offshore fields still tie up lots of capital over several years -- money that could go to projects that can return capital much faster. As much as this trend has held for a few years, chances are it won't last forever. The North American shale industry can't singlehandedly offset global production decline and underinvestment. Eventually, producers will find a price range where spending on offshore developments is once again lucrative. When that time comes, Transocean will be one of the companies producers turn to for an offshore drilling rig. Throughout this downturn in offshore activity, the company has undertaken an incredible fleet turnover program to shed itself of older, less capable rigs. As a result, a vast majority of Transocean's fleet is designed to handle either the deepest drilling waters or the harsh environments of the North Sea and Arctic regions. These rigs command higher service rates and higher margins, and Transocean has a lot of them ready to deploy --and the balance sheet to ride out the middle to late innings of this industry downturn. What makes Transocean's stock so compelling is the fact that it trades so cheap. At a price-to-tangible-book-value ratio of only 0.3, the market is pricing shares for pennies on the dollar of its underlying assets. Wall Street's fear here is that the anticipated recovery may never materialize. That isn't inconceivable, but the possible returns that would come from a recovery make this a high-reward stock worth a deeper dive. ","
      
    3 Top Oil Stocks to Buy in December -- The Motley Fool

Reuben Gregg Brewer,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ""Buy and hold"" is a great axiom on Wall Street, but it can be harder to pull off than many investors expect. That's because human nature has a bad habit of giving in to the temptations of the market. But if you step back and focus on owning great companies that pay you to own them, then you increase your chances of sticking it out through good times and bad. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Hormel Foods Corp (NYSE:HRL) are two companies that you can buy today at good prices and collect  dividends while you hold them for at least the next decade. Integrated energy giant ExxonMobil's shares have fallen about 8% this year. Many of its peers are actually up. That suggests that something is wrong at Exxon, which simply isn't true. The company continues to chug along just like it always has. The best example of that is the fact that its dividend was raised again in the second quarter. Its streak of annual increases is up to 35 years -- an incredible record given the highly volatile nature of the energy business. Don't confuse the price of a stock with the value of what you're getting. Image source: Getty Images. In fact, no other major oil company has a dividend record that can match what Exxon has done. Most peers hit the pause button on dividend growth, or cut their dividends, after oil hit the skids in mid-2014. While dividends give you something to hold on to in the tough times, they aren't the entire story here. For example, Exxon continues to be toward the top of the pack when it comes to return on invested capital, a metric that tracks how well a company manages the money of its investors. But the company's astute financial stewardship goes beyond that. The balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry as well, with less leverage than its peers. That's true despite Exxon making a huge increase in its debt during the downturn to help support its capital investment plans and the dividend. But, even at the worst, long-term debt only made up about 15% of the capital structure. That's down to around 12% as of the third quarter, since recovering oil prices have allowed Exxon to start paring its debt levels. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. But here's the best part: Exxon's yield is a pleasing 3.7% today. And it's trading near its lowest price to tangible book value in a decade. So now looks like a good time to step aboard what remains one of the best-run companies in the energy industry. Next up is protein-focused Hormel, a food company that's probably best known for making Spam. But don't let that iconic name fool you, Hormel does a lot more than make potted meat. Its business spans the retail sector (roughly 65% of sales), the food service space (27%), and increasingly, foreign markets (5%). And it has the No. 1 or 2 position in 35 grocery categories across the entire store. Hormel makes more products than you might think. Image source: Hormel Foods Corp. Hormel's dividend, meanwhile, has been increased annually for over 50 consecutive years. That's a record that few public companies can match, let alone Hormel's direct peers. The stock has rebounded lately, but it's still down around 15% from its early 2016 highs. The yield is around 2%, which is toward the high end of its historical range. Concerns about shifting consumer preferences are largely to blame for the stock's troubles -- but that's an industrywide issue (Hormel's sales were down 4% in fiscal 2017). Hormel, however, is taking significant steps to keep up with the changes. Over the last few years it has sold assets that weren't living up to growth expectations (like its salt business) and bought ones that have brighter futures or complement its existing assets. The list here includes the acquisitions of Wholly Guacamole, Skippy Peanut Butter, and Columbus in the retail segment; Fontanini in the food service space; and Ceratti to expand its business into South America. It recently completed a major facility expansion in China, as well. This is not a company that's sitting still. And it has a track record of success, highlighted by that incredible dividend streak. Over the near term I would expect lingering weakness in sales and for debt levels to move higher because of the recent acquisition activity. But if you can handle that near-term uncertainty, this Dividend Aristocrat looks like it's trading at a fair price today. There's no question that Exxon and Hormel are facing headwinds, but both are managing them well -- just like they always have. Their impressive dividend streaks are all the proof you need of that. And while the stocks are down, that's actually an opportunity here for you to pick up great companies that you can own for at least the next decade. Focus on collecting all of those quarterly dividend checks (or reinvesting them) while everyone else worries about the gyrations of the market that don't change the fundamental stories for these stocks..

A year ago, many energy-industry analysts and market gurus expected 2017 to be a year of massive gains for energy stocks amid an oil recovery. It didn’t turn out that way, as the price stalled in March and then again in May and June: The four-year chart gives a broad perspective: This chart shows oil price changes and the total return for the S&P 1500 energy sector over the past 12 months: On Aug. 22, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said in his daily energy report that “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply” because of OPEC’s production cuts and “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed a surprising increase in gasoline prices, along with an expected decline in U.S. oil supplies. After expressing doubt that U.S. gasoline supplies jumped during the Thanksgiving holiday break, Flynn said on Wednesday that “it is very disturbing that week after week we have to continue to question the accuracy of these weekly figures.” So we may once again be in for some volatility, and can expect the EIA to release revised figures.

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"NEW YORK/TEPIC, Mexico (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Lawyers and advocates stepped up the fight against climate change this year by pursuing a rising number of legal cases around the world that aim to test the limits of national laws. Climate change cases numbered nearly 900 in 24 nations as of March, according to a survey by UN Environment and Columbia Law School, marking a steady increase in lawsuits filed to hold governments and companies to account over carbon pollution. They include a handful of milestone suits that charge violations of various states’ constitutions. Here are five cases whose outcomes, some expected in the coming year, could reshape the roles and responsibilities of governments and businesses in tackling climate change: - URGENDA FOUNDATION V. KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS (NETHERLANDS) This landmark case energized the climate movement in 2015 when a district court sided with the nearly 900 Dutch citizens behind it, ordering their government to cut greenhouse has emissions faster. It was “one of the most important climate change decisions ever issued”, said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law in New York. But the outcome is now being appealed and a decision could be handed down as early as 2018, said Gerrard. The Urgenda ruling remains the only one of its kind globally to declare a government’s obligation to control climate change. It did so by citing the Dutch constitution, prompting a flurry of similar complaints worldwide where plaintiffs are trying to enlist their nations’ founding principles to curb global warming. - JULIANA V. UNITED STATES (UNITED STATES) Trial in this federal suit filed by a group of 21 U.S. teenagers could begin in February 2018. Building on the precedent established by the Urgenda case, the young people from Oregon charge their government’s climate policy is inadequate and flouts their constitutional right to live in a habitable atmosphere. The case is currently stalled amid efforts by the U.S. government - fearful it will lead to a constitutional crisis - to prevent it going forward. “It’s clearly a case to watch,” said Sean Hecht, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA in California. “It would be extraordinary for a judge to take the step of holding the U.S. government responsible for this, but it’s not unthinkable,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. - LLIUYA V. RWE (GERMANY) A Peruvian farmer, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, is seeking $20,000 in damages from a large German energy utility based half-way around the world. Lliuya argues that RWE AG holds some responsibility - by emitting planet-warming gases - for the melting of glaciers and rising water level of a lake near his Andean town. Observers are calling the Lliuya suit, which is due to hear evidence in 2018, a test case of whether a company can be held financially liable for its contribution to the effects of climate change in other parts of the world. - EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION V. MAURA TRACY HEALEY (UNITED STATES) Exxon Mobil is battling attorney generals in Massachusetts and New York who are investigating the oil giant, after news reports charged in 2015 that its own scientists had found cutting fossil fuel use was needed to slow down climate change. Exxon’s case against Massachusetts’ attorney general Maura Healey and a similar one against her New York counterpart seek to derail subpoenas to obtain the company’s internal documents on climate science. “There’s a lot at stake because these companies are very concerned about potential liability,” said UCLA’s Hecht. - GREENPEACE NORDIC V. GOVERNMENT OF NORWAY (NORWAY) In another case rooted in a constitutional argument, this lawsuit charges that Norway violated the country’s constitution by letting energy firms explore for oil and gas in the Arctic Barents Sea. With a judgment expected in January, a win by Greenpeace would “re-energize similar litigations in other countries”, said Columbia Law School’s Gerrard.

Trump concluded the tweet saying: ""This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas!""

Sixteen companies, including Amazon, declined to comment. Below is a table of all the companies CNBC contacted in light of the tax bill clearing Congress. It also includes companies that announced plans to raise wages or give bonuses to employees in light of the tax plan passing.

Sean Williams,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It may be hard to believe, but it's the truth: Cryptocurrencies are considerably closer to hitting $1 trillion in total value than $100 billion in value. When the year began, the combined market cap of all virtual currencies was just $17.7 billion, and bitcoin made up nearly 88% of that total. However, as of Dec. 20, the aggregate market cap of the better than 1,360 digital currencies had soared to $635 billion, representing a year-to-date increase of almost 3,500%, and bitcoin's contribution was less than 50%. By comparison, the stock market historically gains about 7% a year, inclusive of dividend reinvestment and adjusted for inflation. Cryptocurrencies have simply whupped traditional equities in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Why such bullishness, you ask? A number of catalysts have played a role in pushing virtual currencies higher. For example, the emergence of blockchain is creating a lot of buzz on Wall Street. Blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that records all transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank. Think of it as the infrastructure that underlies digital currencies like bitcoin. Blockchain has the potential to speed up transaction settlement times, reduce transaction fees, and could be considerably more secure than current databases, just to name a few advantages. Dollar weakness has also been helpful, especially to bitcoin. A falling dollar is great news for U.S. exporters, but it's not such positive news for investors holding cash. These investors will often seek the safety of gold as a store of value, given gold's scarcity and use as a currency for more than 2,700 years. Yet some cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, have protocols that limit the number of coins that can be mined. This creates the perception of scarcity, which has pushed some investors to choose bitcoin, or other cryptos, over traditional commodities, like gold. Emotions are clearly playing a role, too. The fear of missing out, or ""FOMO,"" and watching everyone else make money has coerced both novice and experienced investors into buying cryptocurrencies. Image source: Getty Images. As you might imagine, the buzz is almost always about bitcoin -- and with good reason. It comprises nearly 46% of the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap, is the most popular virtual coin in the world, was the first tradable digital currency, and is accepted by more merchants relative to any other cryptocurrency. Yet, if you ask this investor, it's pretty far down the list of cryptocurrencies worth considering for purchase. Bitcoin, and Litecoin, for that matter, are laser-focused on growing their partnerships with merchants, and have largely ignored the enterprise-based application of their blockchains. While there's value to be had as a means of money transmittance, I personally believe that blockchain is where the bigger long-term opportunity lies. As such, I believe the following three cryptocurrencies may be worth buying over bitcoin. Image source: Getty Images. There's a good reason why Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap: It has a really popular blockchain. Formed earlier this year, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is comprised of 200 organizations that are currently testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain in demo, pilot, and small-scale projects. These testers include governments, financial-service companies (which are expected to be the biggest benefactor of blockchain technology), and tech and energy companies. What makes Ethereum really stand out is its incorporation of smart contracts, which help facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation of a contract. While Ethereum's blockchain is somewhat similar to that of bitcoin, these smart contract protocols allow it to move beyond currency-only applications. Its blockchain could be used to store information about an application, or can function as a multi-signature account that allows money to be spent when a certain percentage of people agree. Or in the case of integrated oil and gas giant BP (NYSE:BP), it could speed up transaction settlement times to improve energy futures trading efficiency. The one knock on Ethereum is that its coin, Ether, is almost exclusively used to cover transaction fees and doesn't have a clear path, like bitcoin, to being accepted by merchants. Again, I believe the smarter path for the Ethereum Foundation is to focus on blockchain, which is what they're doing, but it's unclear how exactly the Ether coin ties into its future. Image source: Getty Images. Another cryptocurrency that's been very impressive of late is Ripple. Its token, the XRP, has galloped higher by more than 12,000% since the year began. As with Ethereum, the buzz here is all about the company's blockchain technology. But unlike Ethereum, which is partnering with a number of industries, Ripple is focused on becoming the go-to blockchain for the financial-services industry. The company's blockchain offers the ability to rapidly proof payments and transactions, which could drastically improve the time it takes for settlement. In particular, Ripple's blockchain may offer the potential for instantaneous cross-border payments and transactions. In June 2016, Ripple announced that four major banks were testing out its distributed ledger technology in some small capacity: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, UBS, Banco Santander (NYSE:SAN), and Unicredit. But it wasn't until Nov. 2017 that Ripple really put itself on the radar. American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Banco Santander announced that they were partnering to test Ripple's blockchain in non-card cross-border payments across AmEx's FX International Payment network to U.K. Santander accounts. These payments are expected to process instantly. What's more, it looks like the XRP is going to play a vital role in the growth of Ripple's blockchain. In particular, it could be used as an intermediary in cross-border transactions that allows for one currency, say Japanese yen, to be exchanged to another currency, like the euro, instantly. Ripple is certainly worth keeping a close eye on, and it looks to be far more intriguing than bitcoin. Image source: Getty Images. Sticking with the theme that blockchain is king, one under-the-radar cryptocurrency you should be following is Stellar (formerly Stellar Lumens), and its coin, the XLM. This is a virtual currency that holds true to its name, as the XLM has been ""stellar"" this year with a 10,400% year-to-date gain. Stellar's focus is similar to that of Ripple: building financial products for transactions around the globe. In other words, it's targeting enterprise clients with high volumes of cross-border transactions. But whereas Ripple is sinking its teeth into big banks and financial-service companies, Stellar is looking at servicing multinational corporations that conduct billions in revenue outside of their home country. Stellar's blockchain suggests that cross-border payments could settle in just two-to-five seconds. What's more, Stellar also incorporates smart contract protocols into its blockchain. Though they aren't exactly the same as Ethereum's, they nonetheless are an attractive addition for enterprise customers. In October, Stellar announced a partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) and KlickEx to facilitate quicker cross-border transactions. IBM generates tens of billions of dollars from global clients, signaling that this could be Stellar's opportunity to prove the value of its blockchain to other multinationals. Currently, a dozen banks in the South Pacific region are deploying this project, with IBM expected to scale the project beyond this region if it's successful. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the word ""consider"" is paramount with all three of these cryptocurrencies. While this investor views them as far more intriguing over the long run than bitcoin, I wouldn't suggest chasing these valuations at this time. The risks in cryptocurrencies are aplenty, and it wouldn't take much for this bubble to burst. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"CHENNAI, India (Reuters) - One of India’s most popular politicians, Jayalalithaa Jayaraman, died on Monday following a massive cardiac arrest, setting off an outpouring of grief among thousands of supporters gathered outside. Her political party and the hospital where she was being treated confirmed the popular former film actress and chief minister of Tamil Nadu, widely known as “Amma” or “Mother”, had died at the age of 68. “Our beloved leader, The Iron Lady of India ... is no more,” tweeted her AIADMK party, the third-largest party in Lok Sabha. Her death deprived her regional ruling party of its only charismatic leader, whose portrait adorned placards and posters around her home state and who was tipped as a possible future Indian prime minister. Jayalalithaa had gone into cardiac arrest on Sunday night, the Apollo Hospital in Chennai said, following her admission with fever and dehydration in September. Despite being resuscitated and put on life support, “her underlying conditions rendered her unable to recover and she passed away at 11:30 p.m.”, the hospital said in a statement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the tributes, tweeting that Jayalalithaa’s death had left a huge void in Indian politics. “Jayalalithaa ji’s connect with the citizens, concern for welfare of the poor, the women and marginalized will always be a source of inspiration,” Modi said. The news of her death was met with howls of grief and tears from the crowd of supporters outside the hospital. Rumours earlier in the evening that she had died, which proved to be false, led to brief unrest. About 2,000 policemen were deployed around the hospital in case crowds of devoted supporters reacted strongly to Jayalalithaa’s death. Supporters have been known to commit suicide in reaction to bad news. “Nothing can kill Amma,” said one man holding a picture of the leader outside the hospital earlier as doctors battled to save her life. Aloof and powerful, Jayalalithaa had a cult following among the people of Tamil Nadu that endured even though she went to jail for corruption more than once. She began a film career at 16 and rose to stardom with dozens of hit Tamil films, often with her screen partner M.G. Ramachandran, an actor-turned politician who then served three terms as chief minister of Tamil Nadu state. With voters ready to confer god-like status on their matinee idols, she also went into politics and trumped her mentor by serving five times as head of the state government. Jayalalithaa leaves behind a legacy of populist schemes, including giving away free cellphones, laptops and kitchen grinders that endeared her to millions of voters. She also drew foreign investors to India’s second largest state economy. Auto giants Ford Motor, Daimler, Hyundai and Nissan have operations in Chennai as has U.S.-listed outsourcing firm Cognizant . Her death opens up a leadership vacuum in her AIADMK party, which she ran with an iron hand without a designated successor. During her latest illness, her picture was put in a chair at the head of the table at state cabinet meetings. O.P. Panneerselvam, a cabinet colleague, has stood in for Jayalalithaa in the past, but he has repeatedly made it clear he was not replacing her. He pointedly refused to take her place at the head of the cabinet table while she was ill. “There is no second line of defence here, and these are emotive times. There is a chance of violence,” said T.R. Ramachandran, an independent expert on Tamil Nadu politics. The AIADMK and its bitter rival, the DMK party, are the main political groupings in Tamil Nadu. Both are built around a personality cult of their leaders, both of whom are drawn from the Tamil film industry. India’s two national parties, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Congress, have little political presence in the state, despite decades of efforts. The death of Jayalalithaa’s mentor Ramachandran, or MGR as he was known, sparked looting and rioting across Tamil Nadu by his grief-stricken supporters in 1987. The U.S. consulate in Chennai asked American citizens to avoid areas where demonstrations were happening and be vigilant because of the chance of violence. “U.S. citizens are reminded that even gatherings intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence,” the consulate said in a notice posted on its website.

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The death toll rose to 36 on Monday from a blaze that engulfed a converted warehouse during a dance party in Oakland, California, the greatest loss of life from a U.S. fire in over a decade, as searchers sifted charred ruins being treated as a crime scene. Authorities said they were certain to find more bodies in the gutted building and were still trying to account for about 50 people reported missing by loved ones, while ruling out any drastic climb in the tally of deaths. “If you have a best friend out there, please hug your best friend,” Franchesca Dickerson, a 21-year old hairdresser, told a candlelight vigil, as she held a collage of images of a friend who died in the blaze. “I’d give 50,000 years to hug mine,” added Dickerson, who was to have joined her childhood friend, 19-year old Michalea Gregory, at the party, but changed plans because of work. The cause of the fire, which erupted late on Friday in a sprawling two-story building leased to an artists’ collective, has yet to be determined. Officials have said arson was not immediately suspected. But charges ranging from involuntary manslaughter to murder could feature in a potential criminal case, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley told a news conference. Possible safety violations were expected to be one aspect of the investigation, with city officials having said the site was already under investigation for reports of illegal construction. Investigators from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives identified an “area of interest” on the ground floor that was still out of reach, said Sergeant Ray Kelly, a spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. He described the spot as being at the rear of the warehouse, where makeshift studios and cubicles were clustered. O’Malley said fire investigators and a task force from her office were working with recovery teams inside the wreckage to preserve any potential criminal evidence as they seek signs of victims and clues to the origin of the blaze. Debris was being removed “bucket by bucket,” said Deputy Fire Chief Darren White, but a large construction crane at the scene required nearby electricity lines to be shut down for several hours, as a precaution. The nature of the fire has raised questions about possible building code violations. City officials have said the warehouse, known as the Ghost Ship, was already under scrutiny, with an inspector having visited on Nov. 17. Municipal authorities also cited reports of people living in the structure, although it was barred to residential use. Some of those who entered the warehouse called it a potential fire trap. The first floor, housing an artist cooperative, the Satya Yuga Collective, was a warren of partitioned studio spaces and rooms crammed with furniture, musical instruments and rugs, according to survivors, city officials and photographs posted on social media before the fire. Two recreational vehicles believed to have been used as living quarters and work space were found parked on the ground floor inside, Kelly said. The dance party was held on the second floor, which partially collapsed when the roof gave way. Survivors said flames spread quickly and billowing thick, black smoke blinded and choked those struggling to flee. The 10,000-square-foot (929-sq-m) building lacked sprinklers or smoke detectors, and wooden pallets partially formed a makeshift stairway between first and second floors, officials said. It had just two exterior doorways. The recovery of three more bodies took the confirmed death count to 36, making the blaze the deadliest in the United States since 100 people perished in a 2003 nightclub fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island. “We absolutely believe that the number of fire fatalities will increase,” Oakland Fire Battalion Chief Melinda Drayton told reporters. But Sheriff Gregory Ahern later said he was “not anticipating any more huge numbers” of victims. By Monday afternoon, 33 of the dead had been identified and authorities were notifying families, said Ahern, adding that three victims were from Finland, South Korea and Guatemala. Most victims had been in their 20s and 30s, but some were younger, officials said. The site was known as a “safeplace” haven for young members of the city’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, Kelly said. With many bodies burned beyond recognition, families were asked to preserve items that might contain DNA to help identification. Kelly said some people died of smoke inhalation. Officials were unsure of the numbers present when the fire erupted. One survivor has estimated them at 60 to 70. The warehouse was one of many converted lofts on the east end of San Francisco Bay in Oakland’s Fruitvale neighborhood, a mostly Latino district where rents are typically lower than elsewhere. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"LOS ANGELES/HONOLULU (Reuters) - It has been 75 years but U.S. Navy veteran James Leavelle can still recall watching with horror as Japanese warplanes rained bombs on his fellow sailors in the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor that plunged the United States into World War Two. Bullets bounced off the steel deck of his own ship, the Whitney, anchored just outside Honolulu harbor, but a worse fate befell those aboard the Arizona, Oklahoma, Utah and other U.S. ships that sank or capsized in the attack that killed 2,400 people. “The way the Japanese planes were coming in, when they dropped bombs, they’d drop them and then circle back,” said Leavelle, a 21-year-old Navy Storekeeper Second Class at the time of the attack. Leavelle, now 96, was among 30 Pearl Harbor survivors honored at a reception in Los Angeles before heading to Honolulu to mark Wednesday’s 75th anniversary of the attack. The bombing of Pearl Harbor took place at 7:55 a.m. Honolulu time on Dec. 7, 1941, famously dubbed “a date which will live in infamy” by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Fewer than 200 survivors of the attacks there and on other military bases in Hawaii are alive. Wednesday’s commemoration at a pier overlooking the memorial to the sunken Arizona began with a moment of silence at precisely that time. The battleship Arizona sank with 1,177 officers and crew on board and lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor. Wearing leis of fresh Hawaiian flowers around their necks, about 350 U.S. veterans of World War Two and their families received blessings and prayers for peace. A performance by the Navy’s Pacific Fleet Band was made bittersweet by the knowledge that every member of the USS Arizona band, one of the Navy’s best, died that day. Two families were to participate in a private ceremony in which the ashes of crew members who survived the attack and died later were to be interred in a turret of the Arizona. Across the United States on Wednesday, Americans remembered those who died at Pearl Harbor and the long, difficult war that followed. The shock of the Pearl Harbor attack is vividly illustrated in an exhibit at Massachusetts’ Museum of World War II, which features relics including a West Point cadet’s letter to his father, then-Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower, on preparing  himself for war. [L1N1E01KC] On Dec. 8, 1941, the United States declared war on Japan. Three days later, Germany declared war on the United States. Will Lehner, 95, was among those who had a chance to fight back in the Pearl Harbor attack. The 2nd class naval fireman was  in the boiler room of the USS Ward, which was patrolling the entrance to the harbor, when crew members spotted a Japanese submarine. “That submarine was on the surface and our skipper didn’t know if it was ours or not,” Lehner, 20 at the time, said at the Los Angeles event. “He said, ‘Load your guns.’” “The first shot went right over the top, the next shot right after it hit that submarine and punched a hole in it.” After the war, a historical discrepancy nagged at Lehner. The Japanese submarine had not been recovered and many historians doubted that it existed. That changed in 2002 when the submarine was found. “For 62 years,” Lehner said, “nobody believed us.” For his part, Leavelle would be touched twice by the hand of history. After the war, he became a policeman in Texas. On Nov. 24, 1963, he was the Dallas officer handcuffed to Lee Harvey Oswald when the accused assassin of President John F. Kennedy was shot to death by nightclub owner Jack Ruby. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"(Editor’s Note: please be advised that paragraphs 5 and 9 contain language that may offend readers) By Scott Malone NATICK, Mass. (Reuters) - A telegram telling of the attack on Pearl Harbor and a West Point cadet’s letter afterwards seeking advice from his father, General Dwight Eisenhower, are among exhibits at a U.S. museum illustrating the shock and horror that catapulted the United States into World War Two. The attack on the U.S. naval base in Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941, 75 years ago on Wednesday, shook a country that had been so focused on the war in Europe that it had lost sight of the threat posed by Japan, said Kenneth Rendell, director of the Museum of World War Two, outside Boston. “The whole issue was America not getting into the war in Europe, and part of the reason this attack was so shocking was because everyone was so focused on Europe,” said Rendell, a dealer in historic documents who founded the museum in 1999 to house a collection that holds some 500,000 items related to the war. One never-before-exhibited piece is a letter that West Point Cadet John Eisenhower sent to his father, then-Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower, the night of the attack after learning that he and his classmates would be graduating early and deploying. “It seems impossible that the Japs have the audacity to attack us as far east as Hawaii,” the letter read. “What can I do to develop myself?” The attack, launched to destroy the U.S. Pacific fleet and with the aim of keeping the United States out of the war, took 2,390 American lives. The exhibit shows relics directly from the attack including pieces of downed Japanese planes and the binoculars that had been used on the bridge of the battleship the USS Arizona, which was sunk in the attack. It also shows the backlash against people of Japanese descent living in the United States. That side of the war story is told through items including a pin claiming to be a “Jap Hunting License”; an official poster ordering residents of the Los Angeles area who were of Japanese ancestry to register; and a painting by an inmate from an internment camp for Japanese-Americans. Rendell said he hoped the exhibit illustrated the complexities of a war that is often romanticized in Hollywood movies and television documentaries. “I think people are yearning for a connection with a time when they believed the country was united,” he said during a tour of the museum in Natick, Massachusetts, about 20 miles west of Boston. “I want them to come out of this with an appreciation of the complexity and intensity of this period.” In addition to its extensive collection of documents, the museum’s collection includes a U.S. Sherman tank, dozens of uniforms and six of the “Enigma” machines that Germany used for coded transmissions. Rendell said the museum is in the midst of a fund-raising campaign, aiming to replace its current 10,000 square foot facility, which can display just a fraction of its collection, with a new 65,000 square foot museum.

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to Pearl Harbor this month, the first by a Japanese leader, will not be to apologize for the Japanese attack 75 years ago that drew the United States into World War Two, Abe’s top aide said on Tuesday. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the purpose of Abe’s Dec. 26-27 visit was to console the souls of those who died in the war. While the lack of an apology could disappoint some U.S. war veterans, Abe hopes the visit will showcase the tight alliance between the former foes. Experts say it is a message Abe wants to send both to regional rival China and to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has criticized Tokyo as a free-rider on defense. “This visit is for the sake of consoling the souls of those who died in the war, not for the sake of an apology,” Suga told a news conference the day after Abe announced the visit. “I think that the prime minister’s visit will be an opportunity to send the message that the calamity of war must not be repeated and ... express the value of reconciliation between Japan and the United States,” he said. The visit to Hawaii with U.S. President Barack Obama could also boost Abe’s popularity rating - already robust at around 60 percent - and raise the likelihood that he will call a snap election for parliament’s lower house. It will come seven months after Obama became the first serving U.S. president to visit the Japanese city of Hiroshima, where the United States dropped an atomic bomb in the closing days of the war in 1945. “The planning for a Pearl Harbor visit has been in the works ever since Obama visited Hiroshima. It’s mostly a reciprocal gesture and symbolic of the U.S. and Japan burying the hatchet,” said Columbia University emeritus professor Gerry Curtis. “It sends a message to China about the strength of the U.S.-Japan relationship (and is) probably also intended to send the same message to Trump,” he said. A boost in popularity ratings would give Abe a freer hand to call a snap election in January before opposition parties are ready. No election need be held until 2018 but speculation persists that Abe wants to call a vote sooner to minimize losses for his ruling bloc, which holds a two-thirds majority in the chamber. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - A Native American leader asked thousands of protesters to return home after the federal government ruled against a controversial pipeline, despite the prospect of President-elect Donald Trump reversing the decision after he takes office. A coalition of Native American groups, environmentalists, Hollywood stars and veterans of the U.S. armed forces protested the $3.8 billion oil project. They said construction would damage sacred lands and any leaks could pollute the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The tribe still wants to speak with Trump about the Dakota Access Pipeline to prevent him from approving the final phase of construction, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault told Reuters. “The current administration did the right thing and we need to educate the incoming administration and help them understand the right decision was made,” he said.Trump’s transition team said on Monday it would review the decision to delay completion once he takes office Jan. 20. “That’s something that we support construction of and we’ll review the full situation when we’re in the White House and make the appropriate determination at that time,” Trump spokesman Jason Miller said at a transition team news briefing. Archambault said nothing would happen over the winter before Trump takes power, so protesters should leave. Many had dug in for the harsh winter of the North Dakota plains, where a blizzard hit on Monday and 40 miles-per-hour (64 kmh) winds rattled tipis and tents. “We’re thankful for everyone who joined this cause and stood with us,” he said. “The people who are supporting us ... they can return home and enjoy this winter with their families. Same with law enforcement. I am asking them to go.” It was unclear if protesters would heed Archambault’s call to leave the Oceti Sakowin camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. SHORT-LIVED VICTORY On Sunday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rejected an application for the pipeline to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. The Army Corps said it would analyze possible alternate routes, although any other route is likely to cross the Missouri River. The camp celebrated the decision, but some expressed concern their victory could be short-lived. “I think this is just a rest,” Charlotte Bad Cob, 30, of the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, said on Sunday. “With a new government it could turn and we could be at it again.” On Monday, tribal leaders and hundreds of veterans walked to Backwater Bridge, one of the focal points of the protests, and offered prayers and chanted after the victory. Several veterans said they had no plans to leave and suspected Sunday’s decision was a ruse to empty the camp. The company building the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, said late on Sunday that it had no plans to reroute the line, and expected to complete the project. The Obama administration’s decision was a “political action”, ETP said in a joint statement on Sunday with its partner Sunoco Logistics Partners. The pipeline is complete except for a 1-mile (1.61 km)segment that was to run under Lake Oahe, which required permission from federal authorities. The chief executive of ETP, Kelcy Warren, donated to Trump’s campaign, while the president-elect has investments in ETP and Phillips 66, another partner in the project. As of Trump’s mid-2016 financial disclosure form, his stake in ETP was between $15,000 and $50,000, down from between $500,000 and $1 million in mid-2015. He had between $100,000 and $250,000 in shares of Phillips, according to federal forms. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - In North Dakota, winter is most definitely coming. That does not deter Dakota Access Pipeline protesters, many of whom say they know a blizzard earlier this week was but a taste of what is to come, as temperatures are expected to fall toward 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18°C). Rather than retreat amidst the cold and an order from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to vacate by Monday, the Oceti Sakowin camp, the epicenter of pipeline opposition, is growing in size - and quickly winterizing in expectation of harsher weather. Dozens of insulated tipis have popped up in recent weeks, adding to those that have dotted these barren plains since last summer. Yurts, a round tent popular in the cold tundra of East Asia, have started appearing. Portable toilets are being swapped out for heated, composting commodes. Ice cleats, which strap onto boots to give stability on ice, are now in demand. Taylor Orpin, 23, quit her job to move to the camp last month. She spends her days collating donated coats by size and gender in a tent near the camp’s main fire circle. “I’m very aware of what true cold is going to feel like,” said Orpin, a native of Winnipeg, Manitoba. “Here, people are able to come in and just take whatever they need to stay warm.” Thousands of people, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, are protesting the pipeline, which would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico. The route is adjacent to the Standing Rock reservation, and the tribe and climate activists say the line risks contamination of the tribe’s water source and its construction has damaged, and would further damage, sacred sites. While clothing, food and money have been pouring in from all over the world, the camp’s website requests more donations of wood, blankets, winter sleeping bags and propane to help weather the winter. A division of labor keeps many active, with campers volunteering in the four kitchens, shoveling snow, building tents and doing myriad other tasks. The multitudes at the camp defy the predictions of state and local officials, many of whom said out-of-state protesters would flee south like migrating birds. Children can be seen sliding playfully down nearby hills while senior citizens gossip over fire pits. “It’s a scare tactic, saying it’s too cold to be here,” said Gemma Akins, 36, a Reiki healer - a form of stress reduction - from Colorado. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple issued an evacuation order for the camp earlier this week, citing the weather. That  followed the Army Corps’ earlier decree to vacate the camp, which is on federal land, by Monday. The state is not going to enforce that order, and voluntary compliance doesn’t look likely. “I have zero experience with the cold,” said Jess Weiner, 29, of Los Angeles, who arrived Thursday. “But I love the adrenaline of being here.” It’s not clear how much money has been raised to build and sustain the camp since it was founded last spring, but estimates stand in the millions of dollars. The protests started attracting more attention in the late summer, particularly after clashes between activists and private security hired by Energy Transfer Partners ETP.N, which is building the line. The Obama Administration has twice delayed approval for ETP to tunnel the pipeline under the Missouri River. This one-mile stretch is the last unfinished spot on the line in North Dakota. The Three Affiliated Tribes of the MHA Nation, another large American Indian tribe in North Dakota, earlier this fall funded portable toilets, food and garbage removal. Even though they have earned billions from the extraction of oil and gas from their lands, the MHA have supported the Standing Rock protest. Financial support, including more than $500,000 alone for a veterans rally this weekend at the camp, have been pouring in through GoFundMe and other crowdfunding websites. Beyond donations, Hollywood actors like Shailene Woodley and Susan Sarandon have visited North Dakota, though they are not currently at the camp. Some campers bring technical skills. Joshua Tree, 42, has helped install solar panels and wind turbines to power a white, dome-like structure that dwarfs everything else here. The dome, which organizers say can hold 380 people, is where most meetings and press events are held. “We wanted to help the best way we can. And that’s setting up solar power and wind power,” said Tree. As the group tries to ward off the cold, challenges loom. One family had to be hospitalized on Thursday due to carbon monoxide poisoning after attempting to heat a tent using propane without proper ventilation. That feeds concern from law enforcement that protesters don’t respect the weather. “These are people who don’t yet understand what cold is,” Wayne Stenehjem, North Dakota’s attorney general, told Reuters. Signs posted around the camp note there are 18 different communal sleeping areas that are warmer than personal tents. “We cannot stress how cold it’s going to get,” the posting reads. “Don’t be in a small tent or your car and think you’ll be OK. Let’s all look after each other.” ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned on Wednesday after a bruising referendum loss at the weekend, with most parliamentary factions pushing for an early election in a few months’ time. The 41-year-old’s decision to quit after less than three years in office dealt a new blow to Western governments still in shock from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the election of outsider Donald Trump as U.S. president. Underscoring the financial risks that heavily indebted Italy faces, Moody’s changed its outlook on the country’s bond rating to negative from stable, saying prospects for much-needed economic reform had shrunk after Italians rejected Renzi’s proposals to revise the constitution and streamline parliament. Renzi tendered his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, who said he would consult with political parties to decide the next steps. He asked Renzi to carry on in a caretaker capacity until a solution is found. After the consultations, which will begin on Thursday at 1700 GMT and end on Saturday afternoon, Mattarella is widely expected to ask a member of Renzi’s cabinet, or a politician from his Democratic Party, to try to form a new government. Elections are due in 2018 but many politicians are calling for them to be held earlier. Two sources told Reuters on Tuesday that Renzi’s administration was preparing to take a 2-billion-euro ($2.15-billion) controlling stake in the bank by purchasing junior bonds. On Wednesday, a Treasury spokesman denied Italy was poised to ask for a loan from the European Stability Mechanism to support its banking sector. Renzi addressed his Democratic Party (PD) before meeting the president, saying the party would only participate in a government intended to last until 2018 if it was backed by all the main forces in parliament, a prospect which seems remote. Otherwise early elections should be held as soon as possible, he said, after the Constitutional Court has ruled early next year on the legitimacy of the current electoral law. “The PD is not afraid of going to early elections,” he said. Most opposition parties, including the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing Northern League, are clamoring for a quick vote. Northern League leader Matteo Salvini said on Wednesday his party would “take to the streets” if a clear indication of the timing of the next election had not been given within a week. Infrastructure Minister Graziano Delrio, a close ally of Renzi, said an interim government should change the electoral law quickly so an election could be held “in the Spring”. Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and a left-wing minority inside Renzi’s PD want a new administration to be formed with the backing of the current parliament, perhaps to last until 2018, to give them time to resolve internal party battles. Markets have reacted calmly to the political tensions, with the gap between Italian and German bond yields hitting 155 basis points on Wednesday, the tightest in about a month, having climbed as high as 193 points before Sunday’s vote. Although Moody’s maintained its rating at Baa2, just two notches above junk status, it said the outlook had dimmed, with the chances of meaningful economic and fiscal reform receding. “(There is) the rising risk that the stabilization and reduction in Italy’s large debt burden will be further deferred,” the ratings agency warned. It said it might consider cutting the rating at a future date, citing as one possible trigger “the need for a significant  recapitalization of banks by the government”. There was no immediate comment from the Treasury. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Delays to the Dakota Access Pipeline have added millions of dollars to Energy Transfer Partners’ construction tab - but even if the line is approved, the freezing temperatures will bring their own challenges to finishing the drilling process. Frigid weather makes some aspects of pipeline construction more difficult, though not impossible, engineers and experts interviewed by Reuters said this week. While the majority of the construction on the 1,100-mile (1,770 km) line is complete, work on a one-mile segment in North Dakota was halted in September following protests from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others, who said it could desecrate sacred lands and contaminate drinking water. That stretch would be expected to take 90 to 120 days to finish, ETP has said. Construction equipment used to bore under rivers can break through any layer of frost, said Eric Hansen, the director of environmental services at Westwood Professional Services, a surveying and engineering firm in the U.S. upper Midwest. At issue, however, is the fluid construction companies use to lubricate the drill head. That drilling fluid, which circulates to clear out debris and keep parts lubricated, freezes at air temperatures between 10 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-12 to -7 Celsius). To avoid this, pipeline crews will keep equipment running nonstop, which allows them to avoid warming up equipment that’s been turned off in cold weather, said an engineer who has done work in North Dakota but declined to be named. The median temperature in Morton County, North Dakota, near the pipeline route is 13 degrees F between December and February, according to the National Weather Service.

Hansen added that the high winds in North Dakota and heavy snow accumulation can also slow operations. The temperature in Cannon Ball, North Dakota was 30 degrees F on Thursday. As the U.S. government weighs whether to grant Energy Transfer the easement, the pipeline operator said in a legal filing in late November that delays following the projected Jan. 1 start-up would cost about $84 million a month. Energy Transfer Partners this week said it still expected to complete the pipeline in the first quarter of next year, even after the U.S. government in November further delayed a decision on whether to grant the company an easement needed to drill under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that is part of the Missouri River. Even if boring started at the beginning of 2017, the 90 to 120-day time frame for completion could mean additional costs of between $252 million and $336 million. The company has moved equipment to begin drilling under Lake Oahe as soon as it receives the easement. The pipeline was originally slated to begin transporting oil out of the Bakken shale to the U.S. Midwest by the end of this year. The segment of the Dakota Access that needs completion will  burrow under the ground before Lake Oahe, and then cut about 100 feet below the bottom of the river, according to environmental assessment documents from the Army Corps of Engineers and Dakota Access company. Pipeline companies accustomed to working in freezing temperatures have ways to combat the elements, such as using heated shacks at the site to protect welders, said John Stoody, vice president of government and public relations at the Association of Oil Pipelines, an industry group. Capital-intensive pipeline projects are underpinned by firm commitments from shippers, meaning an exodus of shippers due to delays could erode the economic viability of the line. “Loss of shippers to the project could effectively result in project cancellation,” the company said in a court filing. Energy Transfer cannot access the remaining $1.4 billion of its credit facility without all necessary approvals for the line, the company said on its quarterly earnings call. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said for the first time that he supports the completion of a pipeline project near a North Dakota Indian reservation, which has been the subject of months of protests by tribes and environmentalists. A communications briefing from Trump’s transition team said despite media reports that Trump owns a stake in Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, Trump’s support of the pipeline “has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans.” “Those making such a claim are only attempting to distract from the fact that President-elect Trump has put forth serious policy proposals he plans to set in motion on Day One,” said the daily briefing note sent to campaign supporters and congressional staff. Activists have spent months protesting plans to route the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying the project poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites. On Thursday, U.S. military veterans were arriving at a camp to join thousands of activists braving snow and freezing temperatures to protest the pipeline. Republican Trump has been a vocal supporter of another high-profile pipeline project, Transcanada’s Keystone XL, which Democratic President Barack Obama denied a permit for last year. Republican North Dakota Senator John Hoeven said he met with Trump’s transition team to discuss the delayed pipeline. “Today, Mr. Trump expressed his support for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has met or exceeded all environmental standards set forth by four states and the Army Corps of Engineers,” Hoeven said in a statement. “It is important to know that the new administration will work to help us grow and diversify our energy economy and build the energy infrastructure necessary to move it from where it is produced to where it is needed,” he said.

Gary X. Ashton,12082016,Investopedia,12012016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On Wednesday U.S. crude settled up 9.3% at $49.44 per barrel after OPEC finalized a deal to cut output for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2008. OPEC agreed to cut approximately 4.5%, or 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), from their collective output starting in January 2017. After the cuts are implemented, OPEC is targeting production of 32.5 mb/d from 33.7 mb/d now.  Each OPEC member is responsible for enforcing what the cartel is calling “an allocation of oil production adjustments,” instead of production quotas. OPEC is known for cheating, however, so an internal committee will oversee enforcement as a precaution. For some member states, like Indonesia, the proposed cuts were simply too much to ask. Indonesia used to be an oil exporting country, but became a net importer several years ago. The country was re-admitted to the cartel last summer, but does not really seem to have a role to play any longer. So when the rest of the cartel announced an output reduction agreement, Indonesia took the opportunity to suspend its membership. The Indonesian government tried to put on a brave face and said the membership was being suspended rather than revoked. Time will show. (For more see: Does Indonesia’s OPEC Membership Matter?) Not many oil market observers expected OPEC to reach an agreement at this meeting, but the cartel’s credibility and even relevance was on the line. Saudi Arabia, perhaps because of its quasi-leadership role in the group, was particularly keen on reaching an agreement. When the meeting started, Saudi said any agreed cuts would be allocated among member states based on their respective percentage of output. If this were true, then the percentage of cuts should look something like the chart below, which is based on OPEC’s production figures in October 2016. Instead, the actual cuts agreed at Wednesday’s meeting are more like this, based on figures discussed during OPEC’s press conference. Saudi Arabia agreed to a larger proportion of oil production cuts than it should have if the percentage was actually based on output. When the story first broke, Reuters reported that, “Saudi is prepared to take a ‘big hit’ to its own production to reach an agreement.” Several countries like Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela are not really participating in the agreement. For example, Iran agreed to freeze production at 3.797 mb/d, which is actually a 90,000 b/d increase from October output levels. Nigeria negotiated an outright exemption from cuts. Most likely this is because of the country’s fragile macroeconomic and financial condition. (For more see: Nigeria Badly Needs OPEC Agreement). Key to making this agreement more credible was the announced participation of non-OPEC countries. At the press conference, OPEC said it expected non-OPEC countries to cut production by 600,000 b/d in 2017, with fully half of that amount coming from Russia alone. Russia’s Energy Minister Novak had earlier said that Russia would suspend 2017 production increases in support of OPEC, but instead Russia agreed to actually reduce current production levels. Lukoil (MCX:LKOH) said it would abide by the Russian governments agreed cuts, but the Russian government is more likely to lean on state owned producers to deliver production cuts rather than private companies. OPEC has done a good job of making its presence felt on the global oil markets again. Not only were they able to negotiate an agreement among member countries, but even convinced some non-OPEC members to join in to the agreed production decline. Many analysts now expect oil prices to rise from here. The next stop along the way will be the $60 per barrel mark, which is the price at which U.S. shale oil should start coming back on line in a meaningful way. It will be interesting to see what OPEC’s next move will be when they meet again in six months.  Disclaimer: Gary Ashton is an oil and gas financial consultant who writes for Investopedia.

""From April 2017, the net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary,"" the ECB said. The surprise move initially sent the EUR higher by as much as 0.8 percent against the U.S. dollar, rising to a four-week high of 1.0870 and yields on German benchmark Bunds spiked by as much as 9 basis point. However, these gains were wiped out after ECB President Mario Draghi announced some changes in parameters to its bond buying program in his press conference. The ECB announced it is permitting the purchase of bonds yielding below the deposit rate of minus 0.4 per cent and reducing the minimum required maturity of bonds from two years to one. By increasing these parameters it suggest the ECB may be worried it is running out of assets to buy. However, by reducing the required maturity to one year there are fears the ECB will get involved in the bank funding market. The surprise reduction in the asset purchase program comes as the ECB grapples with what to do with Italy and its floundering banking system, mainly Monte dei Paschi.

There has been much speculation as to why this transpired. The potential reasons have ranged from “it was time,” to him being too vocal politically. We might never know, but that’s not what’s important. What’s important is that Schultz is remaining a part of the team to help grow Starbucks Reserve Roastery, which Schultz had earlier referred to as the “next generation of Starbucks.” If Starbucks Reserve Roastery is indeed the “next generation of Starbucks,” then Schultz didn’t really leave. He’s actually still in charge of growing the company.

This is our Roastery, a place we had to create. The Siren called. We listened.” Starbucks Reserve Roastery has been referred to by Starbucks executives as “the Willy Wonka of coffee.” This appears to be a wise concept because today’s young consumers are more interested in experience than merchandise.

Two years ago Canadian toy company Spin Master Corp began creating Hatchimals, a small furry creature that arrives in a colorful egg and requires kids to rub and warm up until the egg cracks and hatches. Part of the allure of Hatchimals is that the toy inside is unknown. There are up to five possibilities: Draggles and Pengualas, which look like penguins, Owlicorns the owl, Burtles the turtle and Bearakeets the bear. (See also: The Hottest Toy This Season: The Hatchimal) The unveiling began with a secret launch on October 7 but quickly culminated into a mad dash with parents queuing up outside retail stores such as Target, Walmart and Toys R Us hours before opening. Although the toy retails for $59.99, Hatchimals are now re-selling at a steep premium of up to $250 on sites such as Amazon and eBay, which doesn't necessarily translate into the company's bottom line. (See also: Should You Resell Toys At Christmas For Extra Money). Spin Master's stock is up 36% since July 1, 2016 and the company is rushing distribution by airfreighting the remaining Hatchimals from China. Although the company won't reveal sales figures until after the end of the fourth quarter, it has acknowledged that demand has far outstripped supply and it does not expect a new batch of Hatchimals to arrive from its Chinese warehouse until 2017, although who knows if the toy's popularity will continue beyond the holiday season.

David Floyd,12082016,Investopedia,12012016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's rate-setting committee, meets from December 13 to 14, chances are nearly 95% that it will vote to raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 0.5% to 0.75%. That comforting certainty, courtesy of the CME Group's federal funds futures tracker, breaks down quickly when Donald Trump's incoming administration takes the reins. The president-elect accused the Fed of stoking a bubble in August 2015, switched to extolling the merits of low interest rates the following May, then in October accused Fed chair Janet Yellen of ""doing political things"" by offering low rates as a sop to the Obama administration. To get a sense of what kind of central bank we can expect during the Trump administration, Investopedia spoke to Danielle DiMartino Booth on November 22. A former advisor to the Dallas Fed, Booth is the author of ""Fed Up,"" a book criticizing the Federal Reserve System that goes on sale February 14th, 2017. The incoming administration has promised the largest tax change since Reagan and $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. While the final shape this stimulus will take is anyone's guess – Congressional Republicans could remain fiscally hawkish – optimism regarding the plan has yanked up Treasury yields and inflation expectations. Many forecasters expect economic growth to accelerate as well, although not to the 4%, 5% or 6% Trump has promised. All of these factors suggest higher interest rates. (See also, Is Trump the Next Reagan? Investors Brace Themselves.) Asked if she bought this narrative, Booth burst into song – ""happy days are here again…"" (Ironically, the theme for a Democratic presidential campaign; appropriately, the campaigner was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, author of American history's most ambitious stimulus package.) In other words, ""no, because starting points matter, and we are at a completely different juncture."" When Reagan came into office, Booth pointed out, the S&P 500's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was in the single digits; according to multpl.com, it was just over 9.0 at the beginning of January 1981. Today, by contrast, we are at ""the tail end of one of the longest expansions in post-war history"" and the S&P's P/E is nearly 25.4. Interest rate outlooks that assume Ronald Reagan's third term will begin in 2017, in short, may not play out. (See also, Trumponomics: Economic Forecasts.) Asked whether we can expect Trump to return to his previous embrace of low rates, Booth linked his inconsistency on monetary policy to the shake-up of his campaign staff in May. ""Before he fired his campaign manager he's like hey, I'm a debt guy. Low interest rates good, high interest rates bad."" After he replaced Corey Lewandowski as campaign manager in June – first with Paul Manafort and then, in August, with Kellyanne Conway – Trump changed his tone, tapping into the feeling that ""the Fed had been doing the Obama administration's bidding for the last eight years."" ""I happen to agree with that,"" Booth added, pointing out that Lael Brainard donated the maximum amount of $2,700 to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and that Daniello Tarullo put an Obama sticker on his car. Both are on the Board of Governors, meaning they have votes on the FOMC. (See also, The Federal Reserve: Introduction.) Given that Booth ascribes Trump's pronouncements on monetary policy more to campaign strategy than conviction, she is not certain what shape the Fed will take over the next four to eight years. She'd been excited when the election results first came in, since there was reason to believe Trump's win would ""imply a much different Fed going forward."" Over the following two weeks, though, Trump became ""more genteel,"" leading her to wonder whether he'll be the force for change his late-stage campaign rhetoric would suggest. (See also, How Trump Could Quickly Shake Up the Fed.) He certainly has the opportunity to reshape the FOMC. There are currently two open seats on the committee, both reserved for governors. The Board of Governors accounts for seven of the FOMC's 12 votes when politics allows (no one has even mentioned Obama's two forlorn nominees since March). One vote goes to the New York Fed president, William Dudley, who also serves as the committee's vice-chair. The remaining four go to an annually rotating group of regional Fed presidents. Trump might have even more leeway to appoint like-minded FOMC members. Yellen told Congress on November 17 ""it's fully my intention to serve out"" her term as chair of the Board of Governors, and Booth ""cannot foresee a set of circumstances that would force her to step down"" sooner. But that term expires in February 2018, and Stanley Fischer's term as vice-chair expires the following June. If both step down, Trump would have the opportunity to nominate four of the seven governors during his first two years, subject to Senate approval. (See also, Yellen's Future with the Fed After Trump Win.) On the other hand, there is no guarantee that Yellen and Fischer leave the board when their leadership terms expire. Yellen has a board seat until the end of January 2024, though the usual pattern is for outgoing chairs to leave the board when their successors take over. Fischer is serving out a predecessor's term, which ends in January 2020. He could conceivably begin another 14-year stint if reappointed, which would carry him through to age 90. Also worth considering: if push comes to shove, the law allows Trump to remove a board member ""for cause."" Trump's charge that Yellen is acting politically has led to hand-wringing over the central bank's future independence. Former Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota wrote shortly after Trump's victory, ""there is absolutely nothing in U.S. law preventing Trump from violating the Fed's independence, a post-1979 development that rests largely on the restraint of the president."" In Booth's view, however, the Fed is already ""political in an overt way."" Assuming that Trump does get ""the opportunity of a lifetime"" to appoint four governors – Booth's phrasing – what kind of changes would she like to see? First, that Trump recognizes ""the futility of econometrics and designing monetary policy based on models and theories that don't necessarily apply on planet Earth."" The corrective to this ""throwing spaghetti at the wall methodology"" is picking the right people. The current FOMC, in her view, is stacked with academics who enjoy lifetime defined-benefit plans and, as a result, ""don't have to eat what they cook."" She thinks CEOs, pension fund managers and others who understand the implications of zero interest rate policy are better suited to the job than Ph.D.s. She cautions that the answer is not necessarily higher interest rates, however. If the Fed forces a recession, ""which I think they might do,"" rates are unlikely to rise regardless of the board's composition. But in any case, she argues, certain lessons need to be learned: ""the zero bound should never be breached again, and we should always at least aspire to have curve in our yield curve."" That means taking financial markets into account, as well as the rest of the ""complex, adaptive system"" Booth says the Fed too often ignores, creating models as if they operated ""in a vacuum."" (See also, Buffett on Dodd-Frank, the Fed and the National Debt.)

Nathan Reiff,12082016,Investopedia,12012016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Hyperinflation has run rampant in Venezuela for a prolonged period of time, and the government's central bank is responding by issuing currency in new denominations. According to a report fromt he Venezuelan central bank, beginning on December 15 the country will have six new bills added to its currency in circulation. Currently, the largest denomination is 100 bolivar; the new bills will range from 500 up to 20,000 bolivar. Whether the move will help with the major economic crisis gripping the country is uncertain, as previous efforts to reduce rates of inflation have proven unsuccessful. The current largest bill in Venezuelan currency, the 100 bolivar note, is officially worth 15 U.S. cents, but it is more likely to carry the weight of about 2 cents based on unofficial market rates. The result is that many Venezuelans have resorted to carrying money around in large bags, as so many individual bills are necessary in order to purchase even the most basic of goods. A pair of pants is likely to cost about 40,000 bolivars, for instance, says Luis Oliveros, professor of economics at Caracas Metropolitan University, in an interview with CNN. Credit card use has caused the electronic payment system in the country to collapse, meaning that more and more Venezuelans are dependent upon paper currency for every transaction. At the same time, inflation rates have skyrocketed, with the overall rate of inflation for 2016 estimated at roughly 500% and expectations for rates topping 1600% for 2017 already speculated. The major question on most analysts' minds is whether or not the gamble by the Venezuelan central bank will pay off and help to reduce the inflation rates in the country. Unfortunately, many economists are not optimistic. Back in 2008, the country eliminated three zeroes from all of its currency as the government pledged to work on the inflation problem, but the intervening time has seen inflation only increase. At the same time, with a heavy dependence on oil, the country has seen its revenue decline, forcing it into a position in which it may default on its debt in the coming weeks. Citizens in Venezuela have faced major shortages of food, medicine, and other staples. Should the introduction of new bills into the Venezuelan economy not serve to help with the problems of inflation, economists will likely suggest that the problem has deeper roots than the mere value of the accessible bills and the cost of goods for sale around the country. In the meantime, citizens in Venezuela are becoming increasingly desperate for relief from the current inflation cycle and shortage of necessary goods for everyday life.

The resulting deal in September did not involve the sale of HPE in total, but the bulk of the firm’s software unit, which was sold off to Micro Focus International in a deal worth $8.8 billion. Throughout the massive restructuring through divestitures, HPE has focused on returning value to shareholders largely through repurchases. In the firm’s most recent fiscal fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Timothy Stonesifer said the firm returned $3 billion, more than triple the firm’s initial target, to shareholders, committing to return another $3 billion in 2017. Chatter again is building regarding a possible sale of HPE to private equity. Jack Mohr of TheStreet said, “The company is on track to sell non-core assets, which should allow for narrowed focus toward the higher-margin, more predictable Enterprise Services business … HPE’s stock continues to trade at a discount to the base case as a result of weak conviction by its potential ownership base.” Recently, investment firms Jana Partners LLC, Starboard Value LP and Frontfour Capital Group LLC have taken stakes in HPE. While the positions are small for now, the firms are following the examples of activist investors who gradually pick up investments over time. However, some analysts note that after the spinoffs, there may not be much more value for activists to harness.

Amid strong operating results, which have helped AK Steel surpass Wall Street's earnings estimates in six straight quarters, the company expects strong demand for its carbon and stainless steel products for the rest of 2016 and for fiscal 2017. The company's improved outlook and current performance have been endorsed by Moody's Investors Service, which last week upgraded AK Steel's outlook from negative to positive. (See also: Moody's Upgrades AK Steel Outlook to Positive.) From a valuation perspective, AK Steel shares, which are priced at a forward P/E ratio of 14, or about three points below the average stock in the S&P 500 (SPX) index, are attractive. Assuming the company meets earnings per share forecasts of 69 cents in fiscal 2017, AK Steel would have grown its earnings by 122%. Similarly, based on Friday's closing price and an average price target of around $12, AK Steel stock could trade 22% higher. ",Assessing AK Steel After 91% One-Month Rise (AKS) | Investopedia
Jacob Pramuk,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Donald Trump has sold his entire stake in Energy Transfer Partners, the company overseeing construction of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, a Trump spokeswoman told NBC News. Trump's shares of the company created a possible conflict of interest for the president-elect, as his administration may determine the project's fate amid ongoing protests from Native Americans and climate activists. Trump has supported the 1,172-mile pipeline and broader efforts to produce more fossil fuels in the United States. On Sunday, the Army Corp of Engineers denied a federal permit for the project needed for a segment of the pipeline. Trump's administration could still approve it. The planned pipeline route would have crossed beneath the Missouri River and run a half-mile of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Opponents said it could taint drinking water and disturb sacred sites. Protests against the pipeline have gone on for months. This summer, Trump's most recent financial disclosure form said he owned between $15,000 and $50,000 of Energy Transfer Partners' stock, so the sale must have taken place since then. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not say if he also sold his shares of Phillips 66, which has a smaller investment in the project. Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren also gave $100,000 to Trump's joint fundraising effort with the Republican Party, according to Federal Election Commission records. However, Hicks said the donation would not affect Trump's decision making when he takes office. Late last month, The Washington Post first reported that Trump sold off his stake.

 ,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned on Wednesday after a bruising referendum loss at the weekend, with most parliamentary factions pushing for an early election in a few months' time. The 41-year-old's decision to quit after less than three years in office dealt a new blow to Western governments still in shock from Britain's vote to leave the European Union and the election of outsider Donald Trump as president of the United States. Renzi tendered his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, who said he would consult with the political parties to decide the next steps. He asked Renzi to carry on in a caretaker capacity until a solution is found. After the consultations, which will begin on Thursday at 1700 GMT and end on Saturday afternoon, Mattarella is widely expected to ask a member of Renzi's cabinet, or a politician from his Democratic Party, to try to form a new government. Elections are due in 2018 but many politicians are calling for them to be held earlier. The political crisis sparked by the referendum coincides with a crisis in Italy's debt-laden banks, especially at its third-biggest lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which looks likely to require government intervention to survive. Two sources told Reuters on Tuesday that Renzi's administration was preparing to take a 2-billion-euro ($2.15-billion) controlling stake in the bank by purchasing junior bonds. On Wednesday, a Treasury spokesman denied Italy was poised to ask for a loan from the European Stability Mechanism to support its banking sector. Renzi addressed his Democratic Party (PD) before meeting the president, saying the party would only participate in a government intended to last until 2018 if it was backed by all the main forces in parliament, a prospect which seems remote. Otherwise early elections should be held as soon as possible, he said, after the Constitutional Court has ruled early next year on the legitimacy of the current electoral law. ""The PD is not afraid of going to early elections,"" he said. Most opposition parties, including the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing Northern League, are clamouring for a quick vote. Northern League leader Matteo Salvini said on Wednesday his party would ""take to the streets"" if a clear indication of the timing of the next election had not been given within a week. Infrastructure Minister Graziano Delrio, a close ally of Renzi, said an interim government should change the electoral law quickly so an election could be held ""in the Spring"". Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and a left-wing minority inside Renzi's PD want a new administration to be formed with the backing of the current parliament, perhaps to last until 2018. The PD has the largest number of parliamentarians, so it is unlikely any new government could be formed without Renzi's backing. ($1 = 0.9319 euros) Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Fred Imbert,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"U.S. equities closed higher on Monday, unfazed by a key vote in Italy which led to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's resignation, as financials, technology and consumer discretionary stocks rose around 1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained around 45 points, notching record highs on an intraday and closing basis, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 advanced 0.58 percent, with financials, information technology and consumer discretionary leading advancers. The Nasdaq composite outperformed, closing 1 percent higher. Stocks have been on a rip-roaring rally since the U.S. election, with the three large-cap indexes rising more than 2 percent. ""I think we'll be OK through the rest of the year,"" said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. ""There really isn't that much to wrap your hands around through the rest of the year."" Renzi said he would step down after being defeated in a referendum regarding his plan to overhaul the Italian constitution. Renzi said voters had shown a ""clear"" rejection of legislative reform measures and that he would meet with his cabinet on Monday and then hand in his resignation to the President Sergio Mattarella, taking full responsibility for the defeat. The reforms would have made it so that the executive branch needs approval only from parliament's lower house in order to pass laws. Legislation is a slow, arduous process in Italy, where there are a high number of lawmakers relative to the population, and where the two houses of parliament essentially have the same, duplicate powers. But ""going into the vote, ... the market had expected any trouble in terms of liquidity, particularly with the banks, would be mitigated by a Mario Draghi put,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. Shares of Italian bank Banca Popolare di Milano fell more than 7 percent in European trade. ""I think the fact that we went through the referendum and not much has changed since then is [good] for U.S. markets,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, adding that U.S. stocks were taking their cue from European markets. The euro briefly dipped more than 1 percent against the dollar on Sunday evening, before trading higher against the U.S. currency. As of 4:01 p.m. ET, the European common currency traded 0.94 percent higher, at $1.0765. European stocks also rose, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index rising about 0.56 percent. We didn't react today to Italy, ""however, I think this is the calm before the storm,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, noting that the referendum's defeat puts the country's banks in a vulnerable spot. ""Much of the bounce back is mainly due to the victory of the Green party over in Austria which has faded the picture that there would be any outcome such as Brexit. But the pain for the euro may continue as the upcoming elections over in Germany, Netherland, France and Italy will maintain their pressure,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, in a note. ""The support of 1.02 could be tested in the coming months and we will be watching this level very closely."" Investors also payed attention to remarks made by New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley, in which he said he favors gradual rate hikes if the U.S. economy stays on track. The expectation among investors is for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at its meeting later in December. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, market expectations for a rate hike this month are above 90 percent. In economic news, the November IHS Markit non-manufacturing index came in at 54.6, marking the ninth consecutive month in which the services sector has shown expansion. ""Survey respondents noted that improved client confidence and a favourable domestic economic backdrop had helped to boost business activity in November,"" IHS said. The November ISM services index read, meanwhile, came in at 57.2, above an October read of 54.8. Market watchers also eyed news from the incoming presidential administration, after President-elect Donald Trump threatened payback for U.S. firms that moved abroad. ""The hope and belief of many voters is that when deciding on a candidate, campaigning is different than governing and things said doing the former are implemented more practically under the latter or not at all,"" Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note to clients.

Ted Kemp,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"This time, the ""get tough on China"" talk could be more than empty rhetoric — and leaders in Beijing may even recognize some of the tactics Donald Trump plans to use against them. The president-elect is showing a willingness to try to shape U.S. trade with China in ways that are politically more direct than previous administrations have been willing to discuss. On Sunday, he threatened — again — to use steep, blanket tariffs to stem imports into the United States. He has repeatedly declared that exports should be a priority for U.S.-based companies, and has promised a tax structure that will help make them happen. His willingness to wield political influence over business matters isn't limited to trade. Over the last week, Trump has shown he isn't afraid to lean directly on U.S. companies that aren't behaving as he wants. On Tuesday morning, he used Twitter to pressure Boeing to charge less for a new Air Force One. On Friday, he promised ""retribution"" against firms that fire employees or build factories overseas. ""I was in Beijing a week ago, and at one point I said to an audience of government officials, it's going to be very interesting for you to work with an American leader who admires a lot of what you guys do,"" said Ian Bremmer, a closely watched political scientist and founder of consulting firm Eurasia Group. When the officials showed surprise at Bremmer's remark, he explained what he meant: ""When you say, 'Jump' to a company, they ask, 'How high?' Trump would love that."" Representatives from the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to emails from CNBC requesting comment. Neither Bremmer nor anyone else expects the U.S. economy to start mimicking China, where 20 to 25 percent of GDP comes from state-controlled companies whose primary purpose isn't even to make profits but to advance Beijing's political goals such as maintaining employment. But ""we're entering an era where I wouldn't be surprised to see the U.S. government being less shy about applying state power to achieve what it sees as the national interest,"" said John Minnich, senior Asia-Pacific analyst at consulting firm Stratfor. The dynamic between the two countries is changing. For decades, Democrats and Republicans alike have said that the best way to encourage a more open China was for the U.S. to just keep trading with the country and drawing it into the global economy. The hope was that eventually, China's tremendous market would become as open to U.S. companies and investment as the U.S. is to Chinese imports and investment. But that hasn't been happening, especially over the last few years. ""I think a lot of the long-standing assumptions have been undermined by what's happened in China. They're not becoming more liberal,"" said Robert Manning, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security. In fact, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who took power in 2012, has rolled back many of the trade and currency reforms that his predecessor began. Trump showed that American workers have lost their patience with China, if they ever had it. Trump appealed to voters in struggling manufacturing regions largely by saying he would impose restrictions on imports from China, especially in the form of tariffs. ""We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing,"" Trump told excited crowds at an Indiana rally in June, referring to the trade deficit with China. Such language was the norm for then-candidate Trump, who has said repeatedly that Beijing's heavy state influence on its economy is ""killing"" the United States. Trump certainly is not the only person suggesting creative ways to counter China's unfair trade practices. A June paper from the nonpartisan American Security Project, for instance, suggested using U.S. antitrust law to level the playing field against China's biggest industries, which are part of a ""single country-wide State syndicate."" ""There's definitely this idea that state capitalism in China gives them a negotiating advantage"" on trade matters, Bremmer said. ""When the United States tries to negotiate, they get undercut by companies that are inherently unpatriotic, because of their fiduciary responsibilities"" to investors. ""And Trump wants to change that."" But Bremmer and others who spoke with CNBC argued that Trump has only so much power to restructure how global trade works. First off, Trump is likely to run into congressional resistance — from the GOP at least as much as Democrats — if he makes it harder for companies to operate overseas or otherwise seems to direct their behavior. ""The power of the American president is not absolute. There's a serious amount of pushback that he will get from important people, including from some people he's appointed to posts,"" Bremmer said. Moreover, manufacturing now accounts for about 15 percent of U.S. GDP, which ""is the highest it's been in 20 years at least,"" according to Manning. The real threat to American workers is not cheap labor in China, he said, but rising automation from technology, which increasingly will threaten not just factory workers but others such as automobile drivers, warehouse employees and retail workers. ""We may expand manufacturing, and we ought to, but it won't bring back the jobs that they're talking about,"" Manning said. ""We're having the wrong debate. The debate needs to be, 'How do you prepare the workforce for 21st-century jobs?'"" ",Donald Trump gets tough on China by borrowing from Beijing's playbook
Huileng Tan,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's defeat in a referendum over his plan to reform the constitution is a harbinger of further uncertainty in Europe next year where populist parties are making gains in the key economies of France, Germany and the Netherlands. On Sunday, Renzi said he would resign following a ""clear"" rejection of legislative reform measures as what was originally a rather dry referendum on constitutional change turned into a high-stakes game with the political and economic stability of Italy—and ultimately the euro zone—at risk. ""We know that the referendum was technically on constitutional reforms but the Italian government linked the vote to its own political future,"" said Stratfor's senior European analyst, Adriano Bosoni. Sunday's vote was on whether the country's second chamber should be stripped of some of its powers. The country's government is hamstrung by procedure and delays to legislation. A ""yes"" vote in the referendum would have meant that laws would only need the approval of the lower house to be passed. Renzi had pinned his political future on the vote, saying he would resign if a ""yes"" vote was rejected. While the vote would weigh on Italy's sovereign debt, the impact would likely be contained with aid from the European Central Bank, said Bosoni. What is more significant about Italy's rejection of the constitutional changes are concerns over its impact on the future of the European Union and euro zone, particularly after the shock outcomes from this year's polls, including the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. Also weighing on the political scene is the surprise U.S. election of Donald Trump in a populist wave. With Renzi leaving, Italy likely faces early elections next year, raising the prospect of a a new political combination in power. ""If you take a look at the political environment in Italy, Renzi's center-left Democratic Party is probably the only mainstream party that still supports the EU and the euro zone,"" Stratfor's Bosoni told CNBC's ""The Rundown"". Most of the rest of the top five most popular parties all criticize the trade bloc, he noted. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement has gained ground in popularity, winning mayoral elections in Rome and Turin. It has said it would renegotiate the country's membership of the euro if it came into power. ""Renzi thought he could tackle (the rise of anti-establishment sentiment) by making it about him; we see now that was a radical big mistake for him and now he's paying the ultimate price by having to resign much like David Cameron last June when they try to leverage that personal popular support for him on a wider canvas and ultimately it just simply failed,"" said Maastricht University's European Studies professor, Michael Geary, in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"". Italy's referendum on Sunday also came ahead of elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands next year, where populist parties including France's National Front are seeing growing support. The party fervently opposes the EU and is renowned for its very conservative and nationalist views on immigration and globalization. However, Marine Le Pen has tried to soften the party's image in recent years by de-radicalizing some of its positions and expelling some more controversial members for extreme comments, including her own father. She has also vowed to hold a referendum on France's euro and EU membership if elected.

He said voters had shown a ""clear"" rejection of legislative reform measures and that he would meet with his cabinet on Monday and then hand in his resignation to the President Mattarella, taking full responsibility for the defeat. ""The experience of my government ends here,"" Renzi said in a televised address to the nation as results showed his 'Yes' camp was well on track to lose the referendum.

A ""Yes"" vote in the referendum would have meant that laws would only need the approval of the lower house to be passed. Renzi had pinned his political future on the vote, saying he would resign if a ""Yes"" vote is rejected. Populist parties such as the 5-Star Movement had campaigned for a ""No"" vote, saying the change to the constitution would lead to a concentration of power. As well as throwing the political future of Italy into doubt, a ""No"" could hit the country's already-fragile economy hard. In Asian trade the euro was down 0.90 percent to 1.0574 to the dollar after touching a 20-month low. Renzi's resignation could lead to early polls in the second or third quarter of 2017, according to analysts, with worries in the near term focused on risk assets. ""This is negative for Italian assets, European shares, the euro and risk assets like shares generally and positive for safe havens like government bonds in ""safe"" countries and gold and some of this reaction has already been seen today,"" Shane Oliver, head of Investment Strategy and Chief Economist at AMP Capital Investors in Australia said in a note to clients. But Oliver added that the stability of the euro zone remains intact. ""More broadly, my view remains that the euro zone is likely to continue to hang together and bouts of market turmoil driven by break-up fears should ultimately be seen as buying opportunities. Just as we have seen since the euro zone crisis began earlier this decade."" However, Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, told CNBC last week that she believed that the referendum in Italy could also provoke another banking crisis in Europe. Italy's stricken banks are holding nearly a third of the 990 billion euros (or more than $1 trillion) of unpaid loans at top euro zone lenders, according to the European Central Bank data. The 14 large Italian banks sit on 286 billion euros (more than $300 billion) of bad loans, debt securities and off-balance sheet items. That corresponds to more than one in every 10 Italian loans. The Italian banking sector has already been performing badly this year, down some 48 percent on the start of 2016. The high levels of toxic loans are a throwback to the euro zone's financial crisis, and what's worse is that they are stopping the banks from lending more, which could kick-start the Italian economy.

Tom DiChristopher,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Oil traders hung on OPEC's every word in 2016, and this year the market could be in for more of the same. After a year of proposed deals, debated deals, and failed deals to reverse two years of low oil prices, OPEC finally put to rest the market's constant speculation by vowing this week to cut production. But the market still has plenty to worry over. Perhaps the chief concern is whether OPEC can cut production enough to balance a global market awash in more oil than it needs, while still preventing prices from rising so high that sidelined U.S. producers to start pumping again. Just one day after the decision, International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol told a conference that OPEC's decision could indeed embolden U.S. drillers. He warned that the oil market is entering a period of greater price fluctuations. However, there is some evidence that crude's rally since the decision was announced will not immediately soar into the danger zone. Since 1998, OPEC has cut production 15 times. A week later, U.S. crude rose 60 percent of the time, with an average return of 1.6 percent, according to analytics tool Kensho. Brent crude traded positively 75 percent of the time, with an average gain of 1.8 percent. (There are only 12 occurrences recorded for Brent.) But a month after cuts, U.S. crude was down 53 percent of the time. The average loss was 1.38 percent. Brent was up 67 percent of the time, but only put up an average gain of 0.16 percent. Market watchers also wonder whether oil producers will stick to the quotas they agreed to this week. OPEC will also decide whether to extend the cuts halfway through 2017, raising the prospect of further volatility as that decision nears. If 2016 proved anything, it was the power of the cartel to move the market — even as experts repeatedly questioned its continuing relevance. CNBC looked at 11 of the biggest OPEC events and announcements. On average, the price of U.S. crude rose or fell 4.2 percent the following day, indicating a high degree of volatility. Amid those major announcements, oil traders had to contend with a flurry of pronouncements from OPEC, as well as from Russian officials. Even an expression of optimism that a deal would get done had the ability to reverse daily losses. ""We came to refer to it as verbal intervention,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital. Traders like Kilduff were keenly aware oil ministers might simply be jawboning the market to put a floor under oil prices. But it was impossible to ignore the latest pronouncements, Kilduff said. OPEC may look like the boy crying wolf, but any one of its missives might have been the real deal — and come back to bite those who hadn't adjusted their positions. ""You kind of had no choice, mostly due to the fact that it was really the Saudis leading the charge,"" he said. ""In the bond market, they say don't fight the Fed. In the oil market, you have to remember not to fight the Saudis."" Saudi Arabia is the world's top oil exporter and OPEC's de facto boss. This year's volatility created ample opportunity for retail traders to buy the dips and cash in on run-ups, said Steven Quirk, head of trading at TD Ameritrade. ""When there's moves like we've seen in energy, it can be 40 percent of our futures trading,"" he told CNBC. ""Normally, it would be maybe 15 or 20 percent,"" he added. The volatility also created a cult trade in instruments  like the VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN. The risky exchange-traded note gave traders the opportunity to reap exponential gains — or take big losses — on the rise and fall of oil prices. The opportunities could continue as Nigeria and Libya — both exempt from output cuts — aim to return supply to the market and nimble U.S. drillers eye the $55 to $60 per barrel range that will make more drilling profitable. ""It's not the old oil market. There's just a lot of flexibility, a lot of moving parts to it. It's going to be volatile,"" Kilduff said. ",OPEC deal: How the cartel may move oil markets
Jacob Pramuk,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Donald Trump's Twitter-fueled provocations of China are underscoring just how much the world's two biggest economies have to lose if tensions were to escalate. Trump risked angering China on Friday by taking a call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen — a first for a U.S. president or president-elect with any Taiwan leader since 1979. For decades, the United States has not recognized Taiwan as a separate state from mainland China. China's foreign ministry lodged a formal diplomatic complaint with Washington, pointing out that it sees U.S. recognition of its ""One China"" policy as a core of the two countries' relations, Reuters reported Saturday. Then Trump provoked China again on Sunday, using Twitter to hammer the country for devaluing its currency, to claim China ""heavily"" and unfairly taxes U.S. exports, and to slam it for military buildup in the South China Sea. The U.S. and China have enormous economic entanglements, and both could be seriously hurt if tensions were to escalate into economic retribution. Neither of the trading partners has clear advantage over the other, and any policy designed to hit the other country's economy may only lead to ""mutual assured destruction,"" analyst Robert Manning said. ""I think everybody loses. And the global economy is even worse when you have the two biggest economies going after one another,"" said Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security. China exported about $482 billion in goods to the U.S. last year, more than any other country exported to the United States, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The U.S. exported about $116 billion in goods to China in 2015, putting its goods trade deficit $366 billion. Many U.S. companies rely on China's low-cost industrial workers to make their merchandise, and U.S. consumers have become accustomed to cheap Chinese imports sold by big big-box retailers and others. China also holds more U.S. debt than any other country, about $1.2 trillion in Treasury securities as of the end of September, according to the Treasury Department. When the United States needs to borrow — which is more or less perpetually — it very often borrows from China. While Trump has directed free-wheeling rhetoric toward China, Beijing's relatively ""cautious"" response may signal that it has decided to punish Taiwan for the Taipei-to-New York phone call, while trying to ""educate"" Trump on U.S.-China relations, said Rodger Baker, vice president of strategic analysis at Stratfor. Still, China was one of the biggest targets of Trump's campaign rhetoric; he repeatedly argued that the Asian giant took American jobs and depressed wages in working-class America. Trump may not soften his pronouncements, and that could increase tension, even if he does not immediately take any drastic economic policy steps toward China, Baker added. Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But to the extent that his past rhetoric can be taken at face value, he clearly believes that the United States has strong economic pressure it can bring to bear against China. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency in order to give its exports an advantage over U.S.-made goods, and he threatened to slap a tariff of up to 45 percent on Chinese imports. That would obviously be a problem for China given that the United States is a critical export market. Many forms of economic punishment would have drawbacks for either side, Manning and Baker said. U.S. impediments to Chinese trade would hurt China, but U.S. companies — and farmers — would likely also lose access to China's growing middle class. ""There are implications of cutting trade and economic activity that hurt U.S. businesses and business operations,"" Baker said. The threatened tariffs could have the same effect, as many U.S. businesses have built supply chains that stretch around the globe, including into China, Manning added. China has the ""nuclear option"" of dumping its U.S. Treasurys. Such a move could roil financial markets in the U.S. by causing shifts in the dollar or interest rates. But even a move that drastic would not present a clear advantage to China, Manning said. Investors — including many of the world's sovereign governments — buy U.S. debt because it is a safe investment. For China to put that money elsewhere, such as into an increasingly unstable euro zone, would create new problems for Beijing. Regardless, Baker said he expects sustained U.S. resistance to China in some key areas, such as impeding Chinese investors from buying property and technology in the United States.

Jennifer Williams,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Donald Trump has been ruffling diplomatic feathers since he was elected by casually talking to world leaders without first getting guidance from the State Department. He's already angered close allies like Britain and India, but his latest phone call threatens to do far more damage. That's because of whom it was with: President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan. This isn't just some charming diplomatic faux pas by Trump — this was a blunder of potentially historic proportions. Trump's call is believed to be the first between a US president-elect and a leader of Taiwan since diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed in 1979. More from Vox: How Italian PM's resignation impacts relationship with Europe Austria just decisively rejected the far-right's presidential candidateThe Army Corps just blocked the route of the Dakota Access Pipeline Trump's transition team may have made matters even worse with its formal statement about the call, which referred to Tsai as the ""President of Taiwan""—a title no American leader has used to refer to the head of Taiwan in decades. The word choice is certain to rankle China, which doesn't recognize the legitimacy of Tsai or any of her predecessors: President-elect Trump spoke with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, who offered her congratulations. During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties exists between Taiwan and the United States. President-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year. Shortly after the transition team issued that statement, Trump took to Twitter and essentially doubled-down, once again referring to Tsai as the ""President of Taiwan"": Donald Trump Tweet: The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! With this phone call, and the follow-up tweet, Trump is risking fundamentally upending decades of US policy toward Taiwan and enraging China, the world's only other superpower. China sees Taiwan not as an independent country, but rather as part of China. The dispute between China and Taiwan goes back to 1949 and the end of the Chinese Civil War, when the defeated Nationalists fled to the island of Taiwan, leaving the communists in power in mainland China. The two territories have been governed separately ever since, with both governments claiming to be the legitimate representative of ""One China""—that is, China and Taiwan. Most countries, including the US, only have formal diplomatic relations with mainland China and don't officially recognize the government in Taiwan—which is why Trump's casual chat with the president of Taiwan, and his seemingly cavalier choice of words when describing Tsai, is so surprising, and so risky. Trump, responding to the immediate groundswell of criticism after the phone call, fired back on Twitter: Donald Trump Tweet: Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. His point is valid — the US does sell Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment. But it betrays a clear lack of understanding of both US policy toward China and of how diplomacy works. Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the US has pledged to ""make available"" to Taiwan various weapons and other military supplies ""as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability."" It's not a defense treaty, but rather a statement of policy that the US will help Taiwan maintain a defense against China. Yet it also makes clear that the US does not formally recognize the government of Taiwan. It's a policy known as ""strategic ambiguity,"" in which the US essentially tries to walk a very fine diplomatic line between supporting its friend Taiwan without upsetting the status quo or angering China. Of course, China could theoretically choose not to give too much weight to Trump's actions, deciding that the president-elect doesn't know what he's doing — and isn't signaling a fundamental shift in US policy. Diplomats from other countries privately say their governments aren't currently taking Trump's pronouncements seriously because they attribute them to ignorance, rather than a change of direction. China is a savvy observer of American politics, and is virtually sure to recognize this as a gaffe. Indeed, a few hours after the incident occurred, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking at a conference, called the move a ""petty act"" by Taiwan and said it wouldn't change the US's longstanding ""One China"" policy. But that doesn't mean it won't do damage. Trump spent the campaign accusing China of manipulating its currency and taking advantage of American businesses, and threatened to take a harder line toward Beijing's aggressive actions in the East and South China Seas. Trump may not realize it, but the US desperately needs Chinese diplomatic support at the United Nations and in reining in nuclear-armed North Korea. Any decision by Beijing to begin selling off its vast holdings of American debt, meanwhile, could throw the US economy into recession. That means that it doesn't matter whether Trump meant to change US policy or not; Beijing may file away the call as it decides how to calibrate its relationship with the new administration — and whether to see Trump as a potentially ally or a potential adversary. Regardless of whether he ""meant it"" or not, China could take actions or make decisions based on those assumptions that could lead to insecurity and potentially even conflict. ""The Chinese leadership will see this as a highly provocative action, of historic proportions,"" Evan Medeiros, former Asia director at the White House National Security Council, told the Financial Times. ""Regardless if it was deliberate or accidental, this phone call will fundamentally change China's perceptions of Trump's strategic intentions for the negative. With this kind of move, Trump is setting a foundation of enduring mistrust and strategic competition for US-China relations."" On Saturday, China's Foreign Ministry reportedly said it had lodged ""stern representations"" with what it called the ""relevant U.S. side,"" urging the careful handling of the Taiwan issue to avoid any unnecessary disturbances in ties. This is at least the third time that a Trump phone call has triggered controversy. He told British Prime Minister Theresa May, ""If you travel to the US you should let me know"" — as if sitting heads of state just pop into other countries unannounced. He also managed to anger India by lavishing praise on Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and promising to visit Pakistan — something President Obama pointedly avoided doing during his two terms because of the two countries' complicated relationship. With this latest call, the president-elect hasn't just caused a headache that Obama will have to deal with during his last weeks in office; he's also given a worrying hint of the kind of diplomatic crises that may erupt once he moves into the White House. ",Trump may have just thrown decades of US-China relations into disarray
Nyshka Chandran,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"U.S-China relations may take a turn for the worse after President-elect Donald Trump publicly insulted the mainland twice in a span of 72 hours. The first incident took place on Friday, when the real-estate billionaire accepted a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, a move that broke nearly four decades of U.S foreign policy. The 10-minute call with a Taiwanese leader was the first by a U.S. head of state since 1979, when Washington first embraced the ""One China"" policy under which Beijing views special territories Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China. Following the call, Trump tweeted: ""The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!"" This post may have further enraged Beijing as mainland media always refer to the Taiwanese head of state as ""leader,"" because the term ""president"" could imply Taiwan is a separate state. In a subsequent tweet that mocked Washington's long-standing relationship with Taipei, Trump said: ""Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call."" China's Foreign Ministry has lodged a diplomatic complaint with U.S. officials, warning that the One China principle was the political basis of bilateral ties, Reuters reported Saturday. Late on Sunday, Trump then accused Beijing of manipulating its currency, unfairly taxing U.S. products and militarizing the South China Sea — also via Twitter. Because his transition team has yet to announce clear policy declarations, the Republican's actions — including tweets and choice of advisers — are being closely watched by a world still trying to figure out the global implications of a Trump administration. ""Trump railing against China on Twitter like it is a Celebrity Apprentice feud is not funny, but deeply, deeply worrying for the world,"" U.K. Labor politician Ed Milliband tweeted on Sunday. Strategists' views on the call with Tsai are mixed: It could be a calculated shift in U.S. foreign policy, a geopolitical game, or simply a rookie mistake. ""Trump's Asia team is broadly hawkish on China and in favor of defending democratic Taiwan on ideological grounds, so the phone call could have been a deliberate signal about a looming policy shift,"" said Ashley Townshend, research fellow at University of Sydney. The president-elect's advisers include many who are openly critical of the mainland, including author Mike Pillsbury and academic Peter Navarro. Others think the phone call may be an intentional move in the game of geopolitics. ""This can be understood as part of a signaling game — a shot across the bow — of how Trump will deal with China,"" said Eduardo Araral, vice dean of research and associate professor at the National University of Singapore. ""Trump is basically telling China he will play hardball. This is a predictable gambit for negotiators — to tell the other party that you are a tough negotiator."" Or America's next president — who reportedly shunned intelligence briefings in the weeks after his election victory — may have simply acted too rashly. ""It's also possible that Trump simply took the call on his advisers' recommendations, without fully appreciating the diplomatic consequences,"" Townshend said. Kellyanne Conway, the president-elect's senior adviser, told Fox News on Sunday that Trump was routinely briefed by ""credible sources"" on international intelligence and was ""fully aware of the One China policy."" But whatever the reasoning, the mixed messages behind the chat with Tsai are sure to have hefty consequences for U.S. policy in Asia. ""If Taiwan thinks it has more American support that it actually does, it might take provocative steps towards Beijing that risk a crisis,"" Townshend said. ""Similarly, if Beijing thinks that Trump's phone call was a rookie error, when it was actually intended to be signal about stronger U.S. policy on Taiwan, the U.S. and China could be on a diplomatic collision course."" Sunday's comment wasn't the first time Trump has complained about China's economic policy. But the aggressive language used by the future commander of the world's No. 1 economy was surprising. ""It's almost as if Trump was looking to kick off China relations as badly as possible,"" Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer tweeted. It remains to be seen how China's President Xi Jinping will react to Trump's statements. ""China has four options to respond: Ignore, calibrate its response, tell Trump it is willing to sit down and talk or play a tit-for-tat game,"" Araral said. Going forward, however, the world could certainly expect more tough words from Trump on China, although, again, it was unclear whether these would be real policy shifts or leverage for a deal, Townshend said. If Trump cannot create the millions of jobs he promised in his election campaign, he may escalate his threat to slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, Aralal warned, thus risking a full-blown trade war between the two heavyweight economies.

After months of bickering and infighting, members of the OPEC cartel have finally reached an agreement to reduce oil production. On Wednesday, the cartel announced plans to reduce its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from recent levels, to 32.5 million bpd. OPEC also said that it expected producers outside the cartel to cut production by 600,000 bpd. News of the deal sent Brent crude prices up by about 8%. Many U.S. energy stocks jumped even more. For example, shares of EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) soared 11% on Wednesday, while shares of Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) skyrocketed a stunning 23%. EOG Resources and Continental Resources Wednesday Stock Performance data by YCharts. Indeed, OPEC hopes to increase oil prices to about $55 to $60 per barrel through its output cuts. Yet the impact of this OPEC agreement depends on the answers to three vital questions. OPEC has stated that producers outside the cartel will help rebalance the oil market by cutting production by 600,000 bpd. Russia, which is currently the world's top oil producer, is critical to achieving these targeted cuts. Russia has agreed to reduce its production by up to 300,000 bpd -- but this is ""conditional on its technical abilities"". Indeed, it is difficult for many Russian oil producers to reduce production without compromising their ability to ramp up output again. Furthermore, since most Russian oil companies are publicly traded, it could be hard to convince any of them to shoulder the burden of cutting production. Even a 300,000 bpd cut would leave Russia producing more oil than it was pumping in the first half of 2016. Still, that would be better than continued growth. We won't find out how serious Russia is about working with OPEC until 2017. An even bigger question is whether OPEC members themselves will abide by the agreement. This week's OPEC deal sets output quotas for most OPEC members. (Libya and Nigeria were exempted.) However, each country has a significant incentive to cheat and pocket a few extra dollars by producing beyond the official quota. In the past, OPEC has suffered significant compliance problems due to this incentive to cheat. Often, Saudi Arabia -- by far the top oil producer within OPEC -- has been forced to shoulder the burden of production cuts singlehandedly. It doesn't seem willing to play this role any longer. If other cartel members ignore their quotas, Saudi Arabia will probably ramp up production again. If the past is any precedent, OPEC may deliver most of its planned production cuts in the next few months. But the higher oil prices go, the greater the incentive for each country to cheat. To maintain higher prices, OPEC will need to stay disciplined over a period of years. Finally, the actions of U.S. oil companies -- especially lower-cost producers like EOG and Continental Resources -- will play a big role in determining how high oil prices rise. On the one hand, these companies don't want to be too aggressive in case oil prices crash again. On the other hand, they have significantly reduced their costs in the past two years, allowing them to thrive with much lower oil prices. U.S. oil producers have dramatically reduced their costs since 2014. Image source: Getty Images. For example, EOG Resources claims that some of its fields are more profitable today with oil at $50/barrel than they would have been in 2012 with oil at $95/barrel. Indeed, with oil above $50, it is profitable to drill in most parts of Texas' prolific Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale. EOG recently set ambitious targets for production growth over the next several years. With a flat $50/barrel WTI oil price, it expects to increase output at a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between now and 2020. If oil prices were sustained at $60 over that period, output would rise at an even more impressive 25% CAGR. Additionally, higher oil prices will encourage oil companies to tap their inventories of drilled but uncompleted wells, providing a relatively quick boost to production. Continental Resources recently started completing wells in North Dakota. It expects to enter 2017 with 175 remaining uncompleted wells. If prices continue to rise, Continental Resources will step up its well completions next year. Higher-cost producers may not be as quick to increase production in 2017 and beyond. But the more oil prices rise, the more U.S. shale producers will ramp up drilling activity. The responsiveness of U.S. oil companies to higher oil prices (in the form of higher production) will help determine whether oil prices as high as $60 can be sustained over the next few years.

Image source: Amazon. E-commerce giant Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) push into groceries continues. The company announced on Monday that it planned to open a concept store in Seattle called Amazon Go, which is billed as having ""the world's most advanced shopping technology."" The 1,800-square-foot store, set to open to the public next year, will use a combination of computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning to automatically track what shoppers have taken off the shelves. When customers are done shopping, they simply walk out, and their Amazon accounts are charged. Any announcement from Amazon, particularly one involving a physical store, is guaranteed to make headlines. But the Amazon Go concept doesn't solve the main problem with grocery shopping. Don't get me wrong: Not having to wait in a checkout line is a great idea. As someone who occasionally perseveres an understaffed Safeway, I can relate. But Amazon Go's small size and limited selection means that it won't eliminate a trip to the grocery store for most people. And it still requires you to wander around the store and grab stuff off the shelf. Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) has a better idea. The company opened the second location of its Pickup and Fuel concept store last week in Thornton, Colorado, just north of Denver. The 4,000-square-foot store is essentially a convenience store, featuring coffee, snacks, and last-minute grocery items, as well as a gas station. The key feature, though, is a dedicated drive-through for picking up online grocery orders. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is making a big online grocery push, equipping its supercenters in more than 100 markets in the U.S. with online grocery pickup capabilities. The Pickup and Fuel stores operate in much the same way: an online grocery order is placed, a pickup time is set, and the groceries are loaded into the customer's car by a Wal-Mart employee. Orders set for pickup at a Pickup and Fuel store are fulfilled by a supercenter nearby, delivered by a refrigerated truck. Given that Wal-Mart is already the leading seller of groceries in the U.S., much of the infrastructure necessary to expand the Pickup and Fuel concept is already in place. For customers, the ability to pick up groceries at a more convenient location, free from the crowds, makes the company's online grocery pickup service more appealing. And the wider selection of anything from Walmart.com is an added bonus. I suspect that Amazon will be piloting plenty of different grocery concepts in the coming years. Amazon Go relies on a lot of technology to make the grocery shopping experience better, but I'd personally rather eliminate the grocery shopping experience altogether and pickup my order from somewhere convenient. According to a report earlier this year from Business Insider, Amazon plans to begin rolling out pilot grocery stores for two different concepts, with a goal of opening 20 stores by the end of 2018. Amazon Go is likely one of these concepts, but the other is rumored to feature a drive-up where customers can pick up their online orders. It's unclear whether this will include fresh groceries – the company's AmazonFresh grocery delivery service is live in just a handful of cities, and it doesn't have the existing grocery infrastructure that Wal-Mart does. Whether the Amazon Go or Wal-Mart Pickup and Fuel concepts have legs is an open question. But one thing is clear: The way in which consumers shop for groceries is going to change. Mediocre grocery stores that succeed simply because they exist are going to face a day of reckoning sooner or later, driven by an increasing array of options. Wal-Mart is making an aggressive push into online groceries, both to maintain its market share and to win new customers. Amazon, faced with the daunting challenge of keeping up its growth rate as it becomes larger, no doubt views groceries as a massive opportunity. The battle between these two giants is just beginning. No matter what happens, the consumer will be the ultimate winner. ","

Image source: The Motley Fool. With Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) stock rising steadily since the presidential election, investors would be smart to start thinking about whether or not it's overvalued. But to do so, of course, you need a sense for how bank stocks are valued for investment purposes. Here's a primer. There are a couple ways bank stocks can be readily valued. Just like any other stock, you can compare how much a bank earns per share relative to its share price. This is done through the price to earnings, or P/E, ratio. In Bank of America's case, it has earned $1.37 a share over the past four quarters. Meanwhile, its shares cost around $21.50 each. This means its P/E ratio is 15.63. There are two ways to interpret this. First, it means that you're paying $15.63 for each dollar's worth of Bank of America's earnings. Or second, you can invert it (divide 1.0 by 15.63) and turn it into an earnings yield -- in this case, 6.4%. Now you can compare these numbers to other investment alternatives. The average stock on the S&P 500 trades at a P/E ratio of 24.35, which is obviously higher than Bank of America's stock. This may go without saying, but because this method lends itself so easily to comparisons, it's a great approach to use. When it comes to bank stocks, though, there's another approach that industry analysts and commentators tend to prefer. This is the price to tangible book value ratio, which is calculated by dividing a bank's share price by its tangible book value per share (you can get the latter from the ""consolidated financial highlights"" page in Bank of America's quarterly financial supplement, which you can find here). In Bank of America's case, its tangible book value per share is $17.14. Meanwhile, its share price is $21.50. Thus, its price to tangible book value ratio is 1.20, meaning it trades for a 20% premium to its tangible book value. As someone who writes about and invests in bank stocks myself, this is the metric I prefer to use. I say that because bank earnings, and Bank of America's in particular, tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and year to year. This throws off the P/E ratio, making it hard for the average investor to know whether or not Bank of America's stock is actually cheap or expensive at a particular point in time. The only thing that fluctuates regularly in the price to tangible book value ratio, by contrast, is the share price. This makes it easier to isolate whether or not the share price seems to be under- or overvaluing a stock. So, how can you tell? As a general rule, banks will trade from anywhere between half of book value (a 50% discount to tangible book value) and two times tangible book value (a 100% premium to tangible book value). For a good bank that's reasonably well run, a threshold that essentially all of the large banks currently satisfy, your goal should be to buy bank stocks either below or as close to 1.0 times tangible book value as you can. Once they cross 1.5 times tangible book value, the upside is pretty limited. And as they approach 2.0 times tangible book value, it's fair to assume that the downside will outweigh the upside. With respect to Bank of America, then, with a price to tangible book value ratio of 1.20, there's no reason to think it's egregiously overpriced. At the same time, though, it's also clear that the bank's shares are no longer a screaming bargain. This is why bank analysts over the past few weeks have begun downgrading its stock from buy to hold. ","

In the early days of the 2016 election, when Donald Trump was just a notion, and people were warming up to having a corporate CEO as president, there was considerable speculation that Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz might enter the race. It wasn't a crazy idea given that Schultz has always been outspoken politically, and he has not hesitated to throw his company into controversial areas. That has not always been the easiest choice for the brand, as efforts at promoting discussions of race and even offering inclusive, rather than Christmas-specific, red holiday cups have resulted in negative feedback for the company. Although we have built an iconic brand while providing even part-time employees with access to healthcare, free college education and stock options, there is more we can do as a public company to demonstrate responsible leadership. That sounded like both a reason to not run against Clinton, who he supported, but a bit of a stump speech for a future run. Now, Schultz has stepped down as Starbucks CEO, though remains involved in growing the company, and while he still denies that he intends to run in 2020, he may be at least considering it. Howard Schultz (left) and incoming CEO Kevin Johnson Image source: Starbucks. The man who led Starbucks from a small company that only sold coffee beans, to a global phenomenon has said he is stepping down in order to lead his company's efforts to create a bigger brand based on its Roastery location in Seattle. That entrepreneurial effort to once again change how Americans consume coffee may well be appealing to Schultz, but it's also possible it's not something he views as a long-term task. And, while he is leaving the CEO job, Schultz, as chairman of the company, still plans to oversee its efforts on ""social impact initiatives."" That's a powerful bully pulpit for the left-leaning CEO to still take clear stands in opposition to the assumed actions of incoming president Donald Trump. By denying his interest in running in 2020, Schultz can protect the Starbucks brand, which has already faced some backlash for its CEO's leftist leanings. But, by stepping down and handing over the top job to COO Kevin Johnson, Schultz has begun to create some needed separation from the brand he created were he to consider making a bid for the presidency. After Clinton's loss, there is no clear standard-bearer of the Democratic Party. Schultz, a business success, would be a logical contender in 2020. He has the CEO experience of the president-elect while also showing that it's possible to make money -- a lot of money -- while still doing right by your employees. There would be no benefit for Schultz in declaring his candidacy now and it would hurt the Starbucks brand. In two years, however, when the 2020 field takes shape and Johnson has been well established as Starbucks' CEO, running for president may very well make sense for a business leader who has a strong history of putting workers' success on equal or even higher footing than corporate profits. Stepping down as CEO is not Schultz getting into the 2020 race, but it is him clearing the decks in case he decides to. Whether he chooses to do that likely depends on what Trump does during the first half of his term, and whether that creates public demand for a different kind of CEO to try to take over as commander in chief.

Image source: LinkedIn. Software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now the official owner of professional network LinkedIn. The blockbuster $26.2 billion deal, announced in June, is Microsoft's largest acquisition ever by a large margin (the second-largest acquisition was Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011), and it makes plenty of sense on a strategic level, given both companies' comprehensive focus on the enterprise, productivity, and professionals. But Microsoft has a poor record when it comes to massive acquisitions. ""Poor"" might even be too generous; the software giant's track record is downright awful. The two worst deals in recent memory were aQuantive ($6 billion) and Nokia's handset business ($7.2 billion), both of which resulted in massive impairments and writedowns as Microsoft failed to execute. The key distinction here is that most of Microsoft's failed acquisitions were made under Steve Ballmer, and Satya Nadella has now been CEO for over two-and-a-half years. Of course, Microsoft has made many acquisitions under Nadella (nearly three dozen), but most of those were fairly small and targeted. LinkedIn will be the biggest test on the acquisition front, and any success or failure to execute on the vision for LinkedIn will strongly reflect on Nadella's leadership record. The bar for success will be high, given the price tag. I've said this before, but it's not just about what you buy, but also what you pay for it. By sheer virtue of the price, Microsoft will create a commensurately high level of risk should things go sideways. The transaction will definitely increase Microsoft's goodwill by a meaningful amount. In accounting for goodwill, Microsoft will need to measure the fair value of acquired assets, which can potentially differ from the current carrying value on LinkedIn's balance sheet. It will also need to net out the fair value of liabilities that it's assuming, and it's worth noting that the $26.2 billion valuation is inclusive of cash acquired and refers to enterprise value, which includes the debt that Microsoft is buying. Fair value analyses are often conducted by third-party valuation companies. Microsoft was carrying $21.4 billion in goodwill and net intangibles at the end of last quarter. The context for the high price is that LinkedIn was already publicly trading at fairly high multiples, as investors were pricing in long-term growth (40% plunge earlier this year notwithstanding). In fact, that earnings-related sell-off likely set the stage for this acquisition, as it made shares that much cheaper. Plus, there was the whole bidding war with salesforce.com, which reportedly kicked off the festivities around $160 to $165 per share. Microsoft ended up paying $196 per share. LinkedIn has become a powerful force in professional networking, and it would be a shame if Microsoft somehow screwed it up. That's why it's encouraging that LinkedIn will still mostly operate independently, in order to maintain its strong brand and culture. For now, Nadella deserves the benefit of the doubt, as he has delivered handsome returns to shareholders so far thanks largely to executing on cross-platform strategies, something that was never possible under Ballmer. Let's hope he follows through with LinkedIn and puts an end to Microsoft's bad rap. ","

Last Thursday, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) announced that visionary CEO Howard Schultz will step down next April, handing the leadership reins to top deputy Kevin Johnson. This is the second time Schultz has retired from the top job at Starbucks. The last time he departed, the chain eventually lost its way, first over-expanding, and then getting creamed by the Great Recession. Not surprisingly, many investors are wary of Schultz retiring again. Howard Schultz plans to step down as Starbucks CEO in 2017. Image source: The Motley Fool. However, this executive transition is likely to be much smoother than Schultz's first retirement. Most importantly, Starbucks is a far more established company today than it was in 2000. Additionally, Schultz plans to remain actively involved in his role as executive chairman, overseeing the company's growing Starbucks Reserve brand and its social impact initiatives. Today, investors take Starbucks' dominance of the coffee market for granted. However, in 2000, Starbucks had fewer than 3,000 stores globally and fewer than 400 outside the U.S. Annual revenue was a little over $2 billion. Starbucks has since become a global behemoth with more than 25,000 stores -- about half of those outside the U.S. -- and $21 billion of revenue last year. Despite its massive scale, it is expected to grow revenue by nearly 10% annually over the next two years. The upshot is that Starbucks has a lot more momentum now than it did 16 years ago. It also continues to have plenty of room for expansion, particularly in China, where it plans to double its store count by 2021. Starbucks is expanding rapidly (and successfully) in China. Image source: The Motley Fool. Howard Schultz's designated successor, Kevin Johnson (currently Starbucks' president and COO) spent the vast majority of his career in the tech industry. His promotion to the top job means that Starbucks is likely to continue its focus on technological excellence as a key sales driver. Starbucks already has a heavily used and highly rated mobile app. Roughly a quarter of Starbucks' U.S. transactions now go through the app. The relatively new mobile order and pay feature is also gaining in popularity, helping customers avoid lines while improving employee productivity. As CEO, Johnson is likely to keep a close eye on the further development of Starbucks' mobile app. As the app improves, it should drive higher customer engagement, ultimately boosting demand. Meanwhile, broader consumer acceptance of the mobile order and pay feature could enable a step-change improvement in the profitability of Starbucks cafes. While Schultz has made it clear that Johnson will be in charge of Starbucks' day-to-day activities as CEO, Schultz will remain actively involved in building up the Starbucks Reserve brand. Starbucks is set to open several new Starbucks Reserve Roasteries across the world in the next few years. It could eventually operate 20-30 roasteries, supporting a network of about 1,000 upscale Starbucks Reserve coffee shops. The company also plans to offer pricier Starbucks Reserve coffee in more of its regular stores going forward. The first Starbucks Reserve Roastery opened two years ago in Seattle. Image source: Starbucks. Starbucks Reserve arguably represents the company's biggest remaining growth opportunity in the U.S. By going upscale, Starbucks hopes to entice existing customers to spend more while also luring in some new customers who are currently loyal to smaller boutique coffee shops. By stepping down from the CEO role, Schultz should be able to give this key growth opportunity his full attention in the next few years. He will be able to translate his vision for the Starbucks Reserve brand into a reality and develop it into a mature concept before handing it off to the next generation of Starbucks' management at some point in the future. Schultz's retirement from the CEO job isn't likely to have a negative impact on the company's operations during the next few years. The biggest risk is that Starbucks gradually loses focus over the next five years or more, which is essentially what happened after Schultz stepped aside in 2000. However, Starbucks is a much stronger company today than it was in 2000 and it has an established formula for success. This makes it less likely to lose its way. Meanwhile, it has been clear for a few years that Schultz intended to back away from a day-to-day role sooner rather than later. His new focus on building up the Starbucks Reserve brand will keep him engaged and could unlock valuable long-term growth opportunities for the company. Howard Schultz may be retiring as CEO, but he isn't done making his imprint on Starbucks. ","
      
    Starbucks Can Thrive Without Howard Schultz As CEO -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Outgoing Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz loves coffee, and his leadership changed how Americans consume it. He took what was once just a coffee roaster and turned it into his own vision of an Italian coffee bar. Schultz, who has said he drinks about five cups of his company's signature beverage each day, changed the coffee house into a ""third place"" between work and home, while introducing many Americans to espresso-based beverages. The coffee chain's longtime CEO has been accused of numerous crimes against coffee, with many enthusiasts decrying that he created the ""half caf, light foam, soy milk, vanilla latte"" crowd. Schultz, who has also been castigated by purists for inventing the Frappuccino, sees things differently: Instead of diluting the coffee-drinking experience, he has brought it to the masses. The man who starts his day by making a French press of coffee for himself and his wife, who then follows that up with a double-shot espresso macchiato from a Starbucks store, according to People.com, has displayed a clear love for coffee simplicity. But he also understands that for many, coffee's simple pleasures are an acquired taste. Schultz has done many things as CEO of Starbucks to make it the premier coffee company in the world, and now that he has, he recognizes that he's no longer the man to lead the brand forward. Last week, the company announced that Schultz would be stepping down as CEO in April, though still remain involved in the company. And that makes sense, because Starbucks' next steps are not about coffee, they are about execution, operational efficiency, and technology. Starbucks' Mobile Order & Pay app will drive growth for the company going forward. Image source: Starbucks. While it's reasonable to think that Schultz, who has led Starbucks as it has become a pioneer in integrating technology into its customer experience, could have continued to do a good job, his hand-picked replacement, Kevin Johnson (the company's president and chief operating officer), has three decades of technology-industry experience. In fact, it could be argued that as COO Johnson deserves much of the credit for making the chain a first mover in mobile order and pay, integrating gift cards and payments into its app, and digitizing its rewards program. Kevin Johnson. Image source: Starbucks. Johnson, who held leadership positions at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and served as CEO of Juniper Networks, may not have Schultz's ingrained love of coffee, but changing how people drink coffee and winning global acceptance is no longer the job of Starbucks' CEO. That mission has already been accomplished, and now the chain's leader has to find ways to continue same-store-sales growth while bringing its products to new places. Those are technology problems. Johnson, who as COO ""drives Starbucks global growth agenda ... with a focus on partner (employee) and customer-facing innovations,""has already shown a strong ability to do that. Mobile Order & Pay, Johnson explained during the company's most-recent earnings call, now accounts for 6% of transactions. In about 3,300 of its stores, he added, 10% of peak transactions are handled that way while in 600 stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 20% of orders at peak, triple the number from last year. ""The data shows that Mobile Order & Pay is making a difference for both our partners and our customers,"" he said during the call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required). ""For customers, Mobile Order & Pay provides a simple, elegant ordering experience, enabling convenience when they want it and rewards them with stars along the way. For partners [employees], Mobile Order & Pay reduces line congestion; enables a more efficient in-store operation."" Basically, Mobile Order & Pay makes stores more efficient because it lets the limited amount of people who can fit behind the counter focus more on production and less on order-taking. That's a big win for customers that drives sales by shortening how long it takes to get your order both for the technology users and those who choose to wait in a now-shorter line. It's a brilliant strategy impressively executed, but it has nothing to do with coffee. While it's possible that part of Schultz's stepping aside has to do with his at least considering broader ambitions, his immediate task remains focusing on coffee. In his new role he will be leading the company's efforts to expand its high-end Roastery business -- a very coffee-focused task. The outgoing leader, however, acknowledged that the company's focus has changed. ""Our record performance does not yet reflect what may be the most important strategic developments since Starbucks first changed how the world consumes coffee,"" he said during the earnings call. ""The initiatives we have underway that are elevating the Starbucks brand, transforming the customer experience and setting the foundation for the next wave of growth in our business."" Schultz is right. Coffee is not Starbucks' driving force going forward. Technology is. That makes Johnson the leader it needs right now. ","

Adam Levine-Weinberg,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Top U.S. automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) reported solid growth in deliveries during November. Investors cheered the news, sending both stocks significantly higher on Thursday. General Motors and Ford Thursday Stock Performance data by YCharts. However, automakers benefited significantly from extra selling days last month, relative to November 2015. The key question is whether GM and Ford will be able to maintain their momentum during December, when they won't benefit from a favorable calendar shift. GM's sales in the U.S. surged 10% last month to 252,644 vehicles. Looking just at retail sales, deliveries were up 8% year over year to 197,609. GM's midsize pickups (the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon) continued to be standouts, with sales up 43% year over year in November. But the General reported strong gains across most of its truck and SUV lineup. Across town at Ford, total U.S. sales rose 5% during November. Retail sales jumped 10%, offset by a planned decline in fleet sales. Even more than at GM, Ford's gains were driven by strong demand for pickups and SUVs. The launch of its next-generation Super Duty trucks helped Ford sell more than 72,000 F-Series trucks during November, up 11% year over year. Demand for SUVs and pickups remained strong last month. Image source: The Motley Fool. Many investors have been skeptical about the strength of auto demand lately. They argue that automakers are propping up their sales results by ramping up discounts, which will damage their profitability. Indeed, GM increased its incentives on full-size pickups by 46% year over year through the first three weeks of November, according to J.D. Power. Its average incentive on full-size trucks sold during that period was $5,753, compared to $4,467 for Ford. However, GM and Ford have typically averaged around $10,000 of profit per full-size truck sold. The steady shift in customer preferences toward pricier option packages is making the full-size truck business even more profitable these days. Marking down prices by an extra $1,000 or $2,000 won't hurt that much. More broadly, GM and Ford are benefiting from rising average transaction prices as consumers focus their interest on pricier trucks and SUVs while turning away from small cars. This has allowed GM in particular to earn record profits this year despite offering higher incentives. Rising incentive spending isn't as much of a red flag as some investors believe. Nevertheless, auto sales were artificially inflated during November. The real culprit was a shift in the timing of weekends and holidays that added two selling days to the month, compared to November 2015. November auto sales were boosted by a favorable calendar shift. Image source: The Motley Fool. Thus, while industry sales rose as much as 5% last month, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of auto sales likely declined by about 2%. Adjusting for the extra selling days would wipe out the vast majority (if not all) of the sales gains at both GM and Ford. Last month's sales results were certainly positive news for General Motors and Ford shareholders. But December will be the real test for both automakers. First of all, automakers won't be able to rely on extra selling days to drive growth this month. Second, in recent years, December has had the highest sales volume of any month. Indeed, GM and Ford both sold 27% more vehicles in December 2015 than in November 2015. A strong showing in December would be a good sign that automakers may be able to keep sales at or near record levels in 2017. For General Motors, delivering a good December sales result is particularly crucial. Dealer inventories have been rising sharply at GM in recent months, including an increase of nearly 40,000 units in November. GM ended the month with 874,162 vehicles in inventory, equal to 87 days' supply, compared to 691,133 vehicles (or 69 days' supply) a year earlier. Automakers typically sell more vehicles than they build in December. GM needs to sell through a good chunk of its inventory this month -- otherwise, it could be forced to raise discounts to a level that really would damage profitability during 2017. ","

John Rosevear,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) said that its U.S. sales rose 5% in November, a good result aided by a quirk of the calendar and strong demand over the Black Friday weekend. Data source: Ford Motor Company. About that quirk of the calendar: Last month had two more selling days than did November 2015, making for an especially favorable year-over-year comparison. ""Selling days"" exclude Sundays and other days when new-car dealers are typically closed. Ford's new-for-2017 Super Duty pickups are off to a strong and profitable start. Image source: Ford Motor Company. After a rough October, the Blue Oval fared much better in November, with strong results for three of Ford's biggest profit drivers: Pickups, SUVs, and the Lincoln luxury brand. Pickups: Sales of the F-Series pickup line, the most important single driver of Ford's profits, rose 10.6% to 72,089 on strong demand for the all-new 2017 Super Duty models. That outpaced both Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (NYSE:FCAU) Ram pickup line (up 8%) and General Motors' (NYSE:GM) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra siblings (up a combined 4.3%). Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said on Thursday that 71% of Super Duty sales in November were of higher-trim (Lariat and above) and higher-profit models. As it did when launching the then-new 2015 F-150, Ford has prioritized retail orders for high-specification trucks to maximize profitability while it works to build inventories. Better yet for Ford shareholders, that sales gain wasn't driven by incentives. Ford's incentives on the F-Series averaged $4,467 per truck last month, according to J.D. Power figures made available to The Motley Fool. That's significantly lower than the payouts made by GM ($5,753) and FCA ($6,062) on their full-size trucks last month, and unchanged from October. SUVs: As a group, sales of Ford-brand SUVs rose 20.2% last month. The Escape (up 10.6%), Edge (up 32.2%), Explorer (up 13.9%), and big Expedition (up 74.6%) all posted solid gains. LaNeve said that the group's gains were entirely driven by profitable retail sales, and that the group's sales pace is running close to Ford's all-time record levels of SUV sales, which was set in 2001. Sales of the midsize Lincoln MKX crossover continued to be very strong last month. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Lincoln: The brand's sales jumped 19%, far outpacing gains for the premium segment as a whole. The brand's biggest star may be the all-new Continental sedan, with 1,419 sold last month -- nearly triple the year-ago sales of its predecessor, the now-departed MKS. Sales of the brand's three highest-volume products were all up: the midsize MKZ sedan (up 9.3%), the compact MKC crossover SUV (up 14.4%) and the midsize MKX SUV (up 30.2%). LaNeve said that Lincoln's average transaction price was up about $1,600 from a year ago, versus a roughly $300 gain for the premium segment overall. The good news is that Ford's year-over-year gain kept pace with most of its five largest rivals -- only GM had a better month. Data sources: The automakers. Year-to-date sales are through Nov. 30, 2016. Better yet, the mix of sales was a good one, with Ford's retail sales up 10% while its fleet sales were down 9%. (The fleet drop was expected: Ford's deliveries to rental-car fleets were front-loaded in 2016, meaning that most of them happened early in the year.) It's a big change from the dismal results that the Blue Oval posted in October. But investors should take both results with a grain of salt. While new-vehicle sales in the U.S. are still at extremely strong levels, auto sales are cyclical -- and the peak of this cycle was probably late in 2015. Up-and-down months are typical at this stage of the cycle, as automakers use incentives and other tools to try to generate incremental growth in a market that's roughly flat overall. Long story short: It was a good month for Ford in ways that bode well for its fourth-quarter profit. But investors shouldn't get too excited about either up or down months at this stage in the cycle. The thing to watch is Ford's incentive spending -- and the good news for profitability is that it's still relatively modest right now. ","

Rick Munarriz,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) opened lower on Tuesday after some cautionary comments were made at an analyst conference. Chairman and co-CEO Steve Ells had a presentation Tuesday morning at the Barclays Eat, Sleep, Play -- It's Not All Discretionary Conference, and it didn't exactly ooze confidence. Ells concedes that he's nervous about the chain's ability to hit the guidance it put out in late October, calling for same-restaurant sales to dip in the low single-digits during the current quarter and rise in the high single-digits for all of 2017. He also made some comments about dropping the ball when it comes to customer service and suggesting that the company may be amenable to activist Bill Ackman's call to shake up the boardroom. Chipotle investors have already had it rough over the past year as food-borne illness outbreaks smacked the brand around. The stock has shed half of its value since hitting an all-time high two summers ago. It seemed as if the worst was behind the chain after four rough quarters of double-digit declines in comps, but now let's look at a few things that may be slowing Chipotle's revival. Chipotle has a throughput problem, the issue that Ells was discussing when he admitted that the chain needs to improve its customer service. It's been clear to me the dozen or so times that I have hit up a local outpost. On Monday I drove by a Chipotle, saw a dozen people in line, and just kept driving. I had no problem waiting a couple of years ago in lines 30- or 40-deep because those went by quickly, but it's been a different story these days. At its prime, Chipotle's top restaurants were cranking out as many as 350 transactions an hour during the peak lunch period. That's freakishly atypical. The average store rang up roughly a third as many sales per hour. However, even by the normal standards I'd bet that your typical Chipotle isn't ringing up transactions every 30 seconds or so. There are several reasonable explanations for the deterioration of Chipotle's throughput. Let's start with the initial staffing adjustment after patrons got weirded out about playing gastrointestinal roulette when the stories began to break late last year. Here's a photo I took at 5:20 p.m. at a local Chipotle 13 months ago. There's no one in line, and just two hires working in the front of the house. Image source: Author's image. Staffing has picked up as traffic begins a gradual sequential recovery, but the employees could be out of practice. They could have forgotten the speed demons that they used to be as they put pit crews to shame with their feverish burrito-assembling skills. Chipotle has also made things harder on itself. There are more protein choices for guests to ponder since the addition of chorizo. Mobile orders are picking up, slowing down the process for walk-ins. There's also the frenetic pace of promotions. Folks firing up their smartphones to show BOGO offers or hand over the now-defunct Chiptopia cards do gum things up at the register. The chain also took steps to make its food safer earlier this year. While it's open for debate if the food doesn't taste as good or if the additional steps slow down the process, it's one more item just waiting to be tapped as a scapegoat for the chain's funk. Chipotle likely lost sight of the importance of its once lightning-quick throughput. I'm not suggesting that slow service was implemented by design -- though it does make Chipotle eateries appear more busy and popular -- but it probably didn't seem like a priority when business was slow and it had bigger problems on its plate. Chipotle's paying an unknown price for the assembly line slowdown, and it's great to see Ells admit that it's a problem hungry for a remedy. ","

Stratfor analysts,12082016,MarketWatch,12012016,"Published: Dec 7, 2016 10:26 a.m. ET Predicting threats is part science, part art By It has been 75 years since Japan launched its surprise attack on the United States at Pearl Harbor, and in that time, the raid has lived in the infamy that President Franklin D. Roosevelt described. The events that unfolded on Dec. 7, 1941, have been the subject of intense scrutiny and countless rehashings through the years, noted as much for their military tactics as for their role in drawing the United States into World War II. But just as important as the attack and its aftermath are the dynamics that preceded them. Though the strike on the Hawaiian naval base came as a shock to the United States, it did not come without warning. For those of us in the business of forecasting, Pearl Harbor offers a sobering case study on the shortcomings of intelligence and prediction. Analysis Compared with the elaborate infrastructure that the United States boasts today, the country’s intelligence apparatus was inchoate in the early 1940s. Nevertheless, analysts and military leaders had been tasked with monitoring and assessing Japan for a potential threat. For months before the attack, the United States had been engaged in high-level negotiations with Japan to stabilize the situation in East Asia. As the talks deteriorated, U.S. intelligence intercepted communications indicating that Tokyo did not see a future for its diplomatic relations with the United States. American communications specialists had broken the codes Japan was using for diplomatic missives and could read the messages Tokyo sent to its various embassies, including instructions sent just ahead of the attack for diplomatic posts to destroy all sensitive materials. Read: Will Donald Trump reverse America’s post-Pearl Harbor economic policies? Yet when the Imperial Japanese Navy struck Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Pacific Fleet was sitting unaware and vulnerable in port. The United States knew of Japan’s preparations for hostilities, but it came up short in understanding Tokyo’s thinking and anticipating its strategy. A misjudged threat One of the U.S. military’s gravest errors leading up to the attack was underestimating Japan’s military capabilities. U.S. intelligence on Japan was woefully out of date, thanks to Tokyo’s secrecy and Washington’s lack of deep contacts in the country. The United States assumed, for instance, that Japanese vessels lacked the fuel capacity needed to bring them in range of Pearl Harbor. Analysts pegged U.S. military positions in the Philippines and Guam as more likely targets. In addition, the U.S. military mistakenly thought that Japan’s torpedoes would be ineffective in the relatively shallow waters of Pearl Harbor and that its air force still relied on designs copied from other militaries. Without the intelligence necessary to update their understanding, U.S. analysts and military commanders could not account for the steady improvements Japan’s military had made over the preceding 20 years. Consequently, when signs of the impending attack were detected — American naval vessels spotted submarines outside Pearl Harbor on the morning of Dec. 7, and radar picked up aircraft that were misidentified as U.S. B-17 bombers — they were not interpreted as such. The United States’ military and intelligence analysts made another fateful mistake in failing to consider Japan’s point of view in the runup to the assault. American analysts’ own biases colored their assessments of U.S.-Japanese relations and initially led them to dismiss the possibility that Japan would be so foolhardy as to wage war on a country with 10 times its industrial capacity. Little did they understand that Tokyo considered the oil and steel embargo placed on it by the United States as an existential threat and felt that it needed to act quickly — no matter the consequences — before it ran out of supplies. Furthermore, the analysts based their evaluation on the assumption that Japan would attack the United States only to engage it in a full-blown war. But in striking Pearl Harbor, Tokyo had merely intended to weaken the United States to keep Washington from interfering with its campaign in East Asia. The pitfalls of strategic intelligence Though intelligence fallacies and faulty forecasting are seldom as consequential as they were in the case of Pearl Harbor, recent history offers numerous examples of similar challenges and oversights. Few foresaw the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, despite the unrest that had been brewing throughout the Middle East and North Africa. What began as a series of protests in 2010 soon exploded into a wave of popular revolt against governments that, like much of the international community, had underestimated the extent of public dissatisfaction and the political force that disenfranchised youth and labor unions could bring to bear. Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 provides another study in the fallibility of forecasting. The crisis unfolding in Ukraine was unmistakable, and Moscow’s involvement was clear, but even so, few observers could imagine a foreign power annexing a European territory in the 21st century. The hybrid warfare method that Russia used, moreover, came as a surprise to the rest of the world, even though it had been enshrined in that country’s military theory since the waning days of the Cold War. There is, of course, no silver bullet with which to overcome the inevitable pitfalls of strategic intelligence. Even the soundest methods and the best intelligence collection assets can yield erroneous conclusions. Avoiding mistakes, or at least minimizing them, is a matter of analytical culture — from the profiles and training of the analysts to the way they approach their task, communicate with one another and present intelligence to its intended audience. To a great extent, strategic intelligence is as much an art as it is a science, requiring fluid levels of creativity and imagination that defy the constraints of a set methodology. Still, to properly assess a situation and correctly interpret information, analysts must have a firm foundation of subject-matter expertise and rigorous procedures to guide them. As one gets further away from tactical intelligence, assessments depend more and more on probability. The complexity and nuance of a given situation may be difficult for an analyst to accurately assess and even harder to communicate between layers of analysis or to consumers such as policymakers. The demands of strategic intelligence are constantly evolving, as is the discipline itself. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States’ intelligence capabilities were in their infancy and did not begin to develop in earnest until after World War II concluded. But the infamous battle offers lessons in strategic intelligence that still ring true 75 years later.

The currency traded as low as $1.0505 late Sunday, its lowest level since March 16 2015. On Sunday, Italian voters overwhelming rejected a slate of constitutional reforms. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who has led the country since 2014, announced he was stepping down, as was widely expected. Renzi’s decision to resign and the rejection of constitutional reforms roiled Italy’s embattled banking sector and raises questions about the future of the Italian government and that of the European trading bloc. Ahead of the vote, investors worried that a rejection could set the stage for early elections to be held in 2017. But early elections are unlikely, as Renzi’s ruling coalition appears set to retain power by leading a provisional government until the next general election in 2018. ”Markets were concerned that we might see a scenario where snap elections might be called, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. That’s been perceived as a positive [for the euro],” said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho. Investors appear to have determined that the referendum’s defeat ultimately won’t derail the constitutional-reform process in Italy, which is also supporting the euro. “Clearly the referendum was rejected but that doesn’t mean efforts to shore up the banking sector, and fix problems with competitiveness and the country’s lack of economic efficiencies will end,” said Valentin Marinov, chief G-10 currency strategist at Crédit Agricole.

However, shares of Italian banking stocks held on to their initial losses, with shares of UniCredit S.p.a, Italy’s largest lender, down 5.6% at €1.97. But the outlook for the euro could soon change. If the European Central Bank reauthorizes its €80 billion ($85 billion) a month bond-buying program, the currency could come under pressure once again, Harajli said. Read:  What to know now that Italy has voted ‘no,’ with Renzi set to step down The euro has fallen sharply since President-elect Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Presently, its trading just above lows seen in the early 2000s, shortly after the currency was launched. The euro began life in 1999 trading at $1.17, but spent most of its early life below $1. While much of its recent drop is due to a stronger dollar, analysts point to the Italian referendum as another key factor. Indeed, a negative result is a blow to the country’s ruling coalition, while bolstering the populist 5 Star Movement, currently Italy’s largest political opposition, and possibly other euroskeptics across the Continent. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned following the vote, as he had said he would if Italians rejected the reforms. The euro’s early reaction was still muted enough to suggest that financial markets had mostly priced in a negative vote in the referendum and are unlikely to seize up. “We’ve been short the euro for quite some time,” said Gregory McGreevey, chief executive officer of Invesco Fixed Income, who said his firm’s bet against Italian sovereign bonds had also delivered good results over the past few weeks. The extent of the political risk facing the European project will become clearer as the fallout from the Italian referendum unfolds, analysts say. Despite Renzi’s pledge to resign, many believe he could be succeeded by a grand coalition, which would keep the 5 Star Movement at bay. Austria’s rejection of populism in Sunday’s presidential election is likely to provide some optimism to markets, ahead of a complicated political calendar in 2017. the Netherlands, France and Germany are all facing key elections with euroskeptic parties on the rise. Still, some said the euro would likely continue to face pressure due to turmoil in global politics. “Populism is on the rise,” said Ben Sy, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at J.P. Morgan Chase’s private bank in Asia, pointing to the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union, the election of Donald Trump in the U.S. and now the referendum in Italy. “That will undermine the euro as a currency,” he added.

Read: The other loser in Italy’s vote — its big banks Although the referendum officially was on Renzi’s plan for a legislative overhaul, the vote was widely seen as a vote of confidence in the prime minister and his government. There’s concern now the result sets the stage for a political shake-up that ultimately could lead Italy out of the eurozone. “Exactly what this means for markets still needs to be determined, but the uncertainty this brings certainly won’t be welcomed,” said Tony Cross, market analyst at TopTradr, in a note. “However, this should make the recapitalization of Italy’s struggling banks that bit harder, and Mario Draghi had pledged that any volatility stemming from this could be met with further extensions to ECB bond buying,” he said. The vote took place before the ECB’s policy meeting on Thursday, at which it will discuss its bond-buying program. Supporting Italy would come from “first and foremost the continued and current pace of the QE program at 80 billion euros a month. The expectations that are being floated around a bit that that could be cut to €60 billion a month — that wouldn’t be helpful to Italy in the short-term,” said Jim Smigiel, portfolio manager of SEI’s Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund

The following chart shows that the sector has recovered quite a bit from its bottom in January, though it’s still much lower than it was before the financial crisis hit in 2008 and before the current cycle began in July 2014 after U.S. shale-oil producers had altered the competitive landscape: With OPEC’s action, a revised 3.2% GDP growth rate for the U.S. economy in the third quarter and an ADP report showing 216,000 net jobs added during November, a roaring economy could provide strong support for higher oil prices. Before the announcement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said in his daily Energy Report that if cartel members were to comply with an agreement for a production reduction of 1.1 million barrels a day, “we should see oil head back toward $60 a barrel.” OPEC agreed to slash production by 1.2 million barrels a day. The potential for another $10 increase in the price of oil, along with all the positive economic indicators, should prompt analysts to raise earnings estimates and price targets for oil companies. After all, during periods of market turmoil, analysts try to “get ahead” of the wave. So we may still be in an early period for the oil-stock rally. Want news about Asia delivered to your inbox?

Michael J. Hicks,12082016,MarketWatch,12012016,"Published: Dec 3, 2016 7:17 a.m. ET This is about the backdrop for 21st-century jobs that are quickly replacing assembly plants of the 1960s By The deal put together by Donald Trump and Michael Pence to save 800 manufacturing jobs in Indianapolis and the accompanying visit to that factory offers a ripe opportunity for cynicism. After all, this plant owned by Carrier Corp. is a marginally profitable, mid-20th-century assembly plant with a modestly educated workforce — just the sort of situation where automation, if not outright moves to factories abroad, have wiped out millions of American factory jobs in recent decades. Even if Trump announces a deal like this one every day of an eight-year presidency, the United States will still have fewer manufacturing jobs than now, and close to 9 million less than the peak manufacturing employment year of 1977. This surely is a triumphant moment for some Carrier workers, and yet it is easy to make the claim that this was a meaningless piece of political theater. But embedded in this deal is a much stronger signal about the urgency of the Trump-Pence economic policies that the skeptics overlook. It starts with a backstory about American manufacturing. Nationwide, manufacturing employment has been on the decline since 1977, and here in Indiana since 1973. In contrast, American manufacturing production hit a new peak in 2015 (the latest year for which we have data). Experts argue over whether automation accounts for either eight or nine out of every 10 jobs lost in this sector. No matter how you slice the numbers, the outsourcing of American manufacturing is a sideshow to the productivity-induced employment declines. The Carrier deal, with its $7 million of state tax credits and training grants spread out over 10 years, wasn’t about keeping 20th-century jobs in Indianapolis, where the booming manufacturing sector is desperate for trained workers. After all, this deal is no better than what the company was offered last spring. This is about making the U.S. business landscape ready for the 21st-century jobs that are quickly replacing the assembly plants of the 1960s. Whether these new jobs are in advanced manufacturing or software development, employers face common issues regarding business costs, especially regulations and corporate taxes. In the spring, executives at Carrier parent United Technologies Corp.

                                    is booming in the wake of Trump’s election. Read: U.S. jobless rate hits 9-year low of 4.6% in November How important is this? A recent study for the U.S. Small Business Administration reports that regulation adds more than $10,500 to the cost of each worker annually. Other studies find the aggregate impact of the ever-growing pile of regulations seriously slowing U.S. economic growth for decades. Anecdotally, there is abundant evidence that regulatory intervention impacts costs for businesses. Take, for example, the Obama administration’s favorite industry — higher education, where I work. The handbook for simply reporting (not implementing) the federal campus safety rules runs past 255 pages. It’s difficult to imagine what the regulatory torment is like in industries the current administration disfavors. The letter Carrier officials handed out to workers Thursday echoed their concern over the U.S. business climate, saying plainly: “Today’s announcement is possible because the incoming Trump-Pence administration has emphasized to us its commitment to support the business community and create an improved, more competitive U.S. business climate.” The effort to raise the very real hope that regulatory costs will now be a center point of the Trump-Pence administration come January. Still, the biggest evidence that this is about the future of American manufacturing involves actions by Carrier and the state of Indiana. Carrier will add $18 million investment to this plant, which will surely boost production and, yes, automate much of the assembly process. The Carrier letter admitted as much noting “this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone.” The new investment by Carrier will eventually lead to technology-related job cuts, including 700 in Indianapolis. Moreover, the decision to consolidate operations in Indianapolis, while eliminating those in the small town of Huntington, is wholly related to the availability of a 21st-century workforce. The company is also preserving its research and development presence in Indianapolis, within an hour of four research universities: Purdue University, Indiana University, Ball State University and Indiana University-Purdue University-Indianapolis. I have been a longtime critic of capital incentives. These tend to speed automation-related unemployment faster than market forces alone would do while robbing local governments of school and infrastructure dollars. Yet I can find little to complain of in this tax-incentive package. Indiana offered very modest tax credits of about $700 per worker for training for each of 10 years and another $2 million over all in assorted technology incentives. These incentives will pay for themselves in income-tax revenue that Indiana otherwise would have lost in year one, and are among the smaller state tax incentives in the country. This is a fraction of the money Carrier will pay to retrain current and displaced workers, and had been offered to the company last spring, when Gov. Pence worked to keep the factory open. This decision wasn’t about threats, presidential cajoling, or tax incentive packages. If it were, the company would have quietly asked for more incentives. Carrier made a smart decision to go public earlier this year with its very real suite of business climate complaints, that were quietly dismissed by the Obama administration. Executives hadn’t expected that to change, particularly if Hillary Clinton had been elected president. Carrier decided to keep production in Indiana because its leaders now expect a better business climate to emerge in the Trump-Pence administration, supported by Republicans that control both the House of Representatives and the Senate. That is damned fine deal-making. Michael J. Hicks is the George and Frances Ball distinguished professor of economics and the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind.

                                   which is headed by Harold Hamm, seen as a possible pick by President-elect Donald Trump as Energy Secretary. Read: These U.S. shale-oil companies are poised to profit when prices rise The OPEC production cuts are set to begin on Jan. 1 and the group will meet again in May to reassess the agreement and decide whether to extend the reductions. Oil producers found more than enough incentive to reach a deal as prices for West Texas Intermediate crude futures suffered sharp losses in the last two years. By the end of 2015, settled below $40 a barrel—a more than 60% drop from the peak in 2014 of over $105 a barrel. WTI has now gained close to 40% year to date. Against that backdrop, total oil production from seven major U.S. shale plays have fallen all year, but those declines have moderated in recent months. The Energy Information Administration forecast shale oil output down 20,000 barrels a day in December from a month earlier. The month-to-month decline for November was estimated at 30,000 barrels, and for October it was a decline of 61,000 barrels a day. The EIA will issue its latest shale output update, with a forecast for January, on Dec. 12. Perry attributed the declines in shale production in recent months, in part, to the “normal depletion decline of existing wells.” But if “new wells are drilled, these declines will change into oil production increases fairly rapidly.” Michael Roomberg, a portfolio manager at Miller/Howard Investments

                                   explained that “shale wells, like all oil wells, naturally become less productive over time, as the pressure in the formation is released, like the air from a balloon.” And “that decline must be constantly offset by new well drilling, otherwise overall basin supply will decline,” he said. “So long as prices are insufficient to incentivize new drilling activity, supply will decline.” But if oil producers stick to their agreement, prices for oil are expected to rise. “Oil prices are truly on course for a recovery,” with Brent prices having reached a solid $54, backed by the first coordinated action by the OPEC members in 8 years, said Mihir Kapadia, chief executive officer and founder of Sun Global Investors. “It has definitely set a new price outlook for the commodity.” On Monday, Brent prices briefly topped $55 a barrel while those for WTI hit $52, marking levels not seen for those contracts in more than a year. Part of the reason for OPEC’s reluctance to cut back on production has been concern over the loss of marketshare to non-OPEC producers such as the U.S.—specifically shale producers. OPEC’s agreement marked the first output cut in about 8 years. “While some say OPEC has succeeded in its goal of limiting high-cost production, I tend to think they’ve sown the seeds of their own demise,” said Troy Vincent, oil analyst at ClipperData. “Production costs in the U.S. have roughly halved during the downturn in prices caused by Saudi Arabia’s turn to market share maximization, as companies focused on innovation and efficiency.” “This sets a good foundation for the next leg up in U.S. production,” he said. U.S. offshore oil output, however, isn’t likely to benefit as much as shale production, analysts said. Offshore wells involve a degree of exploration risk and logistical difficulties, given that they’re often drilled in deep water. Offshore producers “have especially big lead times to drill wells, so it will take them a particularly long period to be able to get mobilized to drill new off shore wells,” said Perry.

But it soon turned lower, falling more than 1.5% to a three-day low of $1.0602, as investors realized that the statement contained a mixed message of continued stimulus but at a lower level, which was viewed as both dovish and hawkish. The euro traded at $1.0616 late Thursday in New York. “The euro/dollar was exposed to extreme levels of volatility during trading on Thursday following the European Central Bank’s market shaking decision to taper its monetary stimulus,” said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at FXTM, in a note. “The euro first rallied on the headline that the ECB would be reducing its purchases. The euro then fell on the headline that the ECB would be extending the purchases’ time horizon,” said Doug Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine FX, a subsidiary of Tullett Prebon. The ECB’s decision surprised many market strategists and investors who had expected the central bank to extend its program of buying public and private eurozone debt at its present pace of €80 billion ($80.6 billion) for most of 2017. Instead, the central bank announced it would taper the program to €60 billion ($64 billion) beginning in April. The central bank also left interest rates unchanged as expected. During a news conference, President Mario Draghi of the ECB said the central bank would be comfortable buying bonds with yields below the central bank’s deposit rate, which stands at minus 0.4%. The ECB also announced that Eurosystem central banks will also be able to accept cash as collateral for their lending facilities. Draghi also said the governing council had not discussed scaling back its bond-buying program, and that the decision to reduce its program didn’t amount to tapering. He assured investors that the central bank would be involved in the markets “for a long time.” Read: All eyes on ECB ahead of key meeting: Live blog Read: How Italy’s ‘no’ vote might be the ECB’s silver lining Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at the close of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.

John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, noted that monetary policy in the eurozone is likely to largely remain loose despite the ECB announcement. This divergence from the U.S. where the Fed is poised to tighten its policy is expected to lead to a further weakness in the euro with the currency trading at parity against the U.S. dollar by the end of 2017.

By President-elect Donald Trump has tapped retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis to become secretary of defense—a choice that requires Congress to pass a special law for the recently retired military officer to take up the Pentagon’s top post. “We are going to appoint ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis as our secretary of defense,” Trump said at a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, referring to the general by a nickname. Trump’s speech in Ohio was the first stop in a nationwide “Thank You” tour he will conduct over the next few weeks. The decision brings a longtime military hand, known for his battlefield toughness and intellectual heft, to the lead of the nation’s armed forces as thousands of U.S. troops remain on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq. Gen. Mattis rose through the ranks of the Marine Corps over 43 years to become the U.S. military’s top commander in the Middle East. Since retiring in 2013, Gen. Mattis has become a vocal critic of what he calls Washington’s “strategy-free” approach to warfare and threats. He has urged the U.S. to engage in the Middle East more directly and without preset limits on the use of force, echoing critics of President Barack Obama’s administration who say it has taken an overly incremental and fair-weather approach.

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The recapture of Aleppo by Syrian government forces deals a humiliating blow to years of Turkish policy in Syria, leaving in ruins its efforts to force President Bashar al-Assad from power and handing a major victory to main regional rival Iran. But Turkey’s support for the Syrian rebels withdrawing from their last major urban stronghold is far from over, as it intensifies a campaign to drive Islamic State and Kurdish militia fighters from a strip of Syria’s north. Some of the rebel brigades from Aleppo are expected to be redeployed as part of “Operation Euphrates Shield”, an offensive launched by Turkey four months ago to secure a roughly 90-km (56-mile) stretch of Syrian territory across its border. “The work on this is already under way,” said a senior official from the Turkmen Sultan Murad brigade, one of the Turkish-backed groups pulling out of Aleppo. Fighters would initially join Turkey’s effort to drive Islamic State from the city of al-Bab, around 40 km northeast of Aleppo, he said. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s role negotiating the safe exit from Aleppo of the largely Turkmen and Arab insurgents he has backed for the past five years was hardly the outcome he could have wanted. For years, he led calls for international intervention to force Assad from power. But it marks the culmination of a shift in Turkish policy which began months ago as Ankara sought to mend broken ties with Assad’s ally Russia, and as the threat to its national security from Islamic State and Kurdish groups in Syria grew. Turkey itself pulled some of the rebel fighters it backs out of Aleppo in August to take part in Euphrates Shield, further weakening their ability to confront the onslaught from Assad’s forces and their Russian and Iranian-backed allies. “The situation in Syria has morphed into one reality and then another since 2011 and all regional actors ... have muddled through, trying to adjust to new realities. In this respect, Turkey is no exception,” said Gulnur Aybet, professor of international relations at Istanbul’s Bahcesehir University. “Turkey’s priorities with regards to the war in Syria now and for the foreseeable future are two pronged: national security and humanitarian relief.” A chain of suicide bombings over the past two years blamed variously on Islamic State and Kurdish militants have brought into sharp focus the threat from Syria to Turkish cities hundreds of miles from the frontlines. “Syria has turned into a training ground for terrorist organizations,” a senior government official said. “Our Syria policy is adjusting according to the realities on the ground.” In the latest attack last weekend, Kurdish militants claimed a twin bombing outside an Istanbul soccer stadium which killed 44 people, most of them police officers. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday one of the bombers was thought to have come from Syria, and officials in Ankara believe the attacks may have been in revenge for Turkey’s actions against Kurdish militias in northern Syria. “They are not pleased with the advances of the Turkish army in Syria, and they’re trying to send a message to Turkey through terrorist attacks,” said a second Turkish official. “Our fight against terror in Turkey and the Turkish-backed rebel advance in Syria will continue.” The official from the Sultan Murad brigade said rebel fighters withdrawing from Aleppo to Syria’s Idlib province would be vetted by Turkey before being sent to join the Euphrates Shield operation as quickly as possible. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said the aim was to flush out members of the Nusra Front, which is among the rebel groups fighting Assad but was until recently affiliated with al Qaeda. The Nusra Front is considered a terrorist group by both the United States and its NATO ally Turkey. “It won’t take a lot of time, definitely not weeks. The al-Bab operation is vital for Turkey, and from there it wants to move onto Manbij,” the Sultan Murad official said, referring to a town 50 km (30 miles) east of al-Bab which Erdogan has said he wants brought under control of the Turkish-backed forces. The Turkish army dropped leaflets on al-Bab this week urging civilians to seek shelter, as rebels backed by Turkish tanks and warplanes closed in on the city. The rebels seized at least two villages west of al-Bab last week. Turkey’s shifting priorities in Syria have much to do with its rapprochement with Russia in August, after nine months of strained ties caused by Turkey’s shooting down of a Russian fighter jet over Syria. Russia has backed up forces loyal to Assad in Aleppo by providing training, equipment, advice and air support. The Turkish government says the restoration in ties has not changed its position that Assad must go to restore peace in Syria, but it has been forced to work with Moscow. Erdogan has spoken repeatedly in recent weeks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to find a solution in Aleppo. There have also been contacts between Turkey’s foreign minister and his Iranian counterpart in recent days, and Turkish officials have said there will be a tri-partite meeting between Turkey, Russia and Iran to discuss Syria later this month. Ankara’s change of tack has partly been driven by its long-standing frustration with U.S. policy in Syria. Turkey has been angered by U.S. support for Kurdish militia groups and has shared a sense of betrayal among Syrian rebels who feel President Barack Obama encouraged their uprising by calling for Assad to go but then abandoned them, failing even to enforce his own “red line” on Syria’s use of chemical weapons. “The fight that should have been taken on by global powers has not been assumed by them at all,” the senior government official said. “If someone is looking for a scapegoat for what’s happening in Syria, it is neither Erdogan nor Turkey.” ","
                After Aleppo, a chapter closes on Turkey's ambitions in Syria | Reuters"
,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran has played a pivotal role in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s campaign to crush rebel resistance in Aleppo and is now close to establishing a “Shi’ite crescent” of regional influence stretching from the Afghan border to the Mediterranean Sea. Revolutionary Guards commanders and senior clerics in Tehran have this week praised Iran’s defeat of “Wahhabi terrorists” in Syria and the country they characterize as the rebels’ patron, Sunni Muslim regional rival Saudi Arabia. There is little doubt the capture of Aleppo after years of fighting, and at the cost of thousands of lives, will make Assad unassailable to the rebels who have sought to end his rule. It is unlikely such a victory would have been possible without Iran’s steadfast supply of Shi’ite fighters, money and weapons. The central role the Shi’ite majority nation has played - and the power it wields - was starkly illustrated on Wednesday when the evacuation of rebel-held districts was delayed after Tehran was said by opposition officials to have imposed new conditions. Iran demanded a simultaneous evacuation of wounded from two towns besieged by insurgents, according to rebel and U.N. sources. The civil war has pitted Assad, supported by Russia and Iran, against rebel groups backed by the United States, Gulf Arab powers and Turkey. Iran’s involvement over more than five years - first by providing military advisers and then by training and arming Shi’ite militia - has not only helped shape the Syrian conflict, it has strengthened its own hand across the region. For the first time, Tehran could exert authority over a vast sweep of the Middle East extending through Iraq and Syria into Lebanon - an arc of influence that Sunni Arab powers, particularly Saudi Arabia, have been warning about for years. “We know the Iranians are very patient,” said Hilal Khashan, a professor of political studies at the American University of Beirut. “They do not expect immediate rewards. So they persevered and they are reaping the fruits of their patience.” “There is no doubt in my mind that this Shi’ite arc or crescent will be created,” he added. “The Iranians will establish their sphere of influence from Iraq through Lebanon.” That is not only because of the imminent fall of Aleppo but also because of the gains the Shi’ite-led government in Baghdad - a close ally of Tehran - has made in the battle to retake Mosul from Islamic State, an ultra-hardline Sunni group. Thousands of Shi’ite militia fighters trained by Iran are fighting on the side of the government in Iraq. Some have already fought in Syria to support Assad and pledged to go back if necessary. In Iraq they are battling for control of Tal Afar, a city between Mosul and Iraq’s western border with Syria which - if retaken - would allow Iran nearly unfettered military access all the way to the Mediterranean sea. Iran already has a great deal of influence in Lebanon, where it has deep historical ties with the Shi’ite community and funds Hezbollah, the country’s most powerful political and military movement, which is also fighting in Syria on behalf of Assad. Establishing such a “Shi’ite crescent” would give Tehran immense political clout in the region as it vies with arch-rival Riyadh and allow it to protect Shi’ite communities in these countries. It would also present a military threat to Israel, through Syria and Lebanon, which Iranian officials regard as a deterrent to any Israeli aggression towards Iran. For Saudi Arabia and other regional Sunni powers, increased Iranian power would come at cost to their own political, military and trading interests. But whether Iran can maintain such a large sphere of influence is uncertain, Khashan said. From as early as 2012 Iran began arming, training and paying thousands of Afghan and Pakistani fighters, as well as Hezbollah militants from Lebanon, to fight on behalf of Assad, according to diplomats and analysts. Overseen by seasoned Iranian Revolutionary Guards commanders, some of whom have combat experience dating back to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, these fighters were able to hinder many Syrian opposition advances. Among those commanders is Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force - the arm responsible for operations outside Iran - who has been repeatedly photographed at frontline positions in Iraq and Syria in recent years. The presence of Soleimani, as well as other senior Guard commanders, on the ground was completely different to the approach of countries like Saudi Arabia who only sent money and military equipment to the opposition, diplomats and analysts said. “The Saudis have kit. They don’t really have expertise. They provided kit. They provided money. That’s what they thought would be enough and it wasn’t,” said a Western diplomat in the Middle East who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly. “That’s one thing the Iranians did that the other side didn’t - invest capital on the ground.” Rebel fighters have said that when Iranian commanders were present on the ground the Syrian army performed much better, according to the Western diplomat. That decision to keep senior Iranian commanders at the frontline came at a cost, with at least half a dozen Iranian generals killed in Syria. But by using Shi’ite militia fighters from other countries, Tehran was able to keep the total number of Iranians killed in Syria relatively low. Analyst tallies of combat deaths in Syria indicate that hundreds of Iranian nationals likely fought there but it is not clear how many are in the country now. In turn, the Revolutionary Guards and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei were able to sell the war to the Iranian public. Hardline news outlets close to the Guards have been printing stories about the existential threat posed by Islamic State and the need to fight the group in Syria since Iran went public about its role in the conflict in 2012. Earlier this year, Khamenei said that if Iran was not taking part in the war in Syria then they would be fighting the same enemy inside Iran. Iranian religious singers, known as maddah, have regularly praised Shi’ite fighters heading to Syria and Iraq, known as “defenders of the shrine”, in popular videos posted online. At the Tehran book fair in May people could photograph themselves dressed up with a helmet and ammo belt against a backdrop of a bombed-out cityscape that resembled Aleppo. “It’s easier for the government to sell a war that isn’t that popular or essential if it’s not Iranian blood being spilled for the most part,” said the Western diplomat. “By outsourcing it they’ve kept the pain away from most Iranians.” ","
                Fall of Aleppo puts Iran on cusp of 'Shi'ite crescent' of influence | Reuters"
,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"BEIRUT/AMMAN/GENEVA (Reuters) - When rebel fighters launched a last desperate attempt to break the siege of Aleppo in October, they were beaten back - not by the Syrian army but by the Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah fighting on its behalf, a senior official in the pro-government alliance said. In the build-up to the final battle for Syria’s second city, scores of fighters from a single Iraqi Shi’ite militia were killed in just two days of combat this summer, said a commander of another group fighting for President Bashar al-Assad. Even in the last hours of fighting in Aleppo, allied Iraqi militia were at the vanguard. The U.N. human rights office said it had reports that the Syrian army and an allied Iraqi militia had killed at least 82 civilians in captured city districts - allegations denied by the army and militia in question. These episodes show how in the decisive battle of Syria’s nearly six-year-old civil war, Assad drew heavily on foreign Shi’ite militias sponsored by Iran for his most important victory to date. Rebel sources say that among fighters taken prisoner by insurgents in the last months of Assad’s campaign to retake Aleppo, there was not a single Syrian soldier. To be sure, Russian air strikes were the most important factor in Assad’s triumph. They enabled his forces to press the siege of rebel-held eastern Aleppo to devastating effect and regain full control of what was Syria’s biggest city and economic hub before the war. But on the ground, Shi’ite militias from as far afield as Afghanistan played an important role for Assad, a member of the minority Alawite sect which is an offshoot of Shi’ite Islam. Among these militias, which fought in and around Aleppo alongside the Tiger Force, an elite Syrian army unit lavishly backed by Russia, was the Ansar Allah al-Awfiya group. The rebels inflicted big losses on the militia’s fighters by hitting them with a barrage of guided anti-tank missiles as they retreated in an area outside Aleppo, according to the militia commander, also an Iraqi. Reuters was unable to confirm the account with the group itself. But Hezbollah, battle-hardened by years of conflict with Israel, played an even more important role. It ensured the siege was not broken by helping thwart a series of suicide attacks, according to the official in the pro-Assad military alliance. “If they (the suicide attacks) had succeeded we would have been the ones under siege,” he said. Asked about the role of Shi’ite militias in the battle for Aleppo, a Syrian military source said army statements always referred to the “allied forces” working with the army. Last year Assad publicly credited Hezbollah for its role. Victory in Aleppo leaves Assad virtually unassailable by the rebels but he still faces great challenges in restoring the power of his state. While he controls the most important cities in western Syria and the coast, armed groups including Islamic State control swathes of territory elsewhere in Syria. Assad could face prolonged guerrilla warfare from forces  including the Nusra Front, until recently affiliated with al Qaeda, the global jihadist network founded by Osama bin Laden. But victory in Aleppo shows how the direction of the civil war has shifted with the support of his allies. “The course of events in Aleppo in the last few months ... has turned the tide in Syria’s war in favor of the Syrian government and resistance movement,” said Hossein Salami, the deputy head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which has also deployed forces in the protracted campaign for Aleppo. He was referring to a regional alliance grouping Hezbollah, Iran and Syria defined by hostility to Israel. Less than 18 months ago, Assad’s forces had been losing ground across Syria and he had acknowledged there was a manpower problem in his army. Russia’s decision to intervene militarily in September 2015 helped prop up Assad, while protecting its own interests in the region. Russian warplanes played a key role in imposing the siege, and in August launched some of their most powerful sorties yet to thwart a rebel attempt to break the siege from the south. The rebels’ last attempt to break the siege came in late October, and was spearheaded by suicide car and truck bomb attacks on the western flank of government-held west Aleppo. Syrian army soldiers fled when the first trucks, protected by makeshift armor, careered towards their positions. But Hezbollah sharp shooters stood their ground and opened fire, blowing up the trucks before they could hit their targets. One Hezbollah fighter who destroyed one of the suicide truck bombs by hitting it from a distance of 200 meters (220 yards) was killed by the pressure of the blast. “Hezbollah took a decision to halt the weapon of the car bomb regardless of how many martyrs it lost,” said the senior  official in the pro-Damascus alliance. The siege continued unbroken, and proved Assad’s most effective weapon in the campaign for Aleppo. Applied steadily over several months, it culminated with the full encirclement of eastern Aleppo this summer. From then on, rebel fighters faced a daily struggle to find food and fuel for their families, sapping morale. “WEIGHT” BEHIND PRO-GOVERNMENT FORCES Hezbollah fighters have been in Syria since the early days of the civil war which grew out of protests against Assad and his government in 2011. Their role in the battle of Qusair in Homs province in 2013 was critical to stopping rebels splitting the Assad-held west in two. Other Shi’ite militia groups arrived steadily, their level of organization growing under Iranian leadership. The Iraqi commander described foreign fighters as the “weight” behind the pro-government forces. “The Iranians manage all the factions, but Hezbollah is independent,” he said. Like other sources interviewed for this story, he declined to be named as he was talking about military affairs which he was not formally allowed to discuss with the media. Shi’ite militias generally took on the role of holding frontlines after advances led by Hezbollah or the Tiger Force, said Rolf Holmboe, a research fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute and a former Danish ambassador to Syria, Lebanon and Jordan who has deep knowledge of the battlefield. Iran sees the Syrian government’s survival as vital to its regional interests. With their support, pro-Assad forces consolidated their positions around Aleppo and in February severed the most direct supply route from Turkey. By June, air and artillery bombardment made what had been the only way into the rebel-held areas, the Castello Road, impassable. The Tiger Force would finally capture the road in July. Eastern Aleppo then had a population estimated at 275,000 by the U.N. and some 7,000 rebels. Opposition groups had stockpiled months of food. Yet rebel resistance collapsed more rapidly than expected. Warplanes unleashed bunker-busting bombs that left craters meters wide and brought down buildings. Hospitals were bombed out of service. Helicopters also dropped chlorine bombs, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, though the government denied this and other reported atrocities. Some rebels said cooperation on the battlefield was weakened by a lack of trust between groups in eastern Aleppo. Others said government spies has sewn discord among the rebels. Above all, rebel officials complain that their main allies — the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar — did not offer more military assistance when Russia began air strikes. Some rebel groups were armed with weapons including guided anti-tank missiles under a military aid program overseen by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. But Washington has ignored their pleas for anti-aircraft systems because of fears that they fall into the hands of more militant groups. “It’s like you are fighting modern warfare with a sword. Bravery can only take you so far,” a Syrian opposition figure said. “It’s a complete failure of whoever is interested in seeing us win.” (Click here for the graphics story ""The fall of Aleppo"" here) ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Restoring full control over Aleppo, Syria’s most populous city before the war, has been seen as critical to the fortunes of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in a multi-sided civil war now in its sixth year. Insurgents who had held the eastern part of the city since the early days of the war effectively agreed to surrender what remained of their besieged enclave and evacuate after a fierce government assault. Famous for textiles, soap and its UNESCO-listed citadel, Aleppo was Syria’s economic hub and of huge historic and cultural importance. Below is a timeline of the key events in the battle for control of the city: 2011: VIOLENCE BREAKS OUT IN SYRIA AFTER GOVERNMENT CRACKS DOWN ON PRO-REFORM PROTESTS In March 2011, mass demonstrations break out in the Syrian capital Damascus demanding political reform, civil rights and the release of political prisoners, soon spreading to other cities. A few small protests take place in Aleppo. In early 2012 rebels take control of the rural areas northwest of Aleppo city, besieging the Minnegh military air base and the largely Shi’ite towns of Nubl and Zahra. Protesters in Aleppo are shot at for the first time in July 2012 and rebels start to fight for the city itself. Poorer eastern districts quickly fall to the insurgents. Fighting in the Old City damages much of the historic covered market. 2013: REBEL GAINS CUT ALEPPO-DAMASCUS HIGHWAY Rebels cut the main highway from Aleppo to the south, forcing government forces to use a longer, alternative route to reach it from the capital. The western, government-held half of Aleppo comes under almost complete siege as rebels briefly also cut the alternative route. But in October government and allied forces retake it and strengthen their position. In April 2013 the 1,000-year-old minaret of Aleppo’s Umayyad Mosque collapses after being struck during fighting. 2014: REBELS AND GOVERNMENT CONSOLIDATE POSITIONS IN ALEPPO The government’s control of the skies starts to show as it increasingly uses jets and helicopters to strike rebels. A series of rebel advances puts the government under pressure in northwest Syria, where Aleppo is located. But in October 2015 the first Russian air strikes take place and swiftly put the rebels on the back foot. February advances by the army and allies with Russian air support cut the most direct road from Turkey to rebel-held east Aleppo, recapturing Minnegh air base, ending the rebels’ siege of Nubl and Zahra and putting pressure on insurgent supply routes. On July 27 government forces fully encircle eastern Aleppo for the first time, but the siege is broken 10 days later by a rebel counterattack on the Ramousah district that briefly opens a perilous way into eastern Aleppo from the south. Russian air power and Shi’ite militias from Iraq and Lebanon help the army recapture Ramousah on Sept 8, firmly re-encircling the rebel enclave. On Sept. 22, the heaviest air strikes in months hit east Aleppo and the government announces a new offensive to retake it. After weeks of intense bombardment, in which many hospitals and other civilian infrastructure are hit, Russia and Syria’s government declare a pause in their campaign on Oct. 18, urging rebels and civilians to quit east Aleppo. A last rebel offensive aimed at breaking the siege begins on Oct. 28 from the countryside to the city’s west, but after making some progress in the first two days, it loses momentum and all gains are reversed within a week. Intense air strikes resume against east Aleppo on Nov. 15, putting all hospitals out of action by Nov. 19. On Nov. 28, pro-government forces take the northern part of the rebel sector in a sudden advance that reduces its size by more than a third. Another swift advance on Dec. 5 and 6 brings the al-Shaar district and much of Aleppo’s historic Old City under government sway, leaving the rebels trapped in a small southern portion of their former enclave. On Dec. 12, the army makes a series of new advances after taking the Sheikh Saeed district after days of intense fighting and under a heavy aerial bombardment, leaving rebels stuck in only a tiny part of the city. On Dec. 13 insurgents agree to withdraw in a ceasefire deal which would see them evacuate to rebel-held areas outside Aleppo with their families and any other civilians wanting to leave. But the evacuation did not begin as expected on Dec. 14, with an opposition official blaming Iran and its Shi’ite militias allied to President Bashar al-Assad for the hold-up. Rebels said the ceasefire would continue despite the delay. ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"ALEPPO, Syria/BEIRUT/GENEVA (Reuters) - Rebel resistance in the Syrian city of Aleppo ended on Tuesday after years of fighting and months of bitter siege and bombardment that culminated in a bloody retreat, as insurgents agreed to withdraw in a ceasefire. The battle of Aleppo, one of the worst of a civil war that has drawn in global and regional powers, has ended with victory for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his military coalition of Russia, Iran and regional Shi’ite militias. For rebels, their expected departure with light weapons starting on Wednesday morning for opposition-held regions west of the city is a crushing blow to their hopes of ousting Assad after revolting against him during the 2011 Arab uprisings. However, the war will still be far from over, with insurgents retaining major strongholds elsewhere in Syria, and the jihadist Islamic State group holding swathes of the east and recapturing the ancient city of Palmyra this week. “Over the last hour we have received information that the military activities in east Aleppo have stopped, it has stopped,” Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told a heated U.N. Security Council meeting. “The Syrian government has established control over east Aleppo.” Rebel officials said fighting would end on Tuesday night and a source in the pro-Assad military alliance said the evacuation of fighters would begin at around dawn on Wednesday. A Reuters reporter in Aleppo said late on Tuesday that the booms of the bombardment could no longer be heard. Fighters and their families, along with civilians who have thrown in their lot with the rebels, will have until Wednesday evening to quit the city, a Turkish government source said. The ceasefire was negotiated by Turkey and Russia, without U.S. involvement. A commander with the Jabha Shamiya rebel group said that Aleppo was a moral victory for the insurgents. “We were steadfast ... but unfortunately nobody stood with us at all”, the commander, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. The plight of civilians has caused global outrage in the wake of a sudden series of advances by the Syrian army and its allies across the rebel enclave over the past two weeks. “We appear to be witnessing nothing less than ... a total uncompromising military victory,” U.N. Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. The rout of rebels from their ever-shrinking territory in Aleppo sparked a mass flight of terrified civilians and insurgents in bitter weather, a crisis the United Nations said was a “complete meltdown of humanity”. There were food and water shortages in rebel areas with all hospitals closed. The United Nations earlier on Tuesday voiced deep concern about reports it had received of Syrian soldiers and allied Iraqi fighters summarily shooting dead 82 people in recaptured east Aleppo districts. It accused them of “slaughter”. “The reports we had are of people being shot in the street trying to flee and shot in their homes,” said Rupert Colville, a U.N. spokesman. “There could be many more.” “They have gone from siege to slaughter,” British U.N. ambassador Matthew Rycroft said. “Aleppo will join the ranks of those events in world history that define modern evil, that stain our conscience decades later - Halabja, Rwanda, Srebrenica and now Aleppo,” said U.S. ambassador Samantha Power. The Syrian army has denied carrying out killings or torture among those captured, and its main ally Russia said on Tuesday  rebels had “kept over 100,000 people in east Aleppo as human shields”. An official with an Aleppo rebel group said the bulk of about 50,000 people was expected to be evacuated. Fear stalked the city’s streets. Some survivors trudged in the rain past dead bodies to the government-held west or the few districts still in rebel hands. Others stayed in their homes and awaited the Syrian army’s arrival. For all of them, fear of arrest, conscription or summary execution added to the daily terror of bombardment. “People are saying the troops have lists of families of fighters and are asking them if they had sons with the terrorists. (They are) then either left or shot and left to die,” said Abu Malek al-Shamali in Seif al-Dawla, one of the last rebel-held districts. A Syrian military source said the evacuation of fighters  would start at 5 a.m. (0300 GMT) on Wednesday. The source said fighters’ families would also leave, but did not mention other civilian evacuations. “We’re going to watch this closely,” U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said. “Obviously if it is true and there has been a ceasefire arrangement reached that not only stops the bombing and the violence but allows people to safely leave Aleppo, we would welcome it.” Behind those fleeing was a wasteland of flattened buildings, concrete rubble and bullet-pocked walls, where tens of thousands had lived until recent days under intense bombardment even after medical and rescue services had collapsed. The once-flourishing economic center with its renowned ancient sites has been pulverized during the war which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, created the world’s worst refugee crisis and allowed for the rise of Islamic State. The U.N.’s Colville said the rebel-held area had become “a hellish corner” of less than a square kilometer. Its capture was imminent, he added. The Syrian army and its allies could declare victory at any moment, a Syrian military source had said earlier, predicting the final fall of the rebel enclave on Tuesday or Wednesday, after insurgent defenses collapsed on Monday. Terrible conditions were described by city residents. Abu Malek al-Shamali, a resident in the rebel area, said dead bodies lay in the streets. “There are many corpses in Fardous and Bustan al-Qasr with no one to bury them,” he said. “Last night people slept in the streets and in buildings where every flat has several families crowded in,” he added. State television broadcast footage of a tide of hundreds of refugees walking along a ravaged street, wearing thick clothes against the rain and cold, many with hoods or hats pulled tight around their faces, and hauling sacks or bags of belongings. One man pushed a bicycle loaded with bags, another family pulled a cart on which sat an elderly woman. Another man carried on his back a small girl wearing a pink hat. At the same time, a correspondent from a pro-Damascus television station spoke to camera from a part of Aleppo held by the government, standing in a tidy street with flowing traffic. In some recaptured areas, people were returning to their shattered homes. A woman in her sixties, who identified herself as Umm Ali, or “Ali’s mother”, said that she, her husband and her disabled daughter had no water. They were looking after the orphaned children of another daughter killed in the bombing, she said, and were reduced to putting pots and pans in the street to collect rainwater. In another building near al-Shaar district, which was taken by the army last week, a man was fixing the balcony of his house with his children. “No matter the circumstances, our home is better than displacement,” he said. “The crushing of Aleppo, the immeasurably terrifying toll on its people, the bloodshed, the wanton slaughter of men, women and children, the destruction – and we are nowhere near the end of this cruel conflict,” U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said in a statement. ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fall of the last rebel-held areas in the Syrian city of Aleppo could seal the fate of the “Obama Doctrine,” deepening the world’s worst humanitarian crisis in decades and staining U.S. President Barack Obama’s legacy. With the U.S.-aligned rebels facing defeat by government forces backed by Russia and Iran, Obama’s light-footprint approach to the Syrian conflict will suffer a serious blow weeks before he hands power to President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20. The rebel loss would underscore the failure of U.S. efforts to stem the carnage from Syria’s nearly six-year-old civil war, leading some critics to predict that Obama’s record will be tarnished just as President Bill Clinton’s was by his refusal to intervene to halt the 1994 Rwandan genocide. “There is no doubt he will be hammered in historical terms,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East adviser to Republican and Democratic administrations. “The question will be why he didn’t do more.” While the war is expected to grind on, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s victory in Aleppo would provide fresh fodder for Trump, who has argued the insurgency has collapsed, and the United States should revamp its fight against Islamic State by joining up with Russia, and by extension, Assad. Syria has been one of the main testing grounds for Obama’s doctrine of relying on local proxy fighters instead of large-scale U.S. military deployments, reflecting his reluctance to be drawn back into unpopular ground conflicts like the Iraq war. The approach has faltered in Syria, where on Tuesday the Syrian army said it could declare full control over eastern Aleppo by Wednesday. A deal was struck to allow the remaining rebel fighters to evacuate their last enclave there, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said. “Leading from behind leaves a vacuum that is filled by the Bashar Assads and Vladimir Putins of the world,” said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, referring to how an Obama aide described his strategy. “I think history will judge that these are unintended results that are going to cause great challenges to the United States for years to come.” Obama has been criticized for refusing to provide sufficient arms and other support to moderate rebel groups to compel Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers to negotiate an end to his authoritarian rule. “Obama has pursued a policy of calculated dithering in Syria, just agonizing over the choices until they no longer existed,” said Emile Hokayem, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank. The Democratic president has defended his policy as “judicious.” His spokesman, Josh Earnest, said it was Obama’s “overriding responsibility” to protect the interests and safety of the American people first. A Republican, Trump has vowed a dramatic shift from Obama’s cautious strategy toward a more aggressive approach - although exactly how he will proceed remains unclear. He will inherit an increasingly complicated conflict in Syria, and many analysts fear his lack of foreign policy experience could lead to dangerous miscalculations. If Trump follows through after Aleppo’s fall on his pledge to cooperate with Russia, Assad’s military patron, there is a risk that frustrated moderate rebels could gravitate toward militant factions that pose a potential threat to Western interests. As Assad himself turns from the wreckage of Aleppo to assert his authority over a fractured Syria, he will have to contend with the loss of swaths of his country for the time being and tough pockets of resistance still to crush. The war has taken some 400,000 lives and made more than 11 million people homeless, driving many into neighboring countries or on a long perilous trek to Europe. The imminent fall of rebel-held eastern Aleppo – and the sense of U.S. powerlessness as it unfolds – suggests that Obama likely will be judged by history as much for what he did not do as for what he did. He first called on Assad to leave power in 2011. But Obama never supplied moderate rebels with enough firepower to topple him or force him to the negotiating table. His failure to carry out threatened air strikes to enforce his 2012 “red line” over Assad’s use of banned chemical weapons dealt a heavy blow to U.S. standing, including by some of his staunchest regional allies. Obama also rejected recommendations, as recently as October, by members of his national security team for tougher action against Assad. Instead, he gave priority to striking Islamic State with a U.S.-led bombing campaign and local allies assisted by relatively small numbers of U.S. special forces. The strategy hewed to a prescription Obama laid out in a 2014 West Point speech in which he made clear he would intervene in foreign conflicts only when he believed U.S. interests were threatened. That led to the return of thousands of U.S. military personnel to Iraq to support Iraqi forces fighting Islamic State. But in Syria, despite providing billions of dollars in relief aid for refugees, Obama’s approach has failed to quell what some have called the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two. Obama recently told an interviewer that the grim situation in Syria “haunts me constantly” - although he insisted there was not much he would have done differently. James Jeffrey, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Turkey, said Obama’s risk-averse approach had not only allowed Assad to attack the opposition with impunity but also opened the door to greater Russian and Iranian influence in the Middle East. But Paul Pillar, a former top U.S. intelligence analyst on the Middle East, said Obama was right to hold back in Syria because it was “no place to commit U.S. prestige and resources for regime change.” Earnest said on Thursday that historians may “end up quibbling” about Obama’s Syria policy, when he was asked about a Syrian opposition leader who told the Wall Street Journal that “history will never forgive Obama for what he has done to the Syrian people.” White House aides privately acknowledge that Syria – and other Arab countries in turmoil, such as Libya and Yemen – could   leave a black mark on his legacy. But they hope his record will be buoyed in other areas, including the landmark Iran nuclear deal, diplomatic openings to Cuba and Myanmar, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the prevention of a 9/11-style attack on U.S. soil on his watch. Still, reflecting deep unease in Washington over the bloodshed in Aleppo, Robert Ford, who resigned in 2014 as U.S. ambassador to Syria over policy disagreements, and is now at the Middle East Institute, said: “I’m personally sad that after we thought we had learned lessons in places like Sarajevo, Srebrenica and Rwanda, it’s in fact very clear that this administration doesn’t really care.” ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"ALEPPO, Syria (Reuters) - The remains of the medieval Umayyad Mosque’s felled minaret lie in its once-elegant courtyard along with discarded mattresses, fragments of rockets and antique doors, but, after years of fighting, Aleppo’s holiest monument endures. The minaret and the covered markets that surrounded the mosque may have been destroyed in battles between the Syrian army and rebel fighters in 2012 and 2013, but despite suffering great damage, much of the mosque has survived. After sweeping army advances over recent days [nL5N1E82DB] that pushed rebels far from the Old City where the mosque was on a front line, Syria’s Grand Mufti Ahmed Badr al-Din Hassoun hailed its recapture by government forces. “I remember when I would give sermons at dawn prayers,” he said in an emotional speech on state television, referring to the mosque as “the crown of Aleppo”. But in Tuesday’s rain, the bullet-pocked and scorched walls of the mosque, built in the 11th century on the site of an older building, cut a forlorn sight. “Our memories have been erased. It’s a big loss,” said a woman walking through the rubble of the area with her husband to the remains of their shop that they had abandoned when fleeing the fighting. As reporters toured the mosque in the company of an army escort, a soldier climbed the hillock of rubble that was once the 11th-century minaret and replaced the flags of Islamist rebel factions with that of the Syrian state. The mosque has suffered before, from fire and from the wanton destruction of the Mongols, who seized Aleppo in 1260, two years after sacking Baghdad, then the great centre of Islamic civilisation. Nearby, around the imposing main entrance to Aleppo’s great raised citadel, the remnants of war, including shell parts and shrapnel, lay thick on the ground. Although the citadel stayed in government hands, its entranceway was also on the front line. In the streets of the old market near the mosque, burned shop goods and clothed mannequins lay strewn among the rubble. In one place, the only undamaged thing was a signpost saying: “Welcome to the Umayyad Mosque”. Inside, the tomb of the Prophet Zakariah has been encased behind a high wall built while it was in rebel hands, and some of the relics, including teeth, have gone missing. Many Islamist rebels in Aleppo follow Salafist Muslim ideas that hold shrines and tombs to be tantamount to idolatry. The former shopkeeper said: “The importance of the Old City is more symbolic than material. But I’m very distressed by the ruin. It is sad because it’s the history of thousands of years.” ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The battle for Aleppo, for months the focal point of Syria’s multi-sided civil war, is approaching a bloody end as the army and its allies swept through rebel-held areas in recent days. The historic city of Aleppo had for years been divided into a government-held west and rebel-held east, with the army leaning heavily on foreign militias and the rebels divided among an array of factions. Finally taking Aleppo will give Syrian President Bashar al-Assad his biggest battlefield victory yet after nearly six years of conflict. Here are the main combatants fighting in the city: -JABHA SHAMIYA (LEVANT FRONT): One of the main rebel groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in east Aleppo. Jabha Shamiya has received support from Turkey and other states. There are numerous FSA groups, also including the Fastaqim faction, fighting in northern Syria as part of the nationalist opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Many have received military aid from countries opposed to Assad, notably Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United States. The faction’s Aleppo commander led a new military alliance that rebel groups formed this month in an attempt to better organize their defences against the government’s attack. But he was seriously injured soon after. -AHRAR AL-SHAM: A hardline Islamist group widely believed to have received backing from Turkey and some Gulf states. It is an important component of Jaish al-Fatah, an alliance of disparate Islamist groups that made big gains against government forces last year. Ahrar al-Sham is an influential rebel force, with a strong presence in northwestern Syria around Aleppo and Idlib. -NOUR AL-DIN AL-ZINKI MOVEMENT: A rebel group that counts itself part of the FSA umbrella, but has also recently participated in an operations room with the Islamist Jaish al-Fatah coalition. It has received military support, channeled through Turkey, from states opposed to Assad, including U.S.-made TOW missiles. In July the group said it was conducting an internal investigation after the publication of a video that appeared to show its fighters beheading a child. -JABHAT FATEH AL-SHAM: Formerly known as the Nusra Front, the powerful group changed its name to Fateh al-Sham in July and said it was breaking its formal allegiance to al-Qaeda. It is estimated to have many thousands of fighters in Syria, including foreign jihadists, but the actual number in Aleppo is the subject of great controversy. Rebel groups have always said Fateh al-Sham has little to no significance inside east Aleppo. Fateh al-Sham and other jihadist groups based outside the city attacked the southern Aleppo outskirts in October, taking part in a failed rebel offensive aimed at breaking the siege on the east in October. -SYRIAN ARMY: The Syrian army is supported by Russian air strikes, local pro-government militias and mostly Shi’ite foreign militias. Throughout the war, its air force has given it a big advantage over opponents, and the Russian intervention in Syria last year turned the tide in Assad’s favor. Military experts think the army numbered around 300,000 personnel pre-war, but after almost six years of conflict, desertions and defections, its current size is not known. The army has launched several major campaigns to encourage recruitment, and formed a new corps of volunteers in November to fight alongside its regular soldiers. -TIGER FORCE: Pro-Damascus sources say this elite unit of the Syrian army has played a leading role in the ground assaults in rebel-held eastern Aleppo. It is led by Suheil al-Hassan, an army officer who has risen to unusual prominence in the Syrian military. -HEZBOLLAH: The Lebanese Shi’ite movement gives allegiance to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Its armed forces have long experience of military action after fighting numerous wars against Israel. Hezbollah’s entry into the Syrian war in 2013 helped stem rebel advances and it has played a significant role in the fighting around Aleppo. More than 1,500 of its fighters have died in Syria since the start of the war. - OTHER MILITIAS: Iranian-sponsored Shi’ite militias have come to Syria from countries including Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, to fight on the government’s side. Their manpower has played a critical role in the Aleppo battle and has helped fill the gap in the Syrian army’s capacities. Harakat al-Nujaba, an Iraqi Shi’ite militia fighting in Syria, sent more than 1,000 extra fighters to southern parts of Aleppo in September to reinforce its positions, the group’s spokesman said. A non-Shi’ite militia, the Liwa al-Quds, is made up of Palestinian refugees living in Syria. It took part in some of the army’s recent advances in Aleppo. The Kurdish YPG militia is at the heart of a U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State and it controls swathes of the north, where Kurdish groups associated with the militia have set up local government councils since the start of the war. In and around Aleppo, the YPG has clashed with nationalist Syrian Arab rebels, which have accused it of collaborating with the government. The YPG has denied this accusation. The YPG has mostly avoided conflict with the Syrian government, despite tensions flaring at some points. It controls the Sheikh Maqsoud district in northeast Aleppo. ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson emerged on Friday as President-elect Donald Trump’s leading candidate for U.S. secretary of state, a senior transition official said. Trump met Tillerson on Tuesday and may talk to him again over the weekend, the official said. Trump appears to be in the final days of deliberations over his top diplomat with an announcement possible next week. Tillerson’s favored status was revealed as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani formally withdrew from consideration for secretary of state. The transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tillerson, 64, had moved ahead in Trump’s deliberations over 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has met Trump twice, including at a dinner in New York. But the official said Romney was still under consideration for the job, along with John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, and retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis. Giuliani’s withdrawal came after he was fully vetted by the Trump transition team for his overseas business ties in what was described by the Trump official as an “intense” effort by lawyers and accountants. Giuliani, who runs a global consulting firm, was given a clean bill of health, with Trump’s aides concluding his business interests would not pose a risk to his confirmation. Should Tillerson be nominated, his business ties, too, will come under scrutiny. Exxon Mobil has operations in more than 50 countries and boasts that it explores for oil and natural gas on six continents. In 2011, Exxon Mobil signed a deal with Rosneft, Russia’s largest state-owned oil company, for joint oil exploration and production. Since then, the companies have formed 10 joint ventures for projects in Russia. In 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Tillerson his nation’s Order of Friendship. But U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea cost Exxon Mobil dearly, forcing it to scrap some projects and costing it at least $1 billion in losses. Tillerson has been a vocal critic of the sanctions. Trump has spoken of wanting warmer relations with Moscow, which has sparked concerns in Congress that he could lift or loosen some of the sanctions on Russia. Tillerson has been chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil since 2006. He is expected to retire from the company next year. Should Tillerson be nominated, climate change could be another divisive issue. The company is under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s Office for allegedly misleading investors, regulators and the public on what it knew about global warming. ","

According to a statement released at 2:00 p.m. EST, the committee based its decision on solid job gains and a moderate pace of economic expansion since mid-year. It noted that, while household spending has risen moderately, business fixed investment remains soft. Inflation remains below target, and monetary policy remains slightly accommodative, based on the judgment that the neutral real rate – the rate that encourages neither expansion nor contraction – remains ""quite low by historical standards."" The Fed projected three interest rate hikes in 2017, compared to previous forecasts of two hikes. Wednesday's tightening, the first since December 2015 and only the second since 2006, was widely anticipated: the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which tracks fed funds futures, put the probability at 92.9% as of 12:55 p.m. The market reaction has accordingly been muted. The S&P 500 index popped to an intraday high of 2,276.75 within minutes of the release, then quickly slumped to 2,264.75 as of 2:24, 0.3% below Tuesday's close of 2,271.72. Equities often respond negatively to rising rates, though markets can take rate rises as a sign of confidence in the economy. The U.S. dollar index has risen 0.5% to 101.55 as of 2:28. A measure of the dollar's strength against of other currencies, it can be expected to benefit from inflows of capital to higher-yielding U.S. assets. An exception to the generally understated market reaction is the 10-year Treasury yield, which rose by around 0.06 percentage points to nearly 2.53%, its highest level since September 2014. The question on everyone's mind is what comes next: a sustained rise in interest rates, or more of the same? The answer may lie in the Fed's updated projections, released in conjunction with the rate decision. On the other hand, rate projections have been overly gung-ho in the past, with the actual interest rate trajectory falling well short. Before trying to divine where rates are going, it's worth looking at where they're coming from. Beginning in September 2007, the Fed slashed rates in response to the unfolding mortgage crisis, reaching the ostensible bottom, a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%, in December 2008. So-called zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) reigned for fully seven full years, and seven central banks – beginning with Sweden in July 2009 – have shown that zero is not, in fact, the bottom by introducing negative interest rate policy (inevitably, NIRP) to 25 nations. Not pictured: Bank of Japan's short-term policy interest rate of -0.1%. It is difficult to gauge the success of the low rate regime, since the terrible crises that might otherwise have occurred remain hypothetical. However, it is easy to see the pain it has caused in Europe's drowning banks, savers whose deposits yield nothing, and bond investors who must pay to lend to dysfunctional governments. According to critics, the main beneficiaries of low rates have been large companies and wealthy individuals, who can borrow cheaply. Nor has the result necessarily been productive investment. A record proportion of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) in early December – net 74% – thought companies were under-investing. A common use of borrowed funds has been to buy back shares. Many, including President-elect Donald Trump, are calling for the Fed to pick up the pace of rate hikes. The future path of rates depends on a number of factors, most of them unforeseeable. Politics will play a role, since Trump will be able to fill two of the twelve FOMC's voting seats when he takes office and chose a new chair to replace Janet Yellen in early 2018 (Yellen reiterated her intention to serve out her term Wednesday and left open the possibility that she would retain her board seat after stepping down as chair). At least as important, though, are data related to growth, inflation and unemployment. The Fed has a statutory requirement, often referred to as the dual mandate, to seek maximum employment and stable prices while maintaining moderate long-term interest rates. While critics joke that the Fed has taken on a third mandate – keeping either markets or politicians happy, depending on the source – the FOMC says it takes two main data sets into account when making interest rate decisions, inflation and unemployment. It also projects gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which is tightly linked to both of these variables, and the future path of rates. The Fed issued updated quarterly forecasts for these data points Wednesday. Unemployment The first data point the Fed forecasts is unemployment. ""Maximum employment"" is not precisely defined, but the FOMC has generally identified it with an unemployment rate of 4.5% to 5.0%. At 4.6% in November, the current rate is the lowest since August 2007. It falls comfortably within the ""maximum employment"" range and below the Fed's long-run estimate of 4.8%, which has remained constant since March. The Fed reduced unemployment forecasts by 0.1 percentage point to 4.5% for 2017 and 2019, leaving the 2018 forecast of 4.5% intact. Yellen fielded questions Wednesday regarding earlier statements she made suggesting that the economy could benefit from ""running hot,"" with a tighter labor market leading to higher inflation. She denied that she was planning on running an ""experiment"" by allowing competition for workers to drive up inflation. Meanwhile she commented that labor market slack had largely dissipated, yielding tight conditions similar to 2007. Note: FOMC materials describe the ""longer run"" as ""maybe in five or six years – in the absence of further shocks and under appropriate monetary policy."" Inflation The second data point is inflation. The Fed prefers to use the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, and while it tracks changes in the broad PCE index, it focuses on changes to core PCE, which excludes the volatile food and fuel components. Even as labor market conditions have improved to where they are well within the Fed's target range, annual core PCE inflation has remained stubbornly below the Fed's target of 2.0%, due in part to collapsing energy prices. Core PCE rose 1.7% year-over-year in November, the fastest rate since January 2012. According to the Fed's latest projections, it is expected to hit 1.8% in 2017 and 2.0% in 2018 and 2019. These forecasts are unchanged from September. The lack of revisions to inflation projections may come as a surprise, since market indicators have pointed to rising levels of inflation following Trump's election victory. Rolling eight-week inflows to Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) hit record levels in the days after his win, according to BAML. 10-year Treasury yields also surged, leading to a steeper yield curve, both of which are indications of a higher inflation. Yellen mostly evaded questions regarding Trump's plans for fiscal stimulus, which have stoked inflation expectations. She said she could not comment on policies for which specifics were not yet available and that she did not want to be perceived as offering advice to the incoming administration or Congress. GDP Growth The Fed raised estimates for 2017 and 2019 real GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point each, to 2.1% and 1.9% respectively. It left its 2018 estimate of 2.0% intact, as well as its long-run estimate growth estimate of 1.8%. During the campaign Trump promised growth of 4%, 5% and even 6% per year. Federal Funds Rate Based on its growth, unemployment and inflation forecasts, the Fed projects the future trajectory of interest rates. The Fed now projects three 25 percentage point rate hikes in each of the next three years. In September it forecast two hikes in 2017, three in 2018 and three in 2019. Note: the values above are based on the midpoint of the target range, so that a range of 0.50%-0.75% would be shown as 0.625%, rounded to 0.6%. After eight years of accommodation, hawks are expressing worries that the Fed is already ""behind the curve"" – as a reporter at Wednesday's press conference put it – in tightening monetary policy. Yellen responded that the degree of accommodation following the most recent hike is ""moderate,"" since neutral rates remain low. She pointed out that inflation is projected to undershoot for a couple of years and that there is no evidence of labor shortages leading to ""rapid inflation."" First, it's important to note where these forecasts come from. They are based on the individual assessments of the members of the Board of Governors and the 12 regional Fed presidents, the FOMC's ""participants."" Confusingly, this group is not the same as the FOMC's voting members, who actually set interest rates. Under normal circumstances, there are seven governors, but there are currently two vacancies. Each of the governors gets a vote on the FOMC, as does the president of the New York Fed. At any given time, four of the remaining 11 Fed presidents get a vote; they rotate on an annual basis. As a result, economic forecasts reflect the outlooks of 10 voting members and seven non-voting ones, with no way of knowing for sure what effect non-voting members' opinions are having on the forecasts. This conundrum is most evident in the ""dot plot,"" a tantalizing graphic that shows individual participants' views on the appropriate path of rates, but does not label the dots. As a result, it's impossible to know for sure – though people do guess – when the dove calling for 0.875% in 2019 or the hawk calling for 3.375% in 2018 will be able to cast a vote. The December 2016 ""dot plot"": each point represents, to the nearest eighth of a percentage point, the opinion of an FOMC particpant regarding the appropriate federal funds rate (midpoint of the target range) at the end of a given year and in the ""longer run."" The dots are anonymized. The disconnect between the ones doing the forecasting and the ones doing the voting may explain the disconnect between the forecasts and the reality. The Fed's projections for future interest rates, at least since the crisis, are chronically over-eager. In December 2013, FOMC participants gave a median forecast of 1.75% for the fed funds rate at the end of 2016. By December 2014 the forecast had risen to 2.5%, even though the rate itself had remained stubbornly in ZIRP territory in the intervening twelve months. By December 2015, reality had intervened in the form of China's currency devaluation, which spawned an ETF flash crash and months of ensuing market turbulence: the forecast for the end of 2016 fell to 1.375%, more than double the rate we're poised to finish 2016 with (going by the midpoint of 0.625%). In short, don't put too much faith in projections. ",Fed Projections: Where Do Rates Go From Here? | Investopedia

In a press release late Wednesday, Yahoo said it believes an “unauthorized third party” stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August of 2013. That’s in addition to the half a million customers whose data was hacked in another incident which Yahoo disclosed in September. The company believes the August 2013 hack is “likely distinct” from the other incident. In November, Yahoo disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that law enforcement provided it with data files that a hacker claimed was Yahoo user data. Upon analyzing it with the help of outside forensic experts, Yahoo has said it turned out to be the company’s data. (Read more: Yahoo Discloses New Potential Breach.)

Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead. Armstrong said Verizon and Yahoo will start planning what a combined company will look like. By the first quarter of 2017, Armstrong said there will be more clarity for the organization.  (Read more: AOL CEO Optimistic on Verizon-Yahoo Deal.)

""From April 2017, the net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary,"" the ECB said. The surprise move initially sent the EUR higher by as much as 0.8 percent against the U.S. dollar, rising to a four-week high of 1.0870 and yields on German benchmark Bunds spiked by as much as 9 basis point.

The ECB announced it is permitting the purchase of bonds yielding below the deposit rate of minus 0.4 per cent and reducing the minimum required maturity of bonds from two years to one. By increasing these parameters it suggest the ECB may be worried it is running out of assets to buy. However, by reducing the required maturity to one year there are fears the ECB will get involved in the bank funding market.

David Floyd,12152016,Investopedia,12082016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's rate-setting committee, meets from December 13 to 14, chances are nearly 95% that it will vote to raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 0.5% to 0.75%. That comforting certainty, courtesy of the CME Group's federal funds futures tracker, breaks down quickly when Donald Trump's incoming administration takes the reins. The president-elect accused the Fed of stoking a bubble in August 2015, switched to extolling the merits of low interest rates the following May, then in October accused Fed chair Janet Yellen of ""doing political things"" by offering low rates as a sop to the Obama administration. To get a sense of what kind of central bank we can expect during the Trump administration, Investopedia spoke to Danielle DiMartino Booth on November 22. A former advisor to the Dallas Fed, Booth is the author of ""Fed Up,"" a book criticizing the Federal Reserve System that goes on sale February 14th, 2017. The incoming administration has promised the largest tax change since Reagan and $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. While the final shape this stimulus will take is anyone's guess – Congressional Republicans could remain fiscally hawkish – optimism regarding the plan has yanked up Treasury yields and inflation expectations. Many forecasters expect economic growth to accelerate as well, although not to the 4%, 5% or 6% Trump has promised. All of these factors suggest higher interest rates. (See also, Is Trump the Next Reagan? Investors Brace Themselves.) Asked if she bought this narrative, Booth burst into song – ""happy days are here again…"" (Ironically, the theme for a Democratic presidential campaign; appropriately, the campaigner was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, author of American history's most ambitious stimulus package.) In other words, ""no, because starting points matter, and we are at a completely different juncture."" When Reagan came into office, Booth pointed out, the S&P 500's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was in the single digits; according to multpl.com, it was just over 9.0 at the beginning of January 1981. Today, by contrast, we are at ""the tail end of one of the longest expansions in post-war history"" and the S&P's P/E is nearly 25.4. Interest rate outlooks that assume Ronald Reagan's third term will begin in 2017, in short, may not play out. (See also, Trumponomics: Economic Forecasts.) Asked whether we can expect Trump to return to his previous embrace of low rates, Booth linked his inconsistency on monetary policy to the shake-up of his campaign staff in May. ""Before he fired his campaign manager he's like hey, I'm a debt guy. Low interest rates good, high interest rates bad."" After he replaced Corey Lewandowski as campaign manager in June – first with Paul Manafort and then, in August, with Kellyanne Conway – Trump changed his tone, tapping into the feeling that ""the Fed had been doing the Obama administration's bidding for the last eight years."" ""I happen to agree with that,"" Booth added, pointing out that Lael Brainard donated the maximum amount of $2,700 to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and that Daniello Tarullo put an Obama sticker on his car. Both are on the Board of Governors, meaning they have votes on the FOMC. (See also, The Federal Reserve: Introduction.) Given that Booth ascribes Trump's pronouncements on monetary policy more to campaign strategy than conviction, she is not certain what shape the Fed will take over the next four to eight years. She'd been excited when the election results first came in, since there was reason to believe Trump's win would ""imply a much different Fed going forward."" Over the following two weeks, though, Trump became ""more genteel,"" leading her to wonder whether he'll be the force for change his late-stage campaign rhetoric would suggest. (See also, How Trump Could Quickly Shake Up the Fed.) He certainly has the opportunity to reshape the FOMC. There are currently two open seats on the committee, both reserved for governors. The Board of Governors accounts for seven of the FOMC's 12 votes when politics allows (no one has even mentioned Obama's two forlorn nominees since March). One vote goes to the New York Fed president, William Dudley, who also serves as the committee's vice-chair. The remaining four go to an annually rotating group of regional Fed presidents. Trump might have even more leeway to appoint like-minded FOMC members. Yellen told Congress on November 17 ""it's fully my intention to serve out"" her term as chair of the Board of Governors, and Booth ""cannot foresee a set of circumstances that would force her to step down"" sooner. But that term expires in February 2018, and Stanley Fischer's term as vice-chair expires the following June. If both step down, Trump would have the opportunity to nominate four of the seven governors during his first two years, subject to Senate approval. (See also, Yellen's Future with the Fed After Trump Win.) On the other hand, there is no guarantee that Yellen and Fischer leave the board when their leadership terms expire. Yellen has a board seat until the end of January 2024, though the usual pattern is for outgoing chairs to leave the board when their successors take over. Fischer is serving out a predecessor's term, which ends in January 2020. He could conceivably begin another 14-year stint if reappointed, which would carry him through to age 90. Also worth considering: if push comes to shove, the law allows Trump to remove a board member ""for cause."" Trump's charge that Yellen is acting politically has led to hand-wringing over the central bank's future independence. Former Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota wrote shortly after Trump's victory, ""there is absolutely nothing in U.S. law preventing Trump from violating the Fed's independence, a post-1979 development that rests largely on the restraint of the president."" In Booth's view, however, the Fed is already ""political in an overt way."" Assuming that Trump does get ""the opportunity of a lifetime"" to appoint four governors – Booth's phrasing – what kind of changes would she like to see? First, that Trump recognizes ""the futility of econometrics and designing monetary policy based on models and theories that don't necessarily apply on planet Earth."" The corrective to this ""throwing spaghetti at the wall methodology"" is picking the right people. The current FOMC, in her view, is stacked with academics who enjoy lifetime defined-benefit plans and, as a result, ""don't have to eat what they cook."" She thinks CEOs, pension fund managers and others who understand the implications of zero interest rate policy are better suited to the job than Ph.D.s. She cautions that the answer is not necessarily higher interest rates, however. If the Fed forces a recession, ""which I think they might do,"" rates are unlikely to rise regardless of the board's composition. But in any case, she argues, certain lessons need to be learned: ""the zero bound should never be breached again, and we should always at least aspire to have curve in our yield curve."" That means taking financial markets into account, as well as the rest of the ""complex, adaptive system"" Booth says the Fed too often ignores, creating models as if they operated ""in a vacuum."" (See also, Buffett on Dodd-Frank, the Fed and the National Debt.)

This spread reflects widespread investor doubts about the chances for completing the deal. The merger will create a large behemoth which will control more than a quarter of the global market for seeds and pesticides supplies.

Under the program, if Shop Your Way members link their accounts to Uber, they can earn up to $2 in points for every trip they take with the ride-share service. Since its launch, Sears reported in a press release, more than 10,000 Shop Your Way members have linked their accounts to Uber, earning more than $250,000 in points in just over two months. Those points can be redeemed online or in-store at Sears, Kmart, Lands' End, or through the Shop Your Way website or app. ""Expanding the program during the holiday season is especially timely, because we know members are using Uber to shop,"" said Leena Munjal, senior vice president, customer experience and integrated retail, Sears Holdings. ""In fact, Black Friday was the biggest points-issuing day in November. We've had some riders already earn more than $300 in points. We've also had driver-partners who have earned $1,000 in points in addition to their Uber earnings."" Anything that brings attention to Shop Your Way is a good thing for Sears. During the company's recent Q3 earnings call, executives spoke of the rewards program as an important part of the chain's future. They also said that they have so far spent $2 billion on the technology, but did not mention any revenue numbers. Uber is a good partner with a value-conscious user base. It remains to be seen as to whether its customers will want to use a Sears app, but it's smart (and low risk) for the company to try. Uber is just one arrow in the Shop Your Way quiver, but it's one that could win some people over. 10 stocks we like better than Sears Holdings When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company's board of directors seem to believe he does. According to a just-released court filing made public because of the pending lawsuit pitting Zuckerberg against minority investors, the Facebook board voted to give Zuckerberg a two-year leave of absence if he serves ""in a government position or office."" First filed in late April, the class-action lawsuit emerged after Zuckerberg proposed a corporate shake-up that would dilute the voting power of shareholders. Announced during its first quarter earnings report, Facebook board of directors approved a proposal to amend and restate its existing certificate of incorporation. It created a new class of non-voting shares, known as the Class C capital stock, which allows Zuckerberg to retain control of the company even if he were to donate shares to charity. Lawyers of the class-action described this move as having given Zuckerberg “eternal control” of the company. The recently unsealed court documents, meanwhile, revealed text messages Zuckerberg exchanged with two board members discussing not only Zuckerberg’s possible government service, but also how to present it to shareholders. Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and one of the company’s most prominent investors in March texted Zuckerberg, saying that the “biggest issue” of issuing the class of non-voting shares was “how to define the government service thing without freaking out shareholders that you are losing commitment.” According to Bloomberg, Facebook board member Erskine Bowles was uncomfortable with the idea of public-service, expressing concern that Zuckerberg could legally retain control of the company even as he abandon his duties as CEO. Andreessen then explained Bowles' position to Zuckerberg. “Erskine is just massively uncomfortable with you getting to low economic ownership and then going off on leave with no involvement by the board and retaining control,” Andreessen said, according to the report. ""We rediscuss it on every call.” The plaintiffs, however, allege that exchange between Andreessen and Zuckerberg violated Andreessen's duties as a board member. Facebook disagreed, saying, the company is ""confident that the special committee engaged in a thorough and fair process to negotiate a proposal in the best interests of Facebook and its shareholders.” What ethical laws were violated will be for the courts to decide. However, the revelation that Zuckerberg likely has an interest in politics and public service and something to keep an eye out in the future. ",Zuckerberg in Public Office?

Sam Meredith,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Evacuation efforts to remove civilians trapped in Aleppo were suspended on Friday after rebel groups reportedly opened fire on a convoy. After five years the Syrian civil war is still ongoing, here is a quick update of the latest developments: A planned three-day evacuation of civilians in Aleppo, which began on Thursday, was suspended, the Red Cross told CNBC via email. Syrian State TV said on Friday rebel groups had opened fire on a convoy.  It also claimed the rebels had violated the cease-fire by trying to take captives out of the rebel held area, the Associated Press reported. The United Nations (UN) reported 6,000 people had left Syria's second largest city since Thursday though around 50,000 civilians remain trapped and in need of assistance. There were no confirmed reports for how long the suspension to evacuation efforts would be in place. Officials on both sides of the conflict confirmed a ceasefire had begun on Thursday at 2.30 a.m local time (7.30 p.m ET Wednesday) but is no longer holding. Originally an evacuation had been scheduled for Wednesday though it stalled due to continued gunfire and shelling in the city.  And Iran insisted on the simultaneous evacuation of two villages besieged by the rebels, Reuters reported, quoting rebel and UN sources. Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters in Japan on Friday peace talks would be renewed to encompass the whole of Syria imminently and he was working with Turkish President, Tayyip Erdogan, to achieve this aim. ""The next step is to reach an agreement on a total ceasefire across the whole of Syria. We are conducting very active negotiations with representatives of the armed opposition, brokered by Turkey,"" Putin said. ""If (peace talks) happens, it won't compete with the Geneva talks, but will compliment them. Wherever the conflicting sides meet, in my view it is the right thing to do to try to find a political solution."" The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed to CNBC in an email that ten ambulances were able to access the frontlines a few hours after 7 a.m local time on Thursday. The operation was being conducted with support from Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). ""At present, the ICRC and SARC evacuation of wounded and sick is ongoing, and our teams are still inside the key area of Eastern Aleppo,"" the ICRC spokesperson said in an email on Thursday morning. ""We hope to evacuate 200 to 250 wounded and sick in this first phase, though exact numbers remain difficult to confirm. They will be evacuated to healthcare structures in western rural Aleppo,"" they added. The civil war has been complicated by many players becoming enveloped in the conflict which has now lasted for half a decade. President Bashar al-Assad's government's state forces have been supported by Russian air strikes and Iranian-backed Shia militias from Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The opposition has been made up of predominantly Sunni rebel groups, which had received financial backing from the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. Hardline Islamist groups have been involved in the conflict too such as Jabhat Fateh al-Sahm, previously known as Nusra Front. In April 2016, the UN special envoy for Syria approximated that 400,000 people had been killed as result of more than five years of conflict. However, Staffan de Mistura, UN secretary general, stressed that this was not an official UN statistic as the inability to access many areas of the country meant an accurate death toll could not be accurately calculated. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has estimated that 11 million Syrians have fled their homes since the outbreak of the civil war in March 2011 with the majority of people seeking refuge in neighboring countries or within Syria itself. To date, the UNHCR approximates that roughly one million people have sought asylum in Europe with Germany and Sweden receiving the most applications for refuge. The pre-war population of Syria was roughly 22 million meaning so far around half of the country has been displaced. The situation remains unclear as to how Syria's civil war would unfold from here with Assad determined to focus on retaining opposition strongholds throughout the country. Yet rebel groups have promised to continue fighting in the absence of any proposed political solution. George Sabra, chief negotiator for the rebel forces' High Negotiations Committee, told the BBC that the opposition to the government would not be prepared to give up despite the loss of Aleppo to state forces. ""Aleppo is an important place for the revolution but it's not the last place,"" Sabra said. ""Nobody can think about peaceful solutions in these circumstances,"" he added.

 ,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Exxon Mobil will promote insider Darren Woods to chairman and CEO, replacing Rex Tillerson, who is leaving the oil giant after President-elect Donald Trump picked him to become secretary of state. Woods, 51, has been with Exxon for nearly a quarter-century. He rose through Exxon's refinery and chemicals businesses and emerged as Tillerson's likely successor a year ago, when he was named president and joined the board of directors. The company announced Wednesday that Woods will take over the top spot on Jan. 1. Tillerson was expected to step down in early 2017, when he will hit Exxon's mandatory retirement age of 65. His selection by Trump for the nation's top diplomatic job — subject to Senate confirmation — pushed up the timing. Many analysts expect an orderly transition at Exxon, with few significant changes in policy or leadership style under Woods. Because of Exxon's huge size, strategic decisions are made with a long time frame in view. The Irving, Texas-based company is known for taking a cautious, methodical approach to decision-making, and changes in direction usually happen only slowly. Woods ""has been groomed for a couple years to be the replacement,"" said Stewart Glickman, an analyst for CFRA Research. ""He is a 24-year (Exxon) veteran, and I think he probably understands the culture pretty well. I don't think there is much of a hitch for Exxon."" Brian Youngberg of Edward Jones said given Exxon's size ""some tweaks may occur, but I doubt anything substantial"" —especially because the company is already an industry leader in production, refining, chemicals, and selling finished goods like gasoline. Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. who has followed Exxon for 30 years, said the new CEO would be ""old wine in a new bottle."" ""The company doesn't change, but obviously it tries to adapt its strategy to the business environment,"" he said. Exxon is sitting on $5 billion in cash and has a stock-market value of $375 billion. Gheit said that Woods might try to take advantage of lower values in the oil industry to grow by making one or two major acquisitions. In a statement, the Exxon board praised Tillerson and said, ""We know that his service to the nation as secretary of state will be equally successful and distinguished."" Tillerson replaced longtime CEO Lee Raymond in 2006 and led the company during one of the most turbulent periods in its history, which dates to the Standard Oil Co. founded by John D. Rockefeller. The financial crisis of 2008 led to a collapse in oil prices. Crude recovered, only to plunge again starting in mid-2014 because of worldwide oversupply. As CEO, Tillerson signed a multi-billion-dollar deal to explore for oil in Russia's Arctic, only to see the project slowed when the U.S. and European allies slapped sanctions on Russia for annexing Crimea from Ukraine. Analysts said Tillerson overpaid for XTO Energy in 2009. The deal made Exxon the biggest natural gas producer in the U.S. but hasn't lived up to expectations because of continuing low gas prices. Exxon earned a record $45.2 billion in 2008 and nearly matched that in 2012. Since then, however, profit has fallen, dropping to $16.2 billion last year — a whopping sum but Exxon's smallest gain since 2002. The company lost its coveted AAA credit rating earlier this year. Its stock price has risen 16 percent in 2016, but rival Chevron's shares have gained nearly twice as much. On Wednesday, Exxon shares fell $2, or 2.2 percent, to close at $90.58. ","Exxon Mobil names Woods chairman, CEO to replace Tillerson"
Tom DiChristopher,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Exxon Mobil stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil if the United States rolls back sanctions on Russia. U.S. sanctions on Russia have prevented Exxon Mobil from exploring assets covering 63.6 million acres. The prospect of rapprochement between the U.S. and Russia remains speculative, but both President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have said they want to improve relations. The two countries' relationship fell apart after Russia took Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and then intervened in civil wars in Ukraine and Syria. Trump over the weekend dismissed the assessment, reached unanimously by 17 U.S. intelligence services, that the Russian government directed cyberattacks on the United States in a bid to ""interfere with the U.S. election process."" He then waved off a subsequent report citing CIA sources that alleges that intervention was meant to boost his chances of beating Hillary Clinton in November. On Tuesday, Trump announced he would nominate Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of State. Tillerson has experience negotiating deals in Russia, and he got to know Putin while chief executive of the world's biggest integrated oil and gas company. Tillerson has the backing of former Republican Secretaries of State James Baker and Condoleezza Rice, but GOP lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including John McCain and Marco Rubio, have expressed concerns about Tillerson's relationship with Putin. Tillerson has criticized U.S. sanctions on Russia and was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship by Putin in 2013. To be sure, as Exxon's chief executive, Tillerson's priority has been to his shareholders, and he has sought to protect the company's substantial interests in Russia. Exxon's operations in Russia represent only a fraction of its global oil and gas production, but a joint venture with Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft to explore and produce fossil fuels in Arctic waters represents a big part of Exxon's potential future production growth. Those endeavors have been on ice since 2014, when the United States imposed sanctions on Russia for its incursions into Ukraine. Exxon said in a filing after the sanctions were put in place that its ""maximum before-tax exposure to loss from these joint ventures"" totaled $1 billion through the end of 2015. Exxon did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. Exxon and Rosneft entered the joint venture in 2012 to develop offshore reserves in the Arctic Kara Sea and the Black Sea, as well as onshore assets in Siberia. The following year, they advanced their strategic alliance by adding seven more blocks in the Chukchi, Laptev and Kara seas. Exxon's holdings in Russia's Arctic waters and the Black Sea, which are not producing for the energy giant due to the sanctions, totaled 63.6 million acres. By comparison, Exxon holds 85,000 net acres across its main Russian venture, an offshore project called Sakhalin, which was in place before the sanctions. Exxon holds a 33 percent stake in Arctic Kara Sea and Black Sea joint ventures, and a 30 percent stake in the Sakhalin project. Rosneft estimates there are 87 billion barrels of oil lying in the three blocks of the Kara Sea covered by its joint venture with Exxon Mobil. The first exploration well in the Kara Sea in the icy Arctic waters above Russia yielded a discovery of 730 million barrels of oil, S&P Global Platts reported. Just days before the Kara discovery was announced, the United States expanded sanctions on Russia's oil industry that forced Exxon Mobil to quickly wind down its operations in the Kara Sea. Purely from a size perspective, the Arctic is one of Exxon's biggest prizes, said Anish Kapadia, an analyst at energy investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt. But he cautioned there are many questions about the economics of developing the reserves. Drilling in the Arctic is notoriously difficult and can take place only during a few months of the year due to the harsh conditions. A number of oil companies have abandoned Arctic projects in the waters off Alaska. From a financial perspective, Exxon's long-term plans in offshore Guyana make more sense than the Arctic joint venture, Kapadia said. Projects to develop liquefied natural gas and Canadian oil sands could also come with lower development costs. ""It's not just the size of the prize, it's whether you can make it work commercially,"" Kapadia told CNBC. The onshore Siberian assets are not materially significant to Exxon's business, he added. That part of the joint venture likely benefits Rosneft by allowing it to tap Exxon's experience in extracting fossil fuels from tight rock formations, Kapadia explained.

Reuters with CNBC.com,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as his choice for secretary of state on Tuesday, praising him as a successful international dealmaker who leads a global operation. Tillerson's experience in diplomacy stems from making deals with foreign countries for Exxon, the world's largest energy company, although questions have been raised about his relations with Russia. ""He will be a forceful and clear-eyed advocate for America's vital national interests and help reverse years of misguided foreign policies and actions that have weakened America's security and standing in the world,"" Trump said in a statement. Donald Trump tweet 1 Donald Trump tweet 2 Tillerson has been chief executive of Exxon Mobil since 2006 and, like Trump, has never held public office. He said he shared the president-elect's ""vision for restoring the credibility of the United States' foreign relations and advancing our country's national security."" Trump picked Tillerson, 64, after the Texan was backed by several Republican establishment figures, including former Secretary of State James Baker, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a senior transition official said. Rice and Gates, who have worked for Exxon as consultants, both issued statements of support on Tuesday. Their support is seen as crucial to helping Tillerson get past a possibly contentious Senate confirmation battle likely to focus on his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who also was under consideration for the secretary of state job, said in a statement that he would hold a nomination hearing in early January. He called Tillerson ""a very impressive individual"" with ""an extraordinary working knowledge of the world."" Russian ties Lawmakers from both major parties raised concerns about the oilman's relationship with Moscow. Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, in a statement, said he had ""serious concerns"" about Tillerson's nomination. In 2013, Putin bestowed a Russian state honor, the Order of Friendship, on Tillerson, citing his work ""strengthening cooperation in the energy sector."" ""Mr. Tillerson's cozy ties to Vladimir Putin and Russia would represent an untenable conflict at the State Department,"" Representative Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said in a statement. Trump is confident that Tillerson can get past questions about his ties to Russia, the transition official said. ""His relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none,"" Trump's statement said. There also are concerns among lawmakers about former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who has been mentioned as a possible No. 2 State Department official and who has voiced hawkish views on Iraq and Iran. Republicans and Democrats said they would ask Tillerson, who has met Putin several times, about his contacts with Russia. He won fresh praise from Moscow on Monday. Senator John McCain, a leading foreign policy voice and the 2008 Republican candidate for president, told Reuters: ""I have concerns. It's very well-known that he has a very close relationship with Vladimir Putin."" There has been controversy over the role alleged Russian cyberhacking may have had on the outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. The business community welcomed Trump's choice of Tillerson. ""We are pleased that Rex will bring a business perspective to the State Department,"" the National Association of Manufacturers said. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to build his administration. A source close to the transition said Trump had chosen former Texas Governor Rick Perry as his nominee for energy secretary, with an announcement expected soon. Perry met Trump on Monday at Trump Tower in New York. In choosing Tillerson, Trump passed over 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who had famously criticized the president-elect during the campaign this year. ""It was an honor to have been considered for secretary of state of our great country,"" Romney said in a Facebook posting on Monday night.

Andrea Mitchell,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump is expected to nominate Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state, two sources close to the transition process told NBC News on Saturday.

He has spent his entire career at the company now known as Exxon Mobil. The sources cautioned that nothing is final until the president-elect officially announces it, likely next week. Tweet from Trump spokesman The selection of Tillerson comes after Trump and his transition team spent weeks searching for someone to fill the post of the top U.S. diplomat.

 ,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson emerged on Friday as President-elect Donald Trump's leading candidate for U.S. secretary of state, a senior transition official said. Trump met Tillerson on Tuesday and may talk to him again over the weekend, the official said. Trump appears to be in the final days of deliberations over his top diplomat with an announcement possible next week. Tillerson's favored status was revealed as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani formally withdrew from consideration for secretary of state. The transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tillerson, 64, had moved ahead in Trump's deliberations over 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has met Trump twice, including at a dinner in New York. But the official said Romney was still under consideration for the job, along with John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, and retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis. Giuliani's withdrawal came after he was fully vetted by the Trump transition team for his overseas business ties in what was described by the Trump official as an ""intense"" effort by lawyers and accountants. Giuliani, who runs a global consulting firm, was given a clean bill of health, with Trump's aides concluding his business interests would not pose a risk to his confirmation. Should Tillerson be nominated, his business ties, too, will come under scrutiny. Exxon Mobil has operations in more than 50 countries and boasts that it explores for oil and natural gas on six continents. In 2011, Exxon Mobil signed a deal with Rosneft, Russia's largest state-owned oil company, for joint oil exploration and production. Since then, the companies have formed 10 joint ventures for projects in Russia. In 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Tillerson his nation's Order of Friendship. But U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea cost Exxon Mobil dearly, forcing it to scrap some projects and costing it at least $1 billion in losses. Tillerson has been a vocal critic of the sanctions. Trump has spoken of wanting warmer relations with Moscow, which has sparked concerns in Congress that he could lift or loosen some of the sanctions on Russia. Tillerson has been chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil since 2006. He is expected to retire from the company next year. Should Tillerson be nominated, climate change could be another divisive issue. The company is under investigation by the New York Attorney General's Office for allegedly misleading investors, regulators and the public on what it knew about global warming.

Darla Mercado,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"You'll be waiting a long time for that interest rate bonanza on your savings account. Though the Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved only its second interest rate increase in a decade, it will take some time for banks to pass on those higher rates to customers who hold certificates of deposit and savings accounts. Though borrowers may feel the pain right away in the form of higher rates on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and variable rate student loans, it'll take time for savers to see any kind of improvement. ""What's so odd about interest rate increases from the Fed, is that there is a lag between when rates increase on loan products and when rates increase on bank deposits,"" said James A. Cox III, a financial advisor at Harris Financial Group in Chesterfield, Virginia. ""It isn't a one-for-one increase,"" he said. Conservative investors aren't getting much for stashing their cash in these supposed safe havens. The average interest rate on a savings account is in the neighborhood of 0.11 percent, according to Bankrate. Banks won't become more generous overnight, even with this rate increase. Here's why: The Fed increased the federal funds rate — the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight — by a quarter of a percent. It's up to any given bank to determine how much of that hike they would like to pass on to consumers. ""Part of the rate increase consumers might see has to do with where the bank fits in the chain of interbank lending,"" said Sean McQuay, a credit and banking expert with NerdWallet. ""There's also the bank's business model: How much of the interest rate increase do they want to pass on to the consumer versus how much do they want to maintain for themselves,"" he said. Banks also tend to boost rates if they're interested in scooping up new business. ""Banks aren't having trouble getting deposits, so why pay more?"" said David Mendels, director of financial planning at Creative Financial Concepts in New York City. ""When the time comes to compete, they will offer higher rates,"" he said. If you're looking for a boost to your interest rates for CDs and savings accounts, shop around for higher yields. Online banks offer attractive rates on high-yield savings accounts, with some offering rates in the neighborhood of   1 percent. There are also 5-year CDs that offer rates   around 2 percent. The kind of institution you bank with will matter, according to McQuay of NerdWallet. ""You have online banks, large national banks and credit unions,"" he said. ""All three have different interest rate offerings, and online banks tend to have the highest."" If you opt to juice yields on CDs by going for longer terms, be aware of the penalties you may pay for an early withdrawal. ""If rates do go up, and you're stuck in a low-rate CD, you can do an early withdrawal and take the penalty if it's a better deal than staying,"" said Ken Tumin, founding editor of the bank deals blog at DepositAccounts.com. The most punitive five-year CDs could charge a penalty that's equivalent to two years of interest or more if you try to bail out early, but other banks will only charge you six months of interest, he said. Don't let desperation for yield steer you into bad decisions. ""It isn't the job of 'safe' money to make you more money; its job is to be there,"" said Mendels of Creative Financial Concepts. ""Long term, your 'safe' money is subject to inflation risk, but short term, it doesn't matter."" ","Don't hold your breath for juicier yields on CDs, savings after Fed move"

Tom Anderson,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"For most of the nearly $1.4 trillion in U.S. student loan debt, the Federal Reserve interest rate hike means nothing -- for now. That's because 92.5 percent of those loans are from the federal government and carry a fixed rate. The rate on federal student loans is determined by Congress. Under current law, rates are set by a formula based on the auction of 10-year Treasurys each year for loans disbursed on July 1 through the following June 30. So while rates on existing student loans will stay the same, those on student loans next year could rise on expectations that the government will have to borrow more to fund President-elect Donald Trump's plans to cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending. In fact, those expectations have already pushed 10-year Treasury yields higher. ""When you look at what's happened to long-term rates since the election, it might seem inevitable that rates on government student loans taken out after June 30, 2017, will be higher than they are today,"" said Stephen Dash, CEO of Credible.com, an online marketplace for lenders that offer student loan refinancing. If 10-year Treasury yields stay at 2.6 percent, rates on new federal student loans will be about 0.9 percent higher than they are today. (See table below.) Remember that Treasury yields can cut both ways. ""If Trump's stimulus plans fall flat, or if there are other unexpected shocks to the economy, we could see 10-year Treasury rates come down before the May auction,"" Dash said. Even if 10-year Treasurys remain at 2.6 percent in May, it would have a small effect on borrowing costs for most people. For example, a 2017 college graduate with $37,000 in student loans would pay nearly $1,900 more in interest over the life of the loan, or $16 extra each month, under a standard 10-year repayment plan than a graduate this year if T-note yields are at 2.6 percent in May. Why? Because as yields on 10-year T-notes rise, federal student loans will increase by a similar amount. Roughly 7.5 percent — about $102 billion — of U.S. student loans are privately financed, according to MeasureOne, a higher education data analytics firm. Private student loans have fixed and variable rates. Nearly a quarter of student-loan borrowers didn't know the difference between fixed and variable rates, according to a recent survey by Credible of 699 borrowers. Student loans from private lenders generally are set by Libor or prime rates, which closely track the federal funds rate over time. So the Fed rate hike will affect these loans. People with variable-rate student loans may not experience a big increase in their borrowing costs now, but may feel the pain of multiple rate hikes. ""A 25-basis-point increase isn't really going to move the needle and won't sway many people to refinance their variable-rate loans,"" said Max Spiegel, chief operating officer of Student Loan Hero, a website that provides free tools to help borrowers manage their debts. With student loan refinancing, creditworthy borrowers can get lower rates, change the repayment terms of their student loans and potentially save thousands. Private student loans do come with some drawbacks. Borrowers who refinance with private lenders can't take advantage of income-based repayment plans and public service loan forgiveness provided by federal loans. Rates would have to go higher to slow the growth of the student loan refinancing market. ""Borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans reduce their rates by 1.7 percentage points on average, so rates would have to come up quite a bit before they lose that advantage,"" Credible.com's Dash said.

A flag outside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. After analysts and commentators had predicted an interest-rate hike for most of 2016, the Federal Reserve finally came through for them. The central bank concluded its latest monetary policy committee meeting on Wednesday by releasing a statement saying that it had decided to boost the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage points. This is great news for banks, which stand to make a lot more money when rates rise, and none more so than Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). ""In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent,"" says the Fed's press release. ""In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."" US Target Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. The move didn't come as a shock. Going into Wednesday, an analysis of Fed Fund futures prices, which gauge the market's view on changes in monetary policy, tagged the likelihood of an increase at 95%. Much of the optimism was tied to the fact that the unemployment figures for November were surprisingly good. The unemployment rate last month dropped to 4.6%, down from 4.9% in October. That's well below the Fed's 5% target and it's the lowest the unemployment rate has been since August 2007. US Unemployment Rate data by YCharts. Another sign that the Fed's decision wasn't a surprise can be surmised from the fact that bank stocks barely budged today. Shares of JPMorgan Chase were essentially flat, Bank of America closed 0.27% higher, and Citigroup was down by 0.57%. The one exception among the nation's biggest banks was Wells Fargo, which saw its share price drop by 2%. But that had less to do with interest rates, and more to do with the Fed's announcement after the market closed on Tuesday that Wells Fargo had failed to remedy defects in its so-called living will that regulators had identified back in April -- click here to read more about this. For investors in bank stocks who have waited patiently for rates to rise, this is unquestionably a positive development. One way to think about banks is that, by making loans, they effectively sell money. And interest rates are the price at which they do so. As rates rise, in turn, so too will bank profits. All banks will benefit from this trend, but Bank of America is positioned to benefit the most. According to its latest quarterly regulatory filing, its 10-Q, Bank of America's net interest income will increase by $5.3 billion over the next 12 months if short- and long-term rates rise by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point. Bank of America obviously won't see the entirety of that $5.3 billion in added net interest income just yet, given that the Fed boosted short-term rates by only a quarter of that amount. But the North Carolina-based bank will benefit from a portion of the increase. And even more importantly, the Fed's decision to hike rates is a clear signal that the economy is heading in the right direction. ","

Image source: Getty Images. For most health insurance providers, the Affordable Care Act, which you know better as Obamacare, has been a veritable nightmare. Most insurers are losing money on their individual ACA plans, and some of the largest names in the industry have begun pulling back on their coverage options. Perhaps the most vocal opponent of Obamacare has been Stephen Hemsley, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurance company in the United States. UnitedHealth Group has suggested that its aggregate losses from Obamacare between 2015 and 2016 could be near $1 billion. As such, Hemsley announced earlier this year that UnitedHealth would significantly reduce its coverage options in 2017 to just three states from the 34 it's offering ACA plans in this year. In the not-so-distant rearview mirror are giants Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM), which had intended to merge with one another, but were denied by regulators because it would unfairly have reduced competition. If allowed to combine, Aetna and Humana had every intention of expanding their ACA offerings. However, when regulators put the kibosh on their combination, both companies swiftly announced a reduction in their 2017 ACA offerings. Aetna wound up reducing the number of counties it's offering coverage in for 2017 by nearly 70%, while Humana slashed its county-based offerings almost 90%. Even Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), which had been viewed as a poster child of success under the ACA given how well it has attracted customers covered by the Medicaid expansion, has threatened to throttle back its ACA plan offerings by 2018 if it doesn't see its financial performance improve in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. In similar fashion, Aetna reported profits of $12 million on its ACA plans in Texas, and $8 million from its plans in Pennsylvania. However, that didn't stop Aetna from packing its bags and leaving both states. Aetna has lost more than $430 million on its ACA plans since Obamacare was launched, and it reported a $200 million pre-tax loss on its individual ACA plans during the second quarter. Health insurers which have strong roots in helping Medicaid patients have also done well (in fact, far better than their larger counterparts). Centene (NYSE:CNC) and Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH), which both centered their businesses around low-income individuals and families, have benefited from 31 states taking federal funds and expanding their Medicaid programs. The result is both companies have generated profits from their association with Obamacare. Image source: Getty Images. Yet, the reality of Obamacare is that most insurers don't see the program as sustainable. There are four reasons why that is, and why most insurance companies simply can't turn a profit. For starters, Obamacare completely changed how insurance companies ""fished"" for new members. In the days before the ACA, insurers could deny coverage to people because of pre-existing medical conditions. If a consumer was deemed to have a costly, chronic condition, they could be turned away. Under the ACA, insurers are no longer able to deny coverage because of an existing medical condition -- a provision of Obamacare that President-elect Donald Trump has praised. This resulted in insurers getting an influx of sicker patients enrolling in ACA plans -- since these were individuals who'd previously been shut out of the system -- and thus having to pay higher-than-expected medical expenses. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) also let the health insurance industry down. Heading into Obamacare's first open enrollment period in fall 2013, insurers were told by the CBO that some 21 million people could be enrolled by 2016. However, the CBO's estimates weren't even in the ballpark. Its current estimate calls for about 10 million paying enrollees on ACA marketplace exchanges by year's end. The CBO simply misjudged how many people would leave their employer-sponsored care for an ACA plan, and also miscalculated how many people were uninsured from the get-go. Insurers have also struggled to court healthier young adults to enroll. The individual mandate, which is the actionable component of the law requiring consumers to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty come tax time, simply hasn't done its job – and it's easy to see why. The Kaiser Family Foundation forecast that the average household Shared Responsibility Payment (SRP) in 2016 would be $969. Yet, the cheapest annual insurance most non-subsidized individuals can find runs $2,400 to $3,600 a year. This large gap makes it cheaper for healthier young adults to just take their lumps with the penalty and remain uninsured. Unfortunately, insurers desperately need these healthier young people to offset the higher costs of sicker new enrollees. Image source: Getty Images. Lastly, the risk corridor was of little use to the industry. The risk corridor was designed to pull money from overly profitable ACA insurers and funnel that cash to ACA insurers losing excessive amounts of money because they priced their premiums too low. Of the $2.87 billion requested for disbursement by money-losing ACA insurers, just $362 million was paid out. Knowing that there was no true financial backing for money-losing insurers, new entrants were discouraged, and three-quarters of Obamacare's approved healthcare cooperatives closed their doors due to losses. The incoming Trump administration also presents as a reason for insurers to potentially shy away from the ACA marketplace. Donald Trump repeatedly pledged throughout his campaign that he would repeal and replace Obamacare once he was in office. Though Trump has opined that he may keep two Obamacare provisions -- requiring insurers to accept all applicants and allowing children under the age of 26 to stay on their parents' plan -- having Republicans in control of both houses of Congress will likely lead to major changes. What might the future hold for healthcare in America? That's really anyone's guess at this point, but it's pretty clear that even with a stray profit here and there from big insurance providers, the Obamacare we've come to know may not be sustainable over the long term.

With one phone call with the leader of Taiwan and several tweets, President-elect Donald Trump has stirred concerns about a potential trade war between the U.S. and China. It's not just industrial and consumer products companies that could be impacted if the two countries fight economically. Should Big Pharma be worried as well? Image source: Disney/ABC Television Group, via Flickr. Several major pharmaceutical companies have significant operations in China. The push to make inroads in the country has intensified in recent years. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) touts itself as the No. 1 foreign biopharmaceutical company in China. The company employs over 10,000 workers in the country across 300 cities. Pfizer has four manufacturing facilities in China, plus two research and development centers. While the company markets 40 products in China, exact sales figures for the Chinese market are not available. Pfizer reported 2015 sales of $11.1 billion from emerging markets, reflecting nearly 23% of total revenue. However, that's a big territory that includes Asia (except Japan and South Korea), Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, the Middle East, and Turkey. Merck (NYSE:MRK) built its first Chinese manufacturing facility in 1994 in Hangzhou. The company now has multiple manufacturing facilties in the country, along with a research and development center in Beijing, plus a sales and marketing headquarters in Shanghai. Although Merck doesn't break out its sales figures for China specifically, the drugmaker reported sales of $3.82 billion in the Asia Pacific region last year. That represented almost 10% of Merck's total revenue. The company's Asia Pacific region includes China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. China has the largest market among the countries in the region. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) beat both Pfizer and Merck in opening up shop in China. J&J started operations in the country in 1979 with a technology-transfer agreement to build a chemical factory. The company followed up in 1985 with its first joint venture in China. Through the years, Johnson & Johnson has continued to expand its presence in the country. Like Pfizer and Merck, Johnson & Johnson doesn't provide details on sales generated in China. The company reported $12.3 billion in sales last year from its Asia Pacific and Africa regions, reflecting nearly 18% of total revenue. It's hard to know for sure what impact a trade war between the U.S. and China would have on Big Pharma. China represents a significant amount of sales for many drugmakers. A more important question is how many of Big Pharma's drugs are manufactured in China versus exported to the country. The most likely scenario for a trade war would involve both the U.S. and China slapping tariffs on products imported from the other nation. Products (including prescription drugs) manufactured in China probably wouldn't be affected. Because Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, and other Big Pharma companies make some of their products in China, the negative impact of a potential trade war would likely be less than it would otherwise be. However, there are other possible issues that could arise. China already is a challenging market in which to operate for multinational companies. The government doesn't make things easy for companies based in other countries now. It would likely get worse if economic tensions increase between the U.S. and China. Also, even though Big Pharma companies still make most of their money outside of China, the country represents a major growth opportunity. China is currently the second-largest pharmaceutical market in the world. Total pharmaceutical sales in the country could reach $167 billion by 2020. Trade barriers could hurt Big Pharma companies trying to get their share of that potential market. At this point, the only war being waged is one of words. China lodged a complaint about Trump's phone call with Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen but hasn't taken further actions. And for his part, President-elect Trump hasn't gone beyond responding with a few tweets. Both Taiwan's president and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have downplayed the significance of the phone call.

Image source: LinkedIn. Software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now the official owner of professional network LinkedIn. The blockbuster $26.2 billion deal, announced in June, is Microsoft's largest acquisition ever by a large margin (the second-largest acquisition was Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011), and it makes plenty of sense on a strategic level, given both companies' comprehensive focus on the enterprise, productivity, and professionals. But Microsoft has a poor record when it comes to massive acquisitions. ""Poor"" might even be too generous; the software giant's track record is downright awful. The two worst deals in recent memory were aQuantive ($6 billion) and Nokia's handset business ($7.2 billion), both of which resulted in massive impairments and writedowns as Microsoft failed to execute. The key distinction here is that most of Microsoft's failed acquisitions were made under Steve Ballmer, and Satya Nadella has now been CEO for over two-and-a-half years. Of course, Microsoft has made many acquisitions under Nadella (nearly three dozen), but most of those were fairly small and targeted. LinkedIn will be the biggest test on the acquisition front, and any success or failure to execute on the vision for LinkedIn will strongly reflect on Nadella's leadership record. The bar for success will be high, given the price tag. I've said this before, but it's not just about what you buy, but also what you pay for it. By sheer virtue of the price, Microsoft will create a commensurately high level of risk should things go sideways. The transaction will definitely increase Microsoft's goodwill by a meaningful amount. In accounting for goodwill, Microsoft will need to measure the fair value of acquired assets, which can potentially differ from the current carrying value on LinkedIn's balance sheet. It will also need to net out the fair value of liabilities that it's assuming, and it's worth noting that the $26.2 billion valuation is inclusive of cash acquired and refers to enterprise value, which includes the debt that Microsoft is buying. Fair value analyses are often conducted by third-party valuation companies. Microsoft was carrying $21.4 billion in goodwill and net intangibles at the end of last quarter. The context for the high price is that LinkedIn was already publicly trading at fairly high multiples, as investors were pricing in long-term growth (40% plunge earlier this year notwithstanding). In fact, that earnings-related sell-off likely set the stage for this acquisition, as it made shares that much cheaper. Plus, there was the whole bidding war with salesforce.com, which reportedly kicked off the festivities around $160 to $165 per share. Microsoft ended up paying $196 per share. LinkedIn has become a powerful force in professional networking, and it would be a shame if Microsoft somehow screwed it up. That's why it's encouraging that LinkedIn will still mostly operate independently, in order to maintain its strong brand and culture. For now, Nadella deserves the benefit of the doubt, as he has delivered handsome returns to shareholders so far thanks largely to executing on cross-platform strategies, something that was never possible under Ballmer. Let's hope he follows through with LinkedIn and puts an end to Microsoft's bad rap. ","

Casino companies have spent much of the last decade thinking about how to spin off non-core assets in an effort to reduce debt and focus their business on running hotels, entertainment, and casinos. Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) has long taken a strategy of selling off retail assets to mall operators, helping pay for The Venetian and Palazzo Las Vegas. MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) recently spun off some real estate assets. Steve Wynn and his company Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) have always taken a more conservative approach to asset sales. He wants to control the entire Wynn experience, and owning the assets that drive that experience are key to the company's operations. Yesterday, he gave up a little control by selling some shopping assets, although Wynn won't give up complete control just yet. Image source: Wynn Resorts. The retail sale Wynn announced yesterday will take place in two phases. First is the $292 million sale of 49.9% of Wynn Las Vegas' owned and leased retail, which includes the high-end retailers in the resort today. The second phase is the $180 million sale of 49.9% of the Wynn Plaza when it opens in 2017. In total, $472 million will be paid for just under half of Wynn Las Vegas' retail space. That falls well below the $2.0 billion Las Vegas Sands has gotten for The Venetian and Palazzo mall, or the $1.1 billion paid to MGM for CityCenter's Crystals mall. But the Wynn retail space is smaller than both of those malls, and Wynn Resorts will maintain control of the entire space. The control piece is key for Wynn Resorts. Wynn Las Vegas is constantly changing, and this gives the company the freedom to make changes when necessary while still taking cash out of existing assets. The sale of an important asset within the casino may sound strange, but it has to do with selling assets to investors who value them more highly than a gaming company. Wynn said the first sale will have a capitalization rate, or net operating income divided by what was paid for the asset, of 4.7%, and the second sale will be a cap rate of 4.5% to 5%. When a resort is built, gaming companies usually target equity returns of over 20% and returns on the overall investment of over 10%. So, if others value those assets more highly, it makes sense to sell them, which is happening with retail in Las Vegas. The cash infusion comes at an opportune time for Wynn Resorts. The balance sheet had $9.44 billion in debt at the end of the third quarter to $2.02 billion in cash, and that's before the $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion that's expected to be spent on Wynn Boston Harbor. This will give management the opportunity to pay down some debt or keep cash on the balance sheet for future cash needs. For investors, it gives the company a little time to bring Wynn Cotail up to speed and move forward with Wynn Boston Harbor, which will bring a new level of cash flow to the company. The future for Wynn Resorts just got a little brighter, and it's all about the new influx of cash. ","

There was a time, not so very long ago, when a mortgage interest rate even approaching 4% would send countless Americans to their banks to refinance their homes. Now, after five years with rates below or just above that level, many people have forgotten that on a historic level, sub-4% mortgages are an incredible deal. In fact, according to Freddie Mac (NASDAQOTH:FMCC), the average annual interest rate on a 30-year mortgage has topped 4% only once in the past five years, when it came in at 4.17% in 2014. Even in that year, the average dropped to 3.86% in December, a number it has hovered around for nearly two years. Heading into 2017, though, with a new Donald Trump-led administration taking over the White House, rates may very well rise, as they have done by about a quarter of a percentage point since the election ended. That could be bad news not only for people seeking to buy a new home, but also for people looking to sell. ""With the incoming administration's policies driving a large portion of upward rate momentum, mortgage rates will be hard-pressed to make significant improvements until after Trump takes office,"" wrote MortgageNewsDaily.com. ""Rates can move for other reasons, but it would take something big and unexpected for rates to move appreciably lower."" Trump winning the presidency has pushed bond yields higher and that has caused mortgage rates to inch up. It's important to not that today's rates, which still average below 4% for a 30-year mortgage, remain ridiculously low by historical standards. Over the past 45 years that average rate has been 8.26%, according to data from Freddie Mac. Bond rates have been steadily rising since Trump won the presidency. If that continues then mortgage rates will follow. As the following chart shows, 10-year Treasury notes, a common form of bond, have seen rates move higher since November. Image source: YCharts.com. The higher the interest rate you pay on your loan, the more you will pay each month. If you have a mortgage of $100,000 with a 5% interest rate your monthly payment will be $536.82. Paying 0.25% more pushes your monthly payment to $552.20, $15.38 higher. That doesn't sound like much, but it works out to $184.56 extra each year and $5,536.80 over the 30 years of a loan. One quarter of a percent up or down may not change how much house most buyers can afford, but if rates move from steadily below 4% to 5% or even higher, it could change the housing market. How you should respond to the potential of rising rates depends on whether you're a buyer or seller. If you plan to sell your home in the near future, it makes sense to list it now before rates rise, which could not only thin the number of buyers but also push prices down. If you're a buyer, the choice is less clear, and it becomes a bit of a math problem. Paying more interest on your mortgage is bad, but if higher mortgage rates force house prices down while keeping others out of the market, that could actually be a benefit. For those who already own a home they intend to stay in, rising rates mean it's time to refinance if you have a variable-rate mortgage or one where the interest rate is above the current still-near-historic lows. In that case, it becomes a different equation: Here, refinancing makes sense if the amount you'll save from doing so will pay back whatever closing costs you incur in a time period that's less than the length of time you plan to remain in the home.

For the second time in a little more than a month, a former market darling is ditching the co-CEO model in favor of a single chief executive. Last month, it was Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM); this time it's Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Whole Foods will move back to having a single CEO next month. Image source: The Motley Fool. Whole Foods and Chipotle are facing new challenges that have proven harder to surmount than originally expected. As a result, both companies are concentrating power in the hands of their founders in the hope that they will be able to revitalize the businesses they built from scratch. John Mackey has led Whole Foods Market since co-founding the company more than three decades ago. But in 2010, he promoted longtime Whole Foods executive Walter Robb to be co-CEO, as Robb wanted to be a CEO but Mackey didn't want to retire. Whole Foods prospered for a few years after that unorthodox move. However, over the past three years or so, virtually every grocery chain has expanded its offerings of organic and natural foods. This competition has stymied revenue growth for the grocery chain while also crimping its profit margin. As a result, Whole Foods shares have lost about half of their value since late 2013. Whole Foods Market revenue, stock price, and margin performance. Data by YCharts. Whole Foods has reacted to rising competitive pressures by cutting prices and opening a new chain of smaller, value-focused stores, called 365 by Whole Foods. It is also looking to redesign the operating model of its namesake locations in order to drive down costs. In this context, Whole Foods announced last month that Walter Robb will step down as co-CEO at year-end. Mackey will return to his prior role as sole CEO. This will give him more autonomy to shape the company's response to recent competitive challenges. Chipotle Mexican Grill's leadership history is eerily similar to that of Whole Foods. Steve Ells has led the company since founding it in 1993. But in 2009, he promoted his longtime friend Monty Moran from the general counsel position to be co-CEO of the company. As co-CEO, Moran oversaw store operations and helped develop Chipotle's corporate culture. However, like Whole Foods, Chipotle has fallen on hard times recently. Whereas a creeping increase in competition has gradually reduced Whole Foods' profit margin over the last three years, Chipotle's profitability simply collapsed in the past year. Chipotle's customer base has shrunk in the past year. Image source: The Motley Fool. Comparable sales have fallen more than 20% year over year for three consecutive quarters after a series of food safety lapses last fall. Meanwhile, Chipotle has had to spend more on advertising and promotions in order to try to win back customers. Chipotle has thoroughly revamped its food safety procedures to prevent a repeat of last year's E. coli and norovirus outbreaks. However, sales haven't bounced back as quickly as expected. The food safety scares have put Chipotle in the spotlight, so that rumors about people getting sick at Chipotle now routinely go viral on social media. Additionally, throughput has slowed this year, due to employee turnover and a loss of focus on efficiency. As a result, Moran stepped down last Friday as co-CEO of Chipotle, with Ells becoming the sole CEO again. The events of the past year have shown that the company needs a meaningful shake-up, and the board felt that this would work better with a single CEO. On a conference call to discuss the changes, Ells said that having fewer layers of management will allow him to interact more directly with the store leadership teams. That's important because the centerpiece of his strategy involves simplifying everything that's done in the company's restaurants in order to improve customer service. Chipotle founder and CEO Steve Ells wants to improve customer service. Image source: The Motley Fool. When things were going well at Whole Foods and Chipotle Mexican Grill, it wasn't crazy to have two CEOs. At both companies, the co-CEOs were longtime friends, they worked well together, and there was a natural division of labor between them. Having co-CEOs may have helped the companies grow quickly. However, when a company needs to reinvent itself, one voice is probably better than two. A single CEO is more likely to develop a coherent strategy. Furthermore, a streamlined hierarchy is more conducive to ""testing and learning"" with respect to major operational changes. As founders of their respective companies, Mackey and Ells have the credibility to get buy-in from employees if they decide to implement big changes. Simply put, they are the right people to lead the businesses they founded through their current challenges. ","

Can I qualify for spousal benefits even though we divorced decades ago? Will my Social Security be reduced if my ex-spouse files a spousal claim on my work record? Read on to learn more about the relationship between divorce and Social Security. Image source: Getty Images. Social Security provides an important financial safety net to millions of seniors. To qualify for Social Security, you must accumulate 40 work credits, which is the equivalent of a 10-year work history. The amount of money you'll receive in Social Security benefits depends on a complex calculation based on up to 35 years of inflation-adjusted income. While the amount paid out in benefits varies widely from person to person, the program is designed to replace, on average, 40% of your preretirement income. In 2017, the average retired worker will receive $1,360 per month in Social Security benefits. While most people's benefits are based entirely on their own work records, people can also receive benefits on a spouse's work record, if their spousal benefits are higher than the benefits they would otherwise receive. A spouse, or an ex-spouse who meets certain qualifications (more on that in a minute), can receive a permanently reduced spousal benefit beginning at age 62. Or a spouse or ex-spouse can receive up to the maximum 50% of the spouse's/ex-spouse's full retirement amount, if they wait to claim until they reach their own full retirement age. A spouse or ex-spouse's full retirement age varies between age 66 and age 67, depending on the year in which they were born. Data source: Internal Revenue Service. Table by author. Regardless of how long ago your marriage ended, you may still qualify for spousal benefits on your ex-spouse's work record, as long as you were married 10 years or longer, and you meet the following criteria: If you're remarried, you usually can't collect spousal benefits on your ex-spouse's work record, unless your remarriage has also ended (by divorce, death, or annulment). Social Security bases spousal benefits on the primary worker's average indexed monthly earnings, or AIME. Specifically, the highest 35 years of earnings are indexed and averaged, and then bend points are applied to to determine the primary insurance amount, or PIA. In 2017, 90% of the first $885 in AIME, 23% of earnings between $885 and $5,336, and 15% of earnings above $5,336 are added together to calculate a worker's PIA. Fortunately, you don't have to work with this formula yourself. As long as you're applying within three months of turning 62, the Social Security Administration can walk you through your benefits online, by phone, or in person. When applying for benefits as an ex-spouse, you'll be asked to provide information such as the birth date or age of your former spouse, as well as his or her Social Security number, if you know it. You'll also be asked to provide your marriage certificate and your final divorce decree, and you may also be asked to provide other information. If you have an ex-spouse who is claiming Social Security on your work record, rest easy. A spousal benefit paid to an ex-spouse does not reduce your Social Security benefits. If you're an ex-spouse who claims spousal benefits, you're younger than your full retirement age, and you plan to keep working, then you could end up having some of your Social Security income held back, if your income is too high. Social Security will hold back $1 for every $2 you earn above $16,920 in 2017. Any money that is withheld in 2017 because of this earnings limit will be used later to increase your benefit once you reach your full retirement age. Additionally, spousal Social Security benefits may be taxable, depending on your income. For example, single Americans who earn adjusted incomes of more than $25,000 in 2017 will pay income taxes on at least some of their Social Security income. To get a rough calculation of your adjusted income, add one-half of your Social Security income to your other sources of income. If your adjusted income is above the threshold for paying taxes on spousal benefits, make sure to plan ahead so that you avoid a surprise at tax time. ","

Maurie Backman,12152016,Fool,12082016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The average retirement age in the U.S. is around 63, and many Americans retire at 62, when they're able to start collecting Social Security. Of course, there are also plenty of folks who work well into their 70s, both for personal and financial reasons. But even if you haven't narrowed down a specific retirement age at this point, it's fair to say that if you're like most Americans, you'll be retiring within the next decade and a half. And that means you should be maximizing your savings now, while you can. If you're in your 50s, you can contribute up to $6,500 a year to an IRA and $24,000 to a 401(k). And now's when you should aim to hit those limits, because even if you're planning to retire in your early 60s, you still have an opportunity to take advantage of compounding and grow your savings. Imagine you're planning to retire as early as 62 but manage to sock away $24,000 a year in a 401(k) for the next seven years. If your investments generate a conservative average annual 4% return, by the time you're ready to retire, you'll have an extra $189,000 at your disposal. Even if you're only able to save $6,000 a year for the next seven years, that would still give you an extra $47,000 for retirement assuming a 4% return. No matter when you're planning to retire, save as much as possible while you still have a chance to do so -- because once you leave the workforce, your opportunities to generate extra income will be far more limited. You know those 55-and-over communities you keep hearing about? If your house is aging and you no longer need as much space, you may want to book a tour. Whether you opt to rent or buy in an adult community, there's a good chance you'll save on housing compared to what you're currently paying. As you very well know, when you own a home, you're responsible for maintaining it. Most homeowners spend anywhere from 1% to 4% of their property's value on annual maintenance and repairs, but if your home is getting older, you'll probably hit the higher end of that range. Renting might therefore help you minimize your risk of incurring hefty upkeep costs as retirement nears. Even if you opt to buy an apartment or condo in an adult community, there's a good chance your maintenance fees will be lower than what you're paying to maintain a stand-alone home. Best of all, many of these communities are loaded with amenities, from clubhouses to swimming pools, to keep you well entertained when you're not at work. Though there's never a convenient time to lose your job, getting laid off in your mid-50s could upend your finances and hinder your retirement plans. According to research out of Boston College, unemployed workers 55 and up are less likely than unemployed younger workers to find new jobs. After the 2008-2009 recession, it took unemployed workers 55 and over an average of 40.6 weeks to get rehired, compared to just 31.6 weeks for younger workers. And the longer you remain out of work, the more of a financial hit you might take. In a 2014 Rutgers University study, 55% of workers who were unemployed for six months or longer said they'd need to postpone retirement as a result. Turning 55 can be a major wakeup call on the road to retirement, so now's the time to examine your savings and start making plans for the future. A few smart moves this year could put you in a strong financial position as you navigate this next exciting stage of your life. ","

It is in that sense a more or less typical Republican Cabinet — but on steroids. Not surprisingly after a broad swath of Americans voted for change, the new administration-in-waiting signals a marked departure from the Democratic polices of President Barack Obama. Estimates of the net worth of the Cabinet picks so far is well north of $14 billion (if you include the nominee for deputy commerce secretary, Todd Ricketts, and his $5.3 billion), mostly fortunes made or inherited from business empires. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who campaigned for the Democratic nomination against “millionaires and billionaires,” bashed the nominees over the weekend as a “Cabinet of billionaires.” He said that is no way for Trump to back up his pledge to stand up to the establishment, but he offered no specific criticism of their qualifications.

                                   one of the biggest companies in the world, is confirmed as secretary of state, he would be a relative piker with his measly quarter billion next to the likes of Ricketts, Education Secretary-nominee Betsy DeVos ($5 billion), Commerce Secretary-nominee Wilbur Ross ($2.5 billion) and Small Business Administrator-nominee Linda McMahon ($1.6 billion). These people don’t need to work, in other words, and their willingness to serve in a Trump Cabinet could be motivated by anything from patriotism to having an ax to grind. But for sure, they’re not taking a Cabinet job as a springboard to a cushy, high-paying job in the private sector after their government service, as, say, Obama’s first Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner. As with the retired three- and four-star generals among Trump’s early Cabinet picks, these accomplished businessmen and women do represent a caliber of executive power somewhat higher than the usual rag-tag Cabinet picks. Obama thought so little of his Cabinet that he initially installed a coterie of “czars” for key areas in the White House to supersede their authority. In any case, he seemed to have little use for either czars or Cabinet members in formulating and executing administration policy, relying instead on a cadre of close advisers like Valerie Jarrett. Trump’s Cabinet choices are, by and large, independent-minded individuals with a record of achievement. They are more used to taking responsibility than taking orders and would be curious choices for a president considered by some to be so authoritarian he is on the verge of installing a fascist dictatorship in Washington. In any case, the likes of Tillerson, Ross and Treasury Secretary-nominee Steven Mnuchin aren’t going to stick around if they don’t have a real policy role. Ditto for the generals — James Mattis at Defense, Michael Flynn as national security adviser, and John Kelly at Homeland Security. The other category of appointments are the elected officials, who do in fact often have an ax to grind. Georgia Rep. Tom Price wants to repeal and replace Obamacare at Health and Human Services, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt wants to rein in the Environmental Protection Agency as administrator, and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions wants to de-politicize the Justice Department as attorney general. Thankfully, Trump moved on from consideration of Mitt Romney, the losing 2012 Republican nominee for president, for secretary of state. The top Cabinet position was starting to look like the consolation prize for losing the presidency after Obama appointed first Clinton, his rival for the 2008 Democratic nomination and then John Kerry, who lost in his 2004 challenge to George Bush’s re-election. The most effective secretaries of state in recent history have not been politicians. Either they have been successful lawyer-negotiators like James Baker or Warren Christopher, or academics like Henry Kissinger or George Shultz. Tillerson as CEO of a large multinational is something new for State. Much has been made of the Goldman Sachs

                                   influence on the new administration team. Mnuchin, following in his father’s footsteps, cut his deal-making teeth at Goldman. White House strategist Steve Bannon put in his time there, and the designated director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, was long considered to be the next CEO at the investment bank. Press commentary so far has largely ignored the not-insignificant activities of Mnuchin and Bannon as producers in Hollywood — an immersion in popular culture that is hardly normal experience for top Washington jobs — perhaps because it is harder to pigeonhole people if you look at their full careers. In any case, if you elect a Republican president, it’s not unusual to get some Wall Street people in the administration. The beef that Sanders and many voters had with Hillary Clinton is that you can’t avoid getting Wall Streeters even if you vote Democratic. Then there’s the charge that Trump is creating a military junta because three of his choices for two dozen top jobs are retired military. But Trump supporters have countered this criticism by recalling that Obama, too, had three retired four-stars among his initial team: Marine Gen. Jim Jones as national security adviser, Army Gen. Eric Shinseki as veterans affairs secretary and Navy Adm. Dennis Blair as director of national intelligence. No talk of a junta then. And national security posts seem to be a better fit for four-star military than secretary of state, as the mixed records of Alexander Haig and Colin Powell in that post would seem to indicate. Last but not least among issues in the debate over Cabinet appointments and the very legitimacy of Trump’s election is the country’s bogeyman of the moment, Vladimir Putin. Public concern about the Russian leader is reaching a level of hysteria not seen since the red scare of the McCarthy era, which must be a considerable source of satisfaction for Putin. Anyone who thinks a Trump-Tillerson team will simply be Putin puppets are as gullible in their own way as the people who thought Obama was born in Kenya, was a practicing Muslim and was going to introduce Sharia law into the United States. For those not blinded by partisan ideology, however, the aborning administration is largely what you’d expect from a Republican president and is filled with serious people who hopefully will do a good job for the country.

But in the shadowy world of espionage, accusations and counter-accusations, how can the ordinary citizen tell if the next U.S. president is actually an agent of the Kremlin? Good news: We’ve got your back. Here are 10 “telltale signs” that a U.S. president might be a Russian spy, and how we might be able to swear in a “Comrade-in-Chief” next month. 1. U.S. intelligence concludes that the Kremlin helped put him in power. That’s usually a pretty strong giveaway right there. The CIA has never before accused the Kremlin of interfering in a U.S. election. They’re probably not 0-for-1. Mind you, when Russian hackers pointedly attacked and embarrassed Donald Trump’s opponent, but left him completely alone, you have to ask: Did we really need a report by the CIA? 2. The new president sides with the Kremlin against the CIA. Trump’s dismissive response to this news includes three classic spin techniques: shooting the messenger, by attacking the CIA; misdirection, by raising doubts about the CIA’s competence, namely the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when it didn’t; and begging the question, by implying we should now “move on.” Neither is a serious argument. Indeed, if the CIA’s report is accurate, why on Earth would we “move on”? Imagine Ronald Reagan or Dwight Eisenhower reacting this way to a CIA statement about Kremlin activities in the U.S. Go on — try. 3. He receives vast sums of money from mysterious Russians. This even includes an astonishing $95 million that Trump personally received from a Russian billionaire during the 2008 collapse. In Vladimir Putin’s kleptostate, there is no fine line between the state and the private sector, the president and the oligarchs. As Trump’s son Eric confessed: “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. … We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.” 4. His election suddenly makes a lot of people rich … in Moscow. You think Wall Street has done well since Trump’s election victory? The S&P 500 stock index

                                  of the U.S. is up about 5% since Nov. 8. Moscow’s RTS index: 20%. Yes, really — from 973 to 1,148. Let the vodka flow! It’s not just about the oil rally, either. The RTS’s increase is more than twice that of global energy stocks. Putin and his pals were nursing painful losses for several years. But no longer — Moscow stocks are back to their highest levels since the Ukrainian crisis. 5. He wants to end Russia’s global isolation. Vladimir Putin’s sinister state has been subject to global sanctions since 2014, and for good reason. He’s destabilized Ukraine and annexed Crimea. The British government concluded he had “probably” assassinated a critic in London. He helped arm the people who blew up Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, killing 298 people. Trump’s response? He praises Putin’s leadership, wants to “get along” with Russia, and hints strongly at ending those sanctions — something he can do by executive order. 6. He surrounds himself with known Russian agents and sympathizers. Those include Carter Page and the menacing Paul Manafort. You’d imagine that a Kremlin agent in the White House would appoint a close friend of Russia — indeed, someone who actually won the Russian Order of Friendship award — as secretary of state. See:  Donald Trump taps Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson to lead State Department No wonder one of Putin’s advisers is praising Trump’s “fantastic” team. 7. He repeatedly refuses to criticize the Kremlin. It’s been Sherlock Holmes’s dog that didn’t bark. Time and again, during the election campaign and since, Trump has had every opportunity and incentive to criticize Vladimir Putin. He was repeatedly criticized on the campaign trail for being too soft on Putin, or too friendly toward him, or even in Putin’s pocket. And each time, Trump failed. He just couldn’t criticize Putin. Not even for allegedly murdering journalists. I mean, how hard is that? Sometimes silence speaks louder than words. 8. He immediately drives a wedge between the U.S. and Russia’s chief Asian rival, China. What could make the Kremlin happier than a public feud between Washington and Beijing — for example, over Taiwan? A full trade war between the two, including tariffs — that’s what! In retrospect, doesn’t it seem odd that so much of Trump’s campaign has been devoted to attacking China and demonizing the Chinese (oh, and the Japanese) before the eyes of the American public? Any conflict or tension between the U.S. and China, the world’s two biggest economic powers, is great news for Russia. It weakens China, hurts international unity against Russia and reduces America’s strategic options. Brilliant! 9. He also undermines NATO. Trump’s comments undermining NATO, and particularly its commitment to the Baltic states, has long been the stuff of fantasy to Putin’s Kremlin. The Russians have hated the North Atlantic Treaty Organization since Harry Truman set it up in 1949 to stop the Soviet Union’s expansion of its European sphere of influence. They’re especially furious about the Western alliance’s expansion into Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Many in Russia consider the Baltic states to be traditional subjects of the “Russian empire.” It tells you a lot that the Lithuanian government recently started handing out instructions to its citizens on how to cope if Russian tanks roll back in. 10. Oh, yeah — and he once marketed his own brand of vodka. Not beer. Not bourbon. Not even gin. Vodka. Really, in retrospect, how hard was this?

Now our democratic institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American. “Congress’s national security committees have worked diligently to address the complex challenge of cybersecurity, but recent events show that more must be done. While protecting classified material, we have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society. Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks. “This cannot become a partisan issue.

Jeremy Page,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 14, 2016 10:34 p.m. ET China had promises not to militarize disputed islands in South China Sea By BEIJING — China has installed antiaircraft guns and other weapons on all seven of the artificial islands it has built in a disputed part of the South China Sea, according to a U.S. think tank’s analysis of recent satellite imagery. Late Wednesday, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative said China had installed the weapons despite President Xi Jinping’s pledge not to militarize the islands in the Spratly archipelago, where Beijing’s territorial claims are contested by several other governments. AMTI’s report, published on its website, comes after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump suggested this month he would challenge China on trade and the status of Taiwan, and accused Beijing of building a “massive military complex” in the South China Sea. China’s island-building over the last three years has raised fears in the U.S. and among its Asian allies and partners that Beijing plans to use its expanding military power to enforce its territorial claims and take control of one of the world’s busiest shipping routes.

Steve Goldstein,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 13, 2016 4:52 p.m. ET ’I don’t have views on politics, I just have a view on humanity, on people, on the truth,’ West has said of his own presidential ambitions By Two reality-television stars on Tuesday posed for photographs and said nothing consequential. President-elect Donald Trump posed with rapper Kanye West after a brief meeting at Trump Tower, which over the last month has served as a waiting lounge of sorts for potential cabinet members. ‘We’ve been friends for a long time,” Trump said to reporters. “We discussed life.” West didn’t offer an account of the meeting at the photo-op. But the spouse of Kim Kardashian tweeted later Tuesday that he wanted to discuss “multicultural issues” with Trump. Here’s what West said, including a tweet simply reading “#2024” — which could mean he’s deferring a presidential run until then. West has frequently said he’s considering a run for president in 2020. A run by West in 2020, should he stick to that time frame, could set up a head-to-head battle with Trump, should Trump seek re-election. “I don’t have views on politics, I just have a view on humanity, on people, on the truth,” West has said of his presidential ambitions. West recently said he would have voted for Trump, had he bothered to show up at the polls. He told an audience last month that Trump ran a “genius” campaign. The meeting immediately drew comparisons to singer Elvis Presley’s meeting with President Richard Nixon in 1970: .@kanyewest It's been done. pic.twitter.com/rhdID0rNCn Presidents (and those about to take office) frequently meet with celebrities from various walks of life. West appeared at a fundraiser with President Obama in 2015. “Kanye” quickly became the No. 1 trending topic in the country, with comments on Twitter reflecting a mixture of humor and horror: ""This is Kanye West.

It’s 1.1% weekly loss was its first, and also its worst, in three weeks. On Thursday, the European Central Bank surprised investors by announcing that it would reduce its monthly bond purchases to €60 billion ($64 billion) beginning in April. Market strategists had widely expected the central bank to extend the program, which was set to expire in March, at its present €80 billion ($85 billion) pace for most of 2017. In addition, Draghi said the central bank’s governing council had not discussed tapering its asset purchases, while also saying that the central bank would begin buying bonds with yields below the ECB’s deposit rate of minus 0.4%. These comments show that, despite the reduction, Draghi and company have made a long-term commitment to ultraloose monetary policy, said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank. “Even if they were to taper more, we’re seeing a large amount of additional stimulus,” Foley said, adding that the additional liquidity could provide a cushion for European assets heading into a year rife with political uncertainty. By purchasing bonds, the ECB is essentially pumping euros into the global financial system, contributing to the currency’s weakness. The shared currency has fallen sharply over the month since the U.S. presidential election won by Donald Trump, which inspired a dramatic dollar rally that drove the euro to its weakest level since March 2015. The euro edged lower after a report from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment in the U.S. has improved this month. Currency traders now turn their attention to next week’s meeting Dec. 13-14 of the Federal Reserve. The central bank is widely expected to raise rates for the first time in a year, which could add to the pressure on the euro, Foley said. Markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance of a hike next week. “It’s the expectation that we are seeing a divergence of policies between what the ECB is doing and what the Fed is expected to do over the next few months,” Foley said.

But it soon turned lower, falling more than 1.5% to a three-day low of $1.0602, as investors realized that the statement contained a mixed message of continued stimulus but at a lower level, which was viewed as both dovish and hawkish. The euro traded at $1.0616 late Thursday in New York. “The euro/dollar was exposed to extreme levels of volatility during trading on Thursday following the European Central Bank’s market shaking decision to taper its monetary stimulus,” said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at FXTM, in a note. “The euro first rallied on the headline that the ECB would be reducing its purchases. The euro then fell on the headline that the ECB would be extending the purchases’ time horizon,” said Doug Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine FX, a subsidiary of Tullett Prebon. The ECB’s decision surprised many market strategists and investors who had expected the central bank to extend its program of buying public and private eurozone debt at its present pace of €80 billion ($80.6 billion) for most of 2017. Instead, the central bank announced it would taper the program to €60 billion ($64 billion) beginning in April. The central bank also left interest rates unchanged as expected. During a news conference, President Mario Draghi of the ECB said the central bank would be comfortable buying bonds with yields below the central bank’s deposit rate, which stands at minus 0.4%. The ECB also announced that Eurosystem central banks will also be able to accept cash as collateral for their lending facilities. Draghi also said the governing council had not discussed scaling back its bond-buying program, and that the decision to reduce its program didn’t amount to tapering. He assured investors that the central bank would be involved in the markets “for a long time.” Read: All eyes on ECB ahead of key meeting: Live blog Read: How Italy’s ‘no’ vote might be the ECB’s silver lining Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at the close of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Fed-funds futures, used by investors to speculate on the direction and pace of rising interest rates, were pricing in a more than 97% probability of a hike next week. John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, noted that monetary policy in the eurozone is likely to largely remain loose despite the ECB announcement. This divergence from the U.S. where the Fed is poised to tighten its policy is expected to lead to a further weakness in the euro with the currency trading at parity against the U.S. dollar by the end of 2017.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday evening is the latest blow for Europe’s tourism industry, hitting a city that had been attracting more and more visitors in recent years. The truck ploughed into a crowd enjoying mulled wine and festive food at a popular tourist location in former West Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring 48 in what German authorities said seemed to be a deliberate attack. The attack was reminiscent of the carnage in the French city of Nice in July when a gunman drove a heavy truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 people and injuring scores. “Christmas markets are a big attraction for German cities, including Berlin, and this attack will no doubt impact the amount of visitors for the remainder of this year,” Wouter Geerts, travel analyst at Euromonitor, said. The attacks in Nice and Paris last November as well as Brussels in March have already dampened demand for travel to Europe, especially from the United States, China and Japan. ForwardKeys, which predicts travel patterns by analyzing 16 million reservations a day, has said Chinese outbound bookings to Europe have fallen 7.7 percent between mid-November 2015 and mid-October 2016. On Tuesday, ForwardKeys said bookings to Berlin were down 6.6 percent so far this year due to concerns about security in Europe. But it said bookings to the German capital had been staging a recovery over the last two months, with reservations up 11 percent compared with the same period last year. Berlin has more than 60 Christmas markets. Visitors are also attracted by its history, vibrant nightlife and relatively low costs for a European capital, all of which have helped boost visitor numbers in recent years. According to Euromonitor, trips to Berlin have risen by 50 percent since 2010. Between January and October, the latest month for which data is available, the Berlin-Brandenburg statistics office said arrivals rose 2.5 percent to 10.7 million, driven in particular by demand from Britain. The numbers for November and December were also looking excellent, according to Burkhard Kieker, head of tourism promotion group visitBerlin. He said he had spoken with hotels and there were no signs visitors were hastily packing their bags to leave the city. “It is important that we continue to demonstrate our way of life, our hospitality, our culture, to show that it will not be destroyed by the actions of others,” he said. Berlin has one of the highest unemployment rates in Germany at 10.7 percent and tourists are a major driver of the local economy, accounting for about 40 percent of sales in the city’s shopping streets and malls. Authorities in Germany and elsewhere in Europe responded to Monday’s attack by saying they would step up security measures at Christmas markets and New Year events, with a more visible police presence and more frequent patrols. Berlin’s Christmas markets will remain shut on Tuesday out of respect for the victims and police said they would erect extra security barriers in the coming days. However, Euromonitor’s Geerts said he did not expect a major impact on tourism to Germany and Berlin next year. ForwardKeys founder Olivier Jager agreed: “It is too early to say what the impact of last night’s incident will be, but one thing we do know is that travelers in general are becoming less put off by terrorist attacks than they used to be.” ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"MOSCOW/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said he and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan are working to organize a new series of Syrian peace talks without the involvement of the United States or the United Nations. In a snub to Washington, Putin made clear on Friday that the initiative was the sole preserve of Moscow and Turkey and that the peace talks, if they happened, would be in addition to intermittent U.N.-brokered negotiations in Geneva. “The next step is to reach an agreement on a total  ceasefire across the whole of Syria,” Putin said in Tokyo. “We are conducting very active negotiations with representatives of the armed opposition, brokered by Turkey.” Putin, who has leveraged Russia’s role in Syria to boost his diplomatic muscle, said the talks proposal was being put to the Syrian government and the opposition. Kazakhstan, the proposed venue, is a Russian ally, and Putin said the talks could take place in Astana, the Kazakh capital. The surprise move underlines the growing strength of Moscow’s rapprochement with Ankara, with which it fell out last year over the shooting down of a Russian plane, and reflects Russia’s desire to cement its growing influence in the Middle East and more widely. It also shows how fed up Russia is with what it sees as long and pointless talks with the Obama administration over Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier this week dismissed those talks as “fruitless sitting around” and said Ankara might prove a more effective partner on Syria. Turkey, which wants to boost its global sway too, is also deeply frustrated by U.S. policy in Syria, particularly Washington’s support for Kurdish militia fighters it sees as a hostile force, and by what it views as Barack Obama’s failure to give enough support to the rebels. Putin played down the idea that the talks would sideline or overshadow similar talks brokered by the United Nations that have been held intermittently in Geneva. “It won’t compete with the Geneva talks, but will complement them. Wherever the conflicting sides meet, in my view it is the right thing to do to try to find a political solution,” he said. The initiative is unlikely to go down well with U.N. envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura however. He told reporters in Paris on Thursday that it was time for all sides to return to the table, but the United Nations would have to broker any talks for them to have legitimacy. Russia still hopes it can co-operate on Syria with the United States and join forces with Washington against Islamic State once President-elect Donald Trump takes office. But Trump will not be inaugurated until Jan. 20, leaving a power vacuum, and is likely in any case to need some time to formulate foreign policy. The alliance between Moscow and Ankara is at first glance an odd one. Russia is one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s closest allies, while Turkey, a NATO member, wants him removed. But Ankara may be ready to accept a transition in which Assad is involved, provided he ultimately relinquishes power. Turkey’s main priority, on which it will want at least tacit Russian agreement, is to ensure that Kurdish militias are unable to gain further territory in Syria along its borders. Ankara launched an incursion into Syria, “Operation Euphrates Shield”, in August to push Islamic State out of a 90-km (55-mile) stretch of frontier territory and prevent Kurdish groups from seizing ground in their wake. Deputy Prime Minister Nurettin Canikli acknowledged two weeks ago that Turkey “would not have moved so comfortably” without the rapprochement with Russia, which effectively controls parts of northern Syrian air space. Turkey now wants the rebels it supports to push further south into Syria and take the Islamic State-held city of al-Bab, around 40 km northeast of Aleppo. Erdogan is determined that the Turkish-backed rebels capture the city to prevent Kurdish militias from doing so. But that ambition could cause difficulties with Moscow, as al-Bab lies close to the front lines of Assad’s allies. Putin had only warm words for the prospect of deeper Russo-Turkish co-operation however and said the evacuation of rebels from Aleppo was something that he and Erdogan had agreed on. He hoped the Syrian army would be able to consolidate its position in Aleppo and civilians return to normal life. The RIA agency this week quoted Andrei Kelin, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, as saying it had been easier to deal with Turkey on Aleppo than the United States. “It was much more straightforward to reach agreements with Turkey than with the Americans,” he was cited as saying. Putin played down the Syrian government’s recent loss of Palmyra to Islamic State, blaming the lack of coordination between the U.S. led coalition, the Syrian authorities, and Russia for the setback. “Everything that is happening in Palmyra is the result of uncoordinated action,” said Putin. “The question of Palmyra is purely symbolic. Aleppo is much more important from a military-political point of view.” ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The recapture of Aleppo by Syrian government forces deals a humiliating blow to years of Turkish policy in Syria, leaving in ruins its efforts to force President Bashar al-Assad from power and handing a major victory to main regional rival Iran. But Turkey’s support for the Syrian rebels withdrawing from their last major urban stronghold is far from over, as it intensifies a campaign to drive Islamic State and Kurdish militia fighters from a strip of Syria’s north. Some of the rebel brigades from Aleppo are expected to be redeployed as part of “Operation Euphrates Shield”, an offensive launched by Turkey four months ago to secure a roughly 90-km (56-mile) stretch of Syrian territory across its border. “The work on this is already under way,” said a senior official from the Turkmen Sultan Murad brigade, one of the Turkish-backed groups pulling out of Aleppo. Fighters would initially join Turkey’s effort to drive Islamic State from the city of al-Bab, around 40 km northeast of Aleppo, he said. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s role negotiating the safe exit from Aleppo of the largely Turkmen and Arab insurgents he has backed for the past five years was hardly the outcome he could have wanted. For years, he led calls for international intervention to force Assad from power. But it marks the culmination of a shift in Turkish policy which began months ago as Ankara sought to mend broken ties with Assad’s ally Russia, and as the threat to its national security from Islamic State and Kurdish groups in Syria grew. Turkey itself pulled some of the rebel fighters it backs out of Aleppo in August to take part in Euphrates Shield, further weakening their ability to confront the onslaught from Assad’s forces and their Russian and Iranian-backed allies. “The situation in Syria has morphed into one reality and then another since 2011 and all regional actors ... have muddled through, trying to adjust to new realities. In this respect, Turkey is no exception,” said Gulnur Aybet, professor of international relations at Istanbul’s Bahcesehir University. “Turkey’s priorities with regards to the war in Syria now and for the foreseeable future are two pronged: national security and humanitarian relief.” A chain of suicide bombings over the past two years blamed variously on Islamic State and Kurdish militants have brought into sharp focus the threat from Syria to Turkish cities hundreds of miles from the frontlines. “Syria has turned into a training ground for terrorist organizations,” a senior government official said. “Our Syria policy is adjusting according to the realities on the ground.” In the latest attack last weekend, Kurdish militants claimed a twin bombing outside an Istanbul soccer stadium which killed 44 people, most of them police officers. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday one of the bombers was thought to have come from Syria, and officials in Ankara believe the attacks may have been in revenge for Turkey’s actions against Kurdish militias in northern Syria. “They are not pleased with the advances of the Turkish army in Syria, and they’re trying to send a message to Turkey through terrorist attacks,” said a second Turkish official. “Our fight against terror in Turkey and the Turkish-backed rebel advance in Syria will continue.” The official from the Sultan Murad brigade said rebel fighters withdrawing from Aleppo to Syria’s Idlib province would be vetted by Turkey before being sent to join the Euphrates Shield operation as quickly as possible. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said the aim was to flush out members of the Nusra Front, which is among the rebel groups fighting Assad but was until recently affiliated with al Qaeda. The Nusra Front is considered a terrorist group by both the United States and its NATO ally Turkey. “It won’t take a lot of time, definitely not weeks. The al-Bab operation is vital for Turkey, and from there it wants to move onto Manbij,” the Sultan Murad official said, referring to a town 50 km (30 miles) east of al-Bab which Erdogan has said he wants brought under control of the Turkish-backed forces. The Turkish army dropped leaflets on al-Bab this week urging civilians to seek shelter, as rebels backed by Turkish tanks and warplanes closed in on the city. The rebels seized at least two villages west of al-Bab last week. Turkey’s shifting priorities in Syria have much to do with its rapprochement with Russia in August, after nine months of strained ties caused by Turkey’s shooting down of a Russian fighter jet over Syria. Russia has backed up forces loyal to Assad in Aleppo by providing training, equipment, advice and air support. The Turkish government says the restoration in ties has not changed its position that Assad must go to restore peace in Syria, but it has been forced to work with Moscow. Erdogan has spoken repeatedly in recent weeks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to find a solution in Aleppo. There have also been contacts between Turkey’s foreign minister and his Iranian counterpart in recent days, and Turkish officials have said there will be a tri-partite meeting between Turkey, Russia and Iran to discuss Syria later this month. Ankara’s change of tack has partly been driven by its long-standing frustration with U.S. policy in Syria. Turkey has been angered by U.S. support for Kurdish militia groups and has shared a sense of betrayal among Syrian rebels who feel President Barack Obama encouraged their uprising by calling for Assad to go but then abandoned them, failing even to enforce his own “red line” on Syria’s use of chemical weapons. “The fight that should have been taken on by global powers has not been assumed by them at all,” the senior government official said. “If someone is looking for a scapegoat for what’s happening in Syria, it is neither Erdogan nor Turkey.” ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"SEATTLE/AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump prevailed in U.S. Electoral College voting on Monday to officially win election as the next president, easily dashing a long-shot push by a small movement of detractors to try to block him from gaining the White House. Trump, who is set to take office on Jan. 20, garnered more than the 270 electoral votes required to win, even as at least half a dozen U.S. electors broke with tradition to vote against their own state’s directives, the largest number of “faithless electors” seen in more than a century. The Electoral College vote is normally a formality but took on extra prominence this year after a group of Democratic activists sought to persuade Republicans to cross lines and vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. She won the nationwide popular vote even as she failed to win enough state-by-state votes in the acrimonious Nov. 8 election. Protesters briefly disrupted Wisconsin’s Electoral College balloting. In Austin, Texas, about 100 people chanting: “Dump Trump” and waving signs reading: “The Eyes of Texas are Upon You” gathered at the state capitol trying to sway electors. In the end, however, more Democrats than Republicans went rogue, underscoring deep divisions within their party. At least four Democratic electors voted for someone other than Clinton, while two Republicans turned their backs on Trump. With nearly all votes counted, Trump had clinched 304 electoral votes to Clinton’s 227, according to an Associated Press tally of the voting by 538 electors across the country. “I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans,” Trump said in a statement responding to the results. The Electoral College assigns each state electors equal to its number of representatives and senators in Congress. The District of Columbia also has three electoral votes. The votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6. When voters go to the polls to cast a ballot for president, they are actually choosing a presidential candidate’s preferred slate of electors for their state. The “faithless electors” as they are known represent a rare break from the tradition of casting an Electoral College ballot as directed by the outcome of that state’s popular election. The most recent instance of a “faithless elector” was in 2004, according to the Congressional Research Service. The practice has been very rare in modern times, with only eight such electors since 1900, each in a different election. The two Republican breaks on Monday came from Texas, where the voting is by secret ballot. One Republican elector voted for Ron Paul, a favorite among Libertarians and former Republican congressman, and another for Ohio Governor John Kasich, who challenged Trump in the race for the Republican nomination. Republican elector Christopher Suprun from Texas had said he would not vote for Trump, explaining in an op-ed in the New York Times that he had concerns about Trump’s foreign policy experience and business conflicts. On the Democratic side, it appeared to be the largest number of electors not supporting their party’s nominee since 1872, when 63 Democratic electors did not vote for party nominee Horace Greeley, who had died after the election but before the Electoral College convened, according to Fairvote.org. Republican Ulysses S. Grant had won re-election in a landslide. Four of the 12 Democratic electors in Washington state broke ranks, with three voting for Colin Powell, a former Republican secretary of state, and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American elder who has protested oil pipeline projects in the Dakotas. Bret Chiafalo, 38, of Everett, Washington, was one of three votes for Powell. He said he knew Clinton would not win but believed Powell was better suited for the job than Trump. The founding fathers “said the electoral college was not to elect a demagogue, was not to elect someone influenced by foreign powers, was not to elect someone who is unfit for office. Trump fails on all three counts, unlike any candidate we’ve ever seen in American history,” Chiafalo said in an interview. Washington’s Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, said after the vote that the Electoral College system should be abolished. “This was a very difficult decision made this year. There is great angst abroad in the land,” Inslee said. Twenty-four states have laws trying to prevent electors - most of whom have close ties to their parties - from breaking ranks. In Maine, Democratic elector David Bright first cast his vote for Clinton’s rival for the party nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who carried the state in the party nominating contest. His vote was rejected, and  he voted for Clinton on a second ballot. In Hawaii, one of the state’s four Democratic electors cast a ballot for Sanders in defiance of state law binding electors to the state’s Election Day outcome, according to reports from the Los Angeles Times and Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspapers. In Colorado, where a state law requires electors to cast their ballots for the winner of the state’s popular vote, elector Michael Baca tried to vote for Kasich - but was replaced with another elector. In Minnesota, one of the state’s 10 electors would not cast his vote for Clinton as required under state law, prompting his dismissal and an alternate to be sworn in. All 10 of the state’s electoral votes were then cast for her. ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"ANKARA (Reuters) - The Russian ambassador to Turkey was shot in the back and killed as he gave a speech at an Ankara art gallery on Monday by an off-duty police officer who shouted “Don’t forget Aleppo” and “Allahu Akbar” as he opened fire. President Tayyip Erdogan, in a video message to the nation, cast the attack as an attempt to undermine NATO-member Turkey’s relations with Russia - ties long tested by the war in Syria. He said he had agreed in a telephone call with Russia’s Vladimir Putin to step up cooperation in fighting terrorism. At a special meeting at the Kremlin, President Putin ordered increased security at all Russian missions and said “the bandits” who committed the act would feel retribution. “We must know who directed the killer’s hand.” The assassination of an ambassador, not least of a major power such as Russia, marks a dangerous escalation of tension in the region and beyond. Security sources said he was off duty and some witnesses said there was no security scanning machine at the entrance. The attacker was smartly dressed in black suit and tie and stood, alone, behind the ambassador as he began his speech at the art exhibition, a person at the scene told Reuters. “He took out his gun and shot the ambassador from behind. We saw him lying on the floor and then we ran out,” said the witness, who asked not to be identified. People took refuge in adjoining rooms as the shooting continued. A video showed the attacker shouting: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!” and “Allahu Akbar” (“God is Greatest”) as screams rang out. He paced about and shouted as he held the gun in one hand and waved the other in the air. Russia is an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its air strikes helped Syrian forces end rebel resistance last week in the northern city of Aleppo. Turkey, which seeks Assad’s ouster, has been repairing ties with Moscow after shooting down a Russian warplane over Syria last year. The gunman was killed by special forces. Three other people were injured. “We regard this as a terrorist act,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. “Terrorism will not win and we will fight against it decisively.” Erdogan, who has faced a string of attacks by Islamist and Kurdish militants as well as an attempted coup in July, identified the attacker as 22-year-old Mevlut Mert Altintas, who had worked for Ankara riot police for two and a half years. CNN Turk TV said police had detained his sister and mother. A senior security official said there were “very strong signs” the gunman belonged to the network of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara says orchestrated the failed coup in July. Erdogan has denounced Gulen as a terrorist, but the cleric, a former ally, denies the accusation. Gulen described the killing as a “heinous act of terror” that pointed to a deterioration of security in Turkey resulting from Erdogan’s wide-ranging purge of police as well as the army, judiciary and media following the coup bid. The government says Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania since 1999, created a “parallel network” in the police, military, judiciary and civil service aimed at overthrowing the state. Suspicion could also fall on a group such as Islamic State, which has carried out a string of bomb attacks in Turkey in the last year as Ankara has pressed a military campaign against the militants in Syria. The group has urged “lone” attacks in the West. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was due to meet  his Russian and Iranian counterparts in Russia on Tuesday to discuss the situation in Syria. Officials said the meeting would still go on, despite the attack. “The attack comes at a bad time: Moscow and Ankara have only recently restored diplomatic ties after Turkey downed a Russian aircraft in November 2015,” the Stratfor think-tank said. “Though the attack will strain relations between the two countries, it is not likely to rupture them altogether.” However, both Russia and Turkey indicated that they were looking to work together to find the combat militant attacks. The U.S. State Department, involved in diplomatic contacts with Russia in an attempt to resolve a refugee crisis unfolding around the city of Aleppo, condemned the attack, as did the United Nations Security Council. Tensions have escalated in recent weeks as Russian-backed Syrian forces have fought for control of the eastern part of  Aleppo, triggering a stream of refugees. ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States intended to allow the U.N. Security Council to approve a resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlement building, two Western officials said on Thursday, a major reversal of U.S. practice, which prompted Israel to ask President-elect Donald Trump to apply pressure. In a day of intense diplomatic wrangling on one of the thorniest Middle East conflicts, Egypt, which had proposed the draft resolution, abruptly put off a vote that had been scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Diplomats said Cairo had acted under pressure from Israel and to avoid alienating Trump, who spoke to the Egyptian president and urged the White House to use its veto. By late Thursday, four Security Council members had given Egypt an ultimatum and threatened to put the draft resolution to a vote. The two Western officials said President Barack Obama had intended to abstain from the vote, a relatively rare step by the United States to register criticism of the building on occupied land that Palestinians want for a state. The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had an acrimonious relationship with Obama, believes the Obama administration had long planned the council vote in coordination with the Palestinians, the senior Israeli official said. “It was a violation of a core commitment to protect Israel at the U.N.,” the official said. The White House had no immediate comment. U.S. officials have voiced growing fears that a “two-state” solution is imperiled by Israeli settlement building and have been more willing to voice open criticism, including, the two Western officials said, via Thursday’s planned vote. A U.S. abstention would have been seen as a parting shot by Obama, who has made the settlements a major target of his - ultimately futile - peace efforts. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, which in 1979 became the first Arab nation to make peace with Israel, called  Trump on Thursday, a Trump transition official said, saying they spoke broadly about laying the ground for Middle East peace. Sisi’s office said the two leaders spoke. “The presidents agreed on the importance of affording the new U.S. administration the full chance to deal with all dimensions of the Palestinian case with a view of achieving a full and final settlement,” presidency spokesman Alaa Yousef said. The resolution would demand Israel “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem” and said the establishment of settlements by Israel has “no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.” Egypt, currently a Security Council member, worked with the Palestinians to draft the text. The senior Israeli official said Israel remained concerned the resolution could still go ahead with another sponsoring country. New Zealand, Venezuela, Malaysia and Senegal asked Egypt to clarify by midnight whether it planned to call a vote. “In the event that Egypt decides that it cannot proceed to call for vote on 23 December or does not provide a response by the deadline, those delegations reserve the right to table the draft ... and proceed to put it to vote ASAP,” the four states wrote in a note, seen by Reuters. They said “the proposal for other delegations to take the lead ... would also help Egypt by relieving it of the burden of carrying this draft alone.” They plan to meet on Friday morning to decide how to proceed, diplomats said. Officials in Netanyahu’s office spoke to Egyptian officials on Thursday about postponing the vote, an Israeli diplomat said. It was not clear what pressure Israel may have put on Egypt but there are several ways it could do so, including curtailing Israeli security cooperation in Egypt’s fight against Islamist militants in the Sinai desert. Netanyahu took to Twitter in the dead of night in Israel to make the appeal for a veto. Hours later, Trump backed fellow conservative Netanyahu on one of the most contentious issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the pursuit, effectively stalled since 2014, of a two-state solution. The State Department declined to comment immediately on reports of the planned abstention. Israel’s far-right and settler leaders have been buoyed by the election of Trump, who has signaled a possible change in U.S. policy by tapping a fundraiser for a major Israeli settlement as Washington’s ambassador to Israel. Netanyahu, for whom settlers are a key constituency, has said his government has been their greatest ally since the capture of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in a 1967 war. The United States says continued Israeli settlement building lacks legitimacy, but has stopped short of adopting the position of many countries that it is illegal under international law. Some 570,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China to be adopted. The United States has vetoed dozens of Security Council resolutions on Israel and it is rare for it to abstain. The last time the Security Council adopted a resolution on Israel and the Palestinians was in January 2009, when Washington abstained on a resolution calling for ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. In 1979 the United States abstained on a resolution, when the council said Israeli settlements “have no legal validity and constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.” Britain also abstained.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will convene some 70 countries on Jan. 15 for a Middle East peace conference in Paris, its foreign minister said on Thursday, and will invite the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to meet separately at its conclusion. France has repeatedly tried to breathe new life into the peace process this year, holding a preliminary conference in June where the United Nations, European Union, United States and major Arab countries gathered to discuss proposals without the Israelis or Palestinians present. The plan was to hold a follow-up conference before the end of the year with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas involved to see whether the two sides could be brought back to negotiations and revive moribund peace talks. Netanyahu had repeatedly rejected the conference proposal. “France is still determined to hold a conference in Paris to reaffirm the necessity of a two-state solution,” Jean-Marc Ayrault told journalists. “January 15 is the date that has been fixed and 70 countries are invited. We are not going to give up now.” A French diplomatic source said invitations would also be sent to Netanyahu and Abbas to meet French president Francois Hollande to outline the results of the conference. The source said that with uncertainty surrounding how the next US administration would handle the issue it was more important than ever to deal with the issue. “You can see that it’s even more justified in this context,” the source said. Ahead of a UN Security Council vote at the UN later on Israeli settlements, Ayrault declined to say how Paris would vote, but repeated that settlements were illegal. “We will look at this text carefully. The ongoing settlements completely weaken the situation and create tensions  and move Us away from a two-state solution”. ","

Lawmakers voted 60-48 in favor of the nearly 1 trillion shekel ($261 billion) spending package and economic plan, which followed approval in parliament’s finance committee on Tuesday. “The budget is a social one,” said Finance Minister Kahlon, “a budget that helps the entire population. It reduces social gaps, increases public spending, cuts taxes and ... emphasizes social ministries.” Kahlon has said his policies — which include levying a tax on those who own at least three apartments — would rein in housing prices that have more than doubled since 2007 to put home ownership out of reach of many younger Israelis. Passage of the budget was not in doubt since the six-party coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu holds 67 of parliament’s 120 seats. Netanyahu fought hard for a two-year budget as a means of stabilizing his coalition despite many calls in the government to stick to a yearly budget since it is difficult to project what will happen to the economy two years out. The two-year package includes safeguards that will allow the 2018 budget to be reassessed next year if initial economic and fiscal forecasts are missed, with a provision for spending cuts if necessary to reach the deficit target. Israel’s economy is expected to grow nearly 3 percent in 2016 and as much as 3.5 percent in 2017, while the jobless rate is very low at 4.5 percent. Israel’s corporate tax rate, currently 25 percent, will fall to 24 percent in 2017 and to 23 percent in 2018. The total base budget stands at 906.8 billion shekels - 446.8 billion shekels for 2017 and 460 billion for 2018. The largest single expense is defense, at more than 70 billion shekels each year. Various additions, if revenue proves higher than projected, could bring the total budget in the next two years to 994 billion shekels. The Finance Ministry has set a budget deficit target of 2.9 percent of GDP for both 2017 and 2018, up from initial targets of 2.5 and 2.25 percent, respectively. This has angered the central bank, which wants the government to rein in spending. ($1 = 3.8269 shekels) ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday strongly suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally authorized the computer hacks of Democratic Party emails that American intelligence officials say were aimed at helping Republican Donald Trump win the Nov. 8 election. But with only a month left in office, during a somber press conference before leaving for a family holiday in Hawaii, Obama spoke despairingly about the “nasty” state of U.S. politics, saying the chasm between Democrats and Republicans has made it possible for Russia to cause mischief. Obama said he has “great confidence” in intelligence reports he has seen showing that Russians hacked into emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee and to John Podesta, who was campaign chairman for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The leaked emails revealed details of paid speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street, party infighting and comments from top aides to Clinton who were shocked about the extent of her use of a private server to send emails while secretary of state. The leaks led to embarrassing media coverage and prompted some party officials to resign. Obama, who campaigned vigorously for Clinton, said she was treated unfairly and found the media coverage of her troubling. “This happened at the highest levels of the Russian government,” Obama said when asked whether Putin was personally involved in the hacks. He added that “not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.” Obama said he warned Putin in September to stop meddling in American political campaigns, telling his Russian counterpart to “cut it out” during a face-to-face encounter in China at a Group of 20 meeting. Obama said he did not believe that U.S. electronic voting systems were tampered with. Obama, however, stopped short of directly blaming Putin and said he also wanted to give U.S. intelligence officials more time to produce a report that is due before he leaves office on Jan. 20 and Trump is sworn in as his successor. Obama called Russia a smaller and weaker country than the United States that “does not produce anything that others want to buy, except oil and gas and arms.” The comments underscored what Obama called the “sadly deteriorated” relationship between Washington and Moscow, which are also at odds over Russia’s role in Syria’s civil war and its aggressive actions in Ukraine. Russia has denied U.S. accusations that it was behind the hacks. Two senior government officials told Reuters that the Federal Bureau of Investigation backs the CIA’s view that Russia indeed intervened to help Trump win the presidential election. Trump has maintained that he won the election fairly and has bristled at suggestions that Moscow influenced the outcome.    But at one point during the heated presidential campaign, he   publicly encouraged Russia to hack Clinton’s emails. Trump spoke glowingly in the campaign about Putin, and since winning the election he has named top aides who have ties to Russia, including his nominee for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson. Obama left open the door to U.S. retaliation against Russia to discourage further cyber attacks - countermeasures that may be up to Trump to implement. Obama said he has had “cordial” discussions with Trump since the election and has stressed that he would do everything he can to ensure a smooth transition. But the outgoing president also criticized Trump’s fellow Republicans broadly. Referencing polls showing that more than one-third of Republicans approve of Putin, who used to lead the KGB spy agency, Obama said that conservative icon “Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave.” “In some cases, you have voters and elected officials who have more confidence and faith in a foreign adversary than they have in their neighbors,” Obama said. Adding to the gloomy tone of Obama’s remarks, he addressed two other difficult foreign policy issues that will outlast his time in the White House. Obama warned about the economic and geopolitical consequences of any breakdown in the U.S.-China relationship, and said Trump should think carefully about the diplomatic repercussions if he decides to “upend” longstanding U.S. diplomatic norms. Trump angered China earlier this month when he took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen - the first call of its kind since 1979 when President Jimmy Carter acknowledged Taiwan as part of “one China.” Obama also condemned attacks on Syrian civilians trying to flee the city of Aleppo, blaming President Bashar al-Assad and his allies in Russia and Iran for “atrocities.” Obama defended his decision to keep U.S. troops out of Syria and avoid military intervention, although he acknowledged the protracted anguish has weighed on him. “Everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do, but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap,” he said.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin supervised his intelligence agencies’ hacking of the U.S. presidential election and turned it from a general attempt to discredit American democracy to an effort to help Donald Trump, three U.S. officials said on Thursday. U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia tried to influence the election by hacking people and institutions, including Democratic Party bodies, has angered President-elect Trump, who says he won the Nov. 8 vote fairly. Russian officials have denied accusations of interference in the U.S. election. Separately, a senior White House official said on Thursday that Putin was likely to have been aware of the cyber attacks but he fell short of accusing the Russian president. “I don’t think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,” Ben Rhodes, the White House’s deputy national security adviser, told MSNBC. “When you’re talking about a significant cyber intrusion like this, we’re talking about the highest levels of government.” The U.S. officials - who have knowledge of intelligence information on the matter - said on the condition of anonymity that the hacking of U.S. political groups and figures had a more general focus at first. “This began merely as an effort to show that American democracy is no more credible than Putin’s version is,” one of the officials said. “It gradually evolved from that to publicizing (Hillary) Clinton’s shortcomings and ignoring the products of hacking Republican institutions, which the Russians also did,” the official said. By the fall, the official said, it became an effort to help Trump’s campaign because “Putin believed he would be much friendlier to Russia, especially on the matter of economic sanctions” than Democratic rival Clinton. Democratic President Barack Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio that the United States will take action against Russia. “I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections ... we need to take action and we will,” he said according to excerpts of the Thursday interview released by NPR. “At a time and a place of our own choosing. Some of it may be ... explicit and publicized; some of it may not be. ... Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it,” Obama said. NBC reported earlier that U.S. intelligence officials have “a high level of confidence” Putin was personally involved in the Russian cyber campaign against the United States. Hacked emails of Democratic operatives and Clinton aides were leaked during the presidential campaign, and at times dominated the news agenda. The U.S. officials said Russia also hacked Republicans but did little to nothing with the information they found. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told state TV channel Rossiya-24 that he was “dumbstruck” by the NBC report of Putin’s alleged involvement. “I think this is just silly, and the futility of the attempt to convince somebody of this is absolutely obvious,” he said. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has brushed off reports of Russian hacking of U.S. political institutions. “If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter on Thursday. In fact, the U.S. government did formally accuse Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against U.S. political organizations in October - one month ahead of the election. Obama last week ordered a review by the U.S. intelligence agencies about foreign interference in the 2016 election. Asked on Thursday about the hacks, Secretary of State John Kerry described how Obama had been considering the evidence ahead of the October announcement. “The president made the decision based on the input that was carefully, carefully vetted by the intelligence community ... that he did have an obligation to go out to the country and give a warning. And he did so,” Kerry said at a news briefing. The three U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters said the fact that Putin oversaw a hacking operation was not surprising and is standard operating procedure in Russia. “If anything, given his background as a KGB officer, Putin has a much tighter grip on all Russian intelligence operations, civilian and military, foreign and domestic, than any democratic leader does,” one official said. The reports of Russian hacking have raised concerns among both political parties in Congress, with top Republicans breaking with Trump to call for closer scrutiny. Some Republican lawmakers have also questioned Trump’s pick for Secretary of State, Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, who has close business ties to the Russian government. ","

The company stock was down 2.25% in pre-market trading. In a press release late Wednesday, Yahoo said it believes an “unauthorized third party” stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August of 2013. That’s in addition to the half a million customers whose data was hacked in another incident which Yahoo disclosed in September. The company believes the August 2013 hack is “likely distinct” from the other incident. In November, Yahoo disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that law enforcement provided it with data files that a hacker claimed was Yahoo user data. Upon analyzing it with the help of outside forensic experts, Yahoo has said it turned out to be the company’s data. (Read more: Yahoo Discloses New Potential Breach.) For Verizon the latest disclosure may be the nail in the coffin that ends its hope of acquiring Yahoo to add to its purchase of AOL, which it made last year. After all, this data breach is double the size of the other one which has delayed the closing of the deal. In a statement to the media, Verizon said, “As we've said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions."" Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead. Armstrong said Verizon and Yahoo will start planning what a combined company will look like. By the first quarter of 2017, Armstrong said there will be more clarity for the organization.  (Read more: AOL CEO Optimistic on Verizon-Yahoo Deal.)

(For more, see Fed Projections: Where Do Rates Go From Here?) Since the global financial crisis of 2008, when euro hit record high of $1.604, the single currency has been sledding downhill against the dollar. The euro has lost more than 7.5% since October alone. The recent declines have not been unexpected, as the interest rate differential between the U.S. and Europe has widened out significantly. The Fed’s rate hike only built on last week’s European Central Bank’s (ECB) decision to extend the Quantitative Easing (QE) till next year end, and paved the way for further decline in forex rate. Despite the temporary support gained by the euro in early December, when Italy voted against constitutional reform, the recent breach of major technical support levels could lead to parity, i.e. euro trading one-for-one against the dollar. Perennial query remains on the financial impact, what’s next, and for how long. The long-prevailing weak economic prospects in Europe have compelled the ECB to opt for a weaker euro, which would make European products cheaper and help bump up European exports. The Fed’s decision amplified the ECB – and reflected positively on European markets, which gained around 1% on Thursday in the wake of the FOMC hike. (For more, see How Interest Rates Affect The Stock Market?) However, with reduced purchasing power the European consumers will pay a higher price for dollar-denominated products, including key commodities like crude oil. A stronger dollar will also impact payoffs of dollar-denominated loans, which may cripple the financial systems not just in Europe but also in large developing economies. Along with global businesses, the higher dollar will diminish profit margins of American businesses which have overseas presence. With President-Elect Donald Trump driving business-friendly policies in the U.S. amid Fed rate hikes, the greenback is expected to rise by another 5% to 10% in the near term, according to Win Thin, global head of emerging markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. Parity is a key psychological level last observed in early 2003, and may be difficult to sustain for long from a technical trading perspective. Technical analyst continue to maintain that EUR/USD 1.050 to 1.030 will be the key support levels over the next few weeks. The natural balancing behaviors of economic developments are expected to support the euro. For instance, the spread of government stimulus like QE will trigger an increase in fiscal spending, which should bolster euro valuations in over the near term. Societe Generale believes the euro will face a temporary decline and hit parity in the first quarter of 2017, then bounce to 1.09 by the end of 2017. The latest 2017 market outlook from UBS forecasts the euro as high as 1.200 by the end of next year. A Reuters poll reports only 10 of more than 50 economists predicting a decline below parity.

The decline comes after a powerful post-election rally lifted the stock more than 14% to an all-time high just above $200. A sell-the-news reaction makes perfect sense given this rapid rise while maintaining a highly bullish 2017 technical outlook. The company’s upbeat conference call projected U.S. and global growth above 2% in 2017, offering a modest tailwind for projected fiscal year guidance of $11.85 to $12.35 EPS. Its economic projections have proven more reliable than government statistics in recent years, reinforcing the broad theme of modest but continued expansion in the ninth year of the current economic cycle. FDX Long-term Chart (1993-2016) The stock bottomed out at $7.38 in 1990 after a long decline and entered an uptrend that accelerated to the upside in 1997. The rally peaked at $42.25 a few months later, giving way to a steep plunge in reaction to the Asian Contagion crisis. It bottomed in the low 20s one year later and turned higher, carving a strong advance into the 1999 high at $61.88. Price action then shifted into a corrective mode, grinding out a broad cup and handle pattern, ahead of a 2003 breakout. It booked healthy gains during the mid-decade bull market, rising to $120 in 2006, with that level marking the highest high for the next seven years. A broad topping pattern broke to the downside at the end of 2007, signaling a major decline that accelerated during the economic collapse. Selling pressure ended at a 7-year low in March 2009 while the subsequent recovery wave stalled near $100 after retracing about 70% of the prior decline. The stock then dropped into a sideways pattern that took more than three years to overcome, finally reaching the 2006 high at the end of 2013. It broke out immediately, entering a strong trend advance that continued into the December 2014 high at $183.51. It tested that level in June 2015 and turned sharply lower, losing ground for the rest of year before bottoming out at 2-year low in January 2016. Price action since that time has carved a strong uptick that reached the prior high in November, followed by a breakout to an all-time high at $201.57. FDX Short-Term Chart (2014-2016) The rectangular top posted between November 2014 and August 2015 organizes short-term price action, marked by failed attempts to remount new resistance (red line) in November 2015 as well as April and August 2016.  It finally broke this barrier in September and charged higher in a broad trend thrust that cut through the prior high like butter. However, the stock looks technically overextended after the vertical advance, with the bearish post-earnings reaction marking the next stage in a consolidation or pullback that could last into the first quarter of 2017. The rally has carved horizontal support levels at $160 and $180 while the 50-day EMA rising through $186 should contain short-term pullbacks. The unfilled September gap between $165 and $170 could mark a magnetic target if sellers gain the upper hand but the stock is likely to find enthusiastic buying interest well above that price zone. It’s instructive to note that the D.J. transportation average just reached a significant resistance level, with a pullback in that instrument having the power to drag this major component to lower ground. On Balance Volume (OBV) paints a mixed picture, failing to post a higher June high with price and then dropping to a three-year low in the first quarter of 2016. It’s played catch up since that time but failed to post a new high with price during the recent breakout. This marks a bearish divergence that predicts a whipsaw and shakeouts at new highs until the indicator rises to end the divergence or price falls to match the indicator. FedEx is losing ground after missing EPS estimates while matching revenue estimates in their quarterly earnings report. The decline comes after a high percentage rally, signaling a period of profit-taking and consolidation rather than a notable shift in the bullish long-term trend. <Disclosure: the author had no position in FedEx or DJTA trading instruments at the time of publication.>  ",Buy the Fedex Post-earnings Decline (FDX) | Investopedia

But is the company taking on unnecessary risk? According to Reuters, Lloyds, which generates the bulk of its revenue and profits from mortgage loans, has agreed to acquire the MBNA UK credit card business from Bank of America (BAC), spending £1.9 billion ($2.4 billion) and marking the bank's first major acquisition in almost a decade. Partly-owned by the British government, thanks to the government's bail out during the 2007-09 crisis, Lloyds wants to reduce its reliance on mortgage lending, noted Reuters. The deal, which includes roughly £800 million ($829 million) of acquired equity and assumes £240 million ($248 million) for future claims for mis-sold loan insurance (PPI), is expected to close in the first half of 2017. ""Lloyds will be broadly doubling up its exposure to credit cards at a particularly benign point in the bad debt cycle and ahead of a potential slow-down... once the terms of the UK's exit from the EU are reached,"" Gary Greenwood of Shore Capital said, Reuters reports. While the deal is being applauded for the strategic use of Lloyd's capital, analysts were quick to point out the risks that comes with it. Britain's uncertain economic outlook remains unclear amid the country's June vote to leave the European Union. However, António Horta-Osório, Lloyds CEO, is focusing more on the potential reward. ""The acquisition... increases our participation in the expanding UK credit card market with a multi-brand strategy and advances our strategic aim to deliver sustainable growth as a UK focused retail and commercial bank,"" Horta-Osório said. As to the main objective to better diversify the mortgage business, Joseph Dickerson of Jefferies expects the deal to increase the contribution of the consumer finance business to 21% of the bank's pre-tax profits, rising four percentage points from 17%. Likewise, Lloyds expects MBNA, which made after-tax profits of £123 million ($127 million) in the first half of 2016, to add £650 million ($673 million) per year to group revenues.

In Duesseldorf, Ralf Jaeger, interior minister of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), said the Tunisian appeared to have arrived in Germany in July 2015 and his asylum application had been rejected. He seemed to have used different names and had been identified by security agencies as being in contact with an Islamist network. He had mainly lived in Berlin since February, but was recently in NRW, Jaeger added. After being turned down for asylum, the man should have been deported but could not be returned to Tunisia because his documents were missing, he said. ""Tunisia at first denied that this person was its citizen,"" said Jaeger, adding that German authorities started the process of getting new identity papers in August 2016. ""The papers weren't issued for a long time. They arrived today."" A judicial source told Reuters that German authorities had observed Amri over a period this year to try to determine whether he had planned a robbery to fund the purchase of automatic weapons for a possible attack with accomplices. Authorities stopped their monitoring activities because they could not prove their suspicions, the source said. The new details have added to a growing list of questions about whether security forces missed opportunities to prevent the attack, in which a 25-tonne truck mowed down shoppers and smashed through wooden huts selling gifts, mulled wine and sausages in the deadliest attack on German soil since 1980. Christmas markets have been a known potential target for Islamist militants since at least 2000, when authorities thwarted a plot to attack one in Strasbourg, France. And the modus operandi in Berlin was identical to that of a Bastille Day attack in the French city of Nice in July, when a Tunisian-born man rammed a lorry through a seaside crowd and killed 86 people. The market at the scene of Monday's attack, at the foot of the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church, stayed shut on Wednesday, but more than 60 other Christmas markets across the German capital re-opened under tightened security. ""We don't want to let the terrorists win. If everyone stays away, they are winning,"" said tourist Nicki Anning at the Gendarmenmarkt Square in central Berlin. Berlin authorities said 12 people seriously injured in Monday's attack were still being treated in hospital. The pre-Christmas carnage at a symbolic site - under the ruined spire of a church bombed in World War Two - has shocked Germans and prompted security reviews across Europe, already on high alert after attacks this year in Belgium and France. The possible - though unproven - involvement of a migrant or refugee has revived a bitter debate about security and immigration, with Chancellor Angela Merkel facing calls to clamp down after allowing more than a million newcomers into Germany in the past two years. Merkel, who will run for a fourth term next year, has said it would be particularly repugnant if a refugee seeking protection in Germany was the perpetrator. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the Berlin attack on Wednesday, blaming ""Islamist terrorists (who) continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad"". ""It's an attack on humanity and it's gotta be stopped,"" he told reporters in Palm Beach, Florida. Police initially arrested a Pakistani asylum-seeker near the scene, but released him without charge on Tuesday. The Polish driver of the hijacked truck was found shot dead in the cabin of the vehicle. Bild newspaper said he had been alive until the attack took place. It also quoted an investigator as saying there must have been a struggle with the attacker, who may have been injured. Islamic State has claimed responsibility, as it did for the Nice attack. The Passauer Neue Presse newspaper quoted the head of the group of interior ministers from Germany's 16 federal states, Klaus Bouillon, as saying tougher security measures were needed. ""We want to raise the police presence and strengthen the protection of Christmas markets. We will have more patrols. Officers will have machine guns. We want to make access to markets more difficult, with vehicles parked across them,"" Bouillon told the paper. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann told German radio there was a higher risk of Islamist attacks because of the influx of migrants in the past two years, many of whom have fled conflicts in countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The task of tracking the suspects and the movements of the truck may be complicated by the relative scarcity of security cameras in public places in Germany, compared with countries such as Britain. The German cabinet on Wednesday approved a draft law to broaden video surveillance in public and commercial areas, a measure agreed by political parties last month after violent attacks and sexual assaults on women. State surveillance is a sensitive issue in Germany because of extensive snooping by the Stasi secret police in Communist East Germany and by the Gestapo in the Nazi era. ",Germany had previously tried to deport Berlin attack suspect Anis Amri
Gemma Acton,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"Monday evening's attack on a Berlin Christmas market did not reveal any increased terrorist threat to  Germany, according to a leading global risk consultancy. Charles Hecker, senior partner at Control Risks told CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday that his firm is maintaining a low terrorist rating for the country in the wake of the attacks.  This is partly because the tragic event looks unlikely to materially impact domestic businesses but also partly due to the Berlin attack appearing to be the act of a ""lone wolf."" In Hecker's view, the driving of the truck through an unguarded marketplace was a simplistic operation, not one that revealed a high degree of coordination, technology or multiple angles or one that signified a qualitative change in terrorist capabilities in the country. As the search for details to help unravel the full story continues, Hecker points to discovering the identity of the individual behind the attacks as the next critical piece for the authorities, in order to determine elements such as whether the perpetrator was a recent arrival in the country and how they had been  radicalized. It would also be essential to understanding the extent of the terrorist's engagement with jihadist group, the so-called Islamic State (IS),  which claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday. Once deciphered, these factors would shape the agenda for both interpreting the security situation within Germany and better estimating the political fallout for Angela Merkel as she prepares to battle for a fourth term as Chancellor in next September's federal elections. Should the perpetrator be shown to have been a beneficiary of Merkel's controversial 2015 open-door policy towards around a million refugees, the pressure on her would be significantly greater. However, Hecker was keen to point out that large scale attacks enacted in the past 14 months in Paris and Brussels were carried out by first-generation citizens who had been raised within these cities, so observers must be careful not to jump to conclusions. Furthermore, he pointed to Germany's relatively strong track record of integrating refugees into its social security system. ""Germany is a country with an enormous and very secure social security net and by and large the absorption of refugees into employment, into schools and into the German social fabric is going pretty well,"" the risk analyst noted. ""It's kind of along that Scandinavian model, that Denmark model for anti-radicalisation and for giving people jobs, a community and a position in a new life,"" he explained. Hecker also refused to point to failed multi-culturalism as the key issue, saying the evolving situation in the Middle East is a more important factor. ""I think the problem is now, whether it is migrants or local folks, the gradual destruction of IS in Raqqa and northern Iraq is going to increase the dispersal of that threat all around Europe,"" he posited. Turning to the fatal shooting on Monday evening of Russia's ambassador to Turkey in the latter's capital city of Ankara, Hecker said he did not expect the event to derail the gradual rapprochement between Russia and Turkey. While the two countries were at pains subsequent to the ambassador's murder to publicly declare their ongoing joint initiatives to battle terrorism, Hecker told CNBC that he believed this message only up to a point. ""After all they are on separate sides of the story in Syria and on Assad and so they are going to have to in the short to medium term deal with that as something that does drive a wedge between them in regional politics in the area,"" he highlighted. Discussing drivers for their friendship, Hecker noted the attraction for Russia. ""Russia wants a southern oil and gas pipeline and it's going to have to go through Turkey. So they are going to have to learn to like each other no matter what happens in either of those two countries,"" he said. Meanwhile, he explained that Turkey appreciated the ability to play eastern and western leaders off against one another so would tolerate just enough – but not too much – of Russia in its backyard.

 ,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"German authorities are calling the truck attack on a crowded Christmas market an ""act of terrorism"" that had all the hallmarks of Islamic extremism — but many questions remained over who carried out the attack that killed 12 people and wounded more than 40 in the heart of Berlin. Federal prosecutors on Tuesday night released a man taken into custody in the vicinity of the crime on suspicion that he drove the vehicle in the attack Monday night, saying they hadn't found evidence putting him in the truck at that time. Local law enforcement did not follow just one lead from the start, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said. While there is no doubt the truck incident was an attack, the motives remain unclear, he added. It should be noted, the minister said, that it's possible the attacker is still on the run and it's too early to draw political conclusions from the tragedy. The man, a Pakistani citizen who came to Germany last year, had been picked up based upon a description of the man who jumped out of the truck and fled. But prosecutors said he had denied any involvement in the attack. Prosecutors also said no forensic evidence had been found proving that he was in the cab during the rampage, and no witnesses had followed him from the scene of the carnage to where he had been picked up. Under German law, prosecutors have until the end of the calendar day following an arrest to seek a formal arrest warrant keeping a suspect in custody. Federal Criminal Police Office chief Holger Muench and other officials had expressed doubt earlier that the man in custody was the truck's driver. Muench also said police haven't yet found a pistol believed used to kill a Polish truck driver who was supposed to be delivering steel beams with the truck used in the attack until it went missing. Berlin police, meanwhile, urged people to remain ""particularly vigilant"" and to report ""suspicious movements"" to a special hotline. ""We may still have a dangerous criminal out there,"" Berlin police chief Klaus Kandt said. Germany's top prosecutor, Peter Frank, told reporters the Monday night attack on the market outside the landmark Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church was reminiscent of July's deadly truck attack in Nice and appeared to follow instructions published by the Islamic State group. ""There is also the prominent and symbolic target of a Christmas market, and the modus operandi that mirrors at least past calls by jihadi terror organizations,"" Frank said. Still, he said authorities had not yet heard any claim of responsibility. Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the attack cannot change Germans' way of life. ""Twelve people who were still among us yesterday, who were looking forward to Christmas, who had plans for the holidays, aren't among us anymore,"" she said in an emotional, nationally televised statement before heading to the scene of the attack in downtown Berlin. ""A gruesome and ultimately incomprehensible act has robbed them of their lives."" Later Merkel and German President Joachim Gauck attended a memorial service at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church and laid white roses outside the church. Witnesses saw only one man flee from the truck after it rammed into the crowded Christmas market Monday evening. It smashed through the market, going 60 to 80 meters (200 to 260 feet) before finally coming to a halt. Six of those killed have been identified as Germans, and the man found shot and killed in the truck's passenger seat was Polish. The other five people killed have not yet been identified, and 18 people are still suffering from serious injuries. Merkel, who has been criticized for allowing in huge numbers of migrants last year, addressed head-on the possibility that an asylum-seeker was responsible for the carnage. ""I know that it would be particularly hard for us all to bear if it were confirmed that a person committed this act who asked for protection and asylum in Germany,"" Merkel said. ""This would be particularly sickening for the many, many Germans who work to help refugees every day and for the many people who really need our help and are making an effort to integrate in our country."" A spokesman for Berlin's office for refugee affairs said police conducted a broad search overnight at a large shelter for asylum-seekers at the city's now-defunct Tempelhof airport. Four men in their late 20s were questioned but nobody was arrested, Sascha Langenbach told The Associated Press. The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver, his cousin, around noon on Monday and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. ""They must have done something to my driver,"" he told TVN24. Germans have been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by the Islamic State group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 wounded in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed. Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, contributed to tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants. Far-right groups and a nationalist party seized on Monday night's attack, blaming Merkel for what happened. ""Under the cloak of helping people Merkel has completely surrendered our domestic security,"" Frauke Petry, the co-chairwoman of the Alternative for Germany party, wrote. Manfred Weber, a member of Merkel's conservative bloc and leader of the European Parliament's biggest political group, cautioned against sweeping verdicts but said it was important to ensure that extremists didn't enter the country. The German government said Merkel spoke Tuesday with President Barack Obama, who expressed his condolences. In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the United States was ready to help in the investigation and response. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Islamic extremists must be ""eradicated from the face of the earth"" and pledged to carry out that mission with all ""freedom-loving partners."" The attack came less than a month after the U.S. State Department warned that extremist groups including Islamic State and al-Qaeda were focusing ""on the upcoming holiday season and associated events"" in Europe. The Islamic State group and al-Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. IS claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. ",Germany frees man arrested after deadly Berlin Christmas market attack
Justina Crabtree,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"European countries pledged to raise security measures following Monday's attack on a Christmas market in Berlin. London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement Tuesday that ""detailed plans for protecting public events"" over the holiday season were in place. The statement added that the current threat level was already ""severe,"" meaning that an attack was ""highly likely."" The U.K. capital's police force said that ""the use of large vehicles"" in such an event – following the style of Monday's attack on a Berlin Christmas market in which a lorry was driven into a crowd of people – had been taken into consideration.

Gemma Acton,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"Reactions to the violent Monday evening attack on a Berlin Christmas market that left 12 dead and 48 injured will be closely watched for their potential to affect next year's crucial elections in Germany. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the current favorite as she prepares to run for a fourth term in next year's elections yet faces mounting opposition from anti-immigration populist political groups and parties, such as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Pegida. Success in local elections this year indicate AfD is in a position to feasibly pick up sufficient votes to secure seats in Germany's national parliament in the elections – a first for a far-Right party since the Second World War. Although her popularity has since recovered some ground, Merkel saw it dive on the back of her decision in 2015 to open the country's borders to around a million refugees from conflict-strewn zones of the Middle East. A spate of provocations linked to refugees, including multiple sexual assaults in Cologne last New Year's Eve, a suicide bomber at a beer festival and an ax-wielding attacker on a commuter train, further hardened the mood against Merkel's liberal stance. Acknowledging the strength of public sentiment as she addressed the nation on Tuesday morning following the Christmas market attack, Merkel conceded that the violent act had to be assumed to be terrorism. ""I know it would be especially hard for us all to bear if it were confirmed that the person who committed this act was someone who sought protection and asylum,"" she further admitted. Reacting to Monday's attacks, Marcus Pretzell, an AfD politician asked on Twitter, ""When will the German rule of law strike back? When will this cursed hypocrisy end? These are Merkel's dead!"" Although the identity and nationality of the driver of the truck which ploughed through the Christmas market have not yet been publicly confirmed, local police did concede on Tuesday morning that they were likely dealing with an act of terrorism. ""Our investigators assume that the truck was deliberately steered into the crowd at the Christmas market at Breitscheidplatz,"" Berlin police said on Twitter. ""All police measures related to the suspected terrorist attack at Breitscheidplatz are progressing at full steam and with the necessary diligence,"" they continued. Unconfirmed German media reports have been speculating that the truck's driver was of Pakistani origin and had entered the country as a refugee in February. Merkel's revised thinking on her open-door refugee stance was confirmed by her September admission that she regretted the policy and her recent vow it would not be repeated given it was clearly against the wishes of the German people. The Chancellor has also recently toughened her position on the deportation of refugees who fail to qualify for asylum and has supported those calling for a ban on full-face veils where legally possible. Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Tuesday, Otso Iho, senior analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, said that the security issues that Germany is facing are indeed a ""huge problem"" for Merkel. ""The attacks that we have seen over the summer…that have been claimed by the Islamic State, are something that will likely impact her negatively, particularly as there are a lot of different individuals and groups tying Germany's terrorism threats to the migration crisis in Europe,"" he ventured. Via emailed comments to CNBC, Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Centre for European Reform said that it was still too early to tell how much this will impact Merkel's electoral chances. ""There are still months to go before the elections, and she has plenty of time to show that the government is on top of the terrorist threat,"" Bond explained. ""But if there are more attacks, especially if they involve asylum seekers, then that is likely to increase the vote for the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany,"" he added. The extent to which Monday night's event will impact Merkel will partly depend on the government's and authorities' reaction but also as further details emerge. If it becomes suspected that the government had pre-warning of an attack, the fall-out could be significantly worsened. ""According to sources of my colleagues @welt, authorities in Berlin in recent days had info about possible attack against Christmas market,"" tweeted Clemens Wergin, the Washington Bureau Chief of German national daily, Die Welt. This alongside the U.S. State Department's warning in late November about potential terrorism around year end in Europe. ""The Department of State alerts U.S. citizens to the heightened risk of terrorist attacks throughout Europe, particularly during the holiday season. U.S. citizens should exercise caution at holiday festivals, events, and outdoor markets,"" cautioned the press release. The attacks came as part of a day of regional violence which also saw Russia's ambassador to Turkey gunned down and a shooting at a mosque in Zurich and at the end of a year peppered with cruel and deadly terrorist attacks. Some say this context will simply add to fears that Europe has lost control of its migration policy and society, thereby galvanising further support for political groups seeking much more conservative means of addressing the situation. However, others believe the characterisation of these events as a common cross-border battle faced by many countries within Europe will strengthen the Chancellor's position as she continues to be regarded as a critical pillar of strength and continuity for Germany at a challenging time.

Sam Meredith,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"Evacuation efforts to remove civilians trapped in Aleppo were suspended on Friday after rebel groups reportedly opened fire on a convoy. After five years the Syrian civil war is still ongoing, here is a quick update of the latest developments: A planned three-day evacuation of civilians in Aleppo, which began on Thursday, was suspended, the Red Cross told CNBC via email. Syrian State TV said on Friday rebel groups had opened fire on a convoy.  It also claimed the rebels had violated the cease-fire by trying to take captives out of the rebel held area, the Associated Press reported. The United Nations (UN) reported 6,000 people had left Syria's second largest city since Thursday though around 50,000 civilians remain trapped and in need of assistance. There were no confirmed reports for how long the suspension to evacuation efforts would be in place. Officials on both sides of the conflict confirmed a ceasefire had begun on Thursday at 2.30 a.m local time (7.30 p.m ET Wednesday) but is no longer holding. Originally an evacuation had been scheduled for Wednesday though it stalled due to continued gunfire and shelling in the city.  And Iran insisted on the simultaneous evacuation of two villages besieged by the rebels, Reuters reported, quoting rebel and UN sources. Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters in Japan on Friday peace talks would be renewed to encompass the whole of Syria imminently and he was working with Turkish President, Tayyip Erdogan, to achieve this aim. ""The next step is to reach an agreement on a total ceasefire across the whole of Syria. We are conducting very active negotiations with representatives of the armed opposition, brokered by Turkey,"" Putin said. ""If (peace talks) happens, it won't compete with the Geneva talks, but will compliment them. Wherever the conflicting sides meet, in my view it is the right thing to do to try to find a political solution."" The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed to CNBC in an email that ten ambulances were able to access the frontlines a few hours after 7 a.m local time on Thursday. The operation was being conducted with support from Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). ""At present, the ICRC and SARC evacuation of wounded and sick is ongoing, and our teams are still inside the key area of Eastern Aleppo,"" the ICRC spokesperson said in an email on Thursday morning. ""We hope to evacuate 200 to 250 wounded and sick in this first phase, though exact numbers remain difficult to confirm. They will be evacuated to healthcare structures in western rural Aleppo,"" they added. The civil war has been complicated by many players becoming enveloped in the conflict which has now lasted for half a decade. President Bashar al-Assad's government's state forces have been supported by Russian air strikes and Iranian-backed Shia militias from Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The opposition has been made up of predominantly Sunni rebel groups, which had received financial backing from the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. Hardline Islamist groups have been involved in the conflict too such as Jabhat Fateh al-Sahm, previously known as Nusra Front. In April 2016, the UN special envoy for Syria approximated that 400,000 people had been killed as result of more than five years of conflict. However, Staffan de Mistura, UN secretary general, stressed that this was not an official UN statistic as the inability to access many areas of the country meant an accurate death toll could not be accurately calculated. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has estimated that 11 million Syrians have fled their homes since the outbreak of the civil war in March 2011 with the majority of people seeking refuge in neighboring countries or within Syria itself. To date, the UNHCR approximates that roughly one million people have sought asylum in Europe with Germany and Sweden receiving the most applications for refuge. The pre-war population of Syria was roughly 22 million meaning so far around half of the country has been displaced. The situation remains unclear as to how Syria's civil war would unfold from here with Assad determined to focus on retaining opposition strongholds throughout the country. Yet rebel groups have promised to continue fighting in the absence of any proposed political solution. George Sabra, chief negotiator for the rebel forces' High Negotiations Committee, told the BBC that the opposition to the government would not be prepared to give up despite the loss of Aleppo to state forces. ""Aleppo is an important place for the revolution but it's not the last place,"" Sabra said. ""Nobody can think about peaceful solutions in these circumstances,"" he added.

The man took out a pump-action shotgun he hid in his coat and fired around eight shots in the air before the embassy's security guards intervened and apparently overpowered him, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. No one was hurt in the incident which occurred hours after a Turkish policeman, appearing to condemn Russia's military role in Syria, fatally shot Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov in front of a shocked gathering at a photo exhibit. The embassy said its missions in Ankara, Istanbul and the southern city of Adana would be ""closed for normal operations on Tuesday."" The U.S. embassy is located just across the street from the art exhibition center where the Russian ambassador was killed. It was not immediately known if the two incidents were connected. The leaders of Turkey and Russia have described the attack as an attempt to disrupt efforts to repair ties between their countries, which have backed opposing sides in the Syrian civil war. It came as the foreign and defense ministers from Turkey, Iran and Russia prepared to hold a key meeting on Syria on Tuesday in Moscow. The assassination occurred after days of protests by Turks angry over Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russia's role in the bombardment and destruction of Aleppo, Syria's largest city. An Associated Press photographer and others at the art gallery watched in horror as the gunman, who was wearing a dark suit and tie, fired at least eight shots, at one point walking around the ambassador as he lay motionless and shooting him again at close range. The assailant, who was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a 22-year-old member of Ankara's riot police squad, was later killed in a shootout with police. A group of 18 investigators and foreign ministry officials have left for Ankara to investigate the killing, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had accepted during a telephone conversation with Putin a request that Russian experts take part. Anadolu reported that the Russian officials would participate in the autopsy. Hurriyet newspaper said authorities were trying to determine whether Altintas acted alone or if his assault was an organized terror attack. His actions appeared to be well-planned. The paper said Altintas had taken leave from work on medical grounds and booked himself into a hotel near the exhibition center. Turkish police detained three more people connected to Altintas on Tuesday, raising the number of people in custody for questioning to seven, Anadolu reported. They include the man's parents, sister, three other relatives and his roommate in Ankara. The Russian Embassy said Karlov's body would be flown to Russia on Tuesday and a ceremony would be held at the airport in Ankara. Authorities increased security outside the Russian Embassy, and the Iranian Embassy was closed on Tuesday as a precaution. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov warned against traveling to Turkey, citing a number of terror attacks that have plagued the country over the past 18 months. ""I think every person who travels to Turkey should think twice before doing it because terrorist attacks happen there almost every day,"" the Tass news agency quoted Syromolotov as saying. Turkey's pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak claimed Karlov's killing was a plot by the U.S. intelligence agency that was carried out by a movement led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey says is behind a failed coup in July aimed at toppling Erdogan.

"Elizabeth MacBride, special to CNBC.com",12222016,CNBC,12152016,"The Turkish lira fell to session lows against the dollar Monday after Andrey Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, was shot and killed in a gun attack in Ankara. The gunman — who was part of the Ankara police department's special operations unit — shouted about Aleppo, the Syrian city where rebels were defeated this month by Russian-backed government forces, as he carried outthe attack at an art exhibit. The lira was down about 0.6 percent, at 3.526 lira per dollar, at press time. The Turkish currency has lost nearly 20 percent against the dollar this year, a large enough drop to declare a currency crisis, said Steve Hanke, director of the Troubled Currencies Project at the Cato Institute. Political turmoil and acts of terrorism that have plagued the country in recent months have put Turkey's $720 billion economy at a tipping point. Turkey's economy is shrinking for the first time since 2009, by 1.8 percent in the third quarter. The situation has led to a drop in foreign investment. Earlier this month, President Tayyip Erdoğan appealed to Turkish citizens to convert savings held in foreign currencies into gold and Turkish lira. Gold is on track for one of its worst quarters in two decades. According to economists, the fear is if uncertainty persists, it could induce capital flight out of Turkey, and that could put the country on shaky ground. ""The key concern for foreign investors relates to the erosion of the rule of law,"" according to Sinan Ulgen, managing partner at Istanbul Economics and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Turkey is going through exceptionally difficult domestic conditions following the botched military coup of last July."" The currency crisis comes in the wake of a series of events, including the European Parliament voting to suspend talks with Turkey on EU membership; Donald Trump's election, which roiled emerging markets; and the erratic behavior by Erdoğan. In the past three weeks, he has threatened to allow about 3 million migrants to flood the European Union if the EU halted membership talks, which it did temporarily in response to his targeting of political dissidents. Erdoğan also launched what Hanke called ""a war with his own central bank."" He has been resisting the normal response to a sliding currency — higher interest rates — and instead asked Turkish citizens to buy lira and gold to prop up the lira.

Ted Kemp,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"Turkey's latest political slaying could have come from any number of directions. The vicious, entangled war involving Turkey, Russia, Syria and a dozen other combatants got more confusing on Monday when Russia's ambassador to Turkey was fatally shot. Andrey Karlov was gunned down while giving a speech at an art gallery in the Turkish capital. A solitary gunman, whom Turkey's interior minister confirmed was a Turkish police officer, was killed by security forces following the assassination. Video from the scene showed a shouting man in a black business suit and tie standing over the ambassador with a handgun. There was no immediate confirmation about the gunman's motives or possible affiliations — but several groups in the region feel powerful animosity toward Russia and Turkey. In neighboring Syria and throughout the Muslim world, people are outraged at Russia for bombarding Aleppo, which has suffered thousands dead in the civil war against Syrian strongman Bashar Assad. ""Russia has been on the wrong side from the start"" in the Syrian war, especially given that most of the victims of the Assad regime are Sunni Muslims, and Sunnis are a large majority among Muslims in the Arab world and in Turkey, retired U.S. General Barry McCaffrey told CNBC. An NBC producer who witnessed the shooting said the assailant addressed Ambassador Karlov in Russian before shouting ""Allahu akbar"" in Arabic. The phrase means ""God is great."" The Associated Press reported that the gunman shouted about Aleppo, in Turkish. Another enemy of both Russia and Turkey is ISIS. The two countries have cooperated in fits and starts over the last year against the cult-like terror group, which controls whole swaths of Syria. ISIS has carried out a wave of murderous bombings in Turkey this year. Turkey also has fought a long-running, low-level domestic war against elements of its Kurdish population, which lives primarily in Turkey's east. Karlov's killing could create tension between the two countries and embarrass Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""There's no question that this is yet another display of Erdogan not having adequate control of the security within his borders,"" said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, a global risk consulting firm. Domestic security has become a huge problem for Turkey, which hosts about 2 million Syrian refugees. Bremmer pointed out that Erdogan made a bad situation worse by imprisoning many of his own leading generals after a failed coup attempt rocked the country in July. Erdogan may have removed threats to his own power by arresting military leaders and thousands of other people, but he also made his army less effective. The shooting on Monday adds a wrinkle to a complicated relationship between Russia and Turkey — rivals going back centuries — which over the last year have switched from being adversaries to pseudo-allies over the bloody war in Syria. Erdogan was enraged with Russia when it first entered the war, and Turkey shot down a Russian warplane over its airspace in late 2015. But Erdogan made a turnaround with Russia almost immediately after the coup attempt. On the night of the coup, Russia tipped off Erdogan about unusual movements among Turkish military units, Bremmer said, potentially saving the Turkish president's life. In the meantime, the assassination of Karlov is unlikely to dramatically alter anything in the war-wracked region. A senior Russian parliamentarian told the Interfax news agency that the assassination will not disrupt previously scheduled talks between Russia, Turkey and Iran in Moscow. ""The Russians will express their gravest possible concerns, and Erdogan will use this as an excuse to crack down on political enemies as much as possible,"" Bremmer said. A Turkish security official on Monday already was linking the assassination to a U.S.-based cleric whom it has previously blamed for its civil unrest, usually before Ankara makes waves of arrests. McCaffrey described the killing of one ambassador as unfortunate but only a ""footnote"" in the scope of the wider war. ""The much larger issue is a half million dead in Syria,"" he said. Turkey has struggled with a steep drop in foreign investment and a plunging currency that has lost 20 percent of its value against the dollar this year. The iShares MSCI Turkey ETF and VanEck Vectors Russia ETF were trading lower Monday. ",Who shot Russia's ambassador to Turkey? It could be a lot of people

The short answer is that the penalty for not having health insurance in 2017 can be as much as $2,085, or 2.5% of your income, whichever is higher, as part of the Affordable Care Act. However, this doesn't tell the entire story. There are more details behind these numbers, as well as some exemptions that might apply to you. In addition, the election of President-elect Donald Trump as well as a Republican majority in both houses of Congress could potentially eliminate the 2017 penalty entirely. If you can afford health insurance (more on that shortly), but choose not to buy it, you might have to pay a fee. This is officially known as the individual shared responsibility payment, but is also known as the ""Obamacare penalty,"" ""Obamacare fine,"" or ""individual mandate."" Image source: Getty Images. If it applies to you, the fee is due with your tax return for the year you didn't have coverage. For example, if you didn't have health insurance in 2016, any penalty due would be paid with the tax return you'll file in 2017. The penalty is calculated in two different ways, and is assessed for any month you, your spouse, or your dependents didn't have qualifying health coverage. You'll pay the higher of the following methods for both 2016 and 2017: If you had coverage for part of the year, the fee is assessed at 1/12 of the calculated amount for each month you don't have coverage. It's also important to mention that the IRS cannot be enforced through jail time, liens, or other collection activity. The only method the IRS can collect the fee if you choose not to pay it is by withholding money you would otherwise get back as a tax refund. Here's where it gets a little complicated. There is a list of exemptions to the individual shared responsibility payment, and if you qualify for one, you won't have to pay any penalty for not maintaining coverage. You can read a full list of these exemptions on www.Healthcare.gov, but here are a few of the most common: President-elect Trump has pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act quickly once his administration assumes office, and to replace it with a much ""better"" piece of legislation. This would mean the elimination of all taxes and financial penalties that are part of the Act, such as the 3.8% surtax on the investment income of higher-earners, as well as the penalties discussed here. What's unclear is whether there would be a different penalty attached to the replacement plan, and how quickly the Affordable Care Act could realistically be repealed and replaced. That's why even though Trump has promised to get rid of Obamacare, it's important to know the penalties and exceptions for 2017. ","

Image source: Getty Images. With just a little more than a week to go before we close the book on 2016, one thing investors will certainly be able to say is this was an exciting year (and probably a profitable one for many). The year began with the worst two-week losses ever recorded by the major U.S. indexes. By mid-February, all three indexes, including the famed Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI), were down by a double-digit percentage, and the prospect of an end to the seven-year bull market looked possible. However, all three indexes have since galloped higher, with the 14.6% year-to-date gain in the Dow being arguably the biggest bright spot for investors. However, the Dow may not be done yet. Since the election, U.S. stocks have been on fire and the Dow has been taking down one record high after another. With just days left before we ring in the New Year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sits just 25 points away from eclipsing the in-focus 20,000-point mark. Considering that the Dow was at just 6,500 in March 2009, the fact that we're event talking about Dow 20,000 as a possibility less than eight years later is truly incredible. But, the possibility of hitting this milestone in America's oldest stock index could also have unintended consequences if investors aren't mindful of their actions and emotions. If the Dow does hit 20,000, there are five things you should do as an investor: Image source: Getty Images. The first thing investors need to realize is that Dow 20,000 is a completely arbitrary number made up by the media and Wall Street analysts. Though investors are eager to change the first digit on the Dow to a ""2,"" the Dow has hit more than a dozen record high closings just since the Nov. 8 election. We could just as easily be celebrating Dow 19,954, or Dow 19,978, or any number randomly pulled out of a hat. In short, realize that Dow 20,000 is just a number – one of many in the Dow's impressive march higher since the Great Recession. Secondly, investors should understand that the Dow rallying higher really isn't outside of its historic norm. Historically, the stock market averages a 7% gain per year inclusive of dividend reinvestment. Though it'll have its bad years mixed in with the good, stock valuations (of good companies) tend to increase over time. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) provides additional evidence of this. According to Yardeni Research, the S&P 500 has had 35 corrections of 10% or more, when rounded to the nearest whole number, since 1950. Yet, every single one of these 35 corrections has been completely erased by a bull market rally. It can sometimes take years to erase a stock market correction, but long-term investors understand that over time the market tends to head higher, which favors patient long-term investors. Third, investors should strongly avoid selling stocks from their investment or retirement portfolio just because the Dow has hit an arbitrary milestone, or because certain Wall Street pundits have suggested that ""valuations are extended"" or stocks are ""overvalued."" The management of your investments could probably care less whether the Dow is at 15,000 or 20,000. They're solely focused on growing their business and outpacing their competition, and that's where your focus should be too. Stock index valuations have nothing to do with the valuations of your individual companies, meaning Dow 20,000 should have no bearing on the business activity of your stock holdings. Image source: Getty Images. However, Dow 20,000 could be a good time to reassess your portfolio holdings and review the main reasons why you bought the stocks you own in the first place. You certainly don't need Dow 20,000 to do so, as you should be regularly reassessing the stocks you own and determining if your buy thesis remains intact. Should your buy thesis no longer hold true (e.g., a changing business model, new competition that makes a core product of your company inferior, a management scandal, and so on), then it could be time to consider parting ways with your stock(s). Finally, investors should probably consider adding dividend stocks to their portfolio as a hedge should the short-term-minded stock analysts be right about a stock market correction. Not only can dividend stocks help hedge your downside during a correction, but they tend to outperform non-dividend-paying stocks over the long run anyway, meaning they're a potentially good buy regardless of whether the market is going up, down, or is flat. As an added bonus, recurring dividends are often the mark of companies with time-tested business models, meaning they're usually a beacon of sustainable profits for investors. ","

Volkswagen AG (NASDAQOTH:VWAGY) has agreed to pay almost $1.6 billion to settle claims in a Canadian court alleging that VW made ""false and misleading"" environmental claims related to its diesel-engine emissions in marketing materials. This latest settlement brings the total cost of VW's global diesel-emissions cheating scandal to over $18 billion -- and there's almost certainly more to come. The Canadian government's Competition Bureau, which is responsible for antitrust enforcement, announced on Monday that the Canadian units of Volkswagen's VW and Audi brands had agreed to settle a class action suit by offering to buy back and pay restitution to about 105,000 Canadian owners of vehicles with 2.0 liter diesel engines. VW's payments could total as much as 2.1 billion Canadian dollars ($1.57 billion). VW's 2.0 liter TDI diesel engine. Image source: Volkswagen AG. As part of the settlement agreement, which is pending approval by the courts, VW also agreed to pay a fine of CA$15 million ($11.2 million) to the bureau. VW's 2.0-liter TDI turbocharged diesel engine has been at the center of the emissions scandal. VW has admitted to selling millions of diesel-powered vehicles around the world that were programmed to give false results on government emissions tests. In regular driving, the cars emit pollutants at levels far above those allowed by law in many countries. The vehicles covered by this settlement are VW and Audi models from the 2009 through 2015 model years equipped with the 2.0 liter TDI engine. The Competition Bureau said that its investigation into models equipped with a 3.0 liter V6 version of VW's diesel engine is ongoing. VW is said to be close to a settlement in the United States related to those engines, which were fitted to certain VW, Audi, and Porsche models. So far, Volkswagen has set aside about 18 billion euros ($18.8 billion) to cover the costs of the diesel-emissions cheating scandal. But much of that is already accounted for: And now, VW is on the hook for another $1.6 billion in Canada. For shareholders -- and investors eyeing VW's beaten-up shares -- the big questions remain: Where does this end, and will VW be able to afford it? Fifteen months into the scandal, those are two of many questions that remain unanswered. ","

Oil prices went on a wild ride in 2016. Prices swirled downward to start the year over fears that the world's growing oil stockpiles would fill to the brim. Crude crashed all the way into the mid-$20s in early February before rallying past $50 per barrel by the end of the year thanks to improving market fundamentals. That recovery could continue in 2017 thanks to OPEC's decision to support prices by trimming production. However, investors should not expect a smooth ride given that there are plenty of things that could cause quite a bit of volatility in 2017. Analysts have a fairly wide range of opinions when it comes to where oil prices will head next year. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects the U.S. oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), to average $50.66 per barrel next year and the global benchmark, Brent, to average $51.66. Driving that outlook is the expectation that U.S. oil production will only be modestly lower next year at 8.8 million barrels per day versus an average of 8.9 million barrels per day in 2016, which isn't enough of a decline to make much of an impact on the market. However, what's noteworthy about those prices is that they are below the market prices of around $52 and $55, for WTI and Brent, respectively, as of the middle of December, which suggests that the EIA sees the potential for weaker oil prices over the next year. Image source: Getty Images. Other analysts are much more bullish. Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, for example, sees crude jumping 46% by next June, hitting $69 per barrel. Fueling that outlook is the fact oil and gas investments are down $300 billion, or 41%, since peaking in 2014, which should lead to shrinking supplies. Further, the bank's analysts see the persistently lower prices over the past several years driving healthy demand growth. These two factors could lead to the biggest gap between supply and demand in five years, which could push crude prices higher. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs seems to be taking the middle ground. It recently increased its oil price forecast by predicting that WTI crude will rise to $57.50 per barrel by the second quarter, before settling around $55 per barrel in the second half of the year. Analysts at the World Bank, likewise, have a $55 oil price forecast for 2017 due to OPEC's moves to cut output and rebalance the oil market. Overall, the consensus seems to be that crude will remain in the mid-$50s in 2017. Incidentally, that is similar to what analysts had forecast for oil prices in 2016. Given recent history, the odds of a quiet crude market next year appear slim. Image source: Getty Images. One reason analysts have such differing outlooks on crude prices is the uncertainty regarding OPEC's agreements to stabilize the oil market. At the end of November, OPEC members agreed to cut their total output by 1.2 million barrels per day next year, and non-member nations followed two weeks later by agreeing to curtail their production by 558,000 barrels per day for the first six months of the year. That said, the market does not believe OPEC will follow through on those cuts, despite Saudi Arabia's pledge to reduce its output deeper than required. Further, Russia is responsible for half of the non-member output reduction commitment, which could become problematic because its government might not be able to force oil companies to cut production. Meanwhile, even assuming full compliance, producers could quickly ramp back up as soon as the agreement expires in July, swamping the market with oil. Meanwhile, rising oil prices could incentivize shale producers to ramp up output. EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) is one of several oil companies that can rapidly boost production as prices head higher. For example, at $50 crude, EOG Resources can increase its oil production by 15% per year, with that rate accelerating to 25% annually at $60 crude. Further, EOG Resources continues to refine its craft through technical innovations and efficiency gains, which could enable it to grow faster than those estimates. In fact, the company recently raised its growth outlook to those rates just one quarter after initially projecting 10% to 20% growth at $50 and $60 crude, respectively. Likewise, other shale-focused producers have the low-cost drilling inventory and the balance sheet strength to ramp up production fairly rapidly when prices rise. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), for example, currently plans to slowly ramp up drilling activities next year, going from 10 rigs at the end of this year to between 15 to 20 rigs by the end of next year, which should deliver double-digit oil growth. That said, Devon Energy has a cash-rich balance sheet and plenty of lucrative drilling opportunities to accelerate growth in 2017 should crude run into the $60s. The problem with these scenarios is that if too many producers ramp up next year, it could lead to a torrent of crude hitting the market in the second half, which could push prices right back down. Image source: Getty Images. While there are plenty of conditions that could keep a lid on crude prices next year, there is also an abundance of potential catalysts that could drive crude well above analysts' estimates. For example, OPEC's deals could have their desired effect, shale producers might remain cautious, or demand could come in higher than expected. In addition to that, there is always the potential for an unexpected catalyst that could send crude prices soaring. Last year, for example, unexpected production stoppages in Canada (due to wildfires) and in Nigeria (due to militia attacks) temporarily cut into global oil output, helping fuel a torrid run in the oil market. Similar unexpected outages could cause an explosive run in crude, especially if they come early in the year while OPEC is curbing the market's supply. Anything from a terrorist attack on a major oil hub to a natural disaster could cause a significant supply disruption and catapult oil prices. For the most part, analysts see a relatively calm oil market next year, with crude prices rising through the first half before mellowing out in the second. While that is possible, it does not seem very likely to me. Instead, crude prices could bounce around quite a bit as the market ebbs between fear and euphoria fueled by rumors and changing fundamentals. Because of that, an investor's best bet is to stick with top-tier oil stocks that have the capability to adjust as market conditions evolve. ","

Image source: Getty Images Shares of CVR Refining (NYSE:CVRR) and its parent company CVR Energy (NYSE:CVI) jumped by double-digit percentages on Thursday afternoon: CVRR Price data by YCharts Fueling the bounce was an announcement that President-elect Donald Trump had tapped CVR Energy's controlling shareholder, Carl Icahn, to be his special advisor on regulation. Icahn's role will be to help overhaul federal regulations that are hindering business, including EPA regulations that are costly for merchant refiners like CVR Refining to comply with. Further, because Icahn will serve in an ""individual capacity"" rather than as a government employee, he will not have to divest his controlling position in CVR Energy. In other words, he stands to benefit financially should the regulatory reductions he proposes lead to an increase in the value of CVR Energy's stock. Icahn's primary target will likely be the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) program, which he and CVR Refining CEO Jack Lipinski have criticized. Lipinski called the program ""broken"" due to the ""exorbitant costs of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs)"" that must be purchased by merchant refiners like CVR Refining. However, with Icahn-approved Scott Pruitt set to take over the EPA, these and other environmental regulations could soon be a thing of the past. That would allow merchant refiners to compete better against larger integrated refiners, which haven't been hurt by the skyrocketing costs of RINs because they control the blending and retail sale of their fuel. With Icahn heading to Washington to offer his opinions on how best to ease the burden of regulation on business, it appears more likely that the Trump administration will move quickly on that from. That unshackling could enable merchant refiners specifically to thrive in the years ahead, enabling their investors to capture that upside. ","

Oil prices are notoriously volatile, and their actions in 2016 were no exception. Prices plunged to start the year as supplies piled up in storage due to resilient shale production and rising output from OPEC. Speaking of which, OPEC spent most of the year arguing within itself, instead of working together to fix a problem that had grown worse due to its decision to battle shale producers for market share. That said, as the old oilfield mantra goes, ""The cure for low oil prices is low oil prices,"" which has certainly been the case this year. Here's a look back at the rapidly evolving oil market of 2016. Image source: Getty Images. Crude oil prices fell into what seemed like a bottomless pit in early 2016, with analysts trying to one-up each other with bold calls on where crude would bottom. Several analysts put out abysmal oil price targets in late 2015 and early 2016 warning that crude could drop to $20 per barrel or even as low as $10 per barrel. Each made a bone-chilling case for why crude could continue crashing with no end in sight. It turned out that most of these fear-driven calls were wrong, though crude did bottom out in the mid-$20s by early February: WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts Several factors enabled crude prices to hit bottom. Shale producers not only swore off growth, but several cut investment spending well beyond the level needed to maintain their current production level. For example, leading Bakken Shale producer Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) announced an 80% reduction in its capex budget from the prior year. While that capital would enable Whiting Petroleum to complete projects it started in 2015, the company planned to wind down its completion operations by mid-year, which would result in a double-digit production decline by the end of 2016. Meanwhile, several producers in Canada, including Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ), shut-in production from heavy oil wells because they were losing money on these barrels after Canadian crude crashed into the teens making it the cheapest crude in the world. Overall, Canadian Natural Resources shut-in 900 barrels of heavy oil per day, as well as significantly reducing its heavy oil drilling program, resulting in a 17% year-over-year decline in its primary heavy crude oil production during the first quarter. Finally, after a long hibernation, OPEC tried to reemerge as a factor in the oil market by attempting to work together on a coordinated production freeze with non-members, including Russia. That said, the initial talks did not lead to an agreement to freeze output, though they did start heating up oil prices. All the spending and production cuts from North American oil producers began to have their desired effect on oil prices, which rose sharply off the bottom. That said, crude seemed to hit the ceiling at around $50 per barrel and bounced between that level and $40 per barrel for much of the summer: WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts It seemed like any time crude stayed around $40 per barrel for too long that OPEC would pipe up and say it was working on another framework agreement to freeze its output. That would send oil prices back up toward $50 a barrel, which seemed to cool off OPEC's desire to reach an agreement. Meanwhile, with crude prices bouncing off the bottom and holding steady in a new trading range it gave North American oil companies more confidence to increase investments in new wells. Whiting Petroleum, for example, signed several well participation agreements with financial partners, which enabled it to continue completing wells. Canadian Natural Resources, likewise, took advantage of rising prices to restart shut-in production and its stalled heavy oil drilling program. Another factor steadying oil prices was the growing view that an improvement in oil market fundamentals was just over the horizon. Oilfield service company Core Labs (NYSE:CLB), for example, noted these improving market fundamentals when it reconfirmed its outlook in July for a ""V-shaped worldwide commodity recovery beginning in the second half of 2016."" Driving that view at the time was the expectation that U.S. oil production would decline by 940,000 barrels per day this year, which represents a 10.1% year-over-year decrease, while worldwide declines would add up to a 3.3% decrease in production. According to Core Labs, these reductions, when combined with a continued increase in global oil demand, ""should create a tight crude oil supply market for the second half of 2016, and result in increased crude prices."" Core Labs reaffirmed that view in October while noting that U.S. production was declining faster than expected and would be down 11% this year. Core also pointed out that China's year-over-year decline rate reached 10%, pushing production to a six-year low. These factors, along with renewed OPEC talks, reinforced Core Labs' view that oil prices would be on the upswing. Image source: Getty Images. That upswing came at the end of November when OPEC members agreed to cut their production by 1.2 million barrels and go back to their former quota system. That announcement shocked the oil market, sending crude spiking nearly 9% that day to more than $50 a barrel. Two weeks later OPEC announced that it persuaded several non-member countries to reduce their output by roughly 560,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2017. This agreement pushed crude prices to nearly $55 per barrel, which was crude's highest level in more than a year. The aim of these agreements is to drain the market's oil stockpiles, which were nearly filled to the brim earlier this year causing the oil market to panic and analysts to forecast impending doom. That said, the nations pledging to make cuts need to follow through with their agreed output cuts for the agreement to work. Further, shale producers like Whiting Petroleum cannot go back to their free-spending ways and rack up debt to drill more wells. In other words, the jury is still out on whether these agreements will just provide a short-term lift to the market, or send oil prices even higher in 2017. ","
      
    What Happened to Oil Prices in 2016? -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. There's no such thing as a risk-free investment. Shareholders always need to keep an eye on the risks that come with owning each of their stocks, in case those potential demons turn up in the real market. As a longtime owner of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares, I'm about to take a fresh look at that stock's risk factors. You're welcome to come along and look over my shoulder. Micron's chosen specialty is in designing and manufacturing of computer memory chips, both of the DRAM temporary-storage variety and the stable NAND Flash memory type. It's simultaneously a very mature commodity market and a cutting-edge innovation platform, and that mixture leads to an extremely cyclical market. The supply-and-demand equation for memory chips is prone to wild swings. Sometimes the factories can barely keep up with global demand, and chip prices hold steady for a while. Ideally, tight supply would result in higher street prices, but rising chip prices are as rare as hen's teeth. So stability is about the most favorable pricing environment Micron and its rivals can hope for. Then, two different phenomena take turns to drive chip prices lower. In either case, these price wars send memory specialists like Micron scrambling for pricing controls. As the third-largest player in this industry, Micron now has a foot on the sectorwide accelerator -- and on the brake pedal. So when the market is flooded with cheap chips, Micron and SK Hynix can pull back on their production schedules to restore some normalcy a little bit faster. The reason I'm diving into Micron's price control powers is simple. The presence of that safety net reduces the level of business risk involved in owning the stock. And of course, knowing more about how the market operates puts you in a better position to take action when something unusual is going on. Image source: Micron. 2015 was a terrible year for Micron, as Samsung put its back into memory production and chip prices fell through the floor. Micron shares plunged 60% lower amid falling revenues and negative cash flows. Even now, Micron's trailing free cash flows stand at a negative $2.7 billion. But things changed dramatically in 2016. Samsung has reportedly shifted its DRAM capital budget over to the newer 3D NAND market, leaving room for one of those exceedingly rare chip-price increases in the DRAM field. Meanwhile, the NAND market is seeing exceptional growth on the demand side of things. Pick a technology buzzword -- Internet of Things, automotive computing, solid-state storage, and more -- and you'll find NAND memory playing an important role in all of these macro trends. So demand growth is outstripping the supply side's gains for once, and revenues are rising rapidly across the NAND market. Analysts expect both DRAM and NAND prices to stay high over the next couple of quarters. That's good news for Micron and its shareholders, and share prices have bounced back to a market-beating 46% gain year to date. Micron just closed the $4 billion buyout of DRAM technology researcher Inotera. This deal should expand Micron's DRAM profit margins and add new revenue streams as sector rivals pay good money to license Inotera's groundbreaking chip-design technologies. For a fresh update on Inotera's business impact, current pricing trends, and much more, tune in to Micron's earnings report on Wednesday evening. Management expects to deliver roughly $3.7 billion in top-line revenue and about $0.17 per share in adjusted earnings per share. Analysts have set their targets significantly higher on both counts, aiming for earnings of $0.28 per share on sales near $4 billion. Even at these elevated earnings expectations, Micron shares are trading at just 9.9 times forward earnings today. Both the company and the stock have plenty of room for further growth. The downside risk is also significant, but is limited by Micron's pricing power and solid balance sheet. Long story short, I'm perfectly comfortable holding on to my Micron shares in this market environment. The likely rewards over the next couple of years easily outweigh the risks of ownership here.

Memory chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has rallied more than 40% this year -- which might seem odd for a company which has posted six straight quarters of annual revenue declines. Most of that rally was fueled by the belief that global demand for memory chips will rise and cause prices to keep rising. Image source: Micron. However, those bullish expectations might have caused Micron's stock to get ahead of itself. Let's take a look at three major headwinds which could blow the stock off course next year. Micron's sales have been falling due to an oversupply of DRAM and NAND chips. However, bullish interest in the stock was sparked by several reports that DRAM and NAND supplies were tightening up again. Back in August, HP (NYSE:HPQ) CEO Dion Weisler claimed that the company's PC business was facing shortages of memory chips. In October, TrendForce forecast that DRAM prices would hit a two-year high this year due to a supply crunch. The research firm also estimated that the global supply of PC DRAM chips was declining, as memory chipmakers expanded into the adjacent markets of mobile devices and data centers. In the NAND market, DRAMeXchange recently estimated that prices of SSD and eMMC devices will rise over 10% sequentially in the first quarter of 2017, due to a shortage of NAND chips attributed to strong smartphone shipments in China, stable SSD growth, and the increase in the average NAND flash density in eMMC (embedded multimedia controller) and eMCP (embedded multi-chip package) devices. However, Micron is still vulnerable to sluggish PC sales (which have declined annually for eight straight quarters), peaking smartphone sales, and competition from bigger rivals in the DRAM and NAND markets. These factors could all cause supplies to rise and prices to fall again -- which means that analysts' expectations for 31% sales growth next year could be too optimistic. Micron is the fourth largest NAND maker in the world after Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) SanDisk. It's also the third largest mobile DRAM maker after Samsung and SK Hynix. Competing against Samsung is tough, since the South Korean tech giant can use its massive foundry to reduce production prices and other non-semiconductor business segments to offset lower memory chip prices. If we look at Micron's gross and operating margins over the past five years, we can see how price declines and competition hurt its bottom line growth. Source: YCharts This chart suggests that Micron's margins could fall even further before bottoming out. Furthermore, Micron's efforts to expand its moat -- including its development of faster 3D NAND and 3DXpoint tech with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and its acquisitions of smaller memory chip makers like Inotera Memories -- will cause expenses to rise and weigh down earnings growth. Therefore, Wall Street's forecast for Micron's non-GAAP earnings to surge from $0.06 per share last year to $1.63 per share this year could also be too bullish. Meanwhile, China wants to build its own domestic semiconductor market for two reasons -- concerns about the security of U.S. tech, and the need to boost its own economic growth. That's why China's state-backed conglomerate Tsinghua Group tried to buy Micron and a 15% stake in Western Digital earlier this year. However, both deals were eventually terminated due to U.S. security concerns. Nonetheless, the Chinese government and Tsinghua are still aggressively developing their own semiconductors across multiple industries -- which means that it could eventually flood the market with cheap memory chips and bury smaller players like Micron. During a recent event in Taipei promoting the merger of Micron and Inotera, Micron CEO Mark Durcan warned that if China spends ""the money that they say they are capable of spending, they can create oversupply."" He noted that the move was ""absolutely"" a concern for the entire industry. These three challenges could be tough for Micron to address, but I also don't think the stock will fall off a cliff next year. DRAM and NAND prices should continue rising unless sales of PC and mobile devices plummet. Its new 3D NAND and 3DXpoint tech should help it keep pace with its bigger rivals, and the distant Chinese threat shouldn't hurt its results over the next few quarters. Nonetheless, Micron remains a fairly risky play and should only be bought by investors who fully understand the cyclical nature of the DRAM and NAND markets.

    3 Reasons Micron Technology, Inc. Stock Could Fall -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Looking at Micron Technology's (NASDAQ:MU) chart this year, it's hard to imagine anything could be wrong with the memory-chip specialist. Micron's stock has risen more than 40% so far in 2016, easily outpacing the Nasdaq's 8% return. However, since the end of the dot-com bubble sell-off around the start of 2003, a far more important long-term pattern has emerged that anyone considering investing in Micron ought to consider: MU data by YCharts. While more diversified semiconductor producers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have also underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Micron shares have performed slightly worse than Intel while also proving far more volatile in the process. This boom-and-bust tendency in Micron stock makes it highly unappealing from a long-term investor's perspective. So here are two other semiconductor names investors could do well to consider in lieu of Micron. Though they share a common industry, Intel's and Micron's respective places within the semiconductor market give them little else in common. Intel dominates the market for PC and server microprocessors, the chips that serve as the ""brains"" for PCs and servers. In these markets, speed matters, and Intel's ability to consistently produce the fastest chips has allowed it to command premium prices for its chips. Over time, Intel's cushy margin structure allowed it to reinvest heavily in research-and-development and manufacturing innovations, thus extending its chips' competitive position. This self-reinforcing cycle has lead Intel to enjoy what many view as a moderate competitive advantage over rivals like Advanced Micro Devices. The difference in quality between Intel's and Micron's segments of the semiconductor market truly shines through when you compare their respective margin structures. Unlike Intel, Korean conglomerate Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) competes head-to-head against Micron in the memory-chip market to a meaningful degree. However, Samsung holds an advantage over Micron in that its memory business serves as a single piece of its many business segments, one that nicely complements its consumer-electronics businesses. Samsung's phones, tablets, wearables, and other devices require memory chips in order to store the code on which their software runs. Manufacturing its own memory, via its Samsung Foundry business, allows Samsung to reduce its reliance on third-party memory suppliers like Micron, while also lowering its component costs. Samsung's memory business is not just a profit center for the company, but also serves its overall strategy by allowing it to more effectively produce its electronics. Equally important, Samsung likely remains the market's largest memory-chip maker; Samsung not only builds its own chips, but also makes chips for third-party tech companies like. Especially in industries where the market sets prices, being the largest provider can provide some benefits over the competition. In that vein, Samsung's $29 billion in memory-chip sales in fiscal year 2015 more than doubled Micron's total sales this year. What's more, Samsung's massive Foundry business gives it the ability to more effectively compete for market share against stand-alone operators like Micron. However, I prefer Samsung (like Intel) over Micron for its diversification away from the memory-chip market, not its strong competitive stance within it. To be sure, Micron has done a nice job consolidating market share, which could help give it the ability to compete throughout the memory-chip price cycle. However, for long-term investors, plenty of other stocks in the semiconductor market offer less risk and more growth than Micron does today. ","

More specifically, Fred's announced this morning that it has signed an agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Rite Aid to purchase 865 stores, as well as ""certain assets related to store operations,"" for $950 million in cash. For perspective, Fred's currently operates ""just"" 647 stores and three specialty pharmacy-only locations across 15 states in the southeastern United States, including 18 franchised locations. Fred's also has 371 full-service pharmacy departments within its stores, including four franchised locations. ""This will be a transformative event for Fred's Pharmacy that will accelerate our healthcare growth strategy through our acquisition of 865 new stores located in highly attractive markets,"" explained Fred's CEO Michael Bloom. ""We believe that this transaction will also create tremendous opportunities for both our new and existing front of store and pharmacy team members."" Fred's hopes to close on the transaction in the first half of 2017, creating a ""new national competitor"" and representing the third-largest drugstore chain in the United States. The company has already received financing commitments to fund the purchase and related transaction costs, as well as ongoing business operations and anticipated capital investments. In any case, this is a massive transaction, considering Fred's entire market capitalization sits under $800 million as of this writing after the pop. And while it certainly positions the company as a formidable competitor in its space, with shares now trading at fresh 52-week highs, I certainly wouldn't blame Fred's investors for taking at least some of today's quick profits off the table.

                                   is bringing its first “Star Wars” film sans the Skywalker family glue that’s held the franchise together. And, it being a “Star Wars” flick, expectations are grand. “Any film with the word ‘Star Wars’ in the title is an instant contender to become the highest grossing film of the year,” wrote analysts at Box Office. “This installment takes place during the roughly 25-year period between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy. Darth Vader is still alive, the Death Star is being constructed, Luke and Han and Leia aren’t in the picture yet, and a small rebel force is attempting to take down the Empire. “With the most financially successful franchise in movie history behind it, ‘Rogue One’ should be a lock for big dollars.” “Rogue One” is online ticket seller Fandango’s top advance-ticket-seller of the year and No. 2 all-time, just behind last year’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” With a great brand, comes great responsibility — to borrow an idea from another great Disney brand. “Star Wars” fans are some of the most passionate, and therefore critical, there are. “The Force Awakens” did all it needed last year to tap into the nostalgia of old fans and capture younger fans, and became the year’s highest grossing movie. “The Force Awakens” ended its theatrical run with $2.1 billion in global ticket sales and a 92% rating on critical aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.

The film, holding an 84% Rotten Tomatoes rating ahead of opening, could fall victim to the very spin-off, stand-alone nature that sets it apart in hope of making it special.

",Stock market closes lower after China seizes U.S. underwater drone - MarketWatch
Kosaku Narioka,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 2:24 p.m. ET U.S. currency likely to trend higher, though with risk, from next steps by Fed, Trump, says Tokyo analyst By The dollar pulled back against the yen and euro after news that a Chinese navy vessel seized a U.S. underwater survey drone in the South China Sea. It was the first time the government in Beijing has seized a piece of U.S. military gear since the Chinese took a Navy surveillance plane on Hainan Island following a midair collision in April 2001. The U.S. on Friday demanded the return of the drone. But analysts suggested that a pullback was a knee-jerk reaction and an excuse for more consolidation ahead of the weekend. “A lot of people are nervous about the relationship with China in light of [President-elect Donald] Trump’s provocative tweets about China,” said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. “I would not read too much into the move, however, as the dollar is due for a little of a consolidation after a run for the past several weeks,” Win Thin said. The measure of the dollar against a basket of major rivals is hovering near its 14-year high after the Federal Reserve earlier in the week boosted the currency by signaling more interest-rate increases are likely in 2017. Since the U.S. election in early November, the dollar has strengthened broadly on expectations for President-elect Donald Trump’s fiscal stimulus and stronger U.S. growth. The dollar advanced about 1.2% this week after the U.S. central bank lifted rates on Wednesday and raised its projection to from two rate increases in 2017 to three. The ICE dollar Index has risen in eight of the past 11 weeks.

Sue Chang,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 9:09 a.m. ET The latest developments come at a time when President-elect Donald Trump has made it plain that he will play hardball with China By If there were any questions as to how far China will go to bolster its claim to the South China Sea, the world got another clue this week that leaves no doubt that Beijing is playing for high stakes. A series of satellite images released by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative show that China has bulked up its military presence on the Spratly Islands by installing large antiaircraft guns and close-in weapons systems. The AMTI, which had been tracking the construction of the structures since this summer, concluded that these facilities at Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi Reefs are more evolved point-defense fortifications that are already installed at Gaven, Hughes, Johnson, and Cuarteron Reefs. Here are some of the images of those installations: Fiery Cross Reef Mischief Reef Subi Reef “These gun and probable CIWS emplacements show that Beijing is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,” said AMTI in a statement on its website. The think-tank believes the weaponry will be the “last line of defense” against cruise missiles launched by the U.S. Gaven Reef Hughes Reef Johnson Reef Cuarteron Reef “They would back up the defensive umbrella provided by a future deployment to the Spratlys of mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) platforms, such as the HQ-9 deployed to Woody Island in the Paracel Islands,” said the AMTI. China’s activities in the disputed region are a direct contradiction of President Xi Jinping’s pledge to refrain from militarization in the archipelago. They also raise concerns that Beijing will increasingly resort to military force to bolster its territorial claims and control a key shipping route that accounts for $5 trillion of international trade annually, according to The Wall Street Journal. Adm. Harry Harris, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, said Wednesday that the U.S. won’t allow the region to be shut down by China “no matter how many bases are built,” the newspaper reported. “We will cooperate where we can and be ready to confront where we must,” he said. At his disposal is the formidable U.S. Pacific Fleet which includes 200 ships and submarines, more than 1,000 aircraft and 140,000 personnel. The latest developments come at a time when President-elect Donald Trump has made it plain that he will play hardball with China. Trump has already broken with tradition by accepting a congratulatory call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan earlier this month. In the days since, Trump had indicated that the once tamper-proof One-China Policy, which essentially treats Taiwan as a renegade province of China, will likely be reviewed, if not overhauled. Beijing lashed out in an editorial in the state-backed Global Times, calling Trump naive and warned that China could go as far as to provide military assistance to U.S.’s enemies. “China needs to be fully armed and prepared to take a Sino-U. S. roller coaster relationship together with Trump. And many others in the world will probably also need to fasten their seat belts,” said the newspaper.

In a tweet, Trump said the U.S. should expand its nuclear capability until the world “comes to its senses regarding nukes.” He offered no further comment and it was unclear what prompted the tweet. The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes The U.S. holds the second-greatest number of nuclear weapons, behind only Russia, according to the Ploughshares Fund. In 2015, President Barack Obama’s administration dismantled 109 warheads, the fewest of his presidency, according to a report in May from the Pentagon. Trump’s tweet followed a statement from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said Russia must “strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces.” Putin is scheduled to hold his annual news conference on Friday and is expected to comment on his country’s ties with the U.S. Trump has called Putin a “strong leader,” and has cast doubt on reports that Russia was behind hacking during the U.S. election. Obama supporters, the New York Times noted in May, said the slowdown in weapons dismantling was understandable given the rising level of hostility with Russia. Trump has said he wants to rip up the international deal limiting Iran’s nuclear program. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox? Subscribe to MarketWatch's free Europe Daily newsletter.

Steve Goldstein,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 20, 2016 4:42 p.m. ET Plan for fishing or hunting access were ‘initial concepts,’ Trump team says By Two of Donald Trump’s adult children will not be participating in a planned fundraising event, after several media outlets reported that they were set to offer access during a hunting trip in exchange for donations of up to $1 million. The presidential transition team in a statement said late Tuesday that the plan, to offer hunting and fishing expeditions with Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. for donations of up to $1 million, were merely “initial concepts.” “The Opening Day event and details that have been reported are merely initial concepts that have not been approved or pursued by the Trump family,” spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. The two sons are “avid outdoorsmen and supporters of conservation efforts” but are not involved “in any capacity.” The Center for Public Integrity had reported that the donations would have gone to unnamed charities. They were offered by a newly formed organization called the Opening Day Foundation, which has the two Trump children, as well as Gentry Beach and Tom Hicks Jr., as directors. TMZ first reported the flyer associated with the event. An auction offering coffee with Ivanka Trump was cancelled last week after receiving criticism for selling access. Eric, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. all are members of the Trump transition team. Ivanka also was pictured at a meeting the president-elect had with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a time when she had business pending with the Japanese government. During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for allegedly selling access to donors to the nonprofit Clinton Foundation.

Eruviel Ávila reported 29 deaths so far. A bystander caught the dramatic scene in a video posted to YouTube. Emergency responders rushed to the scene but were forced to wait for the chain-reaction explosions to die down before getting closer. Officials said a number of houses were damaged. “My condolences to the relatives of those who lost their lives in this accident,” President Enrique Peña Nieto said in a Twitter post. “And my wishes for a prompt recovery of the injured.” Fireworks are popular in Mexico to celebrate holidays, such as Christmas and New Year’s.

Sager had been battling leukemia since being diagnosed in 2014. Though his career started in 1972 and spanned the world of sports — he covered the Olympics, World Cup and interviewed Hank Aaron on the field after his record-setting 715th home run in 1974 — Sager was best known for his work as a sideline reporter for Turner Sports’ TV coverage of the National Basketball Association. He spent 26 years working the NBA on TNT, and was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame on Tuesday. Sager’s deep knowledge of basketball, positive attitude and garish sense of style made him a favorite of players, coaches and fans alike. His last broadcast appearance was during the NBA Finals in June. This interview with Craig Sager and Kevin Garnett is one of the best. Craig Sager was one of a kind. #SagerStrong https://t.co/2l3SJrvRJI While battling leukemia, Sager underwent three bone marrow transplants and a number of blood transfusions and chemotherapy treatments, but he always returned to work the sidelines as soon as he was able. “There will never be another Craig Sager. His incredible talent, tireless work ethic and commitment to his craft took him all over the world covering sports,” Turner president David Levy said in a statement Thursday. His colorful wardrobe was a point of pride, and Sager said he dressed that way to entertain others. “Sports are supposed to be fun, and so I have fun with the way I dress,” he once told BleacherReport.com. Tributes to the beloved broadcaster rolled in Thursday: “Time is simply how you live your life.” - Craig Sager. So grateful for the time you shared with all of us.

                                   sank as much as 10% on Thursday morning, but trimmed losses later in the day. Monte dei Paschi has in recent weeks raced to raise €5 billion ($5.2 billion) from private investors to shore up its balance sheet and avoid being wound down by European regulators. However, it has run into major challenges. For example, uncertainty following the Italian referendum in early December dissuaded key investors to take part in the private rescue plan. Here are five things you need to know as the bank’s future hangs in the balance, casting a shadow over an entire sector. After failing the European Banking Authority’s stress tests this summer, Monte dei Paschi has been given until the end of the year to raise €5 billion. However, a private recapitalization plan led by J.P. Morgan to score the €5 billion collapsed on Wednesday after BMPS failed to secure an anchor investor. That dissuaded other key investors to back a share sale, according to media reports. Reuters reported that BMPS had banked on Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund investing €1 billion in its cash call, but that the option was no longer on the table. Additionally, a debt-for-equity swap offer failed to raise as much capital as hoped, making it even harder for the bank to reach its recapitalization target. With the private rescue plan now failing to prop up the bank, Monte dei Paschi is left at the mercy of the Italian government. The Italian cabinet is due to meet to approve the rescue plan late on Thursday or early Friday, once the BMPS board has requested help, the Financial Times reported. Italy’s parliament on Wednesday approved a government request for a €20 billion euro rescue loan to support the country’s ailing banking sector, which is expected in part to be used for a BMPS bailout. Italian Daily IL Sole 24 Ore said the capital injection would be carried out in separate steps over the next two to three months. BMPS has already been bailed out twice by the state. While Monte dei Paschi is considered a small bank relative to multinational giants, the fallout from a bailout could have far reaching consequences for global investors. There are concerns that the jitters could spread to other Italian banks and that the €20 billion set aside by the government on Wednesday won’t be enough to prop up all of the struggling lenders. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, estimates Italian banks need €52 billion to be rescued. Read:  Why Italy’s banks could ignite a eurozone crisis And there’s another issue. A taxpayer funded-bailout carries the risk of a political backlash that could empower the so-called euroskeptic and anti-establishment 5 Star Movement. With the risk of snap elections in Italy next year, voter anger could propel this populist party into the driver’s seat. That could mean “Quitaly” or “Brexit 2.0.” Additionally, a euroskeptic government in Italy could lead to a surge in bond yields, credit downgrades and added troubles for banks, analysts say. It’s been a rough year for Monte dei Paschi’s stock. After kicking off 2016 around €123 a share, the stock dropped to an intraday low of €14.71 on Thursday. That is a tumble of more than 85% this year. This week alone, the stock has tanked 21%, with the bulk of that move coming on Tuesday when the bank said it was running out of liquidity much faster than expected. As the poster child for the Italian bank crisis, Monte dei Paschi is saddled with a mountain of non-performing loans that is eating into its capital. It has the highest proportion of bad loans among Italian banks at around 36%. It has been asked to shed €28 billion of those loans to make it healthy again. European regulators said this summer that BMPS would have its capital wiped out in a crisis scenario, prompting the bank to announce plans for a €5 billion capital increase. The plan was somewhat on track until early December, when then-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned after losing a referendum on constitutional reforms. The vote and resignation have triggered a wave of political uncertainty. There is buzz that the developments have paved the way for populist parties who could lead Italy out of the eurozone. That spooked some of the key investors in Monte dei Paschi’s private recapitalization plan, leading them in the eleventh hour to decide against buying into the share sale.

Sara Sjolin,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 21, 2016 8:02 a.m. ET By Italy’s parliament has approved a government request for a 20 billion euro rescue loan to prop up the country’s ailing banking sector, including Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, which on Wednesday moved closer to the financial abyss. The €20 billion ($20.81 billion) bailout fund will be used to guarantee liquidity in the banking system and support several of the country’s struggling lenders that are crumbling under high levels of bad loans, media reports said.

                                   was seen as moving one step closer to the brink, after estimating it will run out liquidity in four months. The bank — the world’s oldest and Italy’s third biggest — had previously estimated to have enough liquidity for 11 months. Monte dei Paschi has been the poster child of the Italian crisis, saddled with mountains of nonperforming loans. It has been asked to raise €5 billion in fresh capital by the end of December or risk being wound down by European regulators. However, the bank has fallen drastically short of raising the €5 billion, raising expectations of a state bailout, maybe by as soon as this week. On Tuesday, just one day before its second debt-for-equity swap expired, BMPS had raised about €500 million, according to Bloomberg. “The weak appetite rings the alarm bell as the year-end deadline approaches at a threatening speed. Failure to save the bank could aggressively shake up the Italian and the European banking sector,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, in a note on Wednesday. “Italian banks need €52 billion to be rescued, more than twice the €20 billion package” approved by parliament on Wednesday, she added. Monte dei Paschi shares took a roller-coaster ride in Wednesday’s action, with trading halted several times because they were falling too fast. The stock was down 19% at one point at €15 a share, a record low. However, the shares started to trim losses after news that the parliament had approved the rescue loan. The chart below shows how the shares were halted several times in early trade as investors dumped the stock, before starting to recoup losses. The bank’s shares have lost 86% in 2016 so far. The losses for other Italian banks were more muted on Wednesday.

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian police shot dead the man believed responsible for this week’s Berlin Christmas market truck attack, killing him after he pulled a gun on them during a routine check in the early hours of Friday. The suspect - 24-year-old Tunisian Anis Amri - traveled to Italy from Germany via France, taking advantage of Europe’s open-border Schengen pact to cross the continent undetected. As anger grew over the fact that Amri had escaped expulsion twice in 18 months thanks to bureaucratic loopholes, euroskeptic parties called for the reintroduction of border controls, while Germany said deportations had to be made easier. Amri is suspected of ploughing a truck through a festive Berlin market on Monday, killing 12 people. In a video released on Friday after his death, he is seen pledging his allegiance to militant group Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. “I call on my Muslim brothers everywhere... Those in Europe, kill the crusader pigs, each person to their own ability,” he says in the video posted on Islamic State’s Amaq news agency. Amri had arrived in Milan’s main railway station from France at 1.00 a.m. (2000 EDT) and then traveled to the working class suburb of Sesto San Giovanni, where two young policemen approached him because he looked suspicious idling on a street. Milan police chief Antonio De Iesu told a news conference his men had no idea that they might be dealing with Amri. “They had no perception that it could be him, otherwise they would have been much more cautious,” De Iesu said. “We had no intelligence that he could be in Milan.” He failed to produce any identification so the police requested he empty his pockets and his small backpack. He pulled a loaded gun from his bag and shot at one of the men, lightly wounding him in the shoulder. Amri then hid behind a nearby car but the other police officer managed to shoot him once or twice, killing him on the spot, De Iesu said. Amri was identified by his fingerprints. De Iesu said that besides the gun, the suspect had been carrying a small pocket knife. He also had a few hundred euros on him but no cell phone and very few other belongings. Amri once spent four years in jail in Italy and police were trying to work out if he knew someone in Sesto, which is home to a sizeable Muslim community. “He could have carried out other attacks. He was a loose cannon,” De Iesu said. Islamic State had previously claimed responsibility for the Berlin killings and on Friday it acknowledged the death of the man it referred to as “the executor of the Berlin attacks.” Leading euroskeptics were quick to blame the Schengen open borders pact for allowing the suspect to travel so easily. “This escapade in at least two or three countries is symptomatic of the total security catastrophe that is the Schengen agreement,” said Marine Le Pen, who leads France’s far-right National Front party and is running for president. Beppe Grillo, the founder of the 5-Star Movement, Italy’s main opposition party, said Schengen was allowing militants to cross Europe with impunity and had to be re-thought. He also said all illegal migrants had to be expelled from the country. Chancellor Angela Merkel, under increasing pressure inside Germany to take a much tougher line on immigration after opening the country’s borders to waves of refugees in 2015, said the Berlin attack raised many questions and promised measures would be taken to improve security. Amri originally come to Europe in 2011, reaching the Italian island of Lampedusa by boat. He told authorities he was a minor, though documents now indicate he was not, and he was transferred to Catania, Sicily, where he was enrolled in school. Just months later he was arrested by police after he attempted to set fire to the school, a senior police source said. He was later convicted of vandalism, threats, and theft. He spent almost four years in Italian prisons before being ordered out of the country after Tunisia refused to accept him back in 2015 because he had no identification papers linking him to the north African country. He moved to Germany and applied for asylum there, but this was rejected after he was identified by security agencies as a potential threat. Once again he could not be deported because of a lack of I.D. Merkel said on Friday she had told Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi during a phone conversation that her government wanted to speed up deportation of failed asylum seekers. The attack, which echoed one in Nice in July that killed more than 80 people, has put Europe on high alert over the Christmas period. Early on Friday, German special forces arrested two men suspected of planning an attack on a shopping mall in the western city of Oberhausen. The men - two brothers from Kosovo, aged 28 and 31 - were arrested in the city of Duisburg on information from security sources, police said. A police spokesman said there was no link with the Amri case. ","

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Carrie Fisher, who rose to fame as Princess Leia in the “Star Wars” films and later endured drug addiction before going on to tell her story as a best-selling author, died on Tuesday aged 60, her family said. Fisher, a mental health advocate who spoke about her own struggles with bipolar disorder and cocaine addiction, had suffered a heart attack on Friday as she flew into Los Angeles. The daughter of actor Debbie Reynolds and the late singer Eddie Fisher had been returning from England where she was shooting the third season of the British sitcom “Catastrophe.” “Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter,” Reynolds said on Facebook. “I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop.” Fisher’s friend and former Star Wars’ co-star Mark Hamill, who played Leia’s brother Luke Skywalker, said in a tweet: “No words. #Devastated” Fisher was met by paramedics and rushed to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after suffering the heart attack during the flight on Friday. She made headlines last month when she disclosed that she had a three-month love affair with her “Star Wars” co-star Harrison Ford 40 years ago. Fisher revealed the secret to People magazine while  promoting her new memoir, “The Princess Diarist,” just before it went on sale. The book is based on Fisher’s diaries from her time working on the first “Star Wars” movie. Harrison said in a statement Fisher was funny, emotionally fearless and one-of-a-kind. “She lived her life, bravely...We will all miss her.” Fisher said the affair started and ended in 1976 during production on the blockbuster sci-fi adventure in which she first appeared as the intrepid Princess Leia. Ford played the maverick space pilot Han Solo. “It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend,” Fisher told People. She was 19 and Ford was 33 at the time. “How could you ask such a shining specimen of a man to be satisfied with the likes of me? I was so inexperienced, but I trusted something about him. He was kind,” she wrote of Ford in the memoir, the latest of several books Fisher authored. Fisher reprised the role in two “Star Wars” sequels. She gained sex symbol status in 1983’s “Return of the Jedi” when her Leia character wore a metallic gold bikini while enslaved by the diabolical Jabba the Hutt. Filming was completed in July on Fisher’s next appearance as Leia in “Star Wars: Episode VIII,” which is set to reach theaters in December 2017. Fisher’s Princess Leia makes a surprise appearance at the end of “Rogue One,” the latest blockbuster, which opened this month, in the “Star Wars” series. Shortly after news of her death was made public, her dog Gary, who has his own Twitter account, said goodbye: “Saddest tweets to tweet. Mommy is gone. I love you @carrieffisher.” She is survived by her mother, Reynolds, her daughter, Billie Lourd, and her brother Todd Fisher. Fisher also played a memorable supporting role in the 1989 hit film “When Harry Met Sally,” as a friend of Meg Ryan’s character who falls for and marries the best pal of Billy Crystal’s character. More recently, Fisher played the American mother-in-law on “Catastrophe.” Born in Beverly Hills, Carrie Fisher got her showbiz start at age 12 in her mother’s Las Vegas nightclub act. She made her film debut as a teenager in the 1975 comedy “Shampoo,” two years before her “Star Wars” breakthrough. But her life was also at times mired in drug abuse, mental illness and tumultuous romances with other entertainment figures, all of which she laid bare in her books, interviews and a one-woman stage show titled “Wishful Drinking.” She was once engaged to comic actor Dan Aykroyd, later married, then divorced, singer-songwriter Paul Simon, and had a daughter out of wedlock with Hollywood talent agent Brian Lourd. After undergoing treatment in the mid-1980s for cocaine addition, she wrote the bestselling novel, “Postcards from the Edge,” about a drug-abusing actress forced to move back in with her mother. She later adapted the book into a film that starred Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine. She told Reuters in a 2011 interview that tabloid exposure of her private life could be trying. “‘Carrie Fisher’s tragic life.’ That was one that hurt,” she said, quoting a headline. “‘Hey, how about Carrie Fisher? She used to be so hot. Now she looks like Elton John.’ That hurt.” She also acknowledged being briefly hospitalized in 2013 due to a bout with bipolar disorder. However, Fisher told Rolling Stone magazine in an interview published last month she was happier than she had ever been. “I’ve been through a lot, and I could go through more, but I hope I don’t have to,” she said. “But if I did, I’d be able to do it. I’m not going to enjoy dying but there’s not much prep for that.” Summing up the showbiz legacy she expected to leave behind in her 2011 memoir “Shockaholic,” Fisher wrote in self-deprecating style: “What you’ll have of me after I journey to that great Death Star in the sky is an extremely accomplished daughter, a few books, and a picture of a stern-looking girl wearing some kind of metal bikini lounging on a giant drooling squid, behind a newscaster informing you of the passing of Princess Leia after a long battle with her head.” ","

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"(Reuters) - - Hollywood legend Debbie Reynolds, who sang and danced her way into the hearts of millions of moviegoers around the world in musicals like “Singin’ in the Rain,” died on Wednesday at age 84, her son said. Reynolds, one of the most enduring and endearing Hollywood actresses, died hours after being rushed to the hospital in Los Angeles after suffering a stroke, her son, Todd Fisher said. Her death came just one day after her daughter, the actress Carrie Fisher, died of a heart attack. Reynolds, who rose to stardom in the film “Singin’ In the Rain,” appeared in dozens of films. She starred opposite  Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Tony Curtis, Donald O’Connor, Fred Astaire and Dick Van Dyke. She received a best actress Academy Award nomination for the 1964 musical “The Unsinkable Molly Brown.” At the peak of her stardom, Reynolds was drawn into a scandal when her husband, singer Eddie Fisher, began an affair with actress Elizabeth Taylor. Reynolds and Fisher divorced in 1959 and he married Taylor. Reynolds and Taylor, who eventually divorced Fisher, made peace years later and appeared together in the 2001 television movie “These Old Broads,” written by Carrie Fisher. In a 2010 interview with Rage Monthly, Reynolds reflected on her philosophy of life. “I always go by a five-year plan,” she said. “I get through today and I’m not going to get upset for five years. “I always picture a long tunnel and at the end of the tunnel, there’s a light. I know I can make it to that light and I’ll take five years to get there. Now…I’ve gone through many tunnels. So, I just keep trying. I never give up.” Mary Frances Reynolds was born on April 1, 1932. She was 16 and in the Miss Burbank beauty contest when she was discovered by a talent scout. Warner Brothers changed her name to “Debbie,” and she had a bit part that year in “June Bride.” She was signed by MGM in 1950 and that year, in “Two Weeks with Love,” Reynolds performed the hit duet “Aba Daba Honeymoon” with Carleton Carpenter. She also made her feature acting debut in 1950 in “The Daughter of Rosie O’Grady.” It was 1952’s “Singin’ in the Rain,” however, that catapulted Reynolds to stardom, playing opposite Gene Kelly and Donald O’Connor and recording the original soundtrack album for the film. Her fame grew with leading roles in “Susan Slept Here” with Dick Powell, “The Tender Trap” with Frank Sinatra, “The Catered Affair” with Bette Davis, “Bundle of Joy” with then-husband Fisher, “The Mating Game” with Tony Randall, “It Started with A Kiss” with Glenn Ford, and “The Pleasure of His Company” with Astaire. Reynolds’ song “Tammy” from her 1957 movie “Tammy and the Bachelor” hit No. 1 on the singles charts. That year, she became a regular on “The Eddie Fisher Show” broadcast by NBC. She performed in nightclubs, hosted TV specials, and in  1968 had her first TV series, the NBC sitcom “The Debbie Reynolds Show.” The 1970 film “What’s the Matter with Helen?” turned out to be the last big screen acting role she would have for some 20 years. “I didn’t stop making movies. They stopped making me,” Reynolds told The New York Times in 1996. Reynolds performed on cruise ships and in nightclubs and took to the stage in New York and London. Her 1973 revival of the musical “Irene” earned her a Tony Award nomination. The same year she gave voice to Charlotte in the animated feature “Charlotte’s Web.” Her second marriage, to shoe businessman Harry Karl, ended in the early 1970s after he gambled away most of her money. Financial reasons compelled her to keep working. In 1984 she married her third husband, real estate developer Richard Hamlett, and they bought a Las Vegas hotel and casino, where she also performed. That marriage ended amid the financial collapse of that property and Reynolds filed for bankruptcy protection in 1997. “There are good men, including my father and my son Todd, but I happened to marry idiots, which is why I gave up years ago. I have very bad taste in men,” she told the Yorkshire Post in a 2010 interview. Reynolds’ theatrical performances took her to the West Coast, then in 1981, she returned to Broadway to take over the lead in “Woman of the Year.” That year brought another TV show, the short-lived series “Aloha Paradise.” By 1983, Reynolds had a recurring role in the TV series “Jennifer Slept Here, starring Ann Jillian. The next year she created and starred in an exercise video, “Do It Debbie’s Way,” and four years later produced the exercise video, “Couples (Do It Debbie’s Way).” Reynolds starred in her first TV movie, “Sadie and Son,” in 1987. The following year brought her written memoir, “Debbie: My Life.” She then toured nationally with “The Unsinkable Molly Brown.” In 1992 she made a cameo appearance in the movie “The Bodyguard” and the next year she had a supporting role in “Heaven and Earth.” The 1996 Albert Brooks comedy “Mother,” brought Reynolds back to the big screen in a lead role. The rest is history: “Halloweentown” movies for Disney, a recurring role in the sitcom “Will & Grace,” more TV movies and,  in 2012, a role in the feature film “One for the Money.” ","

Reynolds, 84, an Oscar-nominated singer-actress, was rushed to Cedars-Sinai hospital earlier on Wednesday, “It’s true, she’s with Carrie,” her son, Todd Fisher, told Reuters, adding that shortly before suffering a stroke Reynolds had said she missed her daughter and wanted to be with her. “She left very shortly after that and those were the last words she spoke,” Todd Fisher said. After the news of Reynolds’ death, numerous people took to social media and wrote that “she died of a broken heart.” One of the most enduring and endearing Hollywood stars of her time, Reynolds received a best actress Academy Award nomination for the 1964 musical “The Unsinkable Molly Brown.” Carrie Fisher, who rose to fame as Princess Leia in the “Star Wars” films and later battled through drug addiction before going on to tell her story as a best-selling author, died on Tuesday at age 60 after suffering a heart attack last  Friday. After Fisher’s death, Reynolds said on Facebook, “Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter. I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop.” Reynolds had been in frail health in the past year, and she missed a dinner in November 2015 to receive an honorary Oscar. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said at the time that she was unable to attend because of “an unexpectedly long recovery from recent surgery.” The nature of her illness was not disclosed.

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will re-assess its ties with the United Nations following the adoption by the Security Council of a resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlement building, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday. The vote was able to pass the 15-member council on Friday because the United States broke with a long-standing approach of diplomatically shielding Israel and did not wield its veto power as it had on many times before - a decision that Netanyahu called “shameful”. “I instructed the Foreign Ministry to complete within a month a re-evaluation of all our contacts with the United Nations, including the Israeli funding of U.N. institutions and the presence of U.N. representatives in Israel,” Netanyahu said in broadcast remarks. “I have already instructed to stop about 30 million shekels ($7.8 million) in funding to five U.N. institutions, five bodies, that are especially hostile to Israel ... and there is more to come,” he said. The Israeli leader did not name the institutions or offer any further details. Defying heavy pressure from long-time ally Israel and President-elect Donald Trump for Washington to use its veto, the United States abstained in the Security Council decision, which passed with 14 votes in favor. Israel for decades has pursued a policy of constructing Jewish settlements on territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbors including the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Most countries view Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel disagrees, citing a biblical connection to the land. ","

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States intended to allow the U.N. Security Council to approve a resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlement building, two Western officials said on Thursday, a major reversal of U.S. practice, which prompted Israel to ask President-elect Donald Trump to apply pressure. In a day of intense diplomatic wrangling on one of the thorniest Middle East conflicts, Egypt, which had proposed the draft resolution, abruptly put off a vote that had been scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Diplomats said Cairo had acted under pressure from Israel and to avoid alienating Trump, who spoke to the Egyptian president and urged the White House to use its veto. By late Thursday, four Security Council members had given Egypt an ultimatum and threatened to put the draft resolution to a vote. The two Western officials said President Barack Obama had intended to abstain from the vote, a relatively rare step by the United States to register criticism of the building on occupied land that Palestinians want for a state. The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had an acrimonious relationship with Obama, believes the Obama administration had long planned the council vote in coordination with the Palestinians, the senior Israeli official said. “It was a violation of a core commitment to protect Israel at the U.N.,” the official said. The White House had no immediate comment. U.S. officials have voiced growing fears that a “two-state” solution is imperiled by Israeli settlement building and have been more willing to voice open criticism, including, the two Western officials said, via Thursday’s planned vote. A U.S. abstention would have been seen as a parting shot by Obama, who has made the settlements a major target of his - ultimately futile - peace efforts. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, which in 1979 became the first Arab nation to make peace with Israel, called  Trump on Thursday, a Trump transition official said, saying they spoke broadly about laying the ground for Middle East peace. Sisi’s office said the two leaders spoke. “The presidents agreed on the importance of affording the new U.S. administration the full chance to deal with all dimensions of the Palestinian case with a view of achieving a full and final settlement,” presidency spokesman Alaa Yousef said. The resolution would demand Israel “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem” and said the establishment of settlements by Israel has “no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.” Egypt, currently a Security Council member, worked with the Palestinians to draft the text. The senior Israeli official said Israel remained concerned the resolution could still go ahead with another sponsoring country. New Zealand, Venezuela, Malaysia and Senegal asked Egypt to clarify by midnight whether it planned to call a vote. “In the event that Egypt decides that it cannot proceed to call for vote on 23 December or does not provide a response by the deadline, those delegations reserve the right to table the draft ... and proceed to put it to vote ASAP,” the four states wrote in a note, seen by Reuters. They said “the proposal for other delegations to take the lead ... would also help Egypt by relieving it of the burden of carrying this draft alone.” They plan to meet on Friday morning to decide how to proceed, diplomats said. Officials in Netanyahu’s office spoke to Egyptian officials on Thursday about postponing the vote, an Israeli diplomat said. It was not clear what pressure Israel may have put on Egypt but there are several ways it could do so, including curtailing Israeli security cooperation in Egypt’s fight against Islamist militants in the Sinai desert. Netanyahu took to Twitter in the dead of night in Israel to make the appeal for a veto. Hours later, Trump backed fellow conservative Netanyahu on one of the most contentious issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the pursuit, effectively stalled since 2014, of a two-state solution. The State Department declined to comment immediately on reports of the planned abstention. Israel’s far-right and settler leaders have been buoyed by the election of Trump, who has signaled a possible change in U.S. policy by tapping a fundraiser for a major Israeli settlement as Washington’s ambassador to Israel. Netanyahu, for whom settlers are a key constituency, has said his government has been their greatest ally since the capture of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in a 1967 war. The United States says continued Israeli settlement building lacks legitimacy, but has stopped short of adopting the position of many countries that it is illegal under international law. Some 570,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China to be adopted. The United States has vetoed dozens of Security Council resolutions on Israel and it is rare for it to abstain. The last time the Security Council adopted a resolution on Israel and the Palestinians was in January 2009, when Washington abstained on a resolution calling for ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. In 1979 the United States abstained on a resolution, when the council said Israeli settlements “have no legal validity and constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.” Britain also abstained.

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will convene some 70 countries on Jan. 15 for a Middle East peace conference in Paris, its foreign minister said on Thursday, and will invite the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to meet separately at its conclusion. France has repeatedly tried to breathe new life into the peace process this year, holding a preliminary conference in June where the United Nations, European Union, United States and major Arab countries gathered to discuss proposals without the Israelis or Palestinians present. The plan was to hold a follow-up conference before the end of the year with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas involved to see whether the two sides could be brought back to negotiations and revive moribund peace talks. Netanyahu had repeatedly rejected the conference proposal. “France is still determined to hold a conference in Paris to reaffirm the necessity of a two-state solution,” Jean-Marc Ayrault told journalists. “January 15 is the date that has been fixed and 70 countries are invited. We are not going to give up now.” A French diplomatic source said invitations would also be sent to Netanyahu and Abbas to meet French president Francois Hollande to outline the results of the conference. The source said that with uncertainty surrounding how the next US administration would handle the issue it was more important than ever to deal with the issue. “You can see that it’s even more justified in this context,” the source said. Ahead of a UN Security Council vote at the UN later on Israeli settlements, Ayrault declined to say how Paris would vote, but repeated that settlements were illegal. “We will look at this text carefully. The ongoing settlements completely weaken the situation and create tensions  and move Us away from a two-state solution”. ","

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"MOSCOW/ANKARA (Reuters) - Syria would be divided into informal zones of regional power influence and Bashar al-Assad would remain president for at least a few years under an outline deal between Russia, Turkey and Iran, sources say. Such a deal, which would allow regional autonomy within a federal structure controlled by Assad’s Alawite sect, is in its infancy, subject to change and would need the buy-in of Assad and the rebels and, eventually, the Gulf states and the United States, sources familiar with Russia’s thinking say. “There has been a move toward a compromise,” said Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think tank close to the Russian Foreign Ministry. “A final deal will be hard, but stances have shifted.” Assad’s powers would be cut under a deal between the three nations, say several sources. Russia and Turkey would allow him to stay until the next presidential election when he would quit in favor of a less polarizing Alawite candidate. Iran has yet to be persuaded of that, say the sources. But either way Assad would eventually go, in a face-saving way, with guarantees for him and his family. “A couple of names in the leadership have been mentioned (as potential successors),” said Kortunov, declining to name names. Nobody thinks a wider Syrian peace deal, something that has eluded the international community for years, will be easy, quick or certain of success. What is clear is that President Vladimir Putin wants to play the lead role in trying to broker a settlement, initially with Turkey and Iran. That would bolster his narrative of Russia regaining its mantle as a world power and serious Middle East player. “It’s a very big prize for them if they can show they’re out there in front changing the world,” Sir Tony Brenton, Britain’s former ambassador to Moscow, told Reuters. “We’ve all grown used to the United States doing that and had rather forgotten that Russia used to play at the same level” If Russia gets its way, new peace talks between the Syrian government and the opposition will begin in mid-January in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, a close Russian ally. The talks would be distinct from intermittent U.N.-brokered negotiations and not initially involve the United States. That has irritated some in Washington. “So this country that essentially has an economy the size of Spain, that’s Russia, is strutting around and acting like they know what they are doing,” said one U.S. official, who declined to be named because of the subject’s sensitivity. “I don’t think the Turks and the Russians can do this (political negotiations) without us.” Foreign and defense ministers from Russia, Turkey and Iran met in Moscow on Dec. 20 and set out the principles they thought any Syria deal should adhere to. Russian sources say the first step is to get a nationwide ceasefire and then to get talks underway. The idea would then be to get Gulf states involved, then the United States, and at a later stage the European Union which would be asked, maybe with the Gulf states, to pick up the bill for rebuilding. The three-way peace push is, at first glance, an odd one. Iran, Assad’s staunchest backer, has provided militia fighters to help Assad, Russia has supplied air strikes, while Turkey has backed the anti-Assad rebels. Putin has struck a series of backroom understandings with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan to ease the path to a possible deal, several sources familiar with the process say. Moscow got Iran to buy into the idea of a three-way peace push by getting Turkey to drop its demands for Assad to go soon, the same sources said. “Our priority is not to see Assad go, but for terrorism to be defeated,” one senior Turkish government official, who declined to be named, said. “It doesn’t mean we approve of Assad. But we have come to an understanding. When Islamic State is wiped out, Russia may support Turkey in Syria finishing off the PKK.” Turkey views the YPG militia and its PYD political wing as extensions of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has long waged an insurgency in its largely Kurdish southeast. “Of course we have disagreements with Iran,” said the same Turkish official. “We view some issues differently, but we are coming to agreements to end mutual problems.” Aydin Sezer, head of the Turkey and Russia Centre of Studies, an Ankara-based think tank, said Turkey had now “completely given up the issue of regime change” in Syria. Turkey’s public position remains strongly anti-Assad however and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday a political transition with Assad was impossible. Brenton, Britain’s former ambassador, said Moscow and Ankara had done a deal because Moscow had needed Turkey to get the opposition out of Aleppo and to come to the negotiating table. “The real flesh in the game the Turks have, and the fear they have, is of an autonomous Kurdistan emerging inside Syria that would have direct implications for them,” he said. Ankara launched an incursion into Syria, “Operation Euphrates Shield”, in August to push Islamic State out of a 90-km (55-mile) stretch of frontier territory and ensure Kurdish militias did not gain more territory in Syria. The shifting positions of Moscow and Ankara are driven by realpolitik. Russia doesn’t want to get bogged down in a long war and wants to hold Syria together and keep it as an ally. Turkey wants to informally control a swathe of northern Syria giving it a safe zone to house refugees, a base for the anti-Assad opposition, and a bulwark against Kurdish influence. The fate of al-Bab, an Islamic State-held city around 40 km (25 miles) northeast of Aleppo, is also a factor. Erdogan is determined that Turkish-backed rebels capture the city to prevent Kurdish militias from doing so. Several sources said there had been an understanding between Ankara and Moscow that rebels could leave Aleppo to help take al-Bab. Iran’s interests are harder to discern, but Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s top adviser, said Aleppo’s fall might alter a lot in the region. By helping Assad retake Aleppo, Tehran has secured a land corridor that connects Tehran to Beirut, allowing it to send arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Russian and Western diplomatic sources say Iran would insist on keeping that corridor and on Assad staying in power for now. If he did step down, Tehran would want him replaced with another Alawite, which it sees as the closest thing to Shia Islam. Iran may be the biggest stumbling block to a wider deal. Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan has said Saudi Arabia must not take part in talks because of its stance on Assad - Riyadh wants the Syrian leader to step down. Scepticism about the prospects for a wider deal abounds. Dennis Ross, an adviser to Democratic and Republican administrations, now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he did not think a deal would bring peace to Syria. “I doubt this will end the war in Syria even after Aleppo,”  Ross told Reuters. “Assad’s presence will remain a source of conflict with the opposition.” ","

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"LONDON (Reuters) - British singer George Michael, who became one of the pop idols of the 1980s with Wham! and then forged a career as a successful solo artist with sometimes sexually provocative lyrics, died at his home in England on Sunday. He was 53. In the mid-1980s, Wham! was one of the most successful pop duos ever, ahead even of Simon & Garfunkel, with singles like ”Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go”, ”Careless Whisper”, “Last Christmas” and “The Edge of Heaven”. “It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period,” his publicist said in a statement. “The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage,” the statement said. British police said Michael’s death was “unexplained but not suspicious.” Born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou June 25, 1963 in London to Greek Cypriot immigrant parents in a flat above a north London laundrette, Michael once played music on the London underground train system before finding fame with Wham!. With a school friend, Andrew Ridgeley, he formed Wham! in 1981, a partnership that would produce some of the most memorable pop songs and dance-floor favorites of the 1980s. “I am in deep shock,” said Elton John. “I have lost a beloved friend - the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans. @GeorgeMichael #RIP.” The duo had their first hit with their second release “Young  Guns (Go For It)” (1982) before their debut release ”Wham Rap” became a hit the following year. The 1984 album “Make It Big” was a huge success in the United States. “No way could I have done it without Andrew,” Michael once said. “I can’t think of anybody who would have been so perfect in allowing something which started out as a very naive, joint ambition, to become what was still a huge double act but what was really...mine.” But Michael was keen to reach beyond Wham!’s teenage audience and to experiment with other genres. Wham! announced their split in 1986. A pilot solo single ”I Want Your Sex” was banned by daytime radio stations but was one of his biggest hits. “I want your sex, I want you, I want your sex,” he sang. “So why don’t you just let me go, I’d really like to try, Oh I’d really love to know, When you tell me you’re gonna regret it, Then I tell you that I love you but you still say no!” In the space of the next five years, Michael had six U.S. Number One hit singles including “Faith”, “Father Figure”, “One More Try”, “Praying For Time” and a duet with Aretha Franklin “I  Knew You Were Waiting For Me”. Questions about his sexuality were raised when he was arrested in 1998 for “engaging in a lewd act” in a public restroom of the Will Rogers Memorial Park in Beverly Hills, California. “I feel stupid and reckless and weak for letting my sexuality be exposed that way,” Michael told CNN at the time. “But I do not feel shame [about my sexuality], neither do I think I should.” “I can try to fathom why I did what I did,” he continued, “but at the end of the day, I have to admit that maybe part of the kick was that I might get found out,” he told CNN. Though he had relationships with women and once told family members that he was bisexual, Michael, then 34, said he was gay. “Rest with the glittering stars, George Michael,” said Star Trek actor and LGBT rights activist George Takei. “You’ve found your Freedom, your Faith. It was your Last Christmas, and we shall miss you.” While Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was in power, Michael voted for Britain’s opposition Labour Party but criticized Tony Blair’s support for George W. Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. “Sad to hear that George Michael has died,” said current Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. “He was an exceptional artist and a strong supporter of LGBT and workers’ rights.” Michael’s death comes at the end of a year that has seen the passing of several music superstars, including David Bowie, Prince and Leonard Cohen. Rick Parfitt, the guitarist of British rock group Status Quo, died on Saturday at 68. ","

(TSLA) CEO Elon Musk does not have much time for interviews and press conferences. Instead he uses Twitter (TWTR) to make major announcements or for conversations and updates. His tweet stream is a mix of humor, information, and a first-hand llook into the issues that occupy one of the world's most famous entrepreneurs and billionaires. He also uses Twitter to engage with fans and critics. There were many from the latter category in an especially volatile year for the company. After all, this was the year that Tesla ventured into mass production of electric cars, completed an acquisition of SolarCity Corp. (SCTY), despite strident opposition, and was showered with public outrage and negative media coverage for the death of a motorist who was using the Autopilot feature in a Tesla car. Through these events, Musk used Twitter to communicate with his severest critics. Here are three examples. In July, Fortune writer Carol Loomis published a post on the magazine’s website charging the electric carmaker with withholding material information from investors during a large stock sale by Musk because it did not disclose the death of a Tesla driver who had used the company's autopilot feature. That set Musk off and he fired back at the magazine. In his tweets, Musk said that one million auto deaths worldwide would have been saved if Tesla’s autopilot feature was universally available. He accused Fortune of writing a “BS” article that increased its advertising revenue. Eventually though, the SEC opened an investigation into the Palo Alto company, which released an updated version of its Autopilot software in September. @alansmurray Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2016 @alansmurray If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about 1M+/year deaths from other auto companies? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2016  In October, Murray Energy CEO Robert E. Murray appeared on CNBC’s Squawk Box and called Tesla “a fraud” who “has gotten $2 billion from taxpayers.” Musk tweeted that the real fraud was denial of climate change and challenged Murray to a situation where both, renewable energy sources and coal, went down to zero subsidy. Real fraud going on is denial of climate science. As for ""subsidies"", Tesla gets pennies on dollar vs coal. How about we both go to zero? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 10, 2016 Right after the U.S. presidential election, when fake news became the topic du jour, Musk used Twitter to poke fun at the content from fake news sites. He has already been at the receiving end of several fake news articles.

Adam Hayes,12292016,Investopedia,12222016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs European investors have moved some $550 Billion (€528.8 billion) out of Europe this year, the largest amount of capital outflows since the Eurozone was created 17 years ago, according to a story in the Wall Street Journal. This comes as investors seek to escape poor returns in Europe in order to buy stocks, bonds and other securities in the United States. Rising U.S. interest rates, differences in economic growth, and other geo-political forces are driving this phenomenon. As a result, the common currency of the EU, the euro, is on track to fall to $1, or parity. (For more, see: Euro-Dollar Parity is Back. ) This year, a record amount of capital outflows have plagued the Eurozone. According to the Journal, ""Eurozone investors bought €497.5 billion ($516.5 billion) of financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, outside the bloc in that period. Global investors, meanwhile, sold or let mature €31.3 billion of eurozone assets during the year. Together, that adds up to a net outflow of €528.8 billion, the most since the single currency was introduced in 1999."" (See also: Why the Euro Failed to Become the World's Reserve Currency.) The outflows have to do with a struggling European economy, plagued by banking crises in Italy (as well as uncertainty that Italy will remain the EU following its recent referendum), Brexit, and persistent troubles from peripheral members such as Greece. At the same time, the United States has enjoyed a recovering economy, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates. Proposed economic policies put forth by President-elect Donald Trump also point to inflation and higher interest rates in the U.S. as well as a stronger dollar due to protectionist measures. (See also: Is Quantitative Easing Destroying The Euro?) As interest rates rise in the U.S. relative to Europe, where rates remain historically low and even negative in some places, investors will seek to purchase dollar-denominated assets in order to receive those higher interest credits. The Euro now trades at around $1.04, approaching parity - where $1 = €1. The euro has declined versus the dollar by around 4.5% this year, and by more than 20% over the past five years. The Euro and the Dollar have not traded at parity since 2002. Many analysts see parity happening some time in 2017, with Deutsche Bank predicting the Euro will buy just $0.95 or less. Economic and geopolitical woes in Europe coupled with a stronger U.S. economy and a Trump presidency on the horizon has caused investors to seek investments outside of the Eurozone and specifically into dollar-denominated assets. The result is that the European currency, the euro, has fallen and is approaching parity with the U.S. dollar for the first time in fourteen years.

(ATVI) shares have taken a beating in recent weeks over concerns that holiday sales of video games will disappoint this season. The stock is down 20% from its 52-week high of $45.55 and has been trading lower throughout most of December. The decline in shares and a lackluster sales forecast for the industry sent lots of shareholders running for the hills, but not everyone is bracing for more bad news in 2017. Take TheStreet.com for starters. From a stock trading perspective, TheStreet.com estimates shares of Activision trade at 19.3 times its 2017 earnings forecast, which is less than Electronic Arts (EA), which TheStreet.com said trades at 25 times next year’s earnings, and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO), which trades at 29.3 times 2017 earnings. What’s more, TheStreet.com pointed out the average 12-month price target for Activision is $48 a share, which means they expect it to climb around 34% from where it’s trading today. It doesn’t hurt that Activision pays out a dividend, although investors aren’t going to get rich off it. The yield is only around 0.7% according to The Street.com, but Activision has raised its dividend in the past. On the business front, namely NPD Intellect’s assessment of November sales, TheStreet.com says that forecast doesn’t take into account digital sales of video games, which are seeing growth even if physical store sales were down in November. What’s more, Activision faced a lot of competition in terms of new game titles from Electronic Arts and others leading up to the holidays. Earlier this month, worries about video game sales reached panic levels after NPD reported physical game sales of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare were down close to 50% in November when compared to last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops III. Meanwhile, Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a research report that ""'Infinite Warfare' units came in 17 percent shy of our expectations, down close to 50 percent [year-over-year]."" Still, Activision isn’t concerned with NPD’s assessment, saying recently that based on year-to-date revenue from physical unit sales Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is the No. 1 console video game in the U.S. The game, which launched on Nov. 4, is also the top-selling console game for the month of November. ""Call of Duty is retail's #1 grossing console franchise in the U.S. for the 8th consecutive year … and Infinite Warfare is the #1 grossing console game of the year at retail in the U.S.,"" said Eric Hirshberg, Activision's CEO in a press release announcing the sales results. ""In addition to our annual blockbuster release, Call of Duty is about engaging fans year around."" (See also: Activision Reacts: Actually, We're No. 1 in Sales.)

(HPQ) has seen its stock rise about 31% year to date (YTD), trading at a price of $15.19 per share Tuesday morning. After the firm’s split from enterprise technology company Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (HPE) in November 2015, both firms have experienced success in refocusing on core businesses and generating solid returns for investors. (See also: HP Inc. Plans to Return Shareholder Value .) HP Inc. reported its latest quarterly earnings at the end of November, pleasing investors with fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that met forecasts, while revenue exceeded consensus estimates. The firm’s 2% year-over-year (YOY) growth in sales was attributed to its gains in the PC market, while the firm’s printing arm declined 8.2%. Despite the printing slump, HP Inc. was successful in slowing the decline down from the 14% YOY decline reported in fiscal Q3. Despite slowdowns in the printing and PC markets, as new smart devices and digital solutions outrun legacy tech, analysts remain bullish on HP Inc.’s prospects for 2017. As for the firm’s hold on the PC market, HP Inc. CEO Dion Weisler says the company looks to capitalize on both gaining its share of traditional PC sales, with the intention of diversifying products to target professionals and upmarket clients, along with building out its PC service, accessories and other secondary PC offerings. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company’s printing arm, which declined to $4.6 billion in sales in the most recent quarter, has suffered due to waning demand for printing business supplies including ink, toner and paper. To tackle this hurdle, management intends on championing a new ink subscription program, calling the tough printer market “the new normal.” The firm’s acquisition of Samsung’s printing arm, worth $1.05 billion, is set to close in 2017 and will try to use copier products to offset printing declines. Further, HP will continue to push into the emerging 3D-printing space, shifting away from consumer prototyping to target industrial clients and enhance manufacturing efficiency.

(See also: Renewable Energy Suffers From Trump Win.) With oil prices hovering around 10-year lows, energy companies in general have found it tough to turn a profit amid ultralow pricing. The market reacted poorly to First Solar’s report in mid November, as management slashed guidance in light of plans to accelerate the production of a more cost-competitive model. The Tempe, Ariz.-based firm said it would phase out its current model Series 4 solar panels, scrap plans for a Series 5 and go ahead with fast-tracking the production of a Series 6. Despite disappointment regarding a $500 million to $700 million cost in impairments, along with a 25% trim of the firm’s employees, many analysts foresee the changes as a necessary step for the solar leader to stay ahead in the market as panel prices decline. A reduction in the price of solar systems, while a great incentive for adoption on the consumer side, is difficult for companies such as First Solar attempting to stay above water with funds to invest in the future. Guggenheim Securities analysts foresee the sale price of S6 modules falling 25%, while the cost of producing them will drop 40% over the same period. This gives First Solar the upper hand as organizations around the world wean off reliance on fossil fuels and other low-cost traditional power sources.

Tim Parker,12292016,Investopedia,12222016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Do you have a hyperactive pet? Maybe one that’s jittery, scared or just a general pain to be around sometimes? The answer, according to some up-and-coming entrepreneurs, is a dog biscuit with just a little cannabis in it. According to the makers, the mellowing effects of a cannabis dog biscuit won't actually make your dog high. The secret ingredient is Cannabidiol or CBD. CBD is one of more than 80 active ingredients in the marijuana plant – marijuana and hemp are basically two strains of the same plant. Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the chemical that causes that happy, all-is-right-with-the-world feeling (along with the munchies), CBD ""does not produce euphoria or intoxication,"" according to 2015 testimony from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. What it does do (for humans, anyway) is help with pain, seizures, anxiety, inflammation and stress, among other medical benefits. Austin and Kat cites this evidence and says it also aids digestion and sleep. An added bonus: It contains Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. According to a New York Times article, Maria Ellis Perez tried cannabis oil on her pet skunk and saw improvement in its eating habits and mood in just a few days. The article also reported good effects on a Rottweiler, a chow-shepherd mix, some pit bulls, several other dogs and a cat. Well, that’s a matter of interpretation. A recent Bloomberg article quoted veterinarian Dr. Gary Richter, a supporter of the treatment, as saying about current research, “A lot of what we're using is extrapolated data from humans, as well as just real world experience on what works.” Austin and Kat’s website acknowledges that research is limited but, “the proof is in the pudding.”  Basically, the argument is that if it works on humans, it’s probably OK for pets. The website gives some weight-based dosage suggestions, but then goes on to say ""missing a dose could interrupt the results"" and that ""it's not possible to overdose,"" (adding that if a pet eats a whole package, a vet should be consulted). That’s another (literally) million-dollar question. Austin and Kat says that it is, but Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spokesman Russell Baer said of the Schedule I controlled substance, “There is widespread illegal distribution of purported CBD products – regardless if they are derived from the marijuana plant or hemp plant.” But until the DEA can get the much larger opioid crisis under control, don’t expect any reality shows popping up covering giant raids of pot-laced dog biscuit factories. According to MJ Freeway, a cannabis industry analytics firm, CBD pet product sales have doubled over the last two years. Other companies making cannibis products for pets include Treatibles and Therabis. We can't tell you what to do if your pet has an issue that might benefit from one of these treatments.

(FIT) may not be doing well, as the entire wearable fitness device market struggles, but rival company Jawbone is apparently doing even worse—so much so that Fitbit withdrew a lawsuit against Jawbone. In a filing late last week, Fitbit said it’s withdrawing the complaint against Jawbone with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in which Fitbit accused Jawbone of infringing on its patents. Fitbit said in the filing it thinks Jawbone is failing from a financial perspective and therefore it doesn’t need to move ahead with its lawsuit. ""It no longer offers for sale any of its wearable activity trackers, nor any of its other products,"" the filing said, according to media reports. ""Press reports and other public documents indicate that the demise of Jawbone's products has created substantial questions regarding Jawbone's ability to continue to operate."" Fitbit went on to say, “Jawbone appears to be a different company. SEC filings of one of its biggest investors now value Jawbone shares as worth nothing, as well as indicate that Jawbone has filed for bankruptcy or is in default.” Had Fitbit been victorious in the complaint, Jawbone would have had to stop importing its wearable devices into the U.S. Jawbone has already stopped selling the devices in questions because of financial woes. In a statement to the media, a Jawbone spokesman said the company thinks the case over the patents should have been dismissed a long time ago and that Fitbit’s “pursuit of these baseless claims for so long was to burden to Jawbone [and] an issue to be raised in Jawbone’s antitrust claim against Fitbit.” Jawbone has not filed for bankruptcy protection. The legal fight between Fitbit and Jawbone started last spring when Jawbone lodged a civil suit against Fitbit, alleging it stole employees and trade secrets. Jawbone also filed a case against Fitbit with the ITC, accusing it of infringing its patent and stealing company secrets. Fitbit fought back with its own claims against Jawbone. In September, Fitbit got a legal victory when the ITC found that a trade court’s ruling invalidating two of Fitbit’s patents was wrong. The ITC sent the lawsuit back to the lower court for further review. In an opinion posted on the ITC’s electronic docket and reported by Bloomberg, it said the judge was wrong to rule the two patents focused on a heart rate monitor and portable monitoring devices weren’t eligible for legal protection. The ITC did uphold the judge’s finding that a third patent was invalid. That paved the way for the suit to prevent Jawbones products from being sold in the U.S. to move forward and Fitbit’s latest action to withdraw it altogether.

(MU) rose more than 12% on Wednesday after-hours trading in light of the chipmaker’s most recent quarterly earnings beat, securing its first revenue growth in about two years. As Micron’s management foresees favorable supply-demand dynamics persisting into 2017, analysts are bound to up their price targets and estimates on the chipmaker. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, indicate that while Micron is positioned to gain from sustained improvement in the DRAM chip market, investors should look to South Korean memory chip producer SK Hynix, reports Barron’s. Hynix rose 3.3% after the Boise, Idaho-based semiconductor manufacturer posted its fiscal first-quarter earnings beat, in which adjusted earnings rose 68% and revenue increase 19% year over year (YOY). However, Hynix lost most of the gains, up about 1.1% as of 9 a.m. Thursday morning due to an announcement that the firm would invest in a new plan south of Seoul to meet the booming demand for NAND memory flash chips. BofA analyst Simon Don-je wrote a bullish note regarding prospects for the South Korean firm above Micron and rivals, Samsung Nanya. “The key catalyst [for Hynix] should be upbeat ASP (average selling price) and consequently margin improvement (back to 2014-15 peaks or higher). We forecast quarterly OP (operating profit) will remain at US$1bn or higher immediately from 4Q16. Samsung’s DRAM supply appears tight to meet demand due to capex​ cut (about 30% for 2016 vs a year ago) and slower migration into 1xnm (20nm still mainstream; multi patterning bottleneck with premature EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] tools). Micron and Nanya also face low growth in chip production. China newcomer, Tsinghua, focuses on NAND (not DRAM), but its progress has been minimal (lack of licensing partnership). Hynix’s 3D NAND also appears successful given profit generation from 36-layer for China smartphone, and 72-layer mass production is expected to be on track (2Q17 start possible),” wrote Don-je. Regarding Micron’s bullish 2017 guidance, the analyst says the investment firm does not doubt projections, yet worries about limited shareholder value creation after aggressive capex, low return and higher debt due to the Inotera acquisition.

 ,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"German police are looking for an asylum-seeker from Tunisia after finding an identity document under the driver's seat of a truck that plowed into a Berlin Christmas market and killed 12 people, officials and security sources said on Wednesday. The federal prosecutor's office offered a reward of up to 100,000 euros ($104,000) for information leading to the capture of the suspect, whom it identified as 24-year-old Anis Amri. ""Beware: He could be violent and armed!"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement, in which it described Amri as 1.78 meters (5'8"") tall, with black hair and brown eyes. German police commandos raided two apartments in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg late on Wednesday but did not find Amri, Die Welt newspaper reported, citing investigators. Amri's father and security sources told Tunisia's Radio Mosaique that he had left Tunisia seven years ago as an illegal immigrant and had spent time in prison in Italy. In Duesseldorf, Ralf Jaeger, interior minister of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), said the Tunisian appeared to have arrived in Germany in July 2015 and his asylum application had been rejected. He seemed to have used different names and had been identified by security agencies as being in contact with an Islamist network. He had mainly lived in Berlin since February, but was recently in NRW, Jaeger added. After being turned down for asylum, the man should have been deported but could not be returned to Tunisia because his documents were missing, he said. ""Tunisia at first denied that this person was its citizen,"" said Jaeger, adding that German authorities started the process of getting new identity papers in August 2016. ""The papers weren't issued for a long time. They arrived today."" A judicial source told Reuters that German authorities had observed Amri over a period this year to try to determine whether he had planned a robbery to fund the purchase of automatic weapons for a possible attack with accomplices. Authorities stopped their monitoring activities because they could not prove their suspicions, the source said. The new details have added to a growing list of questions about whether security forces missed opportunities to prevent the attack, in which a 25-tonne truck mowed down shoppers and smashed through wooden huts selling gifts, mulled wine and sausages in the deadliest attack on German soil since 1980. Christmas markets have been a known potential target for Islamist militants since at least 2000, when authorities thwarted a plot to attack one in Strasbourg, France. And the modus operandi in Berlin was identical to that of a Bastille Day attack in the French city of Nice in July, when a Tunisian-born man rammed a lorry through a seaside crowd and killed 86 people. The market at the scene of Monday's attack, at the foot of the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church, stayed shut on Wednesday, but more than 60 other Christmas markets across the German capital re-opened under tightened security. ""We don't want to let the terrorists win. If everyone stays away, they are winning,"" said tourist Nicki Anning at the Gendarmenmarkt Square in central Berlin. Berlin authorities said 12 people seriously injured in Monday's attack were still being treated in hospital. The pre-Christmas carnage at a symbolic site - under the ruined spire of a church bombed in World War Two - has shocked Germans and prompted security reviews across Europe, already on high alert after attacks this year in Belgium and France. The possible - though unproven - involvement of a migrant or refugee has revived a bitter debate about security and immigration, with Chancellor Angela Merkel facing calls to clamp down after allowing more than a million newcomers into Germany in the past two years. Merkel, who will run for a fourth term next year, has said it would be particularly repugnant if a refugee seeking protection in Germany was the perpetrator. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the Berlin attack on Wednesday, blaming ""Islamist terrorists (who) continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad"". ""It's an attack on humanity and it's gotta be stopped,"" he told reporters in Palm Beach, Florida. Police initially arrested a Pakistani asylum-seeker near the scene, but released him without charge on Tuesday. The Polish driver of the hijacked truck was found shot dead in the cabin of the vehicle. Bild newspaper said he had been alive until the attack took place. It also quoted an investigator as saying there must have been a struggle with the attacker, who may have been injured. Islamic State has claimed responsibility, as it did for the Nice attack. The Passauer Neue Presse newspaper quoted the head of the group of interior ministers from Germany's 16 federal states, Klaus Bouillon, as saying tougher security measures were needed. ""We want to raise the police presence and strengthen the protection of Christmas markets. We will have more patrols. Officers will have machine guns. We want to make access to markets more difficult, with vehicles parked across them,"" Bouillon told the paper. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann told German radio there was a higher risk of Islamist attacks because of the influx of migrants in the past two years, many of whom have fled conflicts in countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The task of tracking the suspects and the movements of the truck may be complicated by the relative scarcity of security cameras in public places in Germany, compared with countries such as Britain. The German cabinet on Wednesday approved a draft law to broaden video surveillance in public and commercial areas, a measure agreed by political parties last month after violent attacks and sexual assaults on women. State surveillance is a sensitive issue in Germany because of extensive snooping by the Stasi secret police in Communist East Germany and by the Gestapo in the Nazi era.

Sarah Whitten,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"What's ""Star Wars"" without Princess Leia? Disney will have to sort that out. While fans and the cast and crew of the beloved films mourn the death Carrie Fisher, questions have arisen about how the actress' passing will affect the sci-fi franchise going forward. Fisher completed filming the yet unnamed ""Star Wars: Episode VIII"" back in July, taking on a larger role than that of her cameo appearance in ""The Force Awakens,"" according to Deadline. However, Disney and LucasFilm have not commented on how Fisher's death will affect the completion of ""Episode VIII"" or impact the script and filming of ""Episode IX."" ""The fact that we are talking about this shows how woven into the DNA of 'Star Wars' Carrie Fisher is,"" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore, told CNBC. ""This is no small thing."" With limited information about General Leia's story arc in the forthcoming films, fans and analysts can only speculate about how Disney will handle the loss of the iconic actress and character. Following the death of Paul Walker, a key player in the ""Fast and Furious"" films, writer Chris Morgan was tasked with rewriting the script of ""Furious 7"" to allow Walker's character to exit the series using footage that had already been shot during production. Morgan rejiggered the script to account for Walker's absence and the production team used a combination of CGI and Walker's younger brothers as stand-ins to get the shots they needed to complete the film. A similar fate could await future ""Star Wars"" films. While Fisher had finished her scenes for ""Episode VIII,"" Disney could decide to alter the script to explain Leia's absence in future films. The film is slated to hit theaters in Dec. 2017. Lionsgate, following the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman in 2014, opted to diminish the actor's role in the final installment of the ""Hunger Games"" franchise instead of digitally recreating the actor for the scenes he had yet to film. The writers used the footage they had of Hoffman to complete several scenes and gave some of his character's dialogue and actions to other characters. It is unclear how integral the character of Leia is for ""Episode IX"" and if more script alterations will be necessary before its release in 2019. Disney has already planned to release a standalone Han Solo film in 2018, which will give the production team time to make major alterations to the final film in the new trilogy, if that is the direction they decide to head in. Audiences were treated to a familiar face while watching ""Rogue One"" in theaters this December. Instead of recasting the role of Grand Moff Tarkin, a character portrayed by the late Peter Cushing in the original trilogy, Director Gareth Edwards and the team at Industrial Light and Magic recreated him digitally. Guy Henry, a British actor, was hired to preform the role of Tarkin during filming and was digitally altered in post-production to appear as Cushing. This technique has raised some questions about the legal and ethical ramifications of portraying a deceased actor's likeness on film, but has set a precedent that could mean Fisher's Leia can still appear in ""Episode IX"" without altering the script. Of course, Disney would likely have to receive permission from Fisher's estate to proceed with the digital replication, but since the production company holds copyright to her performance in ""The Force Awakens"" they may not have to. ""It's a somewhat novel area of law where, as a matter of best practice, they might seek out rights from the estate,"" Paul O'Brien, an associate attorney with Falcon, Jacobson & Gertler LLP, a New York law firm, told CNBC. ""But if they had an agreement previously in place that allows them to create derivative works based on Carrie's prior performances they could be covered by that."" Disney was not immediately available for comment about this matter. ""Based on the divisive way that fans have reacted to the effects in 'Rogue One' and considering that her death will still be pretty fresh, I think they won't go the CGI route,"" Erik Davis, managing editor of Fandango, told CNBC. ""Unless, it's to touch up a tiny bit, a fraction of a scene. Sort of the way 'Fast and Furious' did it with Paul Walker. I think that that would be the only case that they would use effects."" If the production company decides to keep Fisher's performance in ""Episode VIII"" and make significant changes to the script for ""Episode IX,"" fans could see Leia's absence explained in the opening crawl of the final film. Disney could choose to kill the iconic character off screen or concoct a reason that Leia does not appear at the forefront of the narrative. ""If they want to keep 'Episode VIII' intact, if they are happy with the way it came out and they don't want to touch it, then yes, I think explaining where she is in the opening crawl in ""Episode IX"" makes sense,"" said Fandango's Davis. ""However, it's Princess Leia, actually it's General Leia, I don't think you can really explain either the character's death or the character's disappearance from the franchise with words. I think you need to do something inside the story."" Davis expects that Disney will look to the Lucasfilm Story Group, a division of Lucasfilm responsible for determining all ""Star Wars"" canon, as well as ""The Force Awakens"" director J.J. Abrams, ""Episode VIII"" director Rian Johnson and ""Episode IX"" director Colin Trevorrow to determine the best possible route for the both forwarding the franchise and honoring Fisher. ""You have the creative talent behind the 'Star Wars' movies that will deal with this in a very respectful and appropriate way,"" comScore's Dergarabedian said. ""Somehow you will have to address it and be respectful to Carrie Fisher's family, the fans and 'Star Wars,' in that order."" ",The future of 'Star Wars' without Princess Leia

Anita Balakrishnan,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"The 2016 U.S. election was not the first to be the object of ""malicious cyber activity,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement Thursday. Obama said that the White House will issue a report to Congress ""in the coming days"" that will reveal ""Russia's efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections."" The report will come on the heels of Thursday's new sanctions against Russia and related U.S.-based entities. The White House also expelled 35 Russian diplomats and closed two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland in response to what it called harassment of American diplomats in Moscow. The intelligence community, including the FBI, CIA and some other intelligence officials, have all pinpointed Russian hackers as a source of interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. WikiLeaks revealed more than 19,000 pages of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee earlier this year, uncovering damaging messages, including exchanges where officials appeared to actively favor Hillary Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders. The ensuing backlash ultimately prompted the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. ""These data theft and disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian government,"" Obama said in a statement. It's still unclear what malicious cyber activity was related to previous elections, and whether Russia was also involved in that activity. But a joint analysis report from the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said that the 2016 election activity was part of a decadelong campaign targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks, universities, political organizations and corporations. The report released on Thursday details two separate Russian groups that intruded on a U.S. political party, one in summer 2015, and a second in spring 2016. Both groups use targeted ""phishing"" emails and camouflaged their tracks, Thursday's report said. A third attack, likely tied to Russia, was launched in November, just days after the 2016 election, the report said. The president also called on the global technology community to help identify Russian cyberactors, and released technical information about Russian civilian and military intelligence cyber activity. Earlier this year, a study from cybersecurity firm Carbon Black found that more than 1 in 5 registered U.S. voters may have considered staying home on Election Day because of fears about cybersecurity and vote tampering, though its unclear if anything of that nature occurred as part of the Russia-based malicious campaigns. Foreign-based hacking is likely to get worse over time, as it is an increasingly a quick way to improve a nation's economy, said George Kurtz, co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which released some of the first research tying Russian intelligence sources to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. ""When we think about the overall environment, it's just too easy to create malware that's not detected by the current generation of anti-virus products,"" Kurtz told CNBC this week, before news of the sanctions. ""That's the reason that we're seeing a lot of these attacks. ... It's so easy to do, it's very little cost and very little opportunity to actually get caught.""

Foreign policy experts suggest that a ""grand bargain"" could be negotiated between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could address the global terror war and resolution of the Syrian conflict. Yet any potential agreement comes amid high tensions between the two countries, as President Barack Obama announced retribution on Russia in response to alleged U.S. election tampering. Putin has publicly dismissed U.S. intelligence claims of political hacking, which were widely seen as a way to undermine the U.S. government.

Russia's economy has been under stress due to low oil prices and Western economic sanctions stemming from Russian hostilities in eastern Ukraine and the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Russia's military campaign to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad — which is at odds with U.S. interests — has also had an economic cost, as well as military casualties on the Russian side. ""Putin looked at his economy and said, 'You know what, I just cannot afford to continue to spend the kind of money that I am on the military and foreign adventures,'"" said Edward Turzanski, an international policy and national security expert with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think tank in Philadelphia. A moderate recovery in oil prices may help Russia in 2017, but foreign policy analysts suggest there are still reasons for Russians to improve ties — namely, the fight against global terrorism and the war against the Islamic State, commonly known as ISIS or ISIL. ""Putin has a problem with Islamic extremists and so does the United States,"" said Turzanski, who worked in the U.S. intelligence community during the Reagan administration. The Russian envoy to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, was killed Dec. 19 in an attack in Ankara that Trump blamed on a ""radical Islamic terrorist."" The ambassador's assassin shouted, ""Do not forget Aleppo,"" a reference to Syria's second-largest city, and the site of a bloody and lengthy campaign by the Syrian government and its Russian ally to oust rebels armed by powers including the U.S. and Gulf states. ""The battle for Aleppo is over,"" said USC's English. ""We're not going to get what we wanted [in Syria], which was Bashar al-Assad removed. But there is a deal out there for a managed transition where we work with Russia instead of against Russia. And maybe then we can tackle some of the other problems."" A leaked Pentagon memo dated Dec. 1 from Trump's defense transition team was obtained by the publication Foreign Policy and revealed a top priority of the president-elect is to ""develop a strategy to defeat/destroy ISIS."" On the whole, Turzanski said Trump probably views more cooperation in the terror fight as ""a good starting point"" to begin to improve the U.S.-Russia relationship. For Putin, working together with the new U.S. administration on priorities such as global terrorism and Islamist fundamentalists ""won't put him in a position where it's going to cost him a lot."" One person likely to be critical in any negotiation is ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for U.S. secretary of state and a longtime friend of Putin. Tillerson is known to have negotiated commercial deals with world leaders, and if confirmed by the Senate, will be asked to put his skills to use as America's top diplomat. Others are not so certain the Russians want to take on ISIS, which now poses threats beyond the Middle East with members or its terrorist sympathizers. ""In reality, my view is that the Russians aren't all that interested in defeating ISIL,"" said Eugene Rumer, director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Russia and Eurasia program in Washington. ""It's not as much of a priority to them as it is to us and our European allies."" Rumer, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said the priority for Moscow has been keeping the Assad government in power. Recent ceasefires with opposition forces fighting Assad could form the basis of an eventual political solution for Syria. The civil war in Syria has contributed to a refugee crisis and claimed at least 400,000 lives, according to the United Nations. ""You hear a lot of talk about a 'grand bargain' —  a comprehensive deal,"" Rumer said. ""Now that they've achieved a breakthrough in Syria, they will offer something in exchange there. They will not give up Assad and they … will maintain a military and naval facility in Syria."" It's unclear how any deal with the Russians over Syria might look in a Trump administration, but experts suggest it could involve a higher level of cooperation in fighting global terrorism. Also, they suggest Putin may be motivated to give ""an election present"" to Trump to score points for future issues. At the same time, better ties with Putin might help the new U.S. administration offset Chinese ambitions, which include the Beijing government's island buildup in the South China Sea and other military and economic actions. China's defense budget — already second to the U.S. in terms of annual spending —  is on track to almost double in the 2010 to 2020 period and overtake the entire Western European regional defense expenditures, according to the annual Jane's Defence Budgets Report released this month by IHS Markit. Meanwhile, it predicts Russia's defense spending will decline this year for the first time since the late 1990s. Some analysts argue that the history of personal animosity between Obama and Putin probably doomed the chances of a thaw in icy relations between the U.S. and the Kremlin. They also say any deal Trump gets that might ease economic sanctions on Russia will still face opposition from Russian hawks in the Senate. Then again, there are international policy experts skeptical Trump can turn things quickly with Moscow. The Iran deal made by the Obama administration, which included lifting international oil and economic sanctions against Tehran, was criticized by Trump during his campaign. Rescinding the nuclear deal could raise alarm in Russia and would also impact other countries that are part of the agreement. ""If the Trump administration attempts to reset with Russia, it will be the fourth administration in a row to try such a reset at the start,"" said Christopher Chivvis, associate director of the RAND's International Security and Defense Policy Center. Chivvis, who worked as a Eurasian security policy officer in the Office of the Secretary of Defense during the first term of the Obama administration, added: ""Trump can try it too. But the reality at least in my analysis is that the U.S. and Russian interests are not aligned on most issues."" ",Trump could reset Russia ties in 'grand bargain' with Putin

Reuters with CNBC,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"President-elect Donald Trump criticized the United Nations Monday evening on Twitter. Donald Trump tweet: The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad! Although the impetus for the president-elect's message was not immediately clear, it comes after a Friday resolution by the U.N. Security Council calling for a halt to Israeli settlement-building. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been unrelenting in his criticism of the Obama administration over what he condemned as its ""shameful"" decision not to veto the U.N. vote. But with the clock ticking down on Barack Obama's presidency, a possibly more amenable Trump due to succeed him on Jan. 20 and a $38 billion U.S. military aid package to Israel a done deal, it's all a calculated risk for the four-term, right-wing Israeli prime minister. Netanyahu, after what critics are calling a stinging defeat on the international stage, is already maneuvering to mine deep-seated feelings among many Israelis that their country and its policies towards the Palestinians are overly criticized in a world where deadlier conflicts rage. He has tried to rally Israelis around him by portraying the anti-settlement resolution as a challenge to Israel's claimed sovereignty over all of Jerusalem. Trump has promised to reverse decades of U.S. policy by moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Speaking on MSNBC on Monday, Israel's ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, accused the Obama administration of orchestrating Friday's U.N. vote behind the scenes, despite U.S. denials. The diplomatic drama unfolded over the Christmas holiday, with twists and turns unusual even for the serpentine path followed by Netanyahu's relationship with a Democratic president who opposes settlement building. On Thursday, Netanyahu successfully lobbied Egypt, which proposed the draft resolution, to withdraw it — enlisting the help of President-elect Trump to persuade Cairo to drop the bid. But the Israeli leader was ultimately outmaneuvered at the United Nations, where New Zealand, Venezuela, Senegal and Malaysia, resubmitted the proposal a day later. It passed 14-0, with an abstention from the United States, withholding Washington's traditional use of its veto to protect Israel at the world body in what was widely seen as a parting shot by Obama against Netanyahu and his settlement policy.

While Santa Claus may not be real, the Santa rally is a real enough phenomenon. The term refers to the idea that the stock market tends to rise during the period just before Christmas through the end of the year. In its length, the phenomenon is actually closer to Hanukkah, with the rally period being the last five trading days of the calendar year and the first two trading days after New Year's Day. Unlike the mythical jolly fat man who sneaks into people's homes to bring them Christmas presents, the Santa rally is not an every-year phenomenon. It's statistically what usually happens -- ""since 1969 the Santa Claus rally has yielded positive returns in 34 of the past 45 holiday seasons,"" according to the 2016 Stock Trader's Almanac -- but ""usually"" does not mean ""always"" and 2016 could be an exception. Santa generally brings presents for investors, but not always. Image source: The Motley Fool. As the story goes, at least the version of the Santa Claus fable told in the United States, children who have been good receive presents and naughty kids get nothing. A Santa rally occurs nearly 80% of the time, but it's generally a meaningful, albeit small, boost. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac the gains for the seven-day Santa rally period come out to an average of 1.7% using data going back to 1896. Last year there was no Santa rally as the Dow opened on Dec. 24 at 17,593.26 and closed lower after the traditional seven-trading-day rally period, at 17,158.66. That capped an overall down December and showed that, just because markets usually do something, does not mean they always will. Santa may also stay home this year -- not because of any sort of misbehavior, but because the market has been riding high after the 2016 presidential election. As of market close on Dec. 20, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:$INDU) has already risen to 19,974.62 from 18,317.26 on Nov. 9, the day after the election. That's a 9% gain, which already well outpaces the traditional gains of a Santa rally. That suggests that with the Dow already trading at record or near-record highs throughout December, the rally may have already occurred. Santa may stay home this year, as he did last year, because the optimism that usually pushes stocks higher as the year ends has already been priced into the market by people enthusiastic about the economic impact of the new government. Image source: YCharts.com. If there's anything we've learned from the short period since Trump went from reality show host to president-elect, it's that the man, his actions, and the impact of his actions are hard to predict. Many expected the election of a candidate with no political track record to send markets down -- if only due to uncertainty. Instead, the idea that a businessman would be in the White House and the fact that Trump has named numerous Wall Street players and other rich folks to his Cabinet have pushed forward a large rise in prices. It's reasonable to think that at some point the excitement will cool off, but past history or logic may not apply until the new president shows how he will make decisions. Since the election, the market has been in one long rally. That might dim the effect of the post-Christmas period, but the fundamental optimism that Trump will ease regulation and create a better climate for business is not likely to fade until he actually takes office. For now, the markets are being driven by an orange-tinged Santa whose impact remains theoretical. It seems likely that the rally will continue at least through Inauguration Day, perhaps with some down days due to profit-taking. ","

Matthew DiLallo,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The past two years have been brutally tough on the oil industry. Persistently weak oil prices and increasing uncertainty caused approximately 100 oil and gas producers to declare bankruptcy since the onset of the downturn. Meanwhile, most other producers cut costs to the bare bones, causing their output to drop. However, prices seemed to bottom out in early 2016 and should be much more stable in 2017 as a result of two OPEC agreements to rebalance the market. That intervention, combined with falling costs and efficiency gains, means 2017 could be one of the best years to invest in oil stocks in quite some time. Image source: Getty Images. At the end of November, OPEC members agreed to end their battle for market share and instead refocus their attention on supporting oil prices by agreeing to cut their combined output by 1.2 million barrels per day. A couple of weeks later, OPEC announced an agreement with 11 non-member nations who pledged to join it by reducing their production by 558,000 barrels per day for the next six months. The aim of these reductions is to start eliminating the glut of oil that has built up over the past two years due to persistent oversupply. If everything goes according to plan, these actions could drain 46% of the estimated 300 million barrel excess stockpile over the next six months. That would result in a more balanced oil market going forward, which could stabilize oil prices much higher. While many market watchers have their doubts that OPEC will implement these agreements to the full extent, even partial compliance should help reduce the supply overhang quicker than relying on the natural decline of production due to underinvestment. That said, after two years of underinvestment, the market has gotten much closer to rebalancing on its own. According to data from oil-field service company Core Labs (NYSE:CLB), production in the U.S. has already fallen by 1.3 million barrels per day since peaking in March 2015. That decline, when combined with similar natural declines elsewhere, has global production on pace to slump 3.3% in 2016. Meanwhile, demand continues to march higher, which should lead to a much tighter oil market in 2017 even without OPEC. In fact, that outlook had Core Labs anticipating that a V-shaped recovery in the oil market was on the horizon well before OPEC stepped in to support prices. Unless oil demand falls off a cliff, market fundamentals should be much better in 2017 than they were for most of the past year. This improvement alone should lift a weight that had been holding down oil stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Before the downturn, many oil companies relied on triple-digit oil prices to fuel their businesses. However, with those prices a distant memory, producers worked hard to get their costs down to run at much lower prices. Those efforts are about to pay off, with many oil companies recently announcing that they have reached a turning point in their repositioning efforts, and are now in the position to thrive at lower prices. This transformation has been nothing short of remarkable and is a major catalyst for oil stocks in 2017. Leading U.S. independent oil company ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), for example, has reduced its breakeven point from more than $75 per barrel to less than $50 per barrel in just the past couple of years. The company had to make several tough decisions to get to that level, including slashing the dividend and exiting its deepwater exploration program. However, ConocoPhillips can flourish at $50 oil going forward because it can generate enough cash flow to grow the dividend, pay down debt, buy back stock, and boost output by up to 2% per year. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips has built in tremendous flexibility into its operations so that as oil prices go up, so does the company's ability to grow production and increase shareholder distributions. Shale-focused producers, likewise, have experienced a dramatic transformation over the past few years. For example, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) both stopped growing in 2016 to focus their attention on reducing costs by capturing drilling efficiencies, optimizing well completions, and high grading their portfolios. Those efforts are ready to bear fruit, which has both companies positioned to start growing again in 2017 at much lower prices. Concho Resources, for example, can now increase its oil production by a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2019 while living within projected cash flows at current oil prices. Meanwhile, if oil prices rise, Concho Resources has an abundance of high-return drilling locations to capture those higher prices. Devon Energy, meanwhile, believes its cash flow will more than double in 2017 to $2.5 billion if oil and gas average $55 and $3, respectively. That is enough cash flow to enable Devon to deliver double-digit U.S. oil production growth next year. Meanwhile, at $60 oil and $3.25 gas, Devon's cash flow could jump 200% to roughly $3.5 billion, which would enable the company to grow even faster. Thanks to falling supplies, the oil market could quickly rebalance in 2017, which should stabilize prices, if not push them much higher. Meanwhile, dramatic cost reductions have oil producers positioned to grow at much lower prices going forward. Because of this combination, 2017 could be an excellent year for oil stocks. ","

Smart home devices got a lot of hype in 2016, from in-home assistants like the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo to connected and automated toilet seats. While most of these smart home devices range from under $100 to a few hundred, the Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) ""Family Hub"" refrigerator, clocking in at a cool $5,999 on the high-end model, takes the prize as the most expensive smart home device of the year. Here's what that hefty price tag will get you, and why 2016 looks like just the beginning of a connected home revolution. The Samsung ""family hub"" refrigerator. Image source: Samsung. The Samsung ""family hub"" refrigerator is not your typical ice box. The 21-inch touchscreen on the outside of the door connects to your home's wifi, and comes preloaded with various apps and features to connect to a user's smartphone. Cameras inside of the refrigerator allow the users to see what's in the refrigerator when they are not home -- like when they're at the store trying to remember what to buy. Other features include the ability to play music or watch TV, a nice perk to have in the kitchen while cooking, as well as apps that will leave notes for other users, order groceries for you and have them delivered to your home, set reminders and alarms, set expiration reminders for specific food items, and even take a picture every time the refrigerator door is closed to help track food more precisely. Does a typical family need a smart refrigerator that allows them to check on the contents of their ice box via connected cameras when they aren't home? Probably not, especially not for $6,000, which is nearly 10% of the average U.S. household annual income. Still, this is an extreme example of a trend that is clearly gaining a lot of traction right now -- the smart home market that takes the ""internet of things"" (IoT) approach to make everyday devices part of a connected home. Amazon's Echo smart home assistant and speaker was one of the early concepts of a smart home device that is voice-controlled and can do tasks like turn connected lights and switches on and off, read the morning news, or order an Uber. Google Home, a similar device from Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), and a coming device from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that uses Microsoft's Cortana voice assistant software are seeking to put voice recognition and artificial intelligence technology at the center of a connected home. Amazon Echo uses ""skills"" for third party developers to create apps on its smart home device. Image source: Amazon. While the use cases are still relatively limited for these smart home assistant devices, mostly just basic commands and information requests at this point, all of these devices are ""learning"", which means they can get updates from their parent companies and evolve. That and a plethora of new devices that are able to connect to the ecosystem, such as refrigerators, are helping this market to grow quickly. Looking at how much this market has grown in 2016 -- both from the hardware side, with more and more gadgets able to connect, as well as from the software side, with companies like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft working on artificial intelligence -- it seems like that growth will only continue further in 2017. While each new IoT device looks interesting, it's the platform angle of this market to watch to see which company will win the smart home industry. Image source: Windows 10 IoT / Microsoft Android Things is a dedicated IoT operating system (OS). Alphabet is going aggressively after the ecosystem angle, using Android Things as a base for developers to create apps and programs that connect various smart home devices on Alphabet's platform. Microsoft, meanwhile, is trying to make Windows 10 compatible as an IoT OS platform, and while Amazon doesn't have its own OS, it has AWS (Amazon Web Services) bundles that can connect IoT devices together and allow developers a space to create. Largely absent from the connected hardware side is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the earliest artificial intelligence voice recognition makers with Siri, though of course Apple still has the most important hardware at the moment -- the iPhone is still one of the most important connected device hubs. Apple's HomeKit IoT platform earns it a place among the platform developers already, but you can probably count on new announcements from the cash-heavy business about their own play for this market in the coming months. The IoT market is growing. McKinsey research analysts expect the IoT market to grow more than 30% year over year through 2020. However, investing in this trend might not be as easy as just throwing a dart at a connected wall -- here's a concise 5 point checklist for investing in IoT to find which business has the best chance of succeeding in the years ahead.

Image source: Tony Webster. Republished under CC BY 2.0. Tangible net worth (or ""tangible book value"") is an accounting measure of a company's equity value that excludes certain intangible items, such as goodwill. As such, it is a more conservative measure than book value. As I write this, however, Deutsche's NYSE-listed ADRs remain priced just above the low set during the worst of the financial crisis in Jan. 2009 ($18.66). The question then remains: Is Deutsche Bank a buy? My answer, for individual investors, is a categorical ""no"" and I think a single table is enough to show why. In a nod to Thiam's initial quote, you'll find below Deutsche Bank's return on common equity and return on assets for the period 2008 through 2015: 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Return on common equity (10.7%) 2.7% 1.2% 0.5% 8.1% 5.4% 14.8% (11.3%) Data source: Bloomberg. Granted, this period contains the worst of the financial crisis, but we recently marked the eighth anniversary of Lehman Brother's bankruptcy and Deutsche has produced but a single calendar year in which it has earned its cost of equity -- and that was back in 2009. Analysts typically use 10% as a benchmark for a large bank's cost of equity. They won't achieve that this year either, in case you were wondering. Sure, banks have had to operate in a highly adverse environment through and since the financial crisis, but from their Jan. 20, 2009, low, Deutsche Bank's shares have been left in the dust by their global peers: (That statement remains true even if we assume there is a problem. YCharts' data for Deutsche Bank -- Bloomberg has the U.S.-listed shares roughly flat over this period.) The margin of underperformance is even greater if one were to stack up Deutsche's stock against that of the two U.S. investment banks against which it competes, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. By that standard, and from the standpoint of an individual investor, Deutsche Bank's shares cannot be considered anything other than speculative: How can one expect to earn an ""adequate return"" on a stock investment when the underlying business appears incapable of doing so on behalf of common stockholders? At the same conference at which he dubbed European banks un-investable, Thiam went on to say that ""Deutsche Bank is an old institution, a great institution and I really wish them well, I hope that they come out of their current predicament."" I agree (well, on the ""old"" part, at any rate), but wishing is no basis for an investment. ","

Crude crashed all the way into the mid-$20s in early February before rallying past $50 per barrel by the end of the year thanks to improving market fundamentals. That recovery could continue in 2017 thanks to OPEC's decision to support prices by trimming production. However, investors should not expect a smooth ride given that there are plenty of things that could cause quite a bit of volatility in 2017. Analysts have a fairly wide range of opinions when it comes to where oil prices will head next year. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects the U.S. oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), to average $50.66 per barrel next year and the global benchmark, Brent, to average $51.66. Driving that outlook is the expectation that U.S. oil production will only be modestly lower next year at 8.8 million barrels per day versus an average of 8.9 million barrels per day in 2016, which isn't enough of a decline to make much of an impact on the market. However, what's noteworthy about those prices is that they are below the market prices of around $52 and $55, for WTI and Brent, respectively, as of the middle of December, which suggests that the EIA sees the potential for weaker oil prices over the next year. Image source: Getty Images. Other analysts are much more bullish. Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, for example, sees crude jumping 46% by next June, hitting $69 per barrel. Fueling that outlook is the fact oil and gas investments are down $300 billion, or 41%, since peaking in 2014, which should lead to shrinking supplies. Further, the bank's analysts see the persistently lower prices over the past several years driving healthy demand growth. These two factors could lead to the biggest gap between supply and demand in five years, which could push crude prices higher. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs seems to be taking the middle ground. It recently increased its oil price forecast by predicting that WTI crude will rise to $57.50 per barrel by the second quarter, before settling around $55 per barrel in the second half of the year. Analysts at the World Bank, likewise, have a $55 oil price forecast for 2017 due to OPEC's moves to cut output and rebalance the oil market. Overall, the consensus seems to be that crude will remain in the mid-$50s in 2017. Incidentally, that is similar to what analysts had forecast for oil prices in 2016. Given recent history, the odds of a quiet crude market next year appear slim. Image source: Getty Images. One reason analysts have such differing outlooks on crude prices is the uncertainty regarding OPEC's agreements to stabilize the oil market. At the end of November, OPEC members agreed to cut their total output by 1.2 million barrels per day next year, and non-member nations followed two weeks later by agreeing to curtail their production by 558,000 barrels per day for the first six months of the year. That said, the market does not believe OPEC will follow through on those cuts, despite Saudi Arabia's pledge to reduce its output deeper than required. Further, Russia is responsible for half of the non-member output reduction commitment, which could become problematic because its government might not be able to force oil companies to cut production. Meanwhile, even assuming full compliance, producers could quickly ramp back up as soon as the agreement expires in July, swamping the market with oil. Meanwhile, rising oil prices could incentivize shale producers to ramp up output. EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) is one of several oil companies that can rapidly boost production as prices head higher. For example, at $50 crude, EOG Resources can increase its oil production by 15% per year, with that rate accelerating to 25% annually at $60 crude. Further, EOG Resources continues to refine its craft through technical innovations and efficiency gains, which could enable it to grow faster than those estimates. In fact, the company recently raised its growth outlook to those rates just one quarter after initially projecting 10% to 20% growth at $50 and $60 crude, respectively. Likewise, other shale-focused producers have the low-cost drilling inventory and the balance sheet strength to ramp up production fairly rapidly when prices rise. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), for example, currently plans to slowly ramp up drilling activities next year, going from 10 rigs at the end of this year to between 15 to 20 rigs by the end of next year, which should deliver double-digit oil growth. That said, Devon Energy has a cash-rich balance sheet and plenty of lucrative drilling opportunities to accelerate growth in 2017 should crude run into the $60s. The problem with these scenarios is that if too many producers ramp up next year, it could lead to a torrent of crude hitting the market in the second half, which could push prices right back down. Image source: Getty Images. While there are plenty of conditions that could keep a lid on crude prices next year, there is also an abundance of potential catalysts that could drive crude well above analysts' estimates. For example, OPEC's deals could have their desired effect, shale producers might remain cautious, or demand could come in higher than expected. In addition to that, there is always the potential for an unexpected catalyst that could send crude prices soaring. Last year, for example, unexpected production stoppages in Canada (due to wildfires) and in Nigeria (due to militia attacks) temporarily cut into global oil output, helping fuel a torrid run in the oil market. Similar unexpected outages could cause an explosive run in crude, especially if they come early in the year while OPEC is curbing the market's supply. Anything from a terrorist attack on a major oil hub to a natural disaster could cause a significant supply disruption and catapult oil prices. For the most part, analysts see a relatively calm oil market next year, with crude prices rising through the first half before mellowing out in the second. While that is possible, it does not seem very likely to me. Instead, crude prices could bounce around quite a bit as the market ebbs between fear and euphoria fueled by rumors and changing fundamentals. Because of that, an investor's best bet is to stick with top-tier oil stocks that have the capability to adjust as market conditions evolve. ","

It's easy for investors to become completely consumed by a company's financials, and that's obviously an important aspect of investing. But wise investors also pay a lot of attention to the products their companies make, because a product mistake or failure could send a promising company's stock crashing to the ground. That's why reading through Consumer Reports' Annual Owner Satisfaction Survey can be really important for auto investors: It tells us how CR subscribers feel about the cars they bought. I'd much rather own a financially healthy stock that produces vehicles consumers would buy again, than not. Lincoln's rebound isn't limited to sales as its consumer satisfaction jumped this year. Image source: Ford Motor Company. CR's rankings emphasize owner sentiment across a brand's entire portfolio of vehicles and model satisfaction is determined by the percentage of subscribers that would ""definitely"" buy the vehicle again. Also, in order to qualify, a brand must have at least two models with data and the survey focused on 2014-2017 model years. Without further ado, here are the results and some takeaways. Information source: Consumer Reports' Ownership Satisfaction Survey. Chart by author. Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is obviously a huge winner here as the only brand scoring in the 90 percentile range, and well ahead of the next closest brand, Porsche, and that's even more impressive considering the latter was the only brand scoring in the 80 percentile range. But Tesla's victory here is even more important considering the battering it's taken over the past year in regards to production issues. The Model X's wing doors caused consumer frustration, and occasional issues of doors not aligning properly aren't typical complaints for a car that can cost well into the $100,000 range. The fact that so many Tesla consumers would purchase again despite the production complaints is a huge win, and that's amplified by the fact that it's more affordable Model 3 will be launching at the end of 2017. Ford Motor Company's (NYSE:F) luxury Lincoln brand made an impressive jump for the second-largest Detroit automaker. Lincoln jumped from its 21st ranking in the prior CR survey, up to 12th this year. That moved Lincoln ahead of some notable luxury brands such as Cadillac, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. Remember, Lincoln was the only brand that Ford didn't sell off amid its business crisis in 2006, and the following financial crisis. It's poured much capital into reviving the luxury brand and it's now on pace for its third consecutive year of sales gains, something it hasn't accomplished in at least 16 years. This is a great sign for Ford investors as luxury sales are high margin business, and increasing luxury sales at a time when new-vehicle sales are peaking would be very beneficial for the automaker. If more consumers are happy with the product, and would purchase again as this survey indicates, this suggests Lincoln's newest products are improved and that should enable the brand's rebound to continue. Ultimately, these types of surveys are more important to investors than many realize. The automotive business is insanely competitive, and it's very costly to ""conquer"" consumers, which is luring them from a competing brand to your own. If you have a high percentage of consumers remaining loyal to your brand, it's simply good business. These surveys can also give a glimpse of a company that might not be producing vehicles up to standards, and that could lead to sales troubles in the near-term. Take Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for example, which had four of its five brands place 17th or lower. Wise investors should use these surveys to their advantage, and consider them while making investing decisions. ","

Trump has vaguely offered Apple incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back, and while Apple and Foxconn are considering the idea, there are many hurdles that are arguably impossible to overcome. If anything, the company would likely rather kill U.S. manufacturing if it could, including its last vestige of domestic assembly, the Mac Pro. A couple of recent reports further underscore why Apple would be unable to bring iPhone production stateside, at least in any meaningful way beyond small political gestures (like the Mac Pro was, which is already a financial and operational headache for the company). iPhones aren't the only Apple products assembled in China. Image source: Apple. A map of Apple's suppliers by geography. All those Asian suppliers aren't moving halfway across the world. Image source: Apple. For these smaller companies, the prospect of expanding in the U.S. would be prohibitively expensive due to higher labor costs, operating costs, and regulatory costs given the U.S.'s more stringent environmental regulations. There are also concerns around the demographics of the labor pool, with Chinese workers typically being younger than their U.S. counterparts. One of the key benefits of assembling in China is the close proximity to suppliers, which dramatically simplifies operations and reduces logistics costs. It also allows for flexibility to tweak and adapt manufacturing processes as challenges arise. So don't expect Apple to start bringing those jobs back en masse. Sorry, Trump. ","

Image source: Getty Images Shares of CVR Refining (NYSE:CVRR) and its parent company CVR Energy (NYSE:CVI) jumped by double-digit percentages on Thursday afternoon: CVRR Price data by YCharts Fueling the bounce was an announcement that President-elect Donald Trump had tapped CVR Energy's controlling shareholder, Carl Icahn, to be his special advisor on regulation. Icahn's role will be to help overhaul federal regulations that are hindering business, including EPA regulations that are costly for merchant refiners like CVR Refining to comply with. Further, because Icahn will serve in an ""individual capacity"" rather than as a government employee, he will not have to divest his controlling position in CVR Energy. In other words, he stands to benefit financially should the regulatory reductions he proposes lead to an increase in the value of CVR Energy's stock. Icahn's primary target will likely be the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) program, which he and CVR Refining CEO Jack Lipinski have criticized. Lipinski called the program ""broken"" due to the ""exorbitant costs of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs)"" that must be purchased by merchant refiners like CVR Refining. However, with Icahn-approved Scott Pruitt set to take over the EPA, these and other environmental regulations could soon be a thing of the past. That would allow merchant refiners to compete better against larger integrated refiners, which haven't been hurt by the skyrocketing costs of RINs because they control the blending and retail sale of their fuel. With Icahn heading to Washington to offer his opinions on how best to ease the burden of regulation on business, it appears more likely that the Trump administration will move quickly on that from. That unshackling could enable merchant refiners specifically to thrive in the years ahead, enabling their investors to capture that upside. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has been on a roll in 2016. Is the stock due for a terrible correction next year? Let's have a look at Micron's chances of having a record-level difficult year in 2017. Shares of the memory-chip maker have plunged at least 45% in three of the last 10 years. That includes a 62% plunge in 2015. Going back even further, the dot-com crash led to Micron shares losing 76% of their value in 2002. By those standards, it would take a horrific drop indeed to qualify for the ""all-time worst"" dishonor. As far as Micron's financial statements go, the company recently closed the books on a historically tough fiscal year. In fiscal 2016, revenue dropped 23% year over year. Operating profit fell from $3 billion to $168 million for a 94% reduction. EBITDA profit took a 45% haircut to land at $3.1 billion, and unadjusted earnings fell from $2.47 per share to a negative $0.27 per share. Trailing free cash flow was brutally negative, to the tune of $2.6 billion. All of these figures are among the worst Micron has seen in the last decade. However, the stock has not followed the same trend. Micron's share price has gained 60% year to date. And therein lies the key to how Micron might do in 2017. Micron's headquarters in Boise, Idaho. Image source: Micron. Micron's stock gains in 2016 are based on improving market trends. In an industry where average selling prices per chip are in a near-permanent state of free fall, 2015 marked the start of another deadly price war. We already saw the effect of this on Micron's financial results. But memory-chip prices not only stabilized in 2016 -- they actually increased dramatically. In the earnings call for the recently published first-quarter results of fiscal year 2017, Micron CEO Mark Durcan laid his cards on the table. ""Prices have been strengthening on a like-for-like basis across all leading edge DRAM and NAND products and we see this trend continuing into the current quarter,"" Durcan said. ""To give you some perspective on pricing dynamics, after declining for roughly 18 months, PC DRAM ASPs [average selling prices] are up 50% to 60% compared to the trough pricing, driven by an improvement in demand, historically low inventory levels and the impact of supply shifts to other segments."" Other types of DRAM chips have bounced back a bit slower than the PC products, because they saw smaller declines to begin with. In the NAND flash market, a shifting product mix drove average selling prices down 10% year over year, while gross margins expanded significantly. In 2017, management expects demand to grow faster than supply in both the DRAM and NAND markets. That could hold unit prices steady all year long. Could Micron run into trouble in 2017? Sure it could. The market winds can always shift at the drop of a hat. Chip prices could indeed start plunging again, knocking out all support for 2016's gains. But it's fair to say that Micron's management has a clearer view of current market trends than most of us outsiders, and it would be silly to set up high expectations if the real market data points in a darker direction. And even if Micron falls victim to yet another oversupply surge followed by the next memory-chip price war, the blow would still have to be an insanely crushing one before it reaches a low-record level. In fact, I would be downright shocked to see 2017's financial results falling beneath the low bar that was set in 2016. So 2017 is very unlikely to become Micron's worst year yet. It won't even be the worst year in recent memory, even in the most pessimistic case. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

Image source: Getty Images. Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP) is coming off of a tough year. That is evident by looking at its financial statements, which show that adjusted EBITDA is down 4.2% year to date versus the prior period, while distributable cash flow has fallen 9.8% thanks to weaker commodity prices and some other issues. That said, earnings and cash flow should recover nicely in 2017 thanks to several strategic initiatives the company has under way. These catalysts position the company to deliver its best year ever for earnings and cash flow in 2017. The largest near-term catalyst for Energy Transfer Partners is its pending merger with oil pipeline sibling Sunoco Logistics Partners (NYSE:SXL). While Sunoco is technically the acquiring entity, that's merely a formality, because the combined company will retain the Energy Transfer moniker and senior management team. Instead, the driving force behind this deal is that it will significantly strengthen Energy Transfer by improving its balance sheet and other financial metrics. In addition to that, one of the other benefits of the consolidation is an immediate boost in distributable cash flow. For example, Energy Transfer's consolidated cash flow totaled $2.6 billion thus far in 2016 because it included Sunoco Logistics' $696 million in distributable cash flow. However, after adjusting that against distributions received for its ownership interest in the entity, Energy Transfer's actual distributable cash flow was $2.3 billion, which is roughly $100 million less on a quarterly basis. As such, this transaction stands to boost the combined entity's distributable cash flow by approximately $400 million in 2017. The combined company also stands to benefit from a full year of Energy Transfer's acquisition of a 65% stake in PennTex Midstream Partners (NASDAQ:PTXP) in late October. Energy Transfer paid a total of $640 million for that stake, which includes 6.3 million common units, 20 million subordinated units, 100% of PennTex Midstream Partners' general partner, and all of the incentive distribution rights. During the third quarter, Energy Transfer was able to book $8 million in distributable cash flow because of an upcoming distribution to PennTex's common and subordinated unitholders. However, that income level will be higher on a go-forward basis once it also starts receiving the lucrative incentive distribution rights. Meanwhile, Sunoco Logistics completed two acquisitions in 2016. In September, the company acquired Vitol's Permian Basin crude oil system for approximately $760 million. Then in November, the company completed a strategic joint venture with oil giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) to combine their critical oil logistics assets in the Permian Basin. These deals will provide incremental earnings that will show up over the course of 2017. Image source: Getty Images In addition to these acquisitions, both Energy Transfer and Sunoco Logistics have several organic growth projects nearing completion. Topping that list is their controversial $4.8 billion Bakken pipeline system, which is more than 85% finished. While progress on the project stalled because of a permit issue, the company should get the necessary approvals early next year. That said, this project is just one of several these companies still have in the pipeline as Energy Transfer puts the finishing touches on a massive $15 billion expansion phase in 2017. In the year ahead, the company should complete work on the Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail Pipelines, the Rover Pipeline, and the Revolution System, while Sunoco Logistics expects to finish its Mariner East 2 project. While many of these projects will not go into service or start generating cash flow until the second half of the year, they will still provide a lift in 2017. That's on top of the full-year benefit from a slew of projects both companies completed in 2016. Overall, Energy Transfer estimates that its growth projects will deliver a 6-8 times EBITDA multiple on the capital employed in the first year. Given that it anticipates investing $10 billion for its share of these projects, this backlog represents a run rate of $700 million in annual EBITDA once all of the projects go into service. While it will not feel the full impact of that growth until 2018, these projects will still supply meaningful growth in 2017. In many ways, 2017 will be a transformational year for Energy Transfer Partners. Not only should it complete a merger with Sunoco Logistics, but it expects to finish the last of its major expansion projects. These growth initiatives, plus the full-year benefit of recent third-party acquisitions and an improving oil market, should reverse 2016's slide and could push EBITDA and distributable cash flow to new records. As such, the company should enjoy its best financial year ever as long as everything goes according to plan. ","

Fisher had been hospitalized Friday following a heart attack suffered aboard a flight from London to Los Angeles. Carrie Fisher was born in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Oct. 21, 1956 to parents actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher. Fisher’s breakout role came in 1977, when the 19-year-old starred as Princess Leia in the first installment of George Lucas’s “Star Wars,” opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. Fisher reportedly beat out other big names for the role, including Glenn Close and Meryl Streep. “I got to be the only girl in an all-boy fantasy, and it’s a great role for women,” Fisher said of Princess Leia in a 2016 interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. “She’s a very proactive character and gets the job done. So if you’re going to get typecast as something, that might as well be it for me.” The same year as “Empire Strikes Back,” Fisher appeared as a vengeful ex-lover in “The Blues Brothers.” In 1983, Fisher appeared in the final installment of the originally trilogy as Princess Leia in “Return of the Jedi.” Fisher appeared in one scene of “Return of the Jedi” wearing the now iconic and controversial metal bikini “Slave Leia” costume. “I had a lot of fun killing Jabba the Hutt,” Fisher said at a press conference in 2015. “They asked me on the day if I wanted to have a stunt double kill Jabba. No! That’s the best time I ever had as an actor. And the only reason to go into acting is if you can kill a giant monster.” In 2015, an action figure of Leia wearing the costume with a chain around her neck had some parents outraged. Fisher said to the Wall Street Journal, in response to the controversy: “What am I going to tell my kid about why she’s in that outfit? Tell them that a giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn’t like it. And then I took it off. Backstage.” Fisher played a major supporting role in the classic romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally” in 1989. Fisher has more than 90 acting credits to her name, including appearances in “Scream 3,” “Sibling Rivalry,” “Soapdish,” “Hook” and “Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle.” In 2001, Fisher played a nun in the comedy film “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.” Fisher is seen here with her mother, actress Debbie Reynolds, on Jan. 25, 2015, in Los Angeles, when Reynolds received a Screen Actors Guild lifetime achievement award. Fisher confirmed she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in “The Force Awakens” in a 2013 interview. A representative for Fisher said she was joking at the time, but it did in fact come to fruition with an announcement in January 2014. “I’d like to wear my old cinnamon buns hairstyle again but with white hair. I think that would be funny,” Fisher said in an interview with TV Guide. Fisher was often seen at events with her French bulldog, Gary.

George said he wouldn’t make videos or do a tour in support of his latest album and “didn’t need the celebrity.” This caught the attention of Sinatra, who fired a pep-talk-type letter off, including such gems as: Sinatra said when he read that interview in the Times, his reaction was that the pop star should “thank the good Lord every morning when he wakes up to have all that he has,” and that that would make two of them doing so. Sinatra went on to chide Michael for complaining about the “tragedy of fame” and reminded him that he could quickly be back playing venues in which “you’re singing to the cleaning lady in some empty joint that hasn’t seen a paying customer since Saint Swithin’s day.” Michael often referred to himself as a reluctant pop star, having told the BBC in 2007 that for all his attempts at derailing his own career, it “seems to right itself like a plastic duck in a bath.” The Sinatra take: “Talent must not be wasted.” Don’t miss: Why Sinatra had a ‘no contest’ clause in his will Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

Here’s how it happened. On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday, co-host Mika Brzezinski said she’d spoken to the president-elect. In an off-the-air discussion, she asked him about his tweet, she said. Here’s what he said in response, according to her account: It wasn’t clear whom Trump was talking about when referring to “them.” But Trump’s statement, like his tweet, seemed aimed at putting any adversary on notice that the U.S. intends to beef up its nuclear capabilities until he sees fit to do otherwise. Also read: Trump calls for an increase in nuclear weapons. The incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, quickly appeared on two shows after Brzezinski reported on Trump’s comment. He first told NBC’s Matt Lauer that “there is not going to be” an arms race and later said on CNN that Trump’s conversation with Brzezinski had been private.

Robert Schroeder,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 22, 2016 1:15 p.m. ET President-elect tweets U.S. needs to ‘greatly strengthen and expand’ nukes By President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday the U.S. must “greatly strengthen and expand” its nuclear arsenal. In a tweet, Trump said the U.S. should expand its nuclear capability until the world “comes to its senses regarding nukes.” He offered no further comment and it was unclear what prompted the tweet. The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes The U.S. holds the second-greatest number of nuclear weapons, behind only Russia, according to the Ploughshares Fund. In 2015, President Barack Obama’s administration dismantled 109 warheads, the fewest of his presidency, according to a report in May from the Pentagon. Trump’s tweet followed a statement from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said Russia must “strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces.” Putin is scheduled to hold his annual news conference on Friday and is expected to comment on his country’s ties with the U.S. Trump has called Putin a “strong leader,” and has cast doubt on reports that Russia was behind hacking during the U.S. election. Obama supporters, the New York Times noted in May, said the slowdown in weapons dismantling was understandable given the rising level of hostility with Russia. Trump has said he wants to rip up the international deal limiting Iran’s nuclear program. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox? Subscribe to MarketWatch's free Europe Daily newsletter.

Barry D. Wood,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 27, 2016 11:59 a.m. ET The president’s legacy is mixed, but it’s important to note his sometimes hard-fought successes By WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to Pearl Harbor on Dec. 27 is an important milestone that cements the strong relations between the United States and Japan. It follows President Obama’s historic visit, in May, to Hiroshima, where a memorial honors the more than 90,000 who died from the atomic bombing in 1945 that hastened the end of World War II. Those reciprocal gestures of reconciliation, in which neither leader apologized, come 75 years after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that killed over 2,000. That victor and vanquished from a distant war became strategic partners is a triumph of post-war American diplomacy. Vietnam For those who remember the Vietnam War, it was an “Alice in Wonderland” moment in which an American president was in Hanoi delivering a speech beneath a huge banner of Ho Chi Minh. Obama was 15 in 1975, when the conflict ended with the unification of the north and south. Unsettled by China’s offshore maritime claims, communist Vietnam has opened the former U.S. base at Cam Ranh Bay to visits from U.S. navy ships. Vietnam wants to buy weapons from the United States, and Hanoi is a top destination for U.S. corporate investment in the region. Secretary of State John Kerry said in Hanoi that Americans and Vietnamese “refuse to let our past define our future.” Vietnam, he said, “a former adversary, is now a partner with whom we have developed increasingly warm, personal and national ties.” Cuba In December 2014, Obama announced steps to normalize U.S. relations with Cuba, the island nation that has been under a U.S. trade embargo since 1960. In 2015, the State Department said Cuba would no longer be designated a country that sponsors terrorism. Restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba were removed and in March 2016 Obama visited Cuba, the first visit by an American president since 1928. Receiving an enthusiastic welcome from large crowds in Havana, Obama said on Cuban television that “it is time for us to look forward to the future together,” for the Cuban and American people … to make a journey “together as friends, and as neighbors.” Obama’s efforts at reconciliation with Cuba are popular with the business community but opposed by many Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump. Only Congress can lift the embargo and that action is unlikely in 2017. Elusive aims In 2009, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, an honor previously accorded, among others, to Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin. The 2009 citation praised the American president for “strengthening international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.” In the case of Obama, the peace prize was premature and, given subsequent events, probably undeserved. As his eight years in office near an end, the big successes Obama hoped for were elusive. There has been no reconciliation with the Muslim world, the reset in U.S. relations with Russia failed, and the nuclear agreement and rapprochement with Iran is fragile and likely to reversed by Trump. While Obama did wind down U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, the inability to halt the deadly civil war in Syria and the flight of refugees into Europe constitute a huge failure. Despite those shortcomings, Obama registered important foreign policy victories. U.S. relations with Japan, Vietnam and Cuba have been significantly strengthened and are likely to be judged positively in the years ahead. Want news about Asia delivered to your inbox?

All eyes are now on the Italian government, after it became clear late Wednesday that BMPS had failed to raise enough money to stave off a collapse.

                                   sank as much as 10% on Thursday morning, but trimmed losses later in the day. Monte dei Paschi has in recent weeks raced to raise €5 billion ($5.2 billion) from private investors to shore up its balance sheet and avoid being wound down by European regulators. However, it has run into major challenges. For example, uncertainty following the Italian referendum in early December dissuaded key investors to take part in the private rescue plan. Here are five things you need to know as the bank’s future hangs in the balance, casting a shadow over an entire sector. After failing the European Banking Authority’s stress tests this summer, Monte dei Paschi has been given until the end of the year to raise €5 billion. However, a private recapitalization plan led by J.P. Morgan to score the €5 billion collapsed on Wednesday after BMPS failed to secure an anchor investor. That dissuaded other key investors to back a share sale, according to media reports. Reuters reported that BMPS had banked on Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund investing €1 billion in its cash call, but that the option was no longer on the table. Additionally, a debt-for-equity swap offer failed to raise as much capital as hoped, making it even harder for the bank to reach its recapitalization target. With the private rescue plan now failing to prop up the bank, Monte dei Paschi is left at the mercy of the Italian government. The Italian cabinet is due to meet to approve the rescue plan late on Thursday or early Friday, once the BMPS board has requested help, the Financial Times reported. Italy’s parliament on Wednesday approved a government request for a €20 billion euro rescue loan to support the country’s ailing banking sector, which is expected in part to be used for a BMPS bailout. Italian Daily IL Sole 24 Ore said the capital injection would be carried out in separate steps over the next two to three months. BMPS has already been bailed out twice by the state. While Monte dei Paschi is considered a small bank relative to multinational giants, the fallout from a bailout could have far reaching consequences for global investors. There are concerns that the jitters could spread to other Italian banks and that the €20 billion set aside by the government on Wednesday won’t be enough to prop up all of the struggling lenders. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, estimates Italian banks need €52 billion to be rescued. Read:  Why Italy’s banks could ignite a eurozone crisis And there’s another issue. A taxpayer funded-bailout carries the risk of a political backlash that could empower the so-called euroskeptic and anti-establishment 5 Star Movement. With the risk of snap elections in Italy next year, voter anger could propel this populist party into the driver’s seat. That could mean “Quitaly” or “Brexit 2.0.” Additionally, a euroskeptic government in Italy could lead to a surge in bond yields, credit downgrades and added troubles for banks, analysts say. It’s been a rough year for Monte dei Paschi’s stock. After kicking off 2016 around €123 a share, the stock dropped to an intraday low of €14.71 on Thursday. That is a tumble of more than 85% this year. This week alone, the stock has tanked 21%, with the bulk of that move coming on Tuesday when the bank said it was running out of liquidity much faster than expected. As the poster child for the Italian bank crisis, Monte dei Paschi is saddled with a mountain of non-performing loans that is eating into its capital. It has the highest proportion of bad loans among Italian banks at around 36%. It has been asked to shed €28 billion of those loans to make it healthy again. European regulators said this summer that BMPS would have its capital wiped out in a crisis scenario, prompting the bank to announce plans for a €5 billion capital increase. The plan was somewhat on track until early December, when then-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned after losing a referendum on constitutional reforms. The vote and resignation have triggered a wave of political uncertainty. There is buzz that the developments have paved the way for populist parties who could lead Italy out of the eurozone. That spooked some of the key investors in Monte dei Paschi’s private recapitalization plan, leading them in the eleventh hour to decide against buying into the share sale.

Damian Paletta,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 23, 2016 3:12 a.m. ET F-35 called too expensive By President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday continued his pressure on the defense sector by suggesting he could use a Boeing Co. plane as a substitute for the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 combat jet. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F/A-18 Super Hornet!” he said in a tweet, referring to a Boeing plane that has long been used by the Navy and some overseas allies. The Pentagon plans to acquire more than 2,400 of the F-35 jets to replace much of its combat fleet in what is by far its costliest program, and Trump has singled it out for criticism after a legacy of delays and design problems. It is unusual for a president or a president-elect to publicly negotiate government procurement spending on weapons programs. Trump’s approach of negotiating via Twitter has shaken defense contractors and the complex defense bidding and procurement process. He has said he sees it as his job to try to save taxpayers money, but defense experts have said he is tackling a process that can’t be orchestrated in 140-character social media posts.

                                    climbed from $46 to $54 per barrel, underscoring a year in which oil’s 60%-plunge since 2014 finally bottomed out at $35. Don’t hold your breath. Yes, the decline of recent years has bottomed out. But prices aren’t about to soar because the economic conditions aren’t there. On the contrary, 2017 will expose the new-and-improved producers’ cartel as the same failed idea it has been even in its best times. This decade’s oil glut has been fed by two trends, On the supply side, fracking has multiplied U.S. production. On the demand side, the Great Recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis slowed industrial activity in the developed world and shrank the middle classes’ available income, all of which cut energy consumption. The common denominator between these two developments is that they represent organic economic realities. That cannot be said of what OPEC and Russia did, which is a bureaucratic plot to disrupt market dynamics. The markets have repeatedly displayed their impatience with such administrative intrusions, which defy economic gravity by trying to obstruct the reality of supply and demand. The world was afforded a good reminder of this axiom during Fidel Castro’s recent eulogies, when all recalled how Cuba fell on its knees once the U.S.S.R. realized the oil it was shipping Castro should be sold elsewhere for more than double that artificial price. The OPEC-Russia deal’s vulnerabilities were evident before it was signed. A simple roll call of its parties showed that the agreement lacked four of the world’s 10 leading oil producers: China, Canada, Brazil, and the U.S. Between them, these four produce one-third of the 10 leading producers’ output. That is besides the deal failing to recruit smaller, but still sizable, oil-producers Norway and Britain. Even more tellingly, when the deal was done, it turned out that OPEC member Indonesia had opted out. Added up, the deal’s non-signatories represent a critical mass whose increased production as prices rise will compensate for a good portion of the quantities that OPEC and its partners have promised to remove from the markets. This is besides that experience shows the deal’s signatories are likely to cheat each other. As data compiled by Goldman Sachs and Commerzbank show, OPEC members have historically violated their own production caps steadily and systematically. Such a scenario is even more realistic now, because there are 11 non-OPEC parties to the deal besides Russia, from Bolivia to Brunei. The lack of a tool for efficient supervision and disciplining punctured OPEC’s previous production caps, and there is no reason to believe that things will play out differently in the much larger and looser configuration that was unveiled last month. The signatories will have good reason to cheat each other for the same reason they arrived at the deal in the first place, which is that most of their economies are ill. The Saudi case is glaring, as the kingdom that over the years allowed oil to account for 80% of internal revenue and 90% of exports suddenly faced a $98-billion budget deficit for fiscal 2015. This year it slashed gas subsidies, nearly doubling its retail price, and cut senior officials’ wages by 20%, the first time ever Riyadh cut public-sector pay. The Russian economy is different, as it has some serious industry and now also a thriving agricultural sector. However, much like its new partner, Moscow has also made oil, by design, its dominant export. Not only the Russians and Saudis, but most of their unholy alliance’s other partners, from Iraq to Equatorial Guinea, have economies that rely excessively on oil revenue (notable exceptions are Mexico and Malaysia.) Petrodollars in such countries finance the ruling elites’ good life and also keep the masses at bay, through bloated public sectors and elaborate subsidy systems. That is why they won’t be able to sustain production cuts for more than a brief period; their fiscal needs will be urgent and the temptation to lie about outputs will be difficult to resist. Indeed, this deal pits productive economies, from China to Germany, against industrial reactionaries, from Venezuela to Kuwait. Last century, this clash resulted in the industrialized economies’ redoubled efforts to find new oil fields, to cultivate conservation, and to develop alternative energy. Read:  17 unpopular investing predictions for 2017 The result for the cartel was devastating. Oil plunged from $35 per barrel in 1980 to $10 in 1986. OPEC was supposed to learn from this that bullying ultimately backfires, but OPEC members remained addicted to their easy money, mostly with catastrophic results, like Venezuela’s current social collapse. This year’s move will unravel much faster than in the last century, because China, OPEC’s biggest client, has the world’s largest shale deposits. China has only begun to frack, but it plans to multiply production more than twentyfold by the end of the decade, making shale 15% of its gas production. In 2017, while their mutual cheating begins to show, OPEC and its fellow riders will learn that China is intensifying its fracking. This is besides Donald Trump likely expanding drilling and fracking across the U.S. while telling his friend Vladimir Putin that lifting American sanctions means lifting Russian production caps. Oil supply, it follows, will be ample, its prices will return to decline sooner rather than later, and those who own it will have little choice but to peddle it back to the marketplace, where it belongs.
