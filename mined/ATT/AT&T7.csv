,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. intelligence official said on Thursday he was “even more resolute” in his belief that Russia staged cyber attacks on Democrats during the 2016 election campaign, rebuking persistent skepticism from Republican President-elect Donald Trump about whether Moscow was involved. James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said he had a very high level of confidence that Russia hacked Democratic Party and campaign staff email, and disseminated propaganda and fake news aimed at the Nov. 8 election. “Our assessment now is even more resolute than it was” on Oct. 7 when the government first publicly accused Russia, Clapper told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said motives for the attack would be made public next week. Trump on Thursday morning called himself a “big fan” of intelligence agencies. But he has cast doubt on their assessments that Russia targeted the campaign of his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, drawing ire from his fellow Republicans as well as Democrats who are wary of Moscow and distrust Trump’s praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The intelligence officials at Thursday’s hearing said they worried a lack of support from atop the government could prompt valued staff members to leave their agencies. “There’s a difference between healthy skepticism ... and disparagement,” Clapper said. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has used the expression “healthy skepticism” to defend Trump’s criticism of intelligence findings. Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan, speaking at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics on Thursday, said that because Trump had never served in government, he was unfamiliar with the intelligence profession. “It doesn’t bother me if someone is going to be skeptical and challenge our work and maybe disagree with our views, but I expect that the president of the United States will recognize that the CIA and intelligence community were established by statute for a very important reason,” The congressional hearing was overseen by Republican Senator John McCain, a vociferous Russia critic. It was the first in a promised series of briefings and hearings on allegations that Russia tried to disrupt or influence the U.S. campaign, one of the most bitter in recent history. Moscow denies the allegations. McCain told reporters that Senator Lindsey Graham, also a vocal critic of Moscow, would chair a new Armed Services subcommittee dedicated to cyber issues. Trump will be briefed by intelligence agency chiefs on Friday on the hacks. President Barack Obama received a report on the matter on Thursday. An unclassified version will be made public early next week. “I don’t think we’ve ever encountered a more aggressive or direct campaign to interfere in our election process than we’ve seen in this case,” said Clapper, who leaves when Trump becomes president on Jan. 20. Clapper stopped short of declaring Russia’s actions “an act of war,” saying that determination was beyond the scope of his office. Clapper and the two other officials who testified, National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers, and Marcel Lettre, undersecretary of defense for intelligence, did not say what made U.S. intelligence confident Russia was behind the cyber attacks, a conclusion also reached by several private firms. Obama last week ordered the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies he said were involved in hacking U.S. political groups such as the Democratic National Committee. The CIA has identified Russian officials who fed material hacked from the DNC and Democratic Party leaders to WikiLeaks at Putin’s direction through third parties, according to a new U.S. intelligence report, senior U.S. officials said. Documents stolen from the DNC and Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, were posted on the Internet before the election, embarrassing the campaign. In a tweet on Wednesday, Trump was skeptical about a Russian role in the affair, writing: “(WikiLeaks founder) Julian Assange said ‘a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta’ - why was DNC so careless? Also said the Russians did not give him the info!” But on Thursday, Trump said in another Twitter post that he was not against intelligence agencies or in agreement with Assange. “The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!” Trump tweeted. Clapper said Assange had put American lives in danger and deserved no credibility. McCain and other lawmakers also blasted Assange. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, said there would be “howls” from Republicans if a Democrat described intelligence officials as Trump had. U.S. intelligence officials have said Russian cyber attacks were specifically aimed at helping Trump beat Clinton. Several Republicans have acknowledged the Russian hacking but have not linked it to an effort to help Trump win. Trump and top advisers believe Democrats are trying to delegitimize his victory by accusing Russia of helping him. Senator Tim Kaine, an Armed Services member who was Clinton’s vice presidential running mate, said: “It is my hope that this Congress is willing to stand in a bipartisan way for the integrity of the electoral process.” Graham said Obama’s actions against Moscow fell short. “I think what Obama did was throw a pebble. I’m ready to throw a rock,” Graham said. “Putin is up to no good and he better be stopped.” ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"PALM BEACH, Fla./ MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for refraining from retaliation in a dispute over spying and cyber attacks, in another sign that the Republican plans to patch up badly frayed relations with Moscow. Putin earlier on Friday said he would not hit back for the U.S. expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies by President Barack Obama, at least until Trump takes office on Jan. 20. “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!” Trump wrote on Twitter from Florida, where he is on vacation. Obama on Thursday ordered the expulsion of the Russians and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking political groups in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. “We will not expel anyone,” Putin said in a statement, adding that Russia reserved the right to retaliate. “Further steps towards the restoration of Russian-American relations will be built on the basis of the policy which the administration of President D. Trump will carry out,” he said. In a separate development, a code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont electric utility, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing unnamed U.S. officials. The Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations of the utility, the officials told the Post, but penetration of the nation’s electrical grid is significant because it represents a potentially serious vulnerability. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin and nominated people seen as friendly toward Moscow to senior administration posts, but it is unclear whether he would seek to roll back Obama’s actions, which mark a post-Cold War low in U.S.-Russian ties. Trump has brushed aside allegations from the CIA and other intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the cyber attacks.” It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,” Trump said on Thursday, though he said he would meet with intelligence officials next week. U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia was behind hacks into Democratic Party organizations and operatives before the presidential election. Moscow denies this. U.S. intelligence officials say the Russian cyber attacks aimed to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russian officials have portrayed the sanctions as a last act of a lame-duck president and suggested Trump could reverse them when he takes over from Obama, a Democrat. A senior U.S. official on Thursday said that Trump could reverse Obama’s executive order, but doing so would be inadvisable. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the Obama administration “a group of embittered and dimwitted foreign policy losers.” Should Trump seek to heal the rift with Russia, he might encounter opposition in Congress, including from fellow Republicans. Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Friday that Russia must face a penalty for the cyber attacks. “When you attack a country, it’s an act of war,” McCain said in an interview with the Ukrainian TV channel “1+1” while on a visit to Kiev. “And so we have to make sure that there is a price to pay, so that we can perhaps persuade the Russians to stop these kind of attacks on our very fundamentals of democracy,” added McCain, who has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on foreign cyber threats. Other senior Republicans, as well as Democrats, have urged a tough response to Moscow. A total of 96 Russians are expected to leave the United States including expelled diplomats and their families. Trump will find it very difficult to reverse the expulsions and lift the sanctions given that they were based on a unanimous conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies, said Eugene Rumer, who was the top U.S. intelligence analyst for Russia from 2010 until 2014. But that might not prevent Trump from improving ties to Russia, said Rumer, now director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a policy institute. “If Mr. Trump wants to start the relationship anew, I don’t think he needs to walk these sanctions back. He can just say this was Obama’s decision,” said Rumer. As part of the sanctions, Obama told Russia to close two compounds in the United States that the administration said were used by Russian personnel for “intelligence-related purposes.” Convoys of trucks, buses and black sedans with diplomatic license plates left the countryside vacation retreats outside Washington and New York City without fanfare on Friday. A former Russian Foreign Ministry employee told Reuters that the facility in Maryland was a dacha used by diplomatic staff and their children. The 45-acre complex includes a Georgian-style brick mansion, swimming pool, tennis courts and cottages for embassy staff. Neighbors said the Russians were a lively bunch, seen water-skiing in summer and known for throwing a large, annual Labor Day party. The Russian consulate in San Francisco said on its Facebook page, “We hate to have to say goodbye to close to a dozen of our colleagues, our friends.” Among those expelled was the consulate chef. Obama had promised consequences after U.S. intelligence officials blamed Russia for hacks intended to influence the 2016 election. Officials accused Putin of personally directing the efforts and primarily targeting Democrats. Washington also put sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies, the GRU and the FSB, four GRU officers and three companies that Obama said “provided material support to the GRU’s cyber operations.” ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire on New Year revelers at a packed nightclub on the shores of Istanbul’s Bosphorus waterway on Sunday killing at least 39 people, including many foreigners, then fled the scene. Some people jumped into the Bosphorus to save themselves after the attacker began shooting at random in the Reina nightclub just over an hour into the new year. Witnesses described diving under tables as the assailant walked around spraying bullets from an automatic rifle. The attack shook NATO member Turkey as it tries to recover from a failed July coup and a series of deadly bombings in cities including Istanbul and the capital Ankara, some blamed on Islamic State and others claimed by Kurdish militants. Security services had been on alert across Europe for new year celebrations following an attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people. Only days ago, an online message from a pro-Islamic State group called for attacks by “lone wolves” on “celebrations, gatherings and clubs”. “At first we thought some men were fighting with each other,” said a Lebanese woman who gave her name as Hadeel and who was in the club with her husband and a friend. “Then we heard the sound of the gunfire and ducked under the tables. “We heard the guy screaming Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest), all three of us heard that ... We heard his footsteps crushing the broken glass,” she told Reuters. “We got out through the kitchen, there was blood everywhere and bodies.” Officials spoke of a single attacker, a “lone wolf” in the parlance of Islamic State, but some reports citing witnesses including on social media suggested there may have been several. The incident bore echoes of an attack by militant Islamists on Paris’s Bataclan music hall in November 2015 that, along with assaults on bars and restaurants, killed 130 people. Nationals of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Lebanon, Libya, Israel, a Turkish-Belgian dual citizen and a Franco-Tunisian woman were among those killed, officials said. Saudi newspaper al-Riyadh said five of the dead were from Saudi Arabia. France said three of its citizens were wounded. A massive security operation unfolded to track down the fugitive assailant or assailants and any conspirators. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 15 or 16 of those killed at Reina were foreigners but only 21 bodies had so far been identified. He told reporters 69 people were in hospital, four of them in critical condition. Turkey is part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State and launched an incursion into Syria in August to drive the radical Sunni militants from its borders. It also helped broker a fragile ceasefire in Syria with Russia. “As a nation, we will fight to the end against not just the armed attacks of terror groups, but also against their economic, political and social attacks,” President Tayyip Erdogan said in a written statement. “They are trying to create chaos, demoralize our people, and destabilize our country ... We will retain our cool-headedness as a nation, standing more closely together, and we will never give ground to such dirty games,” he said. Reina is one of Istanbul’s best known nightspots, popular with local high society and foreigners. Some 600 people were thought to be inside when the gunman shot dead a policeman and civilian at the door, forced his way in and then opened fire. Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said the attacker used a “long-range weapon” to “brutally and savagely” fire on people, apparently referring to some form of assault rifle. U.S. President Barack Obama expressed condolences and directed his team to offer help to the Turkish authorities, the White House said. President Vladimir Putin Putin said Russia remained Turkey’s reliable partner in fighting terrorism, according to a statement from the Kremlin. Dozens of ambulances and police vehicles were dispatched to the club in Ortakoy, a neighborhood on the city’s European side nestled under one of three bridges crossing the Bosphorus and home to nightclubs, restaurants and art galleries. “I didn’t see who was shooting but heard the gun shots and people fled. Police moved in quickly,” Sefa Boydas, a Turkish soccer player, wrote on Twitter. “My girlfriend was wearing high heels. I lifted her and carried her out on my back,” he said. Hurriyet quoted Reina’s owner, Mehmet Kocarslan, as saying security measures had been taken over the past 10 days after U.S. intelligence reports suggested a possible attack. Turkey faces multiple threats including spillover from the war in Syria. Beside its cross-border campaign against Islamic State, it is fighting Kurdish militants in its southeast. The New Year’s Day attack came five months after a failed military coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, many of them in Istanbul, as rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets in a bid to seize power. More than 100,000 people, including soldiers and police officers, have been sacked or suspended in a subsequent crackdown ordered by Erdogan, raising concern both about civic rights and the effectiveness of Turkey’s security apparatus. On Dec. 28, the Nashir Media Foundation, which backs Islamic State, urged sympathizers to carry out attacks in Europe during the holiday period and to “replace their fireworks with explosive belts and devices, and turn their singing and clapping into weeping and wailing”. A month ago, a spokesman for Islamic State urged supporters to target “the secular, apostate Turkish government”. Turkey has seen repeated attacks in recent weeks. On Dec. 10, two bombs claimed by Kurdish militants exploded outside a soccer stadium in Istanbul, killing 44 people. A car bomb killed at least 13 soldiers and wounded 56 when it ripped through a bus carrying off-duty military personnel in the central city of Kayseri a week later, an attack Erdogan also blamed on Kurdish militants. The Russian ambassador to Turkey was shot dead as he gave a speech in Ankara on Dec. 19 by an off-duty police officer who shouted “Don’t forget Aleppo” and “Allahu Akbar”. In June, around 45 people were killed and hundreds wounded as three suspected Islamic State militants carried out a gun and bomb attack on Istanbul’s main Ataturk airport. ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. Congress had a rough start to its first session of the Donald Trump era on Tuesday when a public outcry that included a dressing-down from the president-elect prompted the House of Representatives to backtrack on its plans to defang an ethics watchdog. It was supposed to have been a ceremonious beginning in which lawmakers set plans to enact Trump’s agenda of cutting taxes, repealing Obamacare and rolling back financial and environmental regulations. With Trump set to be sworn in as president on Jan. 20, Republicans will control both the White House and Congress for the first time since 2007. The moment was overshadowed, however, by a an uproar over a surprise move by Republicans in the House of Representatives in a closed-door meeting late on Monday to weaken the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which is in charge of investigating ethics accusations against lawmakers. Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to “drain the swamp” and bring ethics reform to Washington, was not pleased by the timing. “With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority,” he said on Twitter on Tuesday. “Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!” The ethics office was created in 2008 following several corruption scandals. Some lawmakers have charged in recent years that it has been too quick to investigate complaints from outside partisan groups. Lawmakers wanted to have greater control of the watchdog, and inserted changes into a broader rules package, set to pass when the House convened on Tuesday. Even before Trump’s tweet, many House Republicans, including top leaders, had opposed the measure and worried about its ramifications. Trump’s tweet prompted an emergency meeting and a quick change of course by Republicans. “It was taken out by unanimous consent ... and the House Ethics Committee will now examine those issues,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan. As expected, Ryan was re-elected speaker on a vote of 239-189. He was first elected speaker in October 2015 after predecessor John Boehner retired following repeated revolts by House conservatives. The speaker election was part of the ceremony involved in the first meeting of the 115th Congress, as the 435 members of the House of Representatives and a third of the 100-member Senate were sworn in. Ryan, who kept his distance from Trump during his campaign only to embrace him after his Nov. 8 victory, said Republicans understood from the 2016 election that Americans were dissatisfied with Washington. “We hear you. We will do right by you and we will deliver,” Ryan said. Trump has made clear he wants to move swiftly to enact proposals he outlined during the campaign such as simplifying the tax code and slashing corporate tax rates. He also promised to make good on a Republican pledge to repeal and replace Democratic President Barack Obama’s 2010 signature Affordable Care Act - a law better known as Obamacare. “People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn’t work, and it is not affordable,” Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday, adding: “It is lousy healthcare.” In the first step of a process that could take years, Republican Senator Mike Enzi introduced a resolution on Tuesday to provide for repeal of the law. House Republicans also took a step to clear the decks later for Obamacare repeal by approving a procedural rule making it harder for Democrats to impede progress on such legislation. But Republicans face a dilemma on a replacement program to provide health insurance to people who do not have a plan at work or cannot afford private coverage. The White House says the law has expanded coverage for 20 million Americans, including an estimated 13.8 million people who buy insurance on exchanges, many who receive tax credits to make it affordable. “If Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act they’ll be hastening the demise of Medicare that millions of seniors rely upon for their basic healthcare needs,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not address Obamacare in remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday. He has said his top priorities for the new Congress were dealing with the “massive overregulation” he said had been a brake on the U.S. economy and making changes in the tax code to stop companies from moving jobs out of the country. Republicans might use upcoming spending bills funding government agencies to try to kill some environmental and banking regulations. Trump also is expected to try to use his executive powers toward that end. Leading Democrats warned of a fierce battle over Obamacare and said they planned to mobilize grassroots support for it. Obama is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with congressional Democrats to discuss strategies for fending off the Republican attacks on Obamacare. But Senator Charles Schumer, in his first floor speech as the top Democrat in the Senate, said he was ready to work on some issues with Trump. “If the president-elect proposes legislation that achieves that - on issues like infrastructure, trade, and closing the carried interest loophole, for instance - we will work in good faith to perfect and, potentially, enact it,” Schumer said. “When he doesn’t, we will resist.” House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told a packed House chamber that Democrats would work with Trump “wherever we can,” including reforming taxes and trade deals. Pelosi also warned that Democrats would “stand our ground” and fight Trump and Republicans if they attempt to weaken environmental regulations or civil rights protections. ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a series of incentives to the poor, farmers, women and small businesses on Saturday in a New Year’s address, and defended his recent decision to abolish high denomination bank notes. The televised speech was widely seen as an opportunity for Modi to shore up support after a radical move on Nov. 8 to withdraw all 500 and 1,000 rupee bills, accounting for 86 percent of currency in circulation. Millions of Indians were forced to queue outside banks for hours to deposit old money and withdraw as much new currency as was permitted, causing widespread anger and raising concerns about India’s economic growth in the current quarter. The so-called “demonetisation” was designed to crush India’s huge shadow economy, increase tax revenues and promote the use of bank accounts and digital transactions, but perceptions that the ambitious operation was botched have hurt Modi’s standing. It comes only weeks before Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state with 200 million people, holds an election that will test whether the popular leader has been significantly weakened. Modi praised Indians for their forbearance. “In this fight against corruption and black money, it is clear that you would like to walk shoulder to shoulder with us (the government),” Modi said. “For us in government, this is a blessing ... Corruption, black money, and counterfeit notes had become so rampant in India’s social fabric, that even honest people were brought to their knees.” Lower lending rates could increase credit growth and spark a revival in private investments. On Saturday Modi had urged banks to do more to increase lending for the poor, while announcing a slew of measures including an offer of a 4 percent discount on interest rates for home loans for up to 900,000 rupees ($13,200) taken out in 2017 by middle class Indians. Modi also said the government would increase credit guarantees for small businesses and provided additional incentives for digital transactions. There were steps to help pregnant women and senior citizens, as well as financial support for farmers, an apparent bid to win backing among the huge rural population of Uttar Pradesh that has been hit hard by the cash overhaul. Modi did not say how the government would pay for the measures, although economists said the package was unlikely to be too costly. It was unveiled as the government gears up to announce its annual budget, probably some time in February. “It’s clear that Modi is chastened and he had no big bang offerings today,” said Mohan Guruswamy, chairman of the independent economic think-tank Centre for Policy Alternatives. “He is clearly doing this to win back political support.” The Uttar Pradesh poll will be a litmus test for Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and will go some way to determining the prime minister’s chances of winning a second term in office in national polls scheduled for 2019. While he has introduced several major reforms to Asia’s third largest economy, the cash ban is seen as his biggest political gamble to date. Members of the main opposition Congress party were quick to criticize the speech. One senior member, Prithviraj Chavan, said the address was vague and lacked accurate accounting details. “It was his day to present a report card and specifically disclose the benefits of ‘demonetisation’, but clearly the entire drive has been a failure,” he said. In his speech, Modi sought to cast the move as something all Indians should support. “I urge all parties and leaders to move away from a ‘holier than thou approach,’ to come together in prioritizing transparency, and take firm steps to free politics of black money and corruption.” ($1=67.9445 Indian rupees) ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move “a vote of confidence” in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an “absolute disgrace” during the election campaign. The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there. Trump’s efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment. In a Twitter post hours before Ford’s announcement, Trump wrote, “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States. Trump’s GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20. Mexico’s government said it regrets Ford’s decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment. “Obviously, this isn’t a good decision for us,” said Mexico’s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford’s investment in Flat Rock. Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus. Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent. Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress. “Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he’s talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,” Fields said. Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields’ announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration. Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan. Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020. GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. ","

Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the decision to cancel the new Mexico factory was the result of sagging demand for small cars in North America and not because Trump was elected president. He told Fox Business that the automaker would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. “There was no quid pro quo because there was no negotiation” with Trump over the decision to cancel the plant, Fields said. Fields told reporters the decision related to the need to “fully utilize capacity at existing facilities” amid declining sales of small and medium sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion. Fields also endorsed “pro growth” tax and regulatory policies advocated by Trump and the Republican-led Congress. “This is a vote of confidence for President-Elect Trump and some of the policies he may be pursuing,” Fields said. Trump repeatedly said during the election campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico, which he called an “absolute disgrace” and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on imported Ford vehicles. Ford executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. told reporters he spoke with Trump to notify him of the decision. The company said the decision was influenced by Trump’s policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations but that there were no negotiations over the decision announced on Tuesday. The New York businessman, who has vowed to bring back American jobs that have been outsourced overseas and be tough on illegal immigration from Mexico, takes office on Jan. 20. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020 as the auto industry faces rising fuel efficiency mandates. Ford will add 700 jobs at the Flat Rock plant, Fields said, to cheers from union workers gathered at the factory for the announcement. Ford in April announced it would invest $1.6 billion in the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to build small cars. The company said it will shift production from Michigan of its Focus to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. When Trump announced his campaign in June, 2015, he said Ford would cancel its planned Mexico investments. “They’ll say,’Mr. President we’ve decided to move the plant back to the United States — we’re not going to build it in Mexico.’ That’s it. They have no choice,” Trump said. Trump tweeted a link on Tuesday to a story about the decision. Ford shares rose 3.3 percent to $12.54, up $0.41 a share, while the Mexican peso fell on Tuesday to touch its weakest level in seven weeks. Ford said it will add two new unnamed products at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where the Focus is manufactured today. ","

Trump’s tweet confuses Toyota’s existing Baja plant with the  planned $1 billion plant in Guanajuato, where construction got under way in November. A Trump spokeswoman did not return a request seeking additional comment. Baja produces around 100,000 pickup trucks and truck beds annually. The Guanajuato plant will build Corollas and have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019, shifting production of the small car from Canada. The Japanese automaker’s American Depositary Receipts fell after Trump’s tweet and closed down 0.6 percent at $120.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in Japan on Thursday that the automaker has no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico, preferring to wait until after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration before deciding whether to make any changes. “We will consider our option as we see what policies the incoming president adopts,” Toyoda said at an industry gathering in Tokyo on Thursday before Trump’s tweet, when asked whether his company was considering any changes to a production plant the automaker was building in Mexico. Ford, however, still plans to shift production of small cars to Mexico from Michigan, even as it uses $700 million from the planned Mexico investment to expand its operations in Flat Rock, Michigan, and add 700 jobs. During the campaign, Trump criticized barriers to U.S. auto exports to Japan and said the U.S. government did not do enough to open the market to more American-made vehicles. “Until you open your markets, you’re not selling any more cars over here,” Trump said of Japan in an August 2015 interview with the Detroit News. “That’s going to force people to build in the United States.” Toyota has extensive U.S. investments, operates 10 U.S. plants in eight states and builds more than 1.3 million vehicles in the United States annually.Between 1994 and 2013, U.S. auto factory jobs dropped by a third while jobs in Mexico rose almost five-fold over the same period as lower-wage production boomed. Mexico now accounts for 20 percent of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based, Center for Automotive Research. Based on current investment plans, Mexico’s auto production capacity will grow by another 50 percent over the next five years, according to the center, which draws funding from the auto industry. It said Toyota imported fewer vehicles from Mexico than any other major automaker building cars there last year. Detroit’s Big Three automakers collectively exported more than 1.1 million vehicles to the United States from Mexico in 2016, while Toyota sent about 47,000 Mexican-made vehicles to the United States. Trump criticized GM for importing Mexican-made versions of the Chevrolet Cruze, even as the automaker is laying off 1,200 workers in Ohio this month who assemble the car. ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s central bank sold dollars in Mexico and New York on Thursday to fight off the peso’s nose dive to record lows amid fears U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s protectionist policies could further hammer Latin America’s second-biggest economy. The central bank sold at least $1 billion in U.S. currency in morning trade, four traders told Reuters, asking not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The bank kept the amount confidential. Mexico’s currency commission said in a separate statement that the move was aimed at providing liquidity and combating recent volatility in the peso, adding that it could not rule out further discretionary intervention to support the currency. The dollar sales mark the bank’s first currency intervention since February 2016, when it sold $2 billion to prop up the sinking peso. The peso depreciated 20 percent last year alone and was among the world’s worst performing currencies. Banco Base said in a report following the intervention that the decision was aimed at combating “speculative positions” that had built up against the peso. The peso posted a record low at 21.624 per dollar on Wednesday after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Dec. 13-14 meeting hinted that faster rate hikes could be needed under Trump. Historically the impact of Mexico’s currency interventions have tended to be short-lived, and the peso has continued to trend lower. Juan Garcia, director of national operations for the central bank, confirmed the surprise sales and said they would continue through the day, but he declined to specify volumes. Prior to the February intervention, the Banco de Mexico had sold dollars in rules-based auctions since a deep slump in the peso in 2014. The February dollar sales were a major policy shift and marked the first time the bank opted for direct dollar sales since the 2009 financial crisis. Also, a major fuel price hike that took effect on Jan. 1 has stirred inflation fears and provoked numerous protests and some looting. President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday defended the hike. The currency fall continued on Wednesday and was compounded by the Fed’s minutes showing policymakers were concerned that quicker economic growth under Trump could require faster interest-rate increases in the United States. Trump’s election win drove the Mexican currency steadily lower, with the sell-off fueled by his threats to scrap a trade deal between Mexico and the United States, and to levy punitive tariffs on Mexican-made goods. On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to halt money transfers from Mexican nationals in the United States unless the country agreed to pay for the massive wall he has vowed to build on the U.S. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants.

(TSLA) turned a profit after fourteen quarters of losses and persistently negative cash flows. Now investors are wondering whether the company will remain profitable this year. As with other news in 2016, Tesla's turnaround came about in dramatic circumstances. (See also: Tesla Shares Fall After Goldman Downgrade.) Even as skeptics predicted doom for the company,  Musk emailed employees exhorting them to “produce every car possible” so that the company could “throw pie in the face of Tesla critics.” Eventually, he did that during the company’s third-quarter results, when Tesla turned in a small profit of $22 million after ballooning from $294 million in 2014 to $888 million in 2015. While Tesla did announce record sales during the third quarter, it is unlikely that those numbers contributed to its profitability. Instead, analysts contend that the company’s sale of zero emission vehicle (or ZEV) credits, instituted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), was the main reason. Based on filings, they calculated that the company sold $139 million worth of ZEV credits in the market and this inflated its earnings. For example, Jim Collins at The Street calculated an addition of 88 cents to Tesla's non-GAAP earnings due to the credits sale. Tesla also performed an accounting sleight-of-hand to inch towards profitability. It began counting sale revenues inclusive of its resale price guarantees. (See also: Why Tesla Needs To Report Profits Today.)  Musk is confident that the company will be able to repeat its profitability during the fourth quarter. But analysts are doubtful. The main reason is that the company’s costs are expected to balloon due to business commitments. Those commitments range from expansion of production facilities to manufacture the Model 3 mass-market electric car, to financing its $2.8 billion SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) acquisition, to ramping up car deliveries to 500,000 in 2018. Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer & Co. has estimated that the company will need $12.5 billion through 2018 to finance its various ventures. (See also: Combined Tesla-SolarCity Entity Will Need $12.5 billion Over Next Two Years, Says Analyst.) The company reported $3.08 billion cash on hand during its latest quarter. Last quarter was only the second time in its history as a publicly-listed company that Tesla reported a positive cash flow. But it is likely that expansion of its facilities will take precedence over generating positive cash flows for Tesla in the coming quarters. That means profits may be unlikely at Tesla in 2017.

Rakesh Sharma,01052017,Investopedia,12292016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Between meeting President-Elect Donald Trump and running three companies, Tesla Motors Corp. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk does not have much time for interviews and press conferences. Instead he uses Twitter (TWTR) to make major announcements or for conversations and updates. His tweet stream is a mix of humor, information, and a first-hand llook into the issues that occupy one of the world's most famous entrepreneurs and billionaires. He also uses Twitter to engage with fans and critics. There were many from the latter category in an especially volatile year for the company. After all, this was the year that Tesla ventured into mass production of electric cars, completed an acquisition of SolarCity Corp. (SCTY), despite strident opposition, and was showered with public outrage and negative media coverage for the death of a motorist who was using the Autopilot feature in a Tesla car. Through these events, Musk used Twitter to communicate with his severest critics. Here are three examples. In July, Fortune writer Carol Loomis published a post on the magazine’s website charging the electric carmaker with withholding material information from investors during a large stock sale by Musk because it did not disclose the death of a Tesla driver who had used the company's autopilot feature. That set Musk off and he fired back at the magazine. In his tweets, Musk said that one million auto deaths worldwide would have been saved if Tesla’s autopilot feature was universally available. He accused Fortune of writing a “BS” article that increased its advertising revenue. Eventually though, the SEC opened an investigation into the Palo Alto company, which released an updated version of its Autopilot software in September. @alansmurray Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2016 @alansmurray If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about 1M+/year deaths from other auto companies? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2016  In October, Murray Energy CEO Robert E. Murray appeared on CNBC’s Squawk Box and called Tesla “a fraud” who “has gotten $2 billion from taxpayers.” Musk tweeted that the real fraud was denial of climate change and challenged Murray to a situation where both, renewable energy sources and coal, went down to zero subsidy.

Some analysts predict that 2017 will be another banner year, while others are more skeptical and calling this recent rise a bubble that is waiting to burst. (See also: Bitcoin's Price History) In 2015, Bitcoin had risen modestly, from $313 to $431, a 37% rise, kicking off a year of steady growth throughout 2016. In last year's Investopedia article looking at how 2016 would shape up, many predictions proved to be correct: increased demand did come from China as capital controls did tighten and regulators continued to devalue the Yuan systematically.  However, predictions that venture capital (VC) investment would rise fell a bit flat: bitcoin-related companies raised nearly $500 million in total in 2015, but only around $350 million in 2016. (Look back at: The Outlook for Bitcoin in 2016) 2016 also saw relative price stability in Bitcoin, as its price rose steadily and with lower volatility than had been experienced in the past, and it also gained wider acceptance and legitimacy as a means of payment. Plagued by negative image problems surrounding its use for illegal or illicit transactions such as for drugs and money laundering, a 2016 research paper showed that the transactions occurring on the Bitcoin network became more and more legitimized with far less suspect activity as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured. 2016 also saw the second so-called halving of the Bitcoin block reward, the number of bitcoins found in each block. Set to automatically reduce by 50% approximately every four years, in 2009 there were 50 BTC per block and by summer 2016 just 12.5 BTC. This has reduced the rate of new supply and given an increasing demand, naturally put upward pressure on the price. Already, 2017 has started strong out of the gates for Bitcoin's price, exceeding $1,000 and approaching $1,100 in just the first few days of the year, levels not seen since late-2013 when it's price briefly exceeded $1,200. This top, of course, was followed by a crash in the price of Bitcoin, sending it down to below $250 soon after. This has led some skeptics to claim that this price rise, too, is a bubble. However, many things are different this time around. The size and computing power of the Bitcoin mining network, which confirms and validates transactions, has risen exponentially since then, and the number of users, merchants, and exchange volume has grown similarly. Moreover, the rapid rise back in 2013 is now attributed to fraudulent trading and price manipulation that exploited illiquid and immature markets, and which eventually led to the famous collapse of the primary, and corrupt, Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox. This past year's rise in price has enjoyed liquid, developed markets with many exchanges in competition with one another, and without any evidence of price manipulation. Demand for Bitcoin as a currency is also likely to continue to grow in 2017, again as China has promised to restrict capital outflows and to devalue its currency in order to protect exporters. Another large economy that has seen increased demand for Bitcoin is India, whose government surprised many by scrapping large-denomination banknotes and causing a panic for cash in the country of more than a billion residents. A rising U.S. dollar has also caused some in emerging markets to seek alternatives to fiat currencies as debt denominated in dollars becomes more expensive to service. (For more, see: Bitcoin Prices in India Soar Amid Demonetization Drive) 2017 may also see increased focus on Bitcoin as the dominant digital currency amid many hundreds of alternatives (sometimes called 'altcoins') including notably Litecoin, Ethereum and Zerocash. Some proponents of altcoins had hoped that improvements or enhanced features that made them objectively ""better"" than Bitcoin would help dislodge it as the dominant player. Those efforts have seemed to fail, as Bitcoin continues to climb, its market cap now approaching $18 billion, while its next closer competitor, Ethereum is struggling to break through $1 billion. So-called Bitcoin supremacy or dominance is also likely to damper efforts of private blockchain implementations that have been attempted largely in the financial sector, notably with the consortium R3CEV or IBM's Hyperledger project.

Some analysts have speculated the price could double from here to reach $2,100 by year's end while others claim it will fall to zero. Only time will tell. Personally, I see increased demand given a limited supply and geopolitical events pushing up the price, but how high I cannot guess. (For more, see: Could Bitcoin's Price Surpass $2,000 in 2017?)

(FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg had what it takes for political office. Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution, which includes a 50-state tour, suggests he's preparing himself for a big role. POTUS comes to mind, for example. On Tuesday, via a post on Facebook, Zuckerberg said one of his goals in 2017 is to meet people from all 50 states. The move is part of Zuckerberg’s annual New Year’s tradition to take on a personal challenge. “After a tumultuous last year, my hope for this challenge is to get out and talk to more people about how they're living, working and thinking about the future,” Zuckerberg wrote. “My work is about connecting the world and giving everyone a voice. I want to personally hear more of those voices this year.” Meeting people in every state and shaking hands is an often-recited phrase on the presidential campaign trail. And Zuckerberg, 34, says he's already begun his state tour and needs to visit only thirty more states this year to accomplish his goal. The notion of Zuckerberg for president might seem farfetched, but recently released court documents, disclosing Facebook board voted to give Zuckerberg a two-year leave of absence if he serves in a government position or office, suggests the company believes politics could be in his future. Indeed, the obvious question would be, what does Zuckerberg know about politics? On January 20, when President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, that question will matter even less. But if Zuckerberg accomplishes his 2017 goals, he'll arguably be just as, if not more, qualified than Trump. And with an estimated net w​orth of $52 billion, he'll certainly be richer. As for Facebook, the platform was highly criticized for disseminating fake news and for steering the November presidential election. Zuckerberg's 50-state tour could be a way for him to learn what people think and how they feel about Facebook's political influence.

Even so, their conservative $400 price target suggests a lack of faith in the 2017 outlook since the stock closed just 18-points under that level on Wednesday evening. The company has failed to rebuild its customer base after a well-publicized 2015 food poisoning outbreak, with management adding to woes by making a series of tactical errors in dealing with the backlash. Even so, it’s now 2017, with the January Effect underpinning speculation in the prior year’s biggest losers. This tailwind could trigger a recovery that exceeds analyst and management targets. CMG Long-Term Chart (2006-2017) The stock came public in the mid-40s in January 2006 as a McDonald's Corp (MCD) spinoff and broke out of a trading range 16-months later, lifting in a steady uptrend to the January 2008 high at $155.49. A decline gathered strength in the second half of the year, dumping to an all-time low at $36.86 in November. It took nearly 18-months for the subsequent recovery wave to complete a 100% retracement to the prior high and another five months to generate a breakout. That uptrend built steady gains into April 2012 when it topped out at $442, with the subsequent pullback giving up more than 200-pts into the October low at 234. It turned higher into 2013, reaching the 2012 high in October and breaking out in a buying impulse that continued into the second half of 2015 when food poisoning reports spread across the national media. The rally ended at $758 in August, yielding a steady decline that found support near $400 in January 2016. Last year’s January Effect attracted steady buying pressure, lifting the stock to $542 in March, with aggressive sellers then returning and dumping price into a declining wedge that’s still in force ten months later. Meanwhile, Fibonacci grids placed over the two primary rally waves since the IPO broadcast continued downside exposure through $350, telling observant market players to take place tight stops and take aggressive profits after the recovery wave loses steam. Short-Term Chart (2014-2017) The stock printed a downside breakaway gap in October 2015, exiting a three-month topping pattern while entering a steep downtrend that accelerated into the January 2016 low. The first quarter bounce stalled at the .386 selloff retracement but well below the declining 200-day EMA. In fact, the stock hasn’t touched this long term moving average since the gap, highlighting extreme weakness consistent with a paradigm-shifting loss of confidence. A rally above $400 is needed to break the falling wedge and put the 200-day EMA at $425 in play. Those barriers, relatively close to the current price level, tell us that a recovery wave similar in scope to the 2016 bounce will require a lot more firepower. It’s a two-edged sword because, while the setup lowers odd for a high percentage rally, breakouts will ease highly negative sentiment and attract sidelined players who have no intention of owning the stock at current levels. On Balance Volume (OBV) looks more bearish than the dismal price pattern, failing to bounce strongly in the first quarter of 2016 despite the significant rally. It’s eased to lower ground in the last year in an endless series of lower highs and lows that have drawn a descending channel (red lines). These mark important levels to watch if buying pressure sets into motion and lifts the stock toward $400. Chipotle Mexican Grill could gain significant ground in a January Effect rally similar to 2016’s 140-point bounce, but the stock needs to mount two major resistance levels, at $400 and $425, to set that trade into motion. <Disclosure: the author held no positions in aforementioned stocks at the time of publication.> ","Chipotle Ripe for a January Effect Rally (CMG, MCD) | Investopedia"

With the embattled drug company losing some 86% of its value last year, ranking as one the worst performers of the S&P 500 (SPX) index, Valeant doesn't have to be extraordinary in 2017 to have a bounce-back year. It only needs not to screw things up more than it already has. But that's easier said than done, given that it has some $31 billion in debt on the balance sheet and limited means to grow revenue. Valeant stock closed Friday at $14.52, plunging some 41% in the last three months of 2016.  So, what will drive Valeant in 2017? And does the recent decline present a buying opportunity? According to a Reuters survey of six brokerage companies, all of the firms rated Valeant stock as a Buy, while three firms have issued Strong Buy ratings. The consensus 12-month price target is $24, which suggests potential premiums of about 65% from Friday's close. (See also: Valeant's Meltdown in 2016: A Year in Review.) But for the share price to move higher, which would require stronger execution from the company, Valeant CEO Joe Papa must focus more on managing Valeant and worry less about how the company is portrayed. While speaking at a BMO health care conference last month, Papa said that Valeant's biggest problem was ""click-hungry journalists"" who write negative articles. (See also: Valeant Stock Falls as Three Top Executives Quit.) It would seem Papa is implying that the company's price gouging, its litany of lawsuits, the forced re-statement of SEC reporting and a host of other fundamental flaws have had nothing to do with the company's decay. In other words, blaming external factors instead of outlining strategies to turn the company around doesn't inspire confidence that Valeant, which needs tons of cash, has ""grown up."" (See also: Can Donald Trump Make Valeant Stock Great Again?) With the company now seeing a greater chance of defaulting on its debt obligations, Valeant stock will likely remain toxic in 2017. That is until the first payment to creditors is made. And even then, unless the company's fundamentals drastically improve to a point where Valeant can operate without selling off assets, the shares will struggle to avoid single-digit territory in 2017.

Jacob Pramuk,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Donald Trump threw more praise to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, a day after the Obama administration announced sanctions on people and organizations it believes were involved in suspected Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The president-elect applauded Putin for holding off on retaliating to the U.S. actions, which included sanctions on nine entities and individuals and the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats. Trump, breaking with many members of his Republican party, has so far downplayed the White House's actions and bipartisan concerns about possible Russian meddling, seeing them as attempts to delegitimize his election. In a tweet, Trump called it a ""great move"" for Putin to wait before retaliating, adding that ""I always knew he was very smart!"" Giving it more exposure, he also pinned the tweet to his account, meaning more recent tweets will not appear above it as they normally would. Trump tweet: Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! On Friday, Putin called the measures ""provocative"" and ""aimed at further weakening the Russia-U.S. relationship."" But he said Russia would not expel any U.S. diplomats in response, after Russia's foreign minister earlier indicated that Moscow could. The move was interpreted as waiting to see if Trump will adopt a more conciliatory approach when he takes office next month. The White House's actions were seen as putting Trump in a difficult spot, as top congressional Republicans called the sanctions ""overdue"" and more hawkish GOP senators said they would seek tougher measures against Russia. Trump's lauding of Putin comes after a statement Thursday night in which he said ""it's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things"" than concerns about Russia. He also said he will talk to the intelligence community next week about the ""facts"" that led to the sanctions. Trump has received bipartisan criticism for appearing too warm with Putin. Trump has not yet said if he will keep Obama's sanctions, seek harsher actions or even roll back other existing measures. In a statement Thursday, President Barack Obama said that ""actions intended to interfere with the U.S. election process ... could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian government."" U.S. officials told NBC News earlier this month that they believe with a ""high level"" of confidence that Putin became personally involved in the suspected electoral meddling. Trump's tweet Friday took a decidedly different tone from responses House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave to the sanctions Thursday. Ryan said in a statement that Russia has ""consistently sought to undermine"" America's interests and called Obama's actions ""overdue."" McConnell, meanwhile, said that ""the Russians are not our friends"" and called the sanctions ""a good initial step."" He urged an ""overwhelming response"" to cyberattacks against the U.S. Sen. John McCain, a hawk on policy toward Russia, has set a hearing on foreign cyberattacks against the U.S. for next week. Trump's quote about Putin was also distributed more widely Friday on his Instagram account. A photo posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Dec 30, 2016 at 12:07pm PST The president-elect subsequently tweeted that the Russians are ""playing"" the media. @realDonaldTrump: Russians are playing @CNN and @NBCNews for such fools - funny to watch, they don't have a clue! @FoxNews totally gets it!

Dan Mangan,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Spending less by getting rid of Obamacare could end up costing a whole lot more. Up to 3 million jobs in the health sector and other areas would be lost if certain key provisions of the Affordable Care Act are repealed by Congress, a new report said Thursday. At the same time, ending those provisions could lead to a whopping $1.5 trillion reduction in gross state product from 2019 through 2023, according to the study. ""Repealing key parts of the ACA could trigger massive job losses and a slump in consumer and business spending that would affect all sectors of state economies,"" said Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research and professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. Ku is the lead author of the report, which was issued by the Milken Institute and the Commonwealth Fund. The report comes as President-elect Donald Trump and the new Congress are moving toward repealing parts of the ACA through the budget reconciliation process. ""The immediate and most visible effect of ACA repeal would be the loss of coverage and access to care for millions of people who have gained insurance because of the law,"" said Sara Collins, vice president for health-care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund. ""This study points to even larger potential economic effects that would be detrimental to the health and well-being of millions more,"" Collins said. The estimate of job and state product losses are based on a scenario in which Congress defunds federal subsidies that most Obamacare customers receive to help lower their monthly insurance premium costs, and also gets rid of funding to cover adults who became newly eligible for Medicaid under the ACA. Repealing both provisions would save the federal government $140 billion in health-care spending, the report found. And as that funding spigot dried up, it would lead to job losses and a drop in gross state product, the report said. The study notes that most of the federal funding for Obamacare flows to hospitals, health clinics, pharmacies and other medical providers, who in turn hire and pay staff and purchase goods and services. The biggest job losses would occur in California, with 334,000 lost jobs, Florida, with 181,000 lost jobs, Texas, with 175,000 lost positions, and Pennysylvania, New York and Ohio, each of which would lose more than 125,000 jobs, the report estimates. One-third of the job losses would be in the health-care sector, according to the report. The remaining two-thirds of job losses are expected to come from construction, real estate, retail, finance and insurance. As with other reports estimating the effects of Obamacare repeal, the economic downsides could be mitigated, or completely offset by a replacement plan for the ACA. But so far, Trump and the Republican-led Congress have not committed to such a plan. So researchers have been unable to estimate the ultimate effects of a replacement plan. ",Obamacare repeal costs: 3 million lost jobs
Dan Mangan,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Marsha, Marsha, Marsha ... A Twitter poll by ardent Obamacare foe Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., on whether the health-care law should be repealed backfired big-time Wednesday as lots more people — a whole lot more people — tweeted ""No,"" rather than ""Yes."" Blackburn posted the poll Tuesday, asking people their views on repeal, and requesting that they retweet their support for killing Obamacare if they favored repeal. She also asked in that tweet what people want to see as a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. Tweet When the poll closed Wednesday, a whopping 84 percent of the nearly 8,000 votes were for ""No"" on the question of repeal. The Hill.com noted that Blackburn's cause probably wasn't helped by the fact that White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz retweeted the poll Tuesday to his more than 23,000 Twitter followers. Schultz's boss, President Barack Obama, lists the ACA as his signature legislative achievement, and on Wednesday visited Capitol Hill to encourage his fellow Democrats to defend it against Republican repeal-and-replace efforts. Also Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for the repeal of the ACA, warned his fellow Republicans in several tweets to ""be careful"" how they handle the issue. Trump's tweets said Democrats ""own"" the ""mess"" and ""disaster"" of Obamacare, implying that if Republicans repeal-and-replace efforts lead to spikes in uninsured rates and premium prices, they too could suffer political fallout. Tweet ",This Republican congresswoman's Obamacare Twitter poll didn't go well
John W. Schoen,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Repealing Obamacare will cost the federal government as much as $350 billion, according to a new estimate. Congressional Republicans are eagerly anticipating their long-awaited chance to repeal the 6-year-old Affordable Care Act, one of the signature achievements of the Obama administration. That enthusiasm may be dampened when they learn how much the repeal will cost. The $350 billion cost estimate in an analysis released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget would be spread over 10 years unless key provisions of the law are maintained or replaced. ""Repealing the entire ACA would leave no funds available for 'replace' legislation, and in fact would require further deficit reduction to avoid adding to the debt,"" the report said. Most of the law's opponents have focused on the added cost of subsidizing health insurance. But the law also includes dozens of provisions that cut health care and raise taxes that more than offset the money spent. Despite the GOP's steadfast opposition to the law, that net cost of repealing it could give pause to the party's fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill. The new analysis looks only at the net cost to the federal government and doesn't take into account the far bigger economic impact on insurers, hospitals, doctors, drug companies and other parts of the sprawling American health system. Nor does its estimate include the financial impact on the roughly 23 million Americans who, the group estimates, would lose coverage if the ACA is fully repealed and not replaced. After more than 60 failed votes to gut the ACA under President Barack Obama, Republicans now about to be in control of the White House and Congress are poised to eliminate the law that extended health insurance to millions of American families. President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to move quickly to repeal the law before articulating the complicated details of a potential replacement. Vice President-elect Mike Pence went to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to plot strategy with fellow Republicans. A senior adviser to Trump said Tuesday that after Obamacare is repealed and replaced with different health-care law, no one who has health insurance would lose their coverage. ""That is correct. We don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance,"" the adviser, Kellyanne Conway, said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" Until details are worked out, though, it's impossible to estimate the financial impact of any replacement plan on the government, the health system and those currently covered by Obamacare. In its analysis of the cost of repeal, the Committee for a Responsible Budget said the $350 billion price tag could be reduced by indirect economic benefits that would cut the long-term impact to $150 billion over 10 years. Like the health care system itself, the ACA has lots of moving parts that create costs and savings to the government and generate revenues to help pay for the plan. The committee's analysis, which used Congressional Budget Office figures, breaks them down into three main categories. The biggest savings of repealing the ACA would come from eliminating the cost of subsidizing individual health insurance and the law's expansion of government-funded, state-run Medicaid insurance. Those costs have been offset somewhat by other provisions, including penalties paid by individuals and employers who don't sign up for insurance. Eliminating all of those provisions would produce net savings of about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, according the analysis. But the ACA includes dozens of other provisions that were created to cut other costs or raise revenues to pay for providing coverage; a full repeal would also eliminate those savings and revenues. The cost savings created by the law include an estimated $1.1 trillion over 10 years, according to the committee. Those include cuts to the so-called Medicare Advantage program, controls on the growth of Medicare spending and other savings in Medicare and Medicaid costs. The law also raised taxes to help pay for itself. Eliminating them would cost the government $800 billion over 10 years, the committee said. Those include taxes paid by hospitals, providers of so-called ""Cadillac"" high-cost insurance plans and fees paid by insurers, providers and medical device makers, among others. Those taxes have been unpopular from the start, and lobbyists are already lining up to push for their repeal. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the insurance industry's trade association, American Health Insurance Plans, for example, are pushing to eliminate taxes on medical devices and ""Cadillac"" health plans. But repealing all of the ACA's tax provisions, without replacing the coverage provided by the law, will leave Republicans with a politically difficult problem, according to Joe Antos, a health policy expert at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Dropping taxes on high-income earners making more than $200,000 per year, for example, while taking away lower-income people's health insurance could produce a backlash among voters. ""They can't afford to drop that unless they can afford to come up with that money,"" Antos told NBC News. ""Whatever they do to replace they're going to need some money."" ",Here's how GOP repeal of Obamacare would swell the federal deficit
"David Silverstein, founder of management consulting firm The Lean Methods Group and BrokenHealthcare.org",01052017,CNBC,12292016,"America is in denial about the depth and breadth of the problems with its health-care system. While there is much discussion of rescinding the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), there is nothing being discussed as a substitute that begins to address the underlying problems. Denial is an awful thing. Denial can be catastrophic. What are we in denial about? An aging population? Sort of. Skyrocketing Medicare costs? Our ability to become more cost-efficient? Sure. But at the end of the day, what we are most in denial about is the hidden extent to which we are all subsidizing Medicare. Our ability to provide health care has become so advanced that our aging population is living longer with chronic, expensive health issues. We are not addressing, in a reasonable way, the problem of covering the costs of an aging population, and hospitals are taking matters into their own hands. That is creating a bigger problem for the rest of the population. The true promise of the Affordable Care Act, which was much more well intentioned than most believe, was the insurance mandate and the resulting expectation of millions of young new insurance customers. But young people aren't stupid. Even without the negative press, the cost of insurance under the ACA simply didn't strike people as being worth the investment. The combination of high premiums and high deductibles meant that younger, previously uninsured recipients would rarely receive real benefit. Insurance under the ACA actually started to behave more like catastrophic coverage. But even under that description, the cost was too high. Why? Because the premiums didn't just cover the cost of catastrophic coverage for young, healthy people. The premiums also had to subsidize coverage for chronic illness in middle-aged and older people. In many cases these preexisting conditions were uninsured (and uninsurable) until ACA. And they represent the most expensive of all patient classes. High costs were a big part of the unraveling of Obamacare. Yet those costs were necessary to subsidize the part of the ACA (preexisting conditions) that even Donald Trump has said he wants to keep. Hence the denial. While the very young — 20-somethings — quickly recognized the extent to which they would be subsidizing others under the ACA, the public hasn't yet come to grips with the Medicare equivalent, which has been going on for years (some would say decades). Right now all of us under 65 are subsidizing Medicare just about every time we seek medical care. Some of us understand this relationship and are quietly complicit, while this dynamic has created a systemic dysfunction that is becoming increasingly more evident. More from Health Care: As opioid epidemic worsens, the cost of waking up from an overdose soars Trump advisor Conway says no one will lose coverage after Obamacare repeal We are vulnerable right now to a flu epidemic: Bill Gates The most obvious evidence of dysfunction can be found in our hospital bills. We've got widespread symptoms of a colossal problem showing up in millions of mailboxes. And no one is effectively addressing either the symptoms or the problem. Because we have not yet addressed the substantial and increasing pressure Medicare puts on the health-care system, health-care bills are always variable, often unfair, and sometimes illegal. But they are sent every day. The most egregious billing inequities relate to hospitals and hospital related services such as radiology, anesthesiology, laboratories, and emergency room physician staffing. Unintelligible, inconsistent and improper billing is primarily happening where the medical practitioners do not have a personal relationship with the patient. The hospitals, under pressure from the ballooning Medicare system, is relieving the pressure where it can, through convoluted pricing, secret pricing strategies and inflated, unintelligible bills. And while not necessarily their original intent, in many cases the hospitals are taking advantage of the confusion to beef up profits (and that goes for the so-called ""nonprofits"" too). Efforts at greater transparency are nothing but a mirage designed to fool regulators and legislators — and it's working. Some recent studies conclude that pricing transparency doesn't help as much as expected. These studies — and the press reports about them — are misleading and examples of the line being fed to regulators and legislators. You can pull up the costs of a procedure, but when your doctor says you need a procedure, you are not going to shop to save $75. What they won't show you is what your doctor charges for every procedure, so you can actually shop doctors in the first place. You shop at Target or J.C. Penney or Nordstrom based on your capacity to afford it and your preferences. And you do that because you know as a consumer the level of quality and pricing you prefer. Procedure-by-procedure microtransparency is a game that has allowed the health-care industry to suggest that it's being more transparent, but is not actually giving people truly useful information. Some states have attempted to address these problems with legislation that goes largely unenforced. At the national level, legislators are loath to address the issue of medical billing, because that problem is a symptom of a bigger problem — the one for which they don't have a solution: the funding of Medicare. Hence, the state of denial. In the case of a system that is projected to ultimately consume a great share of our tax revenues, we can't wait to hit rock bottom. That would condemn us to either a decades-long depression or civil disorder that would tear the country apart. Or both. If legislators do not address the big problem, hospitals and providers will continue to relieve the pressure on their finances by passing it along to us fairly, or unfairly. That leaves it to us. Six years ago my daughter, Kailey Silverstein — now getting ready to study health-care law at law school — began questioning the absurd nature of health-care bills. Together, we began challenging the hospitals to learn the system. Collectively, we can force this issue into the open so that our nation's greatest minds can address the root of the problem. How? There is one form of denial that works: denying payment (that's right — deny, not negotiate) to providers that will not post their prices and provide fair and transparent pricing. We believe we have the right to shop for health-care services on the basis of price and any other factors we deem appropriate (quality, service, location, availability of other expertise, etc.). We believe those prices should be fairly and consistently charged to all patients. We do not believe it is ""anticompetitive"" or too complicated for hospitals to post their prices (as they currently claim) any more than it is for Target, Walmart or Amazon. We also believe that since insurance companies are acting as our agents, we are entitled to know what pricing our insurers have negotiated with which providers. Of course, everyone's fear, and what's held them back in the past, is the threat of being sent into collections. We are talking about creating legitimate disputes, not complaints. We demand information that any reasonable person would agree we need. Ultimately, nearly every bill goes to collections. The patient executes a simple power of attorney and BrokenHealthcare calls the collections agency on their behalf. We explain the dispute and remind them that they are required (by the Fair Credit and Reporting Act) to do their due diligence before making a report. We tell them that they must get the correspondence file from the hospital and that if they make a negative report without seeing to it that the questions are answered, the patient (with our assistance) will sue them. Thus far, none have dared. We also tell the patients that if the biller actually does accede to our demands, they might actually have to pay their bill. Our goal is not to get people out of their bills. That is merely a means to an end. The worst-case scenario is that someone ultimately has to pay their bill. Our goal is to get this matter into the courts and into the press. Thus far, no one has had a credit report made. If and when it happens, it will be reported as ""disputed,"" and then we will initiate legal action. It's a risk everyone takes. But there is also emerging case law that says when it comes to medical bills, you can clear a negative report by simply paying it. That's not true of other bills, which can stay on your credit for seven years. The goal of this new form of denial is to put fiscal pressure on hospitals' results. If and when enough patients deny payment, it will hopefully allow us to test current billing practices in court. If the fiscal consequences are severe enough that a provider attempts to fight back by suing someone, we'll be ready. We are building an army of volunteer attorneys prepared to represent people when the time comes. In fact, when communicating with providers and bill collectors, we've been asking them to sue the patient. Thus far, none have. Our demands are too logical. No one believes a judge or jury will ask someone to pay their bill without the provider offering adequate information. And no one has dared test it, lest they establish a precedent for all others to live by. ","Stop hidden Medicare subsidy paid by every American, fix health care"
Jake Novak,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Let's get one thing straight: Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Everyone else, including the Republican Party, lost. And boy, is the GOP about to learn this the hard way. First, President-elect Trump is not going to be shy about embarrassing them. Take Tuesday's Twitter storm and Cabinet news from Trump as an example. If anyone thought Trump favored or would ignore the House Republican's move to weaken the powers of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, they thought wrong. Trump tweeted against the move, sharply criticizing it as being a bad priority compared to the more pressing need to fix health care and taxes. The House Republicans quickly responded with an emergency meeting and reversed their plans to gut that office. That was fast. That thinking doesn't sit well with conservative thought leaders who still hold sway with a lot of Republicans. The leading critic of Trump's trade rhetoric and expected policies is Mark Levin, another former Reagan administration official, who has a nationally syndicated radio talk-show. Levin regularly slams Trump on free trade with his unique combination of historic and legal knowledge mixed with palpable anger. And he and many other conservative free traders sure don't like the other tweets Trump sent out Tuesday slamming General Motors for making some cars in Mexico that it ships backs to dealers in the U.S. tax free. It's become very clear that Trump will continue to make a lot of conservative Republicans very mad in 2017. And here's why he can get away with it: It's not just that Trump won the election and he's going to be the president. Remember that, while the general election was very close, Trump utterly gutted the GOP in the primaries. That was the real landslide of 2016 and it sends the message that he doesn't really need much from the Republican Party — especially its ideology — to succeed. Trump needed and probably still needs the official Republican label after his name, but that's about it. Based on what the GOP House members did on Monday to gut the independent ethics office and the way Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell carries himself, they still haven't gotten the memo. House Speaker Paul Ryan seems closer to understanding the state of things, but even he isn't completely on board with the new realities. Maybe after Trump proceeds with more protectionist policies or pushes for big infrastructure deficit spending projects they'll start to come out of denial. But Trump was a candidate and is going to be a president who likes fighting lots of battles all the time, and he's really not going to care much about which side he's fighting.

Under NAFTA, the automotive industry increasingly became intertwined between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, resulting in an auto parts manufacturing boom south of the border. The impact of that is clear in U.S. trade data. For instance, in the 10 months ended in October 2016, automotive vehicle and parts imports from Mexico totaled $89.6 billion, dwarfing the next biggest import nations, Canada with $54 billion and Japan, at $44 billion. While vehicles were the main imports from Canada and Japan, more than half — $46.8 billion of the automotive-related imports from Mexico — were vehicle parts in that 10-month period. U.S. government data show that car parts imports into the U.S. nearly doubled in the past five years. ""It's all to do with the fact it's a global industry. This is part of the supply chain. It's U.S. producers that produce in the U.S. It's foreign producers that produce in the U.S. It's all part of a chain,"" said Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics. Swonk said non-U.S. auto producers in the U.S. also import from Mexico, reducing imports of parts from their home countries. The North America Free Trade Agreement, adopted in 1994, was intended to create a North American market where goods could move across borders between the U.S., Canada and Mexico tariff-free. As a result, Mexican auto-related manufacturing has grown, while there have been reductions in Canada and the U.S. Canada remains the largest exporter of passenger vehicles to the U.S. — at $37.8 billion for the first 10 months of 2016. That compares with $31.4 billion from Japan. Mexico exported $19.3 billion in passenger vehicles and another $23.5 billion in trucks in the same period. In 2014, the U.S. says Mexico surpassed Canada as the biggest overall vehicle exporter, of both cars and trucks, to the U.S. Trump has for months been highly critical of Ford's plan to move more manufacturing to Mexico. On Tuesday, the company announced that it was now scrapping plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and instead would invest $700 million in the Flat Rock assembly plant in Michigan. Just before the Ford announcement, Trump criticized its rival General Motors in a tweet, for producing the Cruze in Mexico and then importing it into the U.S. tax free. ""Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax,"" the president-elect said in a post on Twitter. GM later said that it built the Cruze hatchback in Mexico for global markets with a very small amount sold in the U.S. Of the 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the U.S., 185,500 were built in Lordstown, Ohio, the company said. The Cruze and the small car Ford was expecting to build in Mexico have fallen out of favor, as cheaper gasoline has sent drivers toward SUVs and other larger vehicles. GM is expected to curtail a third shift in its Lordstown plant, eliminating 1,250 positions there. Ford said it made the decision to halt the plant because of business reasons. Trump's criticism doesn't stop other manufacturers from building up operations there, including Toyota, Audi and BMW. As for parts makers, Mexico is a world-class producer, with U.S.-based TRW, Eaton, and Honeywell among the companies with units operating in Mexico. In an International Trade Administration report,  it was noted that Mexican-produced parts are 10 percent cheaper than those in the U.S., and Mexico has been aggressive in building trade deals in Latin America and Asia. Mexico is the third-largest U.S. trade partner, and there was a $58 billion trade deficit on goods in 2015. That is about the same size as the total deficit in the automotive sector trade. According to the U.S. Trade Representative's office, the vehicles category was the biggest Mexican export to the U.S. in 2015, totaling $74 billion, and exports from the U.S. totaled just $22 billion. Mexico has more than 400 parts-producing plants, according to U.S. government data. More than 2,000 companies make up the industry and 65 percent of those are foreign owned. In 2015, 60 percent of the $5 billion foreign direct investment in Mexico's automotive industry went into parts manufacturing, according to the U.S. government. Trump's idea of a border tax would complicate life for automakers, even more due to their dependence on foreign parts. The president-elect has said goods sold back by U.S. companies into the U.S. should be taxed by 35 percent at the border, but the House's proposed corporate tax overhaul includes a plan to tax all imported goods and services with no tax on exports. Proponents say the proposed border-adjusted tax is similar to valued-added taxes in other countries, and that it would create more jobs in the U.S. and make U.S. manufacturing more competitive. Opponents say it could complicate trade, create inflation and result in potential retaliation from trade partners. ""It's truly a global supply chain. Things are produced in lots of different places and assembled in lots of different places. It's hard to know what the foreign content of a car is, what percent of a car assembled here is produced somewhere else,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""At the end of the day, the strategy is to create more jobs here in the United States. I think it's a failing strategy. It's not going to work. It's not going to make a difference. I don't think this changes the number of jobs that are in the vehicle industry four years from now."" ",Trump is mad about 'made in Mexico' cars — but this is bigger
Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"CEO Mark Fields told CNBC on Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump wasn't the main factor when Ford  decided to cancel its plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. In an interview on CNBC's ""Halftime Report,"" Fields said the decision not move forward with its San Luis Potosi, Mexico, plant was due to market demand. ""The bottom line is we're not seeing the volume and the demand that we expected for that plant. And, therefore, we're looking at our capacity and saying, 'You know what, we can build that in an existing facility and use capacity that we already have,'"" he said. ""Over the last couple of years we've seen small cars markedly decline. Every year we're looking at our capacity. We're looking at our forecast for demand. It became very clear that we didn't need this plant."" On Tuesday, Ford announced it will instead invest $700 million in its Flat Rock, Michigan, plant and add 700 direct new jobs. The company said it will continue to build its Ford Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, to improve company profitability. Trump has previously slammed the company for plans to move all small-car production to Mexico, andclaimed that he helped stop Ford from shifting an entire factory from Kentucky to Mexico. Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants. Fields said the company informed Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence about its decision. He said they were ""very happy"" about the new investments in the U.S. ""And we mentioned also at the same time this is what we do as a business,"" he said. ""Listen, we're a global multinational. Our home is here in the U.S. It's really important for us to be strong and vibrant here in our home, and build on the investment in job creation we've been able to produce over the last five years."" Fields also pointed out that the company could do well with a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under Trump. ""We see the pro-growth policies that he's proposing. So, this is a vote of confidence in what we think the president-elect is going to pursue and it's right for our business,"" he said. ","Ford CEO: Main reason for canceling Mexico plant was market demand, not Trump"
Adam Levy,01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Amazon. In CEO Jeff Bezos' annual letter to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders from April 2016, he highlighted the company's three pillars: Prime (its $99-a-year membership), Marketplace (where it sells items), and Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing business). All three have been instrumental to Amazon's success over the past decade-plus and Bezos wrote, ""I assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth [pillar]."" It looks like that fourth pillar could be the Echo smart speaker featuring the Alexa digital assistant. It's been two years since Amazon unveiled the Echo, which can serve as a hub for other smart-home devices like thermostats and lightbulbs, and its functionality has been extended through third-party ""skills,"" which function like voice-controlled apps. Amazon has the scale and infrastructure necessary to grow the Echo and Alexa into its fourth pillar. Nobody expects using voice-activated digital assistants will replace using smartphones or desktop computers, not even Bezos. However, there's clearly a growing trend toward using voice search and interacting with digital assistants. Google recently released a device similar to Echo, Google Home, in order to take advantage of the trend. Additionally, the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary said voice searches tripled over the last two years. As the artificial intelligence (AI) powering these devices improves, their usefulness increases. And as they're used more, the AI improves, creating a virtuous cycle. Amazon has a first-mover advantage in the smart speaker category, and its success with its Kindle line gives consumers confidence in its brand. But Amazon's biggest advantage with the Echo and Alexa is how it can integrate its existing Prime and Marketplace pillars into its Echo business. One of the primary ways Google is considering monetizing voice searches is through commerce. It recently released a development kit for retailers and service providers to create apps for Google Assistant -- the AI powering Google Home and found in several other Google apps -- to connect with potential customers. Eventually, Google plans to take a cut of sales made through these apps. But Amazon already has a direct line to customers and a huge marketplace of items -- one of its three pillars. Customers can order products using Alexa, and Amazon will use your order history to figure out what you want or choose an item based on user reviews and pricing. Of course, that feature is only available to Prime members -- urging more customers to sign up for the service. Non-members can still ask Alexa to add items to their cart for checkout later, but they'd have to finish ordering the old-fashioned way and using your fingers to buy stuff online is so 2014. As such, Alexa serves to support Amazon's Marketplace and Prime and vice versa. Similarly, Prime supports the  Marketplace business by increasing customer loyalty and attracting new third-party sellers to the platform. That, in turn, brings more Prime-eligible products to the Marketplace, increasing the value of Prime. Adding Alexa to the mix strengthens the other two pillars, making it another pillar. Amazon is putting a lot of money behind marketing Alexa. It's been running a television and digital video ad campaign over the last year, including a Super Bowl commercial starring Alec Baldwin. Amazon produced over 100 10-second spots for the campaign based on real-life use cases of the voice assistant. Most recently, Amazon struck a deal with Wynn Hotels to put an Echo device in each of Wynn's 4,748 Las Vegas hotel rooms. The device will be able to control the lights, temperature, drapes, and TV, with potentially more features to come. It's a clever marketing ploy that will introduce thousands of people to the Echo and allow them to have a firsthand experience using it. Behind the scenes, Amazon has over 1,000 employees working on Alexa, according to Bezos. He also said the current functionality of Alexa is ""just the tip of the iceberg."" It's clear from its investments that Amazon sees the huge potential of Alexa. It's not just a stand-alone product, but a potential pillar of its business that supports its other operations -- specifically, Marketplace and Prime. ","

Adam Levine-Weinberg,01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Two years ago, department store giant Macy's (NYSE:M) decided to explore the possibility of creating a Macy's off-price business. After years of market share losses to off-price retailers like TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), it made sense for Macy's to try moving into this growing segment of the retail market. The first six Macy's Backstage pilot stores opened in the New York metro area during fall 2015. During 2016, Macy's further developed its off-price business by opening a handful of Backstage off-price stores within existing Macy's locations. The company has been particularly pleased with the economics of the store-within-a-store concept. Macy's has started adding Backstage off-price stores to some of its full-line locations. Image source: Author. I visited one of the stores-within-a-store -- at the Galleria in White Plains, New York -- on New Year's Eve. What I saw suggested that adding Backstage off-price sections to Macy's full-line stores could be a profitable strategy in many cases. There was plenty of apparel to be found at the Macy's Backstage store. Image source: Author. One of the biggest risks of putting an off-price store within a full-line location is that it could cannibalize sales from the rest of the store. Why would customers pay full price when they can find the same items for less in a different part of the store? (TJX has had great success marketing T.J. Maxx and Marshalls as offering department store-type merchandise for 20%-60% less.) There were plenty of racks of clothing in the Macy's Backstage store. As a result, the full-price and off-price sections of this Macy's store are competing with one another to some extent. On the other hand, Macy's management has emphasized that the Backstage stores also carry a lot of merchandise that wouldn't be found in a typical Macy's. Toys and home decor have been two particularly successful non-traditional merchandise categories. Macy's Backstage stores sell toys and other items that regular Macy's stores don't offer. Image source: Author. Based on the overall merchandise selection and store configuration, the Macy's Backstage store looked eerily similar to a Marshalls store I visited later the same day. There was a wide range in the amount that items were marked down at the Macy's Backstage location I visited. Two pairs of pants on the same clothing rack illustrate the range of discounts. The first pair of pants was priced at $19.99 compared to a $36 MSRP: a modest 44% discount. The other pair was marked down to $9.98 from a $59.50 MSRP and had a yellow ""buy one get one free"" tag. This meant it was effectively selling for more than 90% off. Some Macy's Backstage merchandise is deeply discounted. Image source: Author. Even moderately discounted merchandise could make Macy's Backstage an attractive option for many shoppers. For customers, part of the appeal of TJX's business model is that there are good deals available no matter when you shop. By contrast, Macy's full-line stores tend to rely on coupons, a steady stream of ""one-day sales,"" and other promotions to drive customer traffic. If there aren't good deals available in the Macy's full-line store on a given day, the availability of 40%-50% discounts in the Macy's Backstage could keep customers from walking out and going to T.J. Maxx or Marshalls instead. The furniture section of the full-line store looked like a ghost town when I visited. Image source: Author. The main level of the White Plains Macy's store was fairly busy when I visited. That part of the store features the jewelry and beauty sections and most of the men's and women's apparel. By contrast, the home section on the lower level was nearly deserted. The Macy's Backstage store occupies perhaps a quarter to a third of the lower level. Given the lack of traffic in the surrounding home department, the Backstage store doesn't have to meet a very high bar to be a better use of space. Macy's management has indicated that, on average, adding a Backstage store to a full-line Macy's increases the sales for that location. Sure enough, the White Plains Macy's Backstage was quite busy. It was a fairly dramatic contrast with the rest of the lower level. The first floor location has the secondary benefit of providing an exterior entrance from Main St. directly to the Macy's Backstage store, which is prominently advertised on the street outside. There were plenty of shoppers at Macy's Backstage on New Year's Eve. Image source: Author. At this point, the Macy's Backstage store-within-a-store concept is less than a year old. Clearly, Macy's is still within the test-and-learn stage. However, based on my visit to the new Backstage store in White Plains, New York, this concept looks very promising. Macy's full-line stores already rely on coupons and discounts to drive customer traffic. Very little merchandise is sold at full price. Thus, investors may be exaggerating the downside risk of Macy's Backstage cannibalizing full-price sales. Meanwhile, with mall traffic on the decline, most Macy's stores have more space than they really need. Installing a Macy's Backstage store could significantly improve the sales productivity of these locations, leading to higher overall profitability. ","

Shares of electric-car maker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared 17.5% in December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock's rise helped it recover some of its pullback earlier in the year. The Tesla Model S. Image source: The Motley Fool. There's no surefire reason for Tesla's 17.5% gain during the month, but one did stand out as the most likely catalyst for at least a portion of the gain. Tesla stock had pulled back in the weeks following the U.S. presidential election, perhaps because investors were concerned about how Tesla could be impacted during Trump's time as president. Trump has expressed disbelief about global warming and outlined actions for eliminating some government spending related to climate change. But sentiment about how Tesla might fare with Trump as president turned rosier when the president-elect started cozying up to Elon Musk. Trump invited the Tesla CEO to his tech summit meeting in New York City, and even appointed him to his Strategic and Policy Forum. So, Tesla stock may have simply rebounded in December from a sell-off spurred by an overreaction to Trump's election. Of course, there were probably other factors driving the rebound, such as the S&P 500's overall 2% gain during this period, but Trump's warming up to Musk was likely one of the main catalysts for Tesla stock during the month. Investors shouldn't read too much into month-to-month moves like this, but it is notable to see Trump keeping Musk close to his side. Still, investors may want to keep an eye on any political action during Trump's presidency that could impact Tesla. ","

"Alex Dumortier, CFA",01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There is a simple reason I won't buy shares of Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA): I don't trust founder-CEO Elon Musk. Let me explain. It's not that I think Musk is fundamentally dishonest, but rather that his grand unifying vision for his company has blinded him to his responsibility to minority shareholders and to the risks he is asking them to bear. The Tesla Motors acquisition-rescue of SolarCity Corp. is all the evidence I need to support that proposition. In a deal with as much potential for conflict of interest as this one, I think Musk had a personal obligation to spell out the enormous risks associated with the acquisition in a clear and forthright manner, instead of letting the lawyers address them in legalese in the pages of a securities filing. He didn't. Image source: Getty Images. If you're reading this article, I assume you're probably familiar with the conflicts of interest I refer to above, but let me recap the most obvious ones for those readers who aren't: Allow me to draw on one of the lessons that 50 years of stewardship of Berkshire Hathaway taught CEO Warren Buffett. As he wrote in his golden anniversary annual letter (emphasis mine): Tesla gave away 0.11 of its shares for every SolarCity share. Here is what I think they received in return, in terms of intrinsic value: zero. That's what I think SolarCity is worth as a going concern. It isn't profitable, either under GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) or on a cash basis. The most recent estimates have SolarCity recording an accounting loss of close to a billion dollars in 2017, following an estimated $925 million loss in 2016. By the end of the third quarter of 2016, SolarCity's cash had declined to $259 million from $373 million 12 months prior -- despite having issued debt and equity totaling $849 million (net basis) over that period. Yet Tesla touted as a financial benefit of the acquisition that it ""is expected to be additive to Tesla's cash balance... We expect SolarCity to add more than half a billion dollars in cash to Tesla's balance sheet over the next 3 years."" Here's to wishing! With the acquisition by Tesla, SolarCity has found a lifeline such that financial distress is no longer imminent. However, to justify the acquisition on any basis other than as a rescue operation, you have to buy into Musk's vision of the rich synergies between the two businesses. I don't. As New York University finance professor and valuation expert Aswath Damodaran wrote in September: I don't think that Tesla's Solar City acquisition passes [either] the smell test (for conflict of interest) [or] the common sense test (of creating value), but I am not a shareholder in either Tesla or Solar City and I don't get a vote. When Tesla shareholders vote, given that owning the stock is by itself an admission that they buy into the Musk vision, I would not be surprised if they go along with his recommendations. Tesla shareholders and Elon Musk are a match made in market heaven and I wish them the best of luck in their life together. (Note: Tesla shareholders approved the acquisition on Nov. 17, and the deal closed five days later.) Like Damodaran, I'm not a Tesla shareholder. I respect Musk for his entrepreneurial vision and for what he has achieved, but there is a fine line between visionary drive in emerging industries and recklessness. As far as I'm concerned, buying or holding Tesla Motors shares at this point has more to do with blind faith than investing. ","

When I toured Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) Gigafactory in July, it was  already a massive structure. With an 800,000-square-foot footprint and 1.9 million square feet of manufacturing space when including the building's several levels, the factory would take hours to walk through. Even more, the company had already tooled significant portions of the factory and had begun streamlining production of Tesla Energy packs (the cells used in the packs were still made in Japan). Tesla's Gigafactory (with Model 3 sitting outside) when I visited last July. Image source: author. But a tour of the Gigafactory today would reveal some massive changes. First, in less than six months, the building's total footprint has doubled to 1.9 million square feet and its operational square feet is 2.6 times what it was, at 4.9 million square feet. Second -- and perhaps more important for Tesla's business -- the company has already begun mass production of lithium-ion battery cells at the factory. ""Today at the Gigafactory, Tesla and Panasonic began mass production of lithium-ion battery cells,"" Tesla announced in a blog post on Wednesday. Tesla said it will be mass producing its new high-performance cylindrical ""2170 cell,"" which CEO Elon Musk has said is both the highest energy density cell in the world and is also the cheapest. Production of battery cells for qualification purposes started at the Gigafactory last month, the company said. But today's production is meant for Tesla's energy storage products, including its Powerwall 2 and its Powerpack 2 energy storage products. And Model 3 is up next, with cell production for the vehicle's batteries scheduled to begin in Q2. Tesla's ability to quickly expand production from energy storage packs to battery cells for energy storage products and its Model 3 continues to highlight the company's aggressive and unique construction approach of building the Gigafactory in phases so that Tesla, Panasonic, and other Tesla partners can begin manufacturing immediately in finished sections. ""Our phased approach also allows us to learn and continuously improve our construction and operational techniques as we continue to drive down the cost of energy storage,"" the company explained. Tesla Gigafactory as of Jan. 3, 2016. Image source: Tesla Motors. The beginning of cell production at Tesla's Gigafactory is good news for investors. With Tesla planning to launch its lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3 in the second half of 2017, the company will need Gigafactory-based cell production both for its lower cell costs and its higher-volume cell production. One interesting takeaway from this news is that by bringing cell production to the U.S., Model 3 will likely become the world's most American-made vehicle. After Tesla brings cell production from Japan to the U.S. for its vehicles, the percentage of content in its vehicles made in the U.S. could jump from around 55% to around 90% -- a figure that would give Model 3 more American-made content than any other vehicle. Model 3. Image source: Tesla Motors. Furthermore, Tesla's narrative of U.S. job creation is arguably an important factor as President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Tesla's emphasis on U.S. job creation will likely resonate with one of the president's biggest priorities: boosting U.S.-based manufacturing. Musk has said the Gigafactory will directly employ around 10,000 people at peak production, and Tesla estimates the factory will indirectly create between 20,000 to 30,000 additional jobs in surrounding regions. For Tesla, this is just the beginning. The company reminded investors today that while Gigafactory construction has progressed by leaps and bounds, the factory is less than 30% done. Tesla's ambition for the factory is enormous. By 2018, it plans to produce about 35 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion battery cell capacity per year, or about as much as the rest of the world's battery production combined today. And when the structure is complete, the Gigafactory will be the biggest building in the world measured by footprint. ","

No one should celebrate the slow-motion demise of once-venerable retailer Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ), but it's been a long time since the department store was where America shopped. And because Sears and its sister company Kmart are merely shells of their former selves after they destroyed so much value over the years for employees, customers, and investors, there may be a group of stakeholders secretly hoping the end comes soon: shopping malls. Image source: Mike Mozart via Flickr. Anchor stores were once the lifeblood of the shopping mall, drawing both customers and other tenants. But retail and the malls have changed a lot since then, and anchor stores today exist more in name only. Consumers are more likely to shop the smaller retailers in the mall than stop in at the big department stores. The chains themselves realize this, which is why they're closing down hundreds of stores. Macy's (NYSE: M) announced in August it would be closing 100 stores in early 2017, on top of the dozens of others it closed over the past few years. J.C. Penney has closed 74 stores over the past two years. Kohl's closed 18 stores in 2016. Wal-Mart said a year ago it would be closing 154 stores in the U.S., though most were its small-footprint Express stores. Real estate information firm CoStar has estimated nearly 1 billion square feet of retail space will need to be ""rationalized"" over the next few years. This could take the form of store closures, conversion to another use, or ""rent roll downs."" CoStar has reported that annual department-store retail sales tumbled 28% from their peak in 1999 to 2015. Sales per square foot have reportedly fallen to $330 from $350 a decade ago and many retailers want to get a break on the rent they pay. Certainly, mall operators such as General Growth Properties, Simon Property Group, and Macerich might agree to rent reductions for some of their tenants to help them survive the transition of retail from physical locations to online -- some analysts estimate half of all retail sales may come from the online channel by 2030 -- but they might also be rooting for anchors like Sears Holdings to go bankrupt so they can rent the space for more money. Image source: Nicholas Eckhart via Flickr. Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG), the real estate investment trust that Sears Holdings Chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert created in 2015 to serve as the vehicle to help the retailer monetize its asset portfolio, is making a mint off the company's woes. The REIT is taking Sears stores and carving them up into smaller parcels and renting out the space to other retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS), Petsmart, and outlet department stores such as Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off 5th. But where a Sears or Kmart store paid bargain-basement rents of just $4.39 per square foot, it's turning around and jacking the rents up on the new tenants. According to the REIT's last quarterly SEC filing, Seritage is getting rent that averages $12.24 per square foot, while on the most recent leases it's signed with tenants who haven't yet moved in -- some 55 leases in all -- it is getting $19.25 per square foot. Sears is also doing that with some of its stores, leasing out space to third-party retailers, and Macy's has entered into a strategic alliance with Brookfield Asset Management to map out a ""predevelopment plan"" for half of the 100 stores it will be closing. This was obviously a good deal for Seritage, but it does come with substantial risk because the REIT's operations are predicated on Sears' continuing to exist and pay it rent, which it uses to finance its redevelopment projects. A bankruptcy by the retailer could cause the whole strategy to implode. A Sears store transformed. Image source: Heritage Growth Properties. Not necessarily so with the malls that Sears and Kmart occupy. While a Sears Holdings bankruptcy might lead malls to suddenly face the prospect of being flooded with zombie retail space, they would have the chance to redevelop the stores themselves and attract new tenants who would pay them, and not Seritage, significantly higher rents. Of course, a Sears Holdings bankruptcy carries risks for them, too. As noted, many retailers are reducing their footprints, not expanding them, so filling up the space may not be so simple, and for malls not in desirable locations, Sears Hodlings' demise could be catastrophic. Credit Suisse says some 184 malls can be classified as ""least valuable property"" -- meaning at risk of shutting down -- and, concernedly, Sears is the anchor store in 110 of them. A Sears Holdings bankruptcy and the wave of store closings that would follow could very well jeopardize their existence. Even so, Seritage reports that its stores enjoy a 99.3% occupancy rate. Of course, that's because most of the properties are still occupied by Sears, but its experience demonstrates there is pent-up demand for the retailer's vacated stores. In fact, in 31 properties, Seritage has joint venture agreements with the mall operators themselves, so they're already realizing some of the benefits from Sears Holdings' slow death. An orderly exit would likely produce the best result for everyone involved, but if Sears Holdings' precarious financial situation finally overwhelms it, you might not find as many mall operators lamenting the outcome as expected.

    Are Malls Secretly Hoping Sears Holdings Goes Bankrupt? -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. Shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) rocketed 224% higher in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Impressive growth in all of its major businesses -- including gaming, data center, and automotive -- in addition to optimistic growth expectations led investors to pile into the stock throughout 2016. Shares of NVIDIA bottomed out in February, followed by a steady rise over the next eight months. NVIDIA handily beat revenue and earnings estimates when it reported earnings in February, May, and August, with its gaming business in particular proving resilient despite a weak PC market. The launch of NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, which currently includes the high-end GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, and the more mainstream GTX 1060, GTX 1050 Ti, and GTX 1050, was by all indications a major success. NVIDIA's third-quarter report in November was a blowout. The company beat analyst estimates for revenue by $310 million, growing sales by nearly 54% year over year. The gaming business accelerated, producing $1.244 billion of revenue, up from just $761 million during the prior-year period. Automotive sales came in at $127 million, up 60% year over year. The star of the show was the data center business. The data center segment generated $240 million of revenue, nearly tripling compared to the third quarter of the previous year. NVIDIA's focus on pushing its graphics cards for deep learning and artificial intelligence acceleration paid off in a big way, and the stock exploded higher as a result. NVDA data by YCharts. With NVIDIA now trading around 9.4 times trailing-12-month sales and 47 times earnings, investors are betting that NVIDIA can keep up its rapid growth rate. The big opportunity for NVIDIA is artificial intelligence (AI), which will require processing power that NVIDIA's graphics cards are well suited to provide. An analyst estimated in November that AI represents a $15 billion opportunity for chip companies, noting that NVIDIA is in prime position to benefit. Whether NVIDIA can continue to grow so quickly, particularly its gaming business, which will face new competition from AMD's Vega graphics cards next year, is an open question. The growth opportunities in automotive and AI acceleration could be huge, but the stock may already be pricing them in. NVIDIA will need to deliver incredible growth in order to keep investors happy. Anything less could lead to a lackluster 2017 for the stock. ","

Trump has vaguely offered Apple incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back, and while Apple and Foxconn are considering the idea, there are many hurdles that are arguably impossible to overcome. If anything, the company would likely rather kill U.S. manufacturing if it could, including its last vestige of domestic assembly, the Mac Pro. A couple of recent reports further underscore why Apple would be unable to bring iPhone production stateside, at least in any meaningful way beyond small political gestures (like the Mac Pro was, which is already a financial and operational headache for the company). iPhones aren't the only Apple products assembled in China. Image source: Apple. A map of Apple's suppliers by geography. All those Asian suppliers aren't moving halfway across the world. Image source: Apple. For these smaller companies, the prospect of expanding in the U.S. would be prohibitively expensive due to higher labor costs, operating costs, and regulatory costs given the U.S.'s more stringent environmental regulations. There are also concerns around the demographics of the labor pool, with Chinese workers typically being younger than their U.S. counterparts. One of the key benefits of assembling in China is the close proximity to suppliers, which dramatically simplifies operations and reduces logistics costs. It also allows for flexibility to tweak and adapt manufacturing processes as challenges arise. So don't expect Apple to start bringing those jobs back en masse. Sorry, Trump. ","

Ashraf Eassa,01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Website Fudzilla recently noticed that performance results of the recently announced Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 835 mobile processor -- the company's latest chip aimed at premium smartphones -- leaked online. The site says that the Snapdragon 835 has ""left Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) much quoted peak score of 172,644 for its A10 chipset for dead,"" with a score of 181,434. Image source: Getty Images. I took the opportunity to run the performance test used to compare the two chips -- called AnTuTu -- on my iPhone 7 Plus. And the findings seem to paint the complete opposite picture to what Fudzilla says. The total score my iPhone 7 Plus achieved was 189,105 -- a bit ahead of the supposed results of the new Qualcomm chip. AnTuTu is a test that's made up of many sub-tests, including 3D graphics, CPU, and ""user experience."" Let's take a closer look at how the A10 chip inside of the iPhone 7 Plus stacks up against these Snapdragon 835 scores -- if they are, indeed, legitimate. The A10 contains two sets of custom-designed processors. The ""high-performance"" cores are called Hurricane while the ""high efficiency"" cores, which handle less processor intensive tasks, are known as Zephyr. The Snapdragon 835 uses a similar processor configuration, except it has performance and efficiency clusters, each with four processor cores each. AnandTech says that the cores are ""semi-custom"" cores based on ARM's Cortex A-series designs tailored specifically for Qualcomm's needs. According to the leak that Fudzilla references, the Snapdragon 835 scores 10230 in the CPU Mathematics sub-test, 11924 in the CPU Common Use sub-test, and 15705 in the CPU Multi-Core sub-test. The A10 in my iPhone 7 Plus achieves scores of 19825, 18570, and 14287 in each of these sub-tests, respectively. This means that per-core, Apple's cores are much faster than Qualcomm's, though there are half as many, and in multi-core applications -- ones that can use Apple's two high-performance cores and Qualcomm's four high-performance cores -- Apple's A10 slightly trails the Snapdragon 835. The AnTuTu test also includes two 3D graphics sub-tests -- 3D Garden and 3D Marooned. The leak shows that the Snapdragon 835 scores 29499 and 45330 points in these two sub-tests, respectively. The A10, on the other hand, achieves 29353 and 30206 in these sub-tests, respectively. This suggests that the Snapdragon 835 has a superior graphics sub-system -- not a surprise, as Qualcomm has traditionally been very strong in graphics compared to the co0mpetition. Finally, in the RAM, which seemingly tests the performance of the memory subsystem of the chip, the Snapdragon 835 apparently gets a score of 10532, while the A10 achieves a score of 12805. Summing up the ""user experience"" subtests, the A10 achieves 64059 points; the Snapdragon 835 leak shows a combined score here of 52865. Although the Snapdragon 835 is more powerful than the Apple A10 in graphics performance, and although it integrates a gigabit LTE modem -- the A10 doesn't include any LTE modem -- the A10 more than holds its own in CPU performance, memory performance, and ""user experience"" performance as measured by AnTuTu. This means that buyers of the iPhone 7/7 Plus shouldn't worry about their devices becoming ""outdated"" from a performance perspective – these will still be best-in-class devices that can hold their own against the many Android-based flagship devices powered by the Snapdragon 835 that are likely to launch in the spring. And when Apple releases the iPhone 7s/8-series smartphones in the fall, I expect Apple's devices to regain decisive performance leadership in graphics while extending Apple's leadership in CPU performance.

Julian E. Barnes,01052017,MarketWatch,12292016,"Published: Jan 5, 2017 3:04 a.m. ET President-elect has been harsh critic of spy agencies, believes they’re too politicized By WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump, a harsh critic of U.S. intelligence agencies, is working with top advisers on a plan that would restructure and pare back the nation’s top spy agency, people familiar with the planning said, prompted by a belief that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has become bloated and politicized. The planning comes as Trump has leveled a series of social media attacks in recent months and the past few days against U.S. intelligence agencies, dismissing and mocking their assessment that the Russian government hacked emails of Democratic groups and individuals and then leaked them last year to WikiLeaks and others in an effort to help Trump win the White House. One of the people familiar with Trump’s planning said advisers also are working on a plan to restructure the Central Intelligence Agency, cutting back on staffing at its Virginia headquarters and pushing more people out into field posts around the world. The CIA declined to comment on the plan. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was established in 2004 in large part to boost coordination between intelligence agencies following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. Many Republicans have proposed cutting the ODNI before, but this has proven hard to do in part because its mission centers are focused on core national security issues, such as counterterrorism, nuclear proliferation, and counterintelligence.

Jeffry Bartash,01052017,MarketWatch,12292016,"Published: Jan 4, 2017 11:21 a.m. ET Full Obamacare repeal could cost $350 billion, new study finds By WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Incoming Vice President Mike Pence and outgoing President Barack Obama rallied allies in Congress on Wednesday amid a pending showdown over a conservative move to kill Obamacare. After a meeting with House Republicans, Pence said in a press conference that erasing the law officially known as the Affordable Care Act will be the administration’s top priority. “The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare,” Pence said. “We need to reverse the damage done.” At the same time, Obama met with House Democrats to plot ways to slow the Republican drive and defend parts of his signature law. Republicans already control the House and Senate, and after Trump takes office later this month they’ll have the power to gut Obamacare. ""We have 6 months to work out Obamacare replacement. We don't have a plan today""-@RepChrisCollins after Pence mtg. pic.twitter.com/BHPwTIS1uN Although repeal of the law is a virtual certainty, it’s far from clear what will replace it. Republican leaders said they are exploring a variety of market-based options that would lower costs, give Americans more choice and reduce government’s role in the health care system. Yet Republicans are expected to leave parts of the law in place as they work out a replacement. “We don’t want people to be caught with nothing,” said Paul Ryan, speaker of the House. Democrats were skeptical. They contend the elimination of Obamacare will “make America sick again,” a twist on Trump’s campaign theme. “They don’t have a replacement plan,” said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats. “To repeal and delay is an act of cowardice” that could jeopardize the health care of millions of Americans, especially seniors who receive Medicare. Whatever the case, doing away with Obamacare won’t come cheap. A new study by a bipartisan budget think tank says full repeal could cost the U.S. government as much $350 billion over the next 10 years if nothing replaces it. Stronger economic growth could reduce the price tag to $150 billion, but at the cost of leaving 23 million Americans who now have health insurance without it, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Since some features of Obamacare have proven popular, Republicans are likely to retain those aspects of the law. But that would add to the government’s costs and complicate the task of Congress. “It is imperative that policymakers avoid a return to the rapid and unsustainable health care cost growth that threatened and in many ways continues to threaten families, businesses, and our nation’s fiscal future,” the CRFB said. Conservatives argue that a more market-based approach will increase competition in the health-care market and lead to lower prices. Yet health-care costs in the U.S., already the highest in the industrial world, have increased rapidly for years despite repeated efforts to contain them. Although premiums slowed after Obamacare, they are on the rise again. ","Pence, Obama rally troops in Congress as Obamacare showdown looms - MarketWatch"

Jordan Hill, 18, of suburban Carpentersville, Ill., and Tesfaye Cooper, 18, Brittany Covington, 28, and Tanishia Covington, 24, all of Chicago, face charges of aggravated kidnapping, hate crimes, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the Chicago Sun-Times and other local media reported.

VRScout, a Los Angeles–based virtual-reality media company, will be on hand at the Obama farewell address at the McCormick Place convention complex in Chicago to broadcast the live 360-degree version of the speech. The White House confirmed the broadcast and the inaugural live virtual-reality video to MarketWatch. Ryan Bell, head of studio at VRScout, said he’d spoken with White House representatives beginning in October about the immersive broadcast experience. This is the largest event thus far for the company, which was founded in January 2015, and Bell said virtual-reality broadcast is the next step in presidential media. “We look at it as similar to the first time a president was put on television or a president was put on the radio,” Bell said. The farewell address is scheduled to take place the evening of Jan. 10 at the convention center on the Lake Michigan shoreline south of downtown Chicago. For the broadcast, VRScout partnered with camera rental and production company Radiant Images and with virtual-reality company Vantage.tv. The company will be working with those partners to shoot the speech with Nokia Ozo virtual-reality cameras. VR Scout hopes to have three cameras at the speech so the company can shoot from different vantage points and toggle among feeds.

She ditched her bad lip syncing by the time she got to her second song, “We Belong Together” — blaming a lack of rehearsals for the on-stage nightmare. “I wanted a holiday too. Can’t I just have one?” she huffed into the mic just before sauntering off stage in a hip-hugging pink bedazzled bodysuit followed by her back-up dancers holding massive feathered wings. Carey is a holiday performer mainstay due to her various Christmas albums. In the last two years, she performed at both the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rockefeller Christmas Tree lighting.

The famous “Hollywood” sign in Los Angeles was vandalized early Sunday to read “Hollyweed” — celebrating the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in California, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Surveillance footage caught one person dressed in all black sneaking up to the iconic sign around 3 a.m. and spending about an hour and a half transforming the “O’s” to “E’s” using white tarps, according to Sgt. Robert Payan of the Security Services office. Payan said authorities are reviewing security footage to try to track down the trespasser, but have not made any arrests. “We can’t even tell if it’s a male or a female,” he said. Hollyweed!!!  I think security took the night off last night in Hollywood👀. pic.twitter.com/ycQXzjsyjG He’s unsure how long it took the prankster to get up to the 45-foot sign, which sits atop Mount Lee and overlooks Hollywood. “It’s a good hike,” Payan said. “And at that time of day, it’s very dark so it probably took a little longer.” The sign was restored by 2 p.m. Sunday. Recreational marijuana officially became legal in the state on Dec. 15. The state already had legalized medical marijuana for more than two decades. This is not the first time the “Hollywood” sign has been changed to “Hollyweed.” Back on Jan. 1, 1976, the sign was altered — again a visual commemoration of a marijuana law taking effect. 1976 vs 2017 WHO WORE IT BETTER? #hollyweed pic.twitter.com/hiIQbEundI This report originally appeared on NYPost.com.

On a most-active basis, the U.S. benchmark futures contract saw a nearly 45% calendar-year rise and a more-than-8% jump in December, fueled in part by expectations members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers will abide by an agreement to curb output. The annual rise was the first in two years, “and while the market saw a rocky road to get to this point with wild swings and at times historic volatility, the surge into the end of the year may have set a low in oil that could last for years,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, in a note.

                                   Brent crude on London’s ICE Futures exchange declined 22 cents, or 0.4%, to $56.63 a barrel. The global benchmark saw an annual rise of 52%, which was also its largest yearly rise since 2009. Trading remained tepid ahead of the New Year holiday. Global oil markets will be closed Monday. Futures saw little reaction to data from oil-services firm Baker Hughes, which reported that the number of active U.S. oil rigs rose by two in the latest week to 525. It was a volatile year for oil futures, indeed. The U.S. benchmark extended a rout in the beginning of the year that took it to a nearly 13-year low below $27 a barrel, before beginning a rebound that more than doubled the price of crude. Energy Information Administration data on Thursday showed that U.S. crude inventories grew 614,000 barrels in the week ended Dec. 23, a moderate rise compared with the 4.2-million barrels increase tipped by the industry group American Petroleum Institute, but still above the 1.2-million barrel contraction forecast by analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. At 486.1 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are near the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year, the EIA said. Read: The big winners in commodities—and why the rally will run into 2017 “The main driver behind last week’s build was a slowdown in refinery activity,” said S&P Global Platts, noting that the refinery utilization rate fell 0.5% to 91% of total capacity. This is the time of the year when crude stocks usually fall, as refiners increase production. Gasoline stocks decreased by 1.6 million barrels, while distillates fuel inventories dropped by 1.9 million barrels in the same week. Oil production also fell by 20,000 barrels from a week earlier, to 8.76 million barrels, roughly 4.4% lower than same period last year. Analysts say the current downtrend in U.S. oil production could reverse as oil prices rise, frustrating OPEC’s latest effort to lift prices by cutting the group’s overall output. In November, after more than two years of low prices, the cartel and 11 non-OPEC players in a landmark pact agreed to slash production by almost 1.8 million barrels a day. If fully implemented, the move could push oil prices to the $60 a barrel range early next year, and to $70 in 2018. “The market has more faith that the participating nations will comply with the assigned production quotas this time because everyone is eager to get the prices up,” said Gao Jian, energy analyst at SCI International. A global crude glut has plagued the oil market since mid-2014, sending prices plunging and weighing on rebound efforts. Since the inking of the deal, several OPEC members have voiced their commitment to the cut. However, most market watchers are waiting to see the production reports for the first few months of 2017 to gauge whether producers have really made good on their pledges. In the past, producers have been known to cheat and produce above their allotted limits.

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Christopher Steele, who wrote reports on compromising material Russian operatives allegedly had collected on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is a former officer in Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, according to people familiar with his career. Former British intelligence officials said Steele spent years under diplomatic cover working for the agency, also known as MI6, in Russia and Paris and at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. After he left the spy service, Steele supplied the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation with information on corruption at FIFA, international soccer’s governing body. It was his work on corruption in international soccer that lent credence to his reporting on Trump’s entanglements in Russia, U.S. officials said on Wednesday. Emails seen by Reuters indicate that, in the summer of 2010, members of a New York-based FBI squad assigned to investigate “Eurasian Organized Crime” met Steele in London to discuss allegations of possible corruption in FIFA, the Zurich, Switzerland-based body that also organizes the World Cup tournament. People familiar with Steele’s activities said his London-based company, Orbis Business Intelligence, was hired by the Football Association (FA), England’s domestic soccer governing body, to investigate FIFA. At the time, the FA was hoping to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cups. British corporate records show that Orbis was formed in March 2009. Amid a swirl of corruption allegations, the 2018 World Cup was awarded to Moscow and Qatar was chosen to host the 2022 competition. The FBI squad whose members met Steele subsequently opened a major investigation into alleged soccer corruption that led to dozens of U.S. indictments, including those of prominent international soccer officials. Senior FIFA officials, including long-time president Sepp Blatter, were forced to resign. Steele was initially hired by FusionGPS, a Washington-based political research firm, to investigate Trump on behalf of unidentified Republicans who wanted to stop Trump’s bid for the party’s nomination. The BBC said on Wednesday, “He (Steele) was compiling this report on behalf of initially Trump’s opponent Jeb Bush,” referring to one of Trump’s 16 opponents in the 2016 Republican primary. The BBC subsequently said on Thursday that its correspondent misspoke. Bush’s spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, denied any involvement between Bush and Steele. “It is absolutely not true that Governor Bush had any knowledge or involvement with this gentleman and his allegations,” Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told Reuters by phone. “It’s nothing we’ve ever seen before.” Steele was kept on assignment by FusionGPS after Trump won the nomination and his information was circulated to Democratic Party figures and members of the media. Steele’s dealings with the FBI on Trump, initially with the senior agent who had started the FIFA probe and then moved to a post in Europe, began in July. However, Steele cut off contact with the FBI about a month before the Nov. 8 election because he was frustrated by the bureau’s slow progress. The FBI opened preliminary investigations into Trump and his entourage’s dealings with Russians that were based in part on Steele’s reports, according to people familiar with the inquiries. However, they said the bureau shifted into low gear in the weeks before the election to avoid interfering in the vote. They said Steele grew frustrated and stopped dealing with the FBI after concluding it was not seriously investigating the material he had provided. Steele’s reports circulated for months among major media outlets, including Reuters, but neither the news organizations nor U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been able to corroborate them. BuzzFeed published some of Steele’s reports about Trump on its website on Tuesday, but the President-elect and his aides later said the reports were false. Russian authorities also dismissed them. Associates of Steele said on Wednesday he was unavailable for comment. Christopher Burrows, a director and co-founder of Orbis with Steele, told The Wall Street Journal, which first published Steele’s name, that he could not confirm or deny that Steele’s company had produced the reports on Trump.

                Former MI6 spy known to U.S. agencies is author of reports on Trump in Russia | Reuters"
,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump escalated a fight with U.S. spy agencies on Wednesday, just nine days before he takes over their command as president, and accused them of practices reminiscent of Nazi Germany. The Republican said leaks from the intelligence community led to some U.S. media outlets reporting unsubstantiated claims that he was caught in a compromising position in Russia. “I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it’s a disgrace, and I say that ... that’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do,” Trump told a news conference in New York. Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia likely hacked the Democratic National Committee and the emails of top Democrats during the 2016 presidential election. “I think it was Russia,” he said, pointing out that other countries were also hacking the United States. Trump’s comments about spy agencies such as the CIA are likely to intensify tensions between the intelligence community and the president-elect, who initially disparaged its conclusion that a Russian hacking campaign was aimed at boosting his candidacy against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, called a dossier that makes salacious claims about him in Russia “fake news” and “phony stuff.” U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he spoke with Trump on Wednesday evening and told the president-elect he did not believe the media leaks came from the intelligence community. “I expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security,” Clapper said in a statement. He defended including the dossier in the intelligence report Trump received on Friday, saying “part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.” Clapper said he emphasized to Trump that the dossier was not produced by the U.S. intelligence community and intelligence officials have not judged whether the information is reliable. Two U.S. officials said the allegations about Trump, which one called “unsubstantiated,” were contained in a two-page memo appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that was presented last week to Trump and to President Barack Obama. Trump said, without offering evidence, that the news he had been briefed on the memo “was released by maybe the (U.S.) intelligence agencies. Who knows? But maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that.” CNN reported on Tuesday about the existence of the memo. BuzzFeed published a fuller 35-page document produced by Christopher Steele, a former British foreign intelligence official, that outlined the allegations of compromising behavior by Trump and alleged links between him and people in Russia. The claims were included in opposition research reports that were made available to Democrats and U.S. officials last year. One U.S. official said investigators had so far been unable to confirm material about Trump’s financial and personal entanglements with Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of Russian intelligence. Some material in Steele’s reports has proved to be erroneous, the U.S. official said. In the news conference, Trump declined to answer whether anyone connected to him or the campaign had contact with Moscow during the presidential campaign, and said he had no loans or business deals with Russia. He defended his goal of better ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability,” he said. The New York real estate developer complained about leaks from meetings he has with intelligence agencies and suggested they were to blame. “I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody’s leaking it out,” he said. The long-awaited news conference was a freewheeling affair, with Trump aides cheering from the sidelines at one point and the president-elect angrily refusing to take questions from a CNN reporter. Outside, about a dozen protesters gathered behind a police barricade across the street from Trump Tower, holding signs with the slogans “Dump Trump” and “Allegiance To America Not Russia” as Fifth Avenue traffic streamed by. It was Trump’s first news conference in about six months and about 250 reporters jammed into the lobby at his Manhattan offices. Questions extended to many issues that will face him when he takes office. He vowed to soon begin negotiations with Mexico on building a border wall and said he will nominate a Supreme Court justice to fill the seat left by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia within two weeks of taking office. He also said he would offer a plan to repeal and replace Obama’s signature health care law once his choice for health and human services, Tom Price, is confirmed by the Senate. Trump gestured to large stacks of manila folders as he described how he will separate himself from his global business operations, which includes hotels and golf courses as well as assets like a winery and modeling agency, to avoid conflicts of interest once he takes office. He also talked about how he plans to bring manufacturing jobs back from overseas plants, slamming drug companies for “getting away with murder” on pricing. U.S. stocks slipped to session lows, before recovering ground, as healthcare stocks took a beating following Trump’s comments on drug pricing. ","
                Trump accuses U.S. spy agencies of Nazi practices over 'phony' Russia dossier | Reuters"
,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia hacked into Republican state political campaigns and old email domains of the Republican National Committee but there is no evidence it successfully penetrated President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign, FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday. Comey also told lawmakers Russia did not release information obtained from the state campaigns or the old RNC email domains, comments that may buttress the U.S. intelligence view that Moscow tried to help Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies on Friday released an assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a covert effort to help Republican Trump’s electoral chances by discrediting Clinton. The report, which omitted classified details, was the U.S. government’s starkest public description of what it says was a Russian effort to manipulate the American electoral process by leaking hacked emails from Democrats. Russia has denied interfering in the election but President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian suspected spies from the United States and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies last month in response to the allegations. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a news conference on Tuesday those penalties were “a start and not the end” of U.S. retaliation for the hacks, and senior officials have suggested covert action may be taken. Comey told lawmakers the Federal Bureau of Investigation  “did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign, or the current RNC, was successfully hacked.” He did not say whether Russia had tried to hack Trump’s campaign. Trump has disputed the accusations of Russian cyber attacks during the election, but his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday that the New York businessman accepts the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusions that Russia was responsible, and that further action may be taken against Moscow. Comey declined to comment on whether or not the FBI might be investigating links between Russia and associates of Trump, who frequently called during the campaign for improved relations between Washington and Moscow. The FBI director was pressed by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to publicly provide a declassified answer to the question before Jan. 20, the day Trump will be inaugurated, but Comey suggested he would unable to do so. Comey appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee along with the director of national intelligence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency and the chief of the National Security Agency at a time of controversy in Washington about the 2016 election. Testifying before Congress for the first time since Trump beat Clinton on Nov. 8, Comey has been criticized by Democrats for statements about a separate investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. The controversy over Russia’s alleged role in attempting to influence the election has roiled Washington, with Democratic lawmakers calling for an independent commission to investigate the matter and Republicans worried that the affair might call into question the legitimacy of Trump’s victory. Comey said there was evidence Russia hacked Republican state-level political campaigns and “old” email domains that the RNC was no longer using. In contrast, Friday’s report assessed that Russian military intelligence used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the Guccifer 2.0 “persona” to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats as part of the effort to help Trump and harm Clinton. The DNC denied “multiple requests” made by the FBI to examine its hacked servers, Comey said. He added that his agents relied on a forensic analysis conducted by the cyber security firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to help clean up the hack when it was detected last spring. Senior U.S. Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Tuesday seeking to impose a wide range of sanctions on Russia over its cyber activities and actions in Syria and Ukraine. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - The gunman who killed five people at a Florida airport walked calmly through the baggage claim area before wordlessly pulling a handgun from his waistband and shooting at victims who fled or dived to the floor in panic, video showed. The 20 seconds of footage published on Saturday by website TMZ, apparently from a security camera, shows the suspect carrying a bag and clothing in his left hand as he strolled with other passengers past luggage carousels at Fort Lauderdale’s airport. Without warning, he pulls out a 9mm semi-automatic handgun with his right hand and fires it repeatedly at targets off-screen. Travelers nearby can be seen reacting in horror and scrambling for cover as the shots ring out. TMZ did not say how it obtained the video. It said it had chosen to show only the seconds leading up to the first shots fired “and the panic that ensued.” Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old U.S. military veteran, was arrested after running out of ammunition and is said by authorities to be cooperating with investigators. He is due in federal court in Fort Lauderdale on Monday. Authorities say they have not ruled out terrorism as a motive. They say Santiago admitted planning the attack and told them he bought a one-way ticket to Florida from his home in Alaska. He could face the death penalty if convicted of federal charges including carrying out violence at an airport. Six people were wounded in the attack, while about three dozen suffered bruises or broken bones in the chaos as people scattered for cover. Authorities say the gunman arrived on a connecting flight from Alaska and retrieved the Walther weapon from his checked luggage before loading it in a bathroom. According to a criminal complaint, he then returned to the baggage claim and walked “while shooting in a methodical manner” some 10 or 15 times, aiming at his victims’ heads. On Saturday, it emerged that police in Alaska had taken a handgun from Santiago in November last year, but then returned it to him about a month later after a medical evaluation found he was not mentally ill. Officials say Santiago walked into an FBI office in Anchorage in November and told agents his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency. Local police then took him to a medical facility for the mental evaluation. Officials in Anchorage said the gun was given back because Santiago had not been adjudicated to be mentally ill. Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard, including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. An aunt said he returned from Iraq “a different person,” MSNBC reported. The attack was the latest in a series of U.S. mass shootings, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Police in Alaska took a handgun from the man accused of killing five people at Fort Lauderdale’s airport on Friday, but they returned it to him last month after a medical evaluation found he was not mentally ill, authorities said on Saturday. Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq war veteran, had a history of acting erratically and investigators are probing whether mental illness played a role in the latest U.S. mass shooting. According to court papers, he told agents he planned the attack and bought a one-way ticket to Florida. Santiago was charged on Saturday in federal court and could potentially face the death penalty if convicted in the case, U.S. prosecutors said. Marlin Ritzman, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s office in Anchorage, told a news conference Santiago walked into the office in November and said his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency. He was turned over to local police, who took him to a medical facility for a mental evaluation. “Santiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS (the Islamic State militant group,)” Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley told the news conference. A handgun police took from Santiago during the evaluation was returned to him early last month, Tolley told reporters. The police chief said it was not clear if it was the same weapon used on Friday. Officials in Anchorage said the gun was returned because Santiago had not been adjudicated to be mentally ill. “As far as I know, this is not somebody that would have been prohibited (from having a gun) based on the information they had,” U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler told the news conference. Investigators said they have not ruled out terrorism as a motive and that the suspect’s recent travel is being reviewed. Federal prosecutors charged Santiago with carrying out violence at an airport, causing serious bodily injury, using a firearm during a crime of violence and causing death to a person through the use of a firearm, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement. He will appear in court in Fort Lauderdale on Monday. Five people were killed and six wounded in the rampage, while about three dozen were taken to local hospitals with bruises or broken bones suffered in the chaos as passengers fled the crowded baggage claim area. Authorities say Santiago arrived in Ft. Lauderdale on a connecting flight from Alaska and retrieved a Walther 9mm semi-automatic handgun from his checked luggage before loading it in a bathroom and shooting indiscriminately. According to the criminal complaint, Santiago fired the weapon 10 to 15 times, aiming it at his victims’ heads. “He was described as walking while shooting in a methodical manner,” the complaint said. Witnesses said the gunman, who was wearing a blue “Star Wars” T-shirt, said nothing as he fired and surrendered to police only after running out of ammunition. The Broward County sheriff has said it took the first deputy about 70 to 80 seconds to contact the suspect after the first shots rang out and that when the deputy confronted him, he dropped the gun and was taken into custody. Authorities said three of the six victims who suffered gunshot wounds are in intensive care. The others are in good condition. Those killed included a volunteer firefighter in his sixties and a retiree on holiday with her husband. Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard, including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before being transferred to the inactive ready reserve in August last year. An aunt said Santiago returned from his deployment “a different person,” MSNBC reported. Santiago’s brother Bryan, who lives in Puerto Rico, told CNN he believed authorities did not do enough to help his mentally ill sibling. “They had him hospitalized for four days, and then they let him go. How are you going to let someone leave a psychological center after four days when he is saying that he is hearing voices?” Bryan Santiago told CNN. The attack was the latest in a series of U.S. mass shootings, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed. Last June, Florida was the scene of the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history, when a gunman apparently inspired by Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded 53 at the gay nightclub “Pulse” in Orlando.

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump accepts the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia engaged in cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election and may take action in response, his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday. Reince Priebus said Trump believed Russia was behind the intrusions into the Democratic Party organizations, although Priebus did not clarify whether the president-elect agreed that the hacks were directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. “He accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in Russia, so that’s not the issue,” Priebus said on “Fox News Sunday.” It was the first acknowledgment from a senior member of the Republican president-elect’s team that Trump had accepted that Russia directed the hacking and subsequent disclosure of Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election. Trump had rebuffed allegations that Russia was behind the hacks or was trying to help him win, saying the intrusions could have been carried out by China or a 400-pound hacker on his bed. With less than two weeks until his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has come under increasing pressure from fellow Republicans to accept intelligence community findings on Russian hacking and other attempts by Moscow to influence the Nov. 8 election. A crucial test of Republican support for Trump comes this week with the first confirmation hearings for his Cabinet picks. A U.S. intelligence report last week said Putin directed a sophisticated influence campaign including cyber attacks to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and support Trump. The report, commissioned by Democratic President Barack Obama in December, concluded vote tallies were not affected by Russian interference, but did not assess whether it influenced the outcome of the vote in other ways. After receiving a briefing on Friday from leaders of the U.S. intelligence agencies, Trump did not refer specifically to Russia’s role in the presidential campaign. In a statement, he acknowledged that “Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat(ic) National Committee.” Trump spokesman Sean Spicer told Reuters the president-elect’s conclusions remained the same and that Priebus’ comments were in line with Friday’s statement. Priebus’ wording did not appear to foreshadow the dramatic reversal of Trump’s apparent Russia policy that experts say would be required to deter further cyber attacks. “It will take a lot more than what we heard on television today to make Putin cool it,” the expert added. “In fact, there may not be anything that can deter Putin from pursuing a course he’s bet his future and Russia’s on,” said a U.S. intelligence expert on Russia, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss domestic political positions. The expert added that Putin’s “multifaceted campaign of cyber attacks and espionage, propaganda, financial leverage, fake news and traditional espionage” had expanded in the United States since the election, “and it will be a shock if it does not escalate in France, Germany and elsewhere this year.” Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman Trump tapped as White House chief of staff, said Trump planned to order the intelligence community to make recommendations as to what should be done. “Action may be taken,” he said, adding there was nothing wrong with trying to have a good relationship with Russia and other countries. Two senior Republican senators urged Trump to punish Russia in response to U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Putin personally directed efforts aimed at influencing the election. Appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said evidence was conclusive that Putin sought to influence the election - a point that Trump has refuted. “In a couple weeks, Donald Trump will be the defender of the free world and democracy,” Graham said. “You should let everybody know in America, Republicans and Democrats, that you’re going to make Russia pay a price for trying to interfere.” On Saturday, Trump wrote on Twitter that having a better relationship with Russia was a “good thing.” U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said three U.S. presidents had tried and failed to be friends with Putin. “I’m just not sure it’s possible,” Nunes said on the “Fox News Sunday” program. “I’ve cautioned his administration to be careful with Putin, as he remains a bad actor.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed it was not unusual for a new president to want to get along with the Russians. He added on CBS, however, that the Russians remained a “big adversary, and they demonstrated it by trying to mess around in our election.” Obama, who himself tried to “reset” relations with Russia after he took office in 2009, told NBC he did not think he had underestimated the Russian president. “But I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating,” he said in an interview with “Meet the Press” broadcast on Sunday.

                Trump acknowledges Russia role in U.S. election hacking: aide | Reuters"
,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"(Reuters) - A declassified report by U.S. intelligence agencies said  Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to help Donald Trump’s electoral chances by discrediting Democrat  Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign. The following quotes are some highlights of the report, which was drafted by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency, and released on Friday: - “Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.” - “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.” - “We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.” - “Moscow’s approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on Russia’s understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency.” - “We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.” - “Further information has come to light since Election Day that, when combined with Russian behavior since early November 2016, increases our confidence in our assessments of Russian motivations and goals.” - “Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations — such as cyber activity — with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or ‘trolls’.” - “Russia’s intelligence services conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 US presidential election, including targets associated with both major U.S.  political parties.” - “We assess with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.” - “We assess with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.” - “Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign.” - “Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards. DHS (Department of Homeland Security) assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying.” - “We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the U.S. presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against U.S. allies and their election processes.” - “Immediately after Election Day, we assess Russian intelligence began a spearphishing campaign targeting U.S. Government employees and individuals associated with U.S. think tanks and NGOs in national security, defense, and foreign policy fields. This campaign could provide material for future influence efforts as well as foreign intelligence collection on the incoming administration’s goals and plans.” ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to help Republican Donald Trump’s electoral chances by discrediting Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign, U.S. intelligence agencies said in an assessment. Russia’s objectives were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate former Secretary of State Clinton, make it harder for her to win and harm her presidency if she did, an unclassified report released on Friday by the top U.S. intelligence agency said. “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,” the report said. “We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.” Russian authorities, which have previously denied interfering in the U.S. elections, offered no immediate comment on the report on Saturday, and the reaction of the country’s media was low-key. The report, although it omitted classified details, was the U.S. government’s starkest public description of what it says was an unprecedented Russian campaign to manipulate the American body politic. Reports of Russian interference in the already divisive election have roiled Washington, even as the U.S. Congress on Friday certified Trump’s victory in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. The report’s conclusions, though lacking details of how the Russians may have relayed the material to WikiLeaks and others, will give ammunition to Democrats and Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress who want tougher action against Russia, setting the scene for a potential showdown with Trump. It could also give a boost to members of Congress seeking an independent, bipartisan investigation of Russian hacking. Trump, who has developed a rocky relationship with U.S. spy agencies and at times disparaged their work, defended the legitimacy of his election victory after receiving a nearly two-hour briefing Friday on the report. The report neither assessed “the impact Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election” nor did it provide details on the evidence underpinning its conclusions, a fact likely to keep alive the controversy over what Moscow may have done. In Moscow, state TV Channel One briefly covered the report, focusing on Trump’s comments that the interference had no impact on the outcome of the election. The broadcaster, which led its news program on Orthodox Christmas celebrations and unusually low temperatures in the Russian capital, also said the arguments used in the U.S. report had been widely mocked by Internet users. The report said U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russian military intelligence, the GRU, used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the Guccifer 2.0 “persona” to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and top Democrats as part of the effort. The release of the emails led to embarrassing media coverage for Clinton and triggered the resignation of the DNC’s chief. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and top Clinton aide John Podesta from “a state party.” However, Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. Russian actors were not found to have targeted U.S. systems that are involved in tallying votes, the report said. The report was produced by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. Also on Friday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security  designated U.S. election infrastructure as critical infrastructure, widening the options the government has to protect voting machines from cyber attacks. While the report found Russia had conducted cyber attacks on both the Democratic and the Republican parties, it made clear that the primary aims were to harm Clinton whether or not she won the election and evolved over time. “When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency,” it said. “We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” it said. The CIA and FBI had high confidence in this judgment and NSA moderate confidence, the report said. Neither the Russian Embassy in Washington, nor Clinton aides immediately responded to requests for comment. The report suggested Putin was motivated in part by personal animus toward Clinton. “Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him,” it said. In a statement after his intelligence briefing, Trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agencies’ belief Russia carried out the hacking. Instead, he said: “Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations” including the DNC. “There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,” Trump said. The businessman, who is to be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, also said he would appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office on how to prevent cyber attacks but suggested that he would keep their recommendations secret. The report did not reveal how the intelligence agencies collected the evidence underpinning their conclusions or the evidence itself, including the means by which Russian military intelligence “relayed” the materials filched from the DNC and other hacking targets to WikiLeaks and others, omissions likely to leave the report open to criticism. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who was briefed on the report on Friday, took issue with Trump’s comments. “The President-Elect’s statement that the Russian hacking had ‘absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election’ is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,” Schiff said. “It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying - which is true - it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to ... Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns,” he said. “The consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended.” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said his panel would continue to compile “facts surrounding Russia’s active measures,” adding: “This is a troubling chapter in an ongoing story.” ","
                U.S. intel report: Putin directed cyber campaign to help Trump | Reuters"
,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The CIA has identified Russian officials who fed material hacked from the Democratic National Committee and party leaders to WikiLeaks at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin through third parties, according to a new U.S. intelligence report, senior U.S. officials said on Thursday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Central Intelligence Agency and others have concluded that the Russian government escalated its efforts from discrediting the U.S. election process to assisting President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign. The intelligence assessment was presented to President Barack Obama on Thursday and will be briefed to Trump on Friday. Trump has rejected the broad intelligence community’s assessment that Russia staged cyber attacks during the election campaign to undermine Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Russia has rejected the hacking allegations. MORE FROM REUTERS* Trump says U.S. funds spent on border wall would be repaid by Mexico* Schumer emerges as Trump's newest punching bag* Beheading attire and sexy suicide vests? Satire of ISIS wives stirs anger and praise “By October, it had become clear that the Russians were trying to help the Trump campaign,” said one official familiar with the full report speaking on the condition of anonymity because the complete version is Top Secret. In some cases, one official said, the material followed what was called “a circuitous route” from the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency, to WikiLeaks in an apparent attempt to make the origins of the material harder to trace, a common practice used by all intelligence agencies, including U.S. ones. These handoffs, the officials said, enabled WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to say the Russian government or state agencies were not the source of the material published on his website. In an interview with Fox News this week, Assange said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and Clinton aide John Podesta from “a state party.” Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. Details of the report emerged as the top U.S. intelligence official, James Clapper, said on Thursday he was “even more resolute” in his belief that Russia staged cyber attacks on Democrats during the 2016 election campaign. Not all 17 intelligence agencies participated in preparing the assessment. An unclassified version of the report is expected to be released on Friday morning, two officials said. The report contains some of what the officials called “minor footnotes” about open questions and other uncertainties, in part because some of the evidence supporting the conclusion is inferential. One such example, the officials said, was that intercepted messages and conversations among senior Russian officials in Putin’s inner circle indicated they were aware of the hacking campaign and celebrated Trump’s election as a victorious end to the campaign. The officials declined to discuss the nature of the communications, including whether they were domestic, international, or both. “People who knew what this was about were celebrating a victory over the United States,” said one official. Another example of inferential evidence, the officials said, was that as time passed and the early leaks attracted media attention that undermined or eclipsed Clinton’s campaign, the Russians increasingly focused their hacking “almost exclusively” on Democratic rather than Republican targets. There was also strong resemblance — including the use of the same computer malware — the Russians have used against targets in Europe and the marriage of traditional espionage tactics used by Soviet and Russian intelligence such as bribery, blackmail and internet vulnerabilities, which they said Putin has devoted increasing resources and attention to exploiting. For example, one official said, the Democratic databases and email servers the Russians hacked also contained personal information that WikiLeaks has not published. Such information could be used to search for financial, medical, browsing history and other records that can be used to target individuals for recruiting efforts by Russian spies. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. intelligence official said on Thursday he was “even more resolute” in his belief that Russia staged cyber attacks on Democrats during the 2016 election campaign, rebuking persistent skepticism from Republican President-elect Donald Trump about whether Moscow was involved. James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said he had a very high level of confidence that Russia hacked Democratic Party and campaign staff email, and disseminated propaganda and fake news aimed at the Nov. 8 election. “Our assessment now is even more resolute than it was” on Oct. 7 when the government first publicly accused Russia, Clapper told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said motives for the attack would be made public next week. Trump on Thursday morning called himself a “big fan” of intelligence agencies. But he has cast doubt on their assessments that Russia targeted the campaign of his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, drawing ire from his fellow Republicans as well as Democrats who are wary of Moscow and distrust Trump’s praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The intelligence officials at Thursday’s hearing said they worried a lack of support from atop the government could prompt valued staff members to leave their agencies. “There’s a difference between healthy skepticism ... and disparagement,” Clapper said. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has used the expression “healthy skepticism” to defend Trump’s criticism of intelligence findings. Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan, speaking at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics on Thursday, said that because Trump had never served in government, he was unfamiliar with the intelligence profession. “It doesn’t bother me if someone is going to be skeptical and challenge our work and maybe disagree with our views, but I expect that the president of the United States will recognize that the CIA and intelligence community were established by statute for a very important reason,” The congressional hearing was overseen by Republican Senator John McCain, a vociferous Russia critic. It was the first in a promised series of briefings and hearings on allegations that Russia tried to disrupt or influence the U.S. campaign, one of the most bitter in recent history. Moscow denies the allegations. McCain told reporters that Senator Lindsey Graham, also a vocal critic of Moscow, would chair a new Armed Services subcommittee dedicated to cyber issues. Trump will be briefed by intelligence agency chiefs on Friday on the hacks. President Barack Obama received a report on the matter on Thursday. An unclassified version will be made public early next week. “I don’t think we’ve ever encountered a more aggressive or direct campaign to interfere in our election process than we’ve seen in this case,” said Clapper, who leaves when Trump becomes president on Jan. 20. Clapper stopped short of declaring Russia’s actions “an act of war,” saying that determination was beyond the scope of his office. Clapper and the two other officials who testified, National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers, and Marcel Lettre, undersecretary of defense for intelligence, did not say what made U.S. intelligence confident Russia was behind the cyber attacks, a conclusion also reached by several private firms. Obama last week ordered the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies he said were involved in hacking U.S. political groups such as the Democratic National Committee. The CIA has identified Russian officials who fed material hacked from the DNC and Democratic Party leaders to WikiLeaks at Putin’s direction through third parties, according to a new U.S. intelligence report, senior U.S. officials said. Documents stolen from the DNC and Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, were posted on the Internet before the election, embarrassing the campaign. In a tweet on Wednesday, Trump was skeptical about a Russian role in the affair, writing: “(WikiLeaks founder) Julian Assange said ‘a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta’ - why was DNC so careless? Also said the Russians did not give him the info!” But on Thursday, Trump said in another Twitter post that he was not against intelligence agencies or in agreement with Assange. “The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!” Trump tweeted. Clapper said Assange had put American lives in danger and deserved no credibility. McCain and other lawmakers also blasted Assange. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, said there would be “howls” from Republicans if a Democrat described intelligence officials as Trump had. U.S. intelligence officials have said Russian cyber attacks were specifically aimed at helping Trump beat Clinton. Several Republicans have acknowledged the Russian hacking but have not linked it to an effort to help Trump win. Trump and top advisers believe Democrats are trying to delegitimize his victory by accusing Russia of helping him. Senator Tim Kaine, an Armed Services member who was Clinton’s vice presidential running mate, said: “It is my hope that this Congress is willing to stand in a bipartisan way for the integrity of the electoral process.” Graham said Obama’s actions against Moscow fell short. “I think what Obama did was throw a pebble. I’m ready to throw a rock,” Graham said. “Putin is up to no good and he better be stopped.” ","

Combined, McDonald’s is selling off 80% percent holding in a deal which is a part of the company’s reorganization plan in the Chinese market where it’s struggling to compete with more nimble rivals. Citic Capital Holdings and Citic Ltd will own 52% of a new partnership, while Carlyle Group will own 28%. McDonald's said it will keep the remaining 20% stake. ""China and Hong Kong represent an enormous growth opportunity for McDonald's,"" said McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook. ""This new partnership will combine one of the world's most powerful brands and our unparalleled quality standards with partners who have an unmatched understanding of the local markets and bring enhanced capabilities and new partnerships, all with a proven record of success."" Upon completion of the deal, the new owners plan to add more than 1,500 restaurants over the next five years in smaller Chinese cities. This stands to be a positive deal for McDonald’s, which has seen its Chinese business suffer at the same time it has witnessed the fourth consecutive year of traffic declines in the U.S., its largest market. The company aims to attract China’s booming middle class which now demands higher quality and healthier food options offered by domestic competition. Ben Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst at China Market Research Group, thinks the deal will help McDonald’s save on its expansion efforts. “Citic and Carlyle’s resources will allow McDonald’s to expand rapidly and refurbish old restaurants, which is expensive to do,” he said to Bloomberg. “Given that McDonald’s lags behind KFC in terms of store count in China, we can expect them to expand aggressively and invest heavily.” Similarly, Yum Brands!, Inc. (YUM), operator of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut last year spun-off its Chinese subsidiary, Yum China Holdings, into a separate company. Both McDonald’s and Yum China Holdings Inc., are now in the same predicament, trying to revive sales in China amid stiff competition. McDonald’s, which currently operates or franchises more than 2,400 outlets in China, said the new partnership will focus on areas such as menu innovation, retail digital leadership and delivery. To the extent it can execute on this transition, McDonald’s shares — one of the Dow’s worst-performers last year — could be on the value menu this year.

Adam Hayes,01122017,Investopedia,01052017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest and most widely used cryptocurrency, has only been around for a handful of years - since 2009. 2016 proved to be a good year for the digital currency, more than doubling over the course of the year from around $400 to just under $1,000. Some analysts predict that 2017 will be another banner year, while others are more skeptical and calling this recent rise a bubble that is waiting to burst. (See also: Bitcoin's Price History) In 2015, Bitcoin had risen modestly, from $313 to $431, a 37% rise, kicking off a year of steady growth throughout 2016. In last year's Investopedia article looking at how 2016 would shape up, many predictions proved to be correct: increased demand did come from China as capital controls did tighten and regulators continued to devalue the Yuan systematically.  However, predictions that venture capital (VC) investment would rise fell a bit flat: bitcoin-related companies raised nearly $500 million in total in 2015, but only around $350 million in 2016. (Look back at: The Outlook for Bitcoin in 2016) 2016 also saw relative price stability in Bitcoin, as its price rose steadily and with lower volatility than had been experienced in the past, and it also gained wider acceptance and legitimacy as a means of payment. Plagued by negative image problems surrounding its use for illegal or illicit transactions such as for drugs and money laundering, a 2016 research paper showed that the transactions occurring on the Bitcoin network became more and more legitimized with far less suspect activity as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured. 2016 also saw the second so-called halving of the Bitcoin block reward, the number of bitcoins found in each block. Set to automatically reduce by 50% approximately every four years, in 2009 there were 50 BTC per block and by summer 2016 just 12.5 BTC. This has reduced the rate of new supply and given an increasing demand, naturally put upward pressure on the price. Already, 2017 has started strong out of the gates for Bitcoin's price, exceeding $1,000 and approaching $1,100 in just the first few days of the year, levels not seen since late-2013 when it's price briefly exceeded $1,200. This top, of course, was followed by a crash in the price of Bitcoin, sending it down to below $250 soon after. This has led some skeptics to claim that this price rise, too, is a bubble. However, many things are different this time around. The size and computing power of the Bitcoin mining network, which confirms and validates transactions, has risen exponentially since then, and the number of users, merchants, and exchange volume has grown similarly. Moreover, the rapid rise back in 2013 is now attributed to fraudulent trading and price manipulation that exploited illiquid and immature markets, and which eventually led to the famous collapse of the primary, and corrupt, Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox. This past year's rise in price has enjoyed liquid, developed markets with many exchanges in competition with one another, and without any evidence of price manipulation. Demand for Bitcoin as a currency is also likely to continue to grow in 2017, again as China has promised to restrict capital outflows and to devalue its currency in order to protect exporters. Another large economy that has seen increased demand for Bitcoin is India, whose government surprised many by scrapping large-denomination banknotes and causing a panic for cash in the country of more than a billion residents. A rising U.S. dollar has also caused some in emerging markets to seek alternatives to fiat currencies as debt denominated in dollars becomes more expensive to service. (For more, see: Bitcoin Prices in India Soar Amid Demonetization Drive) 2017 may also see increased focus on Bitcoin as the dominant digital currency amid many hundreds of alternatives (sometimes called 'altcoins') including notably Litecoin, Ethereum and Zerocash. Some proponents of altcoins had hoped that improvements or enhanced features that made them objectively ""better"" than Bitcoin would help dislodge it as the dominant player. Those efforts have seemed to fail, as Bitcoin continues to climb, its market cap now approaching $18 billion, while its next closer competitor, Ethereum is struggling to break through $1 billion. So-called Bitcoin supremacy or dominance is also likely to damper efforts of private blockchain implementations that have been attempted largely in the financial sector, notably with the consortium R3CEV or IBM's Hyperledger project.

Some analysts have speculated the price could double from here to reach $2,100 by year's end while others claim it will fall to zero. Only time will tell. Personally, I see increased demand given a limited supply and geopolitical events pushing up the price, but how high I cannot guess. (For more, see: Could Bitcoin's Price Surpass $2,000 in 2017?)

At the North American International Auto Show, the company said it had created a sensor package that has slashed costs for the technology by 90% by building it in-house. The Wall Street Journal reports that the package consists of a 360-degree-view radar, eight vision modules and three types of Light Detection and Radar (LIDaR) sensors. Waymo is primarily a software services company that partners with car manufacturers. It unveiled a Chrysler Pacifica minivan with self-driving capability made in conjunction with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Inv. (FCAU) at the show. The minivan is expected to be out on public roads by the end of this month. (See also: Alphabet Spins Off New Self-Driving Car Technology Company.) Sensors are typically the most expensive components in self-driving hardware. For example, Waymo said a LIDaR sensor typically cost $75,000 in 2009. A massive reduction in sensor prices could pave the way for large-scale hardware commoditization for self-driving cars and bring down their price tag. It could open the floodgates for mass-market production of self-driving cars and, in turn, create a market for Waymo’s services. A 2015 report by research firm Boston Consulting Group estimated that a fully autonomous car would add an additional $10,000 to the original price tag. According to that report, even a price tag of $8,000 for LIDaR sensors was too expensive for Google's cars. Tesla Motor Co. (TSLA), which is already including hardware for fully autonomous driving on its production line, charges $5,000 for Enhanced Autopilot and $3,000 on top of that for ""Full Self-Driving Capability."" However, the company doesn't use LIDaR sensors; instead, it uses a Tesla radar to achieve the same effect as LIDaR. (See also: Qualcomm Joins Self-Driving Car Coalition.) The Journal quotes John Krafcik, Waymo CEO, as saying that the company was bringing a ""self-driving technology platform"" to the market.

Even so, their conservative $400 price target suggests a lack of faith in the 2017 outlook since the stock closed just 18-points under that level on Wednesday evening. The company has failed to rebuild its customer base after a well-publicized 2015 food poisoning outbreak, with management adding to woes by making a series of tactical errors in dealing with the backlash. Even so, it’s now 2017, with the January Effect underpinning speculation in the prior year’s biggest losers. This tailwind could trigger a recovery that exceeds analyst and management targets. CMG Long-Term Chart (2006-2017) The stock came public in the mid-40s in January 2006 as a McDonald's Corp (MCD) spinoff and broke out of a trading range 16-months later, lifting in a steady uptrend to the January 2008 high at $155.49. A decline gathered strength in the second half of the year, dumping to an all-time low at $36.86 in November. It took nearly 18-months for the subsequent recovery wave to complete a 100% retracement to the prior high and another five months to generate a breakout. That uptrend built steady gains into April 2012 when it topped out at $442, with the subsequent pullback giving up more than 200-pts into the October low at 234. It turned higher into 2013, reaching the 2012 high in October and breaking out in a buying impulse that continued into the second half of 2015 when food poisoning reports spread across the national media. The rally ended at $758 in August, yielding a steady decline that found support near $400 in January 2016. Last year’s January Effect attracted steady buying pressure, lifting the stock to $542 in March, with aggressive sellers then returning and dumping price into a declining wedge that’s still in force ten months later. Meanwhile, Fibonacci grids placed over the two primary rally waves since the IPO broadcast continued downside exposure through $350, telling observant market players to take place tight stops and take aggressive profits after the recovery wave loses steam. Short-Term Chart (2014-2017) The stock printed a downside breakaway gap in October 2015, exiting a three-month topping pattern while entering a steep downtrend that accelerated into the January 2016 low. The first quarter bounce stalled at the .386 selloff retracement but well below the declining 200-day EMA. In fact, the stock hasn’t touched this long term moving average since the gap, highlighting extreme weakness consistent with a paradigm-shifting loss of confidence. A rally above $400 is needed to break the falling wedge and put the 200-day EMA at $425 in play. Those barriers, relatively close to the current price level, tell us that a recovery wave similar in scope to the 2016 bounce will require a lot more firepower. It’s a two-edged sword because, while the setup lowers odd for a high percentage rally, breakouts will ease highly negative sentiment and attract sidelined players who have no intention of owning the stock at current levels. On Balance Volume (OBV) looks more bearish than the dismal price pattern, failing to bounce strongly in the first quarter of 2016 despite the significant rally. It’s eased to lower ground in the last year in an endless series of lower highs and lows that have drawn a descending channel (red lines). These mark important levels to watch if buying pressure sets into motion and lifts the stock toward $400. Chipotle Mexican Grill could gain significant ground in a January Effect rally similar to 2016’s 140-point bounce, but the stock needs to mount two major resistance levels, at $400 and $425, to set that trade into motion. <Disclosure: the author held no positions in aforementioned stocks at the time of publication.> ","Chipotle Ripe for a January Effect Rally (CMG, MCD) | Investopedia"

We're going to create jobs. I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created, and I mean that. I really — I'm going to work very hard on that we need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we're going to do a real job, and I'm very proud of what we've done, and we haven't even gotten there yet. I look very much forward to the inauguration, it's going to be a beautiful event. We have great talent, tremendous talent, and we have all of the bands or most of the bands from the different segments of the military. And I've heard some of these bands over the years. They're incredible. We're going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special, very beautiful. And I think we're going to have massive crowds, because we have a movement. It's a movement like the world has never seen before. It's a movement that a lot of people didn't expect. And even the polls, although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn't, and that was a beautiful scene on November 8 as those states started to pour in, and we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are going to have a lot of jobs and they're going to have a lot of security, they're going to have a lot of good news for their veterans. And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. We'll do a news release in a little while and tell you about David. He's fantastic. He will do a truly great job. One of the commitments I've made is that we're going to straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. Our veterans have been treated horribly. They're waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days. Cases where they go in and they have a minor, early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. So, David is going to do a fantastic job. We're going to be talking to a few people also to help David. And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more that we have, and we're going to set up a group. These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. And they're going to get together with their great doctors, Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know, from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved. Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. And we're going to straighten out the VA for our veterans. I've been promising that for a long time, and it's something I feel very, very strongly. So, you'll get the information on David, and I think you'll be very impressed with the job he does. We looked long and hard. We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good, but we had a lot of talent, and we think this selection will be something that will, with time, with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good, because our veterans have been treated very unfairly. Okay, questions? Yes, John. Reporter: Mr. President-elect, thank you so much. Trump: Thank you. Reporter: Appreciate it. A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we're looking for further clarification on. Trump: Sure. Reporter: First of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with a two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations? And secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC? And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States? Trump: First of all, these meetings as you know are confidential, classified, so I'm not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting, but we have many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out. I saw the information. I read the information outside of that meeting. It's all fake news. It's phony stuff. It didn't happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together, sick people, and they put that crap together. So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should never have been — number one, shouldn't have even entered paper, but it should never have been released. But I read what was released, and I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an absolute disgrace. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, but I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I can say that, you know, when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary that was probably China. We have much hacking going on. And one of the things we're going to do — we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled. You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world. They were never in the same room together as a group. And we're going to put those minds together and were going to form a defense. And I have to say this also — the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job. They could have had hacking defense, which we had. And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense. And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through. We have to do that for our country. It's very important. Reporter: Mr. President-elect — [inaudible question] Trump: Well, you know, President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news. They said it totally never happened. Now, somebody would say, ""Oh, of course he's going to say that."" I respected the fact that he said that. And I'll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would have released it. They would have been glad to release it. I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would have released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her. I mean, what he said about her was horrible. If somebody said about me what Podesta said about Hillary — I was the boss, I would have fired him immediately, or that person, because what he said about her was horrible. But remember this — we talk about the hacking, and hacking's bad, and it shouldn't be done, but look at the things that were hacked. Look at what was learned from that hacking, that Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it? That's a horrible thing. That's a horrible thing. Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate, it would have been the biggest story in the history of stories, and they would have said immediately, ""You have to get out of the race."" Nobody even talked about it. It's a very terrible thing. Reporter: Mr. President-elect. Thank you, Mr. President-elect. On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election. Do you accept that part of the finding? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this if given a chance? Well, if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. Russia can help us fight ISIS, which by the way is, number one, tricky. I mean, if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed. If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks, that's called an asset, not a liability. Now, I don't know that I'm going to get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there's a good chance I won't. And if I don't, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break. REPORTER: Can you make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St. Petersburg you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable — No — REPORTER: Reasonable observers say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agencies. Let me just say what I do. When I leave our country — I'm a very high-profile person, would you say? I am extremely careful. I'm surrounded by bodyguards. I'm surrounded by people. And I always tell them anywhere, but I always tell them, if I'm leaving this country, be very careful, because in your hotel rooms, and no matter where you go, you're going to probably have cameras. I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category. And number one, I hope you're going to be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places, cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know. You'd better be careful or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television. I tell this to people all the time. I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well. Moscow, the Moscow area, did very, very well. And I told many people, be careful, because you don't want to see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place. And again, not just Russia, all over. Does anyone really believe that story? I'm also very much of a germophobe, by the way, believe me. REPORTER: How do you plan to disentangle yourself from your business? But first, I have to follow up on some of these Russia remarks. Based your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it? So, I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals in Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. I have assets that are — and now people have found out how big the company is — I have very little debt, but I have no loans with Russia at all. And I thought that was important to put out. I certified that. So, I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to. I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict. So I have no loans, no dealings and no current pending deals. Now, I have to say one other thing. Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in DubaI with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Dumak (sp), a friend of mine, great guy, and was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai, a number of deals. And I turned it down. I didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president, which is — I didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have, but I don't want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don't have. Vice President Pence also has it. I don't think he'll need it. I have a feeling he's not going to need it. But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president. It was many, many years old. This is for presidents because they don't want presidents getting — I understand, they don't want presidents getting tangled in minutiae. They want a president to run the country. So I could actually run my business. I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don't like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that, if I wanted to. I would be the only one that would be able to do that. You can't do that in any other capacity, but as a president, I could run the Trump Organization — great, great company — and I could run the country. I'd do a very good job. But I don't want to do that. Now, all of these papers that you see here — yes, go ahead. Reporter: Do you believe the hacking was justified and will you release your tax returns to prove what you're saying about no deals in Russia? Well, I'm not releasing the tax returns, because as you know, they're under audit. Reporter: But every president since the '70s has — Gee, I've never heard that. I've never heard that before. You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? Reporter: You don't think the American public is concerned about that? No, I don't think so. I won. I mean, I became president. No, I don't think they care at all. I think you care. I think you care. First of all, you learn very little from a tax return. What you should do is go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers. And actually, people have learned a lot about my company, and now they realize my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought. We're in many, many countries and I'm very proud of it. And what I'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company. They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They're not going to discuss it with me. Again, I don't have to do this. They're not going to discuss it with me. And with that, I'm going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she's going to go — these papers are just some of the many documents I've signed turning over complete and total control to my son. [Break as Trump's attorney speaks about his business relations being turned over] REPORTER: Thank you Mr. Trump. American news. What is your response to your critics that say not only do you but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest and do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration — TRUMP: Great question. I really think that when you watch what's going on with what's happening and why I was just watching, as an example, Rex Tillerson, I think it's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying. I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator who is going to be a great attorney general, and he was brilliant. And what people don't know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama, and he was brilliant yesterday. So I really think that they are — I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together. And we've been hearing that from so many people. People are so happy. You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly ExxonMobil, when there was a find, he would get it. When they needed something, he would be there. A friend of mine who is very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm, big supporter, he said there's nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson. And that's what we want. That's what I want to bring to government. I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we're way behind. We don't make good deals anymore. I say it all the time in speeches. We don't make good deals anymore. We make bad deals. Our trade deals are a disaster. We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis. Hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody. We don't make good deals anymore. So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because, generally speaking, they're smart. And that's what I put. I'm very proud of the Cabinet. I think they're doing very well. It's very interesting how it's going. But it's — I think they're doing very, very well. REPORTER: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. I want to ask a few questions on Obamacare. Can you be specific on what guidance you're giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or a delay? TRUMP: Finally, Obamacare. REPORTER: I want to ask you if you — TRUMP: Uh-oh. REPORTER: — have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage to those who have gotten health insurance through the Obamacare law? TRUMP: You will be very, very proud, not only as the media and reporters, but you're going to be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care. Obamacare is a complete and total disaster. They can say what they want. They can guide you any way they want to guide you. In some cases they guide you incorrectly. In most cases you realize what's happened. It's imploding as we sit. Some states have over 100 percent increase. And '17 — I said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year. It's going to be catastrophic. Frankly, we could sit back — and it was a thought from a political standpoint — but it wouldn't be fair to the people. We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come — they would come begging to us, please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don't want to own it. We don't want to own it, politically. They own it right now. So the easiest thing would to be to let it implode in '17 and, believe me, we would get pretty much whatever we wanted but it would take a long time. We're going to be submitting as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan. It will be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day. Could be the same hour. So we're going to do repeal and replace. Very complicated stuff. And we're going to get a health bill passed. We're going to get health care taken care of in this country. You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums, which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because the deductibles are so high. Obamacare is the Democrats' problem. We're going to take the problem off the shelves for them. We're doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service. So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we will be filing a plan and it was actually pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times, and the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare. We're going to have health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK. REPORTER: Sir. STAFFER: Which one, Mr. President-elect? TRUMP: Well, I was going right here. Go ahead. Then CBS. REPORTER: President-elect Trump, when you look at all the meetings you've had with Carrier and Softbank and Alibaba,   do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of Commerce? And then my follow-up question, how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and cuts? TRUMP: Well, if I could save jobs. For instance, I was doing individual companies and people said, ""Well, that's only one company."" Like, we did a good job with Carrier and I want to thank you, United Technologies, which owns Carrier. But we saved close to a thousand jobs. And they were gone. And Mike Pence and his staff really helped us a lot. But those were — that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving. It's always tough when they're building a plant, a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement. I want to thank United Technologies. But we've been meeting with a lot of companies. But what really is happening is the word is now out that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason, not going to happen that way anymore. You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you're going build that plant in Mexico and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you're making and you're going to sell it through a, what will be a, very, very strong border, not a weak border like it is — we don't even have a border. It's an open sieve. You're going to sell through a very strong border. Not going to happen. You're going to pay a very large border tax. So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina, you can move from South Carolina back to Michigan, you can do anywhere, you've got a lot of states at play, lot of competition, so it's not like, oh, gee, I'm taking the competition. You've got a lot of places you can move. And I don't care as long as it's within the United States. The borders of United States. There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago and you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States, that are 96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number. That's the real number. So that's the way it is. OK, go ahead. REPORTER: A question about the Supreme Court and the border security, but I also want to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning: Are we living in Nazi Germany? What were you driving at there? Do you have a problem with the intelligence community? On the Supreme Court, what's your timeline? You said a while ago you were down to four. Have you conducted those yet? What's your timeline for nominating? On the border fence, it now appears clear U.S. taxpayers will have to pay for it upfront. What is your plan to get Mexico to pay for it? TRUMP: I got it. Anything more? [crowd's laughter] TRUMP: On the fence. It's not a fence, it's a wall. You just misreported it. We're going to build a wall. I could wait about a year and a half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office. But I don't want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin. I don't feel like waiting a year or a year and a half. I'm going to start building. Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment. Probably less likely that it's a payment. But it will happen. So remember this, OK, I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. I would then say who is going to pay for the wall? And people would all scream out, 25, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had. You know that. You don't like to report that but that's OK. OK. Now we agree. Finally, he agrees. But I say, ""Who is going to pay for the wall?"" And they will scream out, ""Mexico!"" Now, reports went out last week, oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. What's the difference? I want to get the wall started. I don't want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico. And we probably will have a deal sooner than that. By the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice. I respect the government of Mexico. I respect the people of Mexico. I love the people of Mexico. I have many people from Mexico working for me. They are phenomenal people. The government of Mexico is terrific. I don't blame them for what's happened. I don't blame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. I don't blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico. What I say is, we shouldn't have allowed that to happen. It's not going to happen anymore. So in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall. But it will be reimbursed. OK? Supreme Court judge. So as you know, I have a list of 20. I've gone through them. We've met with numerous candidates. They're outstanding in every case. They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society. Jim DeMint was also very much involved in this group, which is fantastic and he is a fantastic guy so between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some Congress people, we have a great group of people. I'll be making the decision on who we will put up for Justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice Scalia. That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. So within about two weeks probably the second week, I consider the first day because we'll also be doing some — some pretty good signings. And I think what we'll do is we'll wait until Monday. That will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration. And then Saturday as you know we're having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. So our first day, and you will be invited to the signings, but we'll be doing pretty good signings on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and then also the next week. And you're all invited. But on the Supreme Court, I'll be make that decision and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it's one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court. So I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected. [ inaudible ] I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it's a disgrace. And I say that and I say that. And that's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. It's a disgrace. That information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public, as far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up — and by the way, we just found out, I was coming down, Michael Cohn is a very talented lawyer, good lawyer in my firm. Was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohn were talking about. All night long, Michael Cohn. I want to see your passport. He brings his passport to my office. I say, wait a minute, he didn't leave the country. He wasn't out of the country. They had Michael Cohn of the Trump organization was in Prague. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohn. It's a disgrace what took place. It's a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with, Michael Cohn. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, not you. Not you. Your organization is terrible. Your organization is terrible. Let's go. Go ahead. Quiet. Quiet. She's asking a question. Don't be rude. Don't be rude. Don't be rude. No, I'm not going to give you a question. I'm not going to give you a question. You are fake news. Go ahead. Go ahead. REPORTER: — with the sanctions that they put on Russia after the hacking. TRUMP: I don't think he went too far. REPORTER: What do you think of Lindsey Graham's plan for a bill to send you tougher ones? TRUMP: Plans to send me a bill for what? REPORTER: Tougher sanctions. TRUMP: I haven't heard Lindsey Graham is going to do that. Lindsey Graham, I've been competing with him for a long time. He's going to crack that 1 percent barrier one day. I didn't realize Lindsey Graham was still at it. It's all right. I heard he's a nice guy actually. I've been hearing it. I've been hearing it. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. You've been waiting. REPORTER: As far as we understand, the intelligence — TRUMP: Stand up. REPORTER: Ian Pannell from BBC News. TRUMP: Another beauty. REPORTER: Thank you. As far as we understand it, intelligence community are still looking at the allegations. It's false news, as you describe it. If they come back with any kind of conclusion with any of it stands up, if any of it is true, will you consider your position, would you think — TRUMP: There's nothing they can come back. Yes, yes, go ahead. Go ahead. REPORTER: Can you — TRUMP: Go ahead. REPORTER:  — public state news and all the problems seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here? TRUMP: Well, I don't recommend reforms. I recommend people that are — that have some moral compass. You know I've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and talking about people go and say all sorts of things. I will tell you some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news. More so than anybody. I could name them, but I won't bother. You have a few sitting right in front of us. So they're very, very dishonest people. But I think it's just something we're going to have to live with. I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back. When it happens to somebody that doesn't have this, doesn't have that kind of a megaphone, they can't speak back. It's a very sad thing. I've seen people destroyed. I've seen people absolutely destroyed and I think it's very unfair. So all I can ask for is honest reporters. Yes. REPORTER: I just want to follow up on the questions about the U.S. intelligence community and be very clear about what you're saying. Do you trust your U.S. intelligence officials and what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you are actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community? TRUMP: Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important. We are going to put in Mr. Pompeo and others, you know the senator, Dan Coats, we're going to put in outstanding people. Within 90 days they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking. I want them to cover this situation. I also want them, however, to cover maybe most importantly, because we're hacked by everybody. You know the United States, our government, out of a list of 17 in terms of industries, it's the worst, number 17 in terms of protection. If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries they put this in the category of an industry, the United States is last in terms of protecting, let's say hacking defense. Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee. That's why we weren't hacked. By the way, we were told they were trying to hack us but they weren't able to hack. I think I get some credit because I told Reince and Reince did a phenomenal job. But I said I want a hacking defense. The Democratic National Committee did not do that. Wait, wait, wait. Let me finish. Within 90 days we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense. How do we stop this new phenomena, fairly new phenomena, because the United States is hacked by everybody. That includes Russia and China and everybody. Everybody. OK. Go ahead. Go ahead. REPORTER: You said just now that you believe that Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's e-mail, etcetera. TRUMP: But you know what, it could have been others also. REPORTER: Why did you spend weeks undermining U.S. Intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement. TRUMP: I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. I think it's pretty sad. First of all, it's illegal. You know, these are — these are classified and certified meetings and reports. I'll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet people are reading about it. Somebody is leaking it out. So there's — maybe it's my office. Maybe my office. Because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it's them. And what I did is I said, I won't tell anybody. I'm going to have the meeting. And I won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence. And what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew. Not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years. She didn't know. I didn't tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had. The meeting was over. They left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting. So I don't want that. I don't want that. It's very unfair to the country. It's very unfair to our country what's happened. That report should have never — first of all, it shouldn't have been printed because it's not worth the paper it's written on. I thank The New York Times for saying that. I thank a lot of different people for saying that. But I will tell you that should never ever happen. OK. REPORTER: Thank you, Mr.President-elect. Can you stand here today once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign and, if you indeed do believe that Russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now? TRUMP: He shouldn't be doing it. He won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading it than when other people have led it. You will see that. Russia will respect our country more. He shouldn't have done it. I don't believe he will be doing it more now. We have to work something out. But it's not just Russia. Take look at what's happened. You don't report it the same way. Twenty-two million accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that's because we have no defense. That's because we're run by people that don't know what they're doing. Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I'm leading it. And I believe — and I hope, maybe it won't happen, it's possible, but I won't be given a little reset button like Hillary. Press this piece of plastic. The guy looked at her like, what is she doing? There's no reset button. We're either going to get along or we're not. I hope we get along. But if not, that's possible, too. But Russia and other countries and other countries including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total. Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations. I want to thank everybody. So this is all — just so you understand, these papers, because I'm not sure that was explained properly. These papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons and I hope at the end of eight years I'll come back and I'll say, ""Oh, you did a good job."" Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I'll say, you're fired. Goodbye, everybody. Goodbye. ",Transcript of President-elect Trump's news conference
Matthew J. Belvedere,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Donald Trump, at his first news conference as president-elect, blasted BuzzFeed on Wednesday for reporting on unverified allegations that Russia put together compromising information on him. He also refused to take a question from a CNN reporter. Trump called BuzzFeed a ""failing pile of garbage,"" arguing the online media outlet ""will suffer the consequences."" A day earlier,  BuzzFeed published a 35-page dossier of unsubstantiated allegations of Russian information-gathering on Trump. At the news conference, Trump took CNN to task for ""going out of their way to build it up,"" then refused to take a question from CNN's Jim Acosta. ""Your organization is terrible,"" the president-elect told Acosta at the nationally televised news conference at Trump Tower. ""I am not going to give you a question, you're fake news."" A spokesperson for CNN released a statement, arguing that the network's reporting on the matter differed from BuzzFeed: ""CNN's decision to publish carefully sourced reporting about the operations of our government is vastly different than Buzzfeed's decision to publish unsubstantiated memos. The Trump team knows this. They are using Buzzfeed's decision to deflect from CNN's reporting, which has been matched by the other major news organizations. ... We made it clear that we were not publishing any of the details of the 35-page document because we have not corroborated the report's allegations."" Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer opened Trump's news conference with a take down of BuzzFeed. ""It's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog, that was openly hostile to the president-elect's campaign, to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the Oval Office,"" Spicer said. Trump takes the oath of office at his inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump dismissed the report on Twitter and at the top of his news conference as ""fake news,"" before elaborating in remarks characterized at the top of this report. The Russian government on Wednesday called the BuzzFeed report published Tuesday night a ""total hoax"" and ""pulp fiction."" BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith on Tuesday evening tweeted an email he had sent to this staff. It read in part: ""As we noted in our story, there is serious reason to doubt the allegations. We have been chasing specific claims in this document for weeks, and will continue to."" TWEET Spicer on Wednesday had his own characterization of the decision to publish the report. ""It's sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks. The report is not an intelligence report — plain and simple."" ""For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting, and is frankly shameful and disgraceful,"" he said. Shortly after Spicer's remarks, BuzzFeed emailed CNBC, saying: ""We stand by our decision to publish the dossier,"" referring readers to Smith's tweet.

Dan Mangan,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Donald Trump poo-pooed rumors of salacious activities in Russia, noting to reporters Wednesday that he is ""very much a germaphobe."" The president-elect's dismissal of the allegations came a day after unsubstantiated reports that Russian intelligence had information about him as a result of a secret video showing him in compromising — and disgusting — circumstances. The video, according to news reports Tuesday night, allegedly showed Trump with prostitutes in 2013 in a hotel room where the women urinated on the bed. Trump angrily denied those claims on Wednesday. ""Does anyone really believe that story?,"" Trump asked at a news conference at Trump Tower in New York City. ""I'm also very much of a germophobe, by the way,"" he said. ""Believe me."" Trump is in fact well-known for having a fear of germs. He has been, in the past, reluctant to shake hands for that reason. Trump said he was savvy enough to be on his best behavior while staying overseas. ""In those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places, cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know,"" Trump mused. ""You'd better be careful or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television. I tell this to people all the time. I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well, Moscow, the Moscow area, did very, very well."" ""And I told many people, be careful, because you don't want to see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place.""

At the Trump Tower lobby in New York, Trump addressed suspected Russian interference in the U.S. election, his plan to reduce conflicts of interest during his presidency, and his health care and immigration policy. Trump on Wednesday claimed he has ""nothing to do with Russia"" and argued that he is the victim of political attacks after reports that intelligence officials possessed briefing material with damaging accusations about ties to Moscow. On Twitter, Trump called the reports ""unfair"" and said, ""Russia has never tried to use leverage over me."" Trump claimed that he has ""no deals, no loans, no nothing"" with Russia, an assertion that is difficult to verify because he has not released his tax returns, unlike every president since Jimmy Carter. The FBI is not actively investigating the information, which was initially circulated among Trump opponents and has not been verified by intelligence agencies, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Those sources did not comment to NBC about the nature of the allegations. Trump will hand control of his business to his two eldest sons, but will not fully divest or create a blind trust, as the Office of Government Ethics and former White House ethics lawyers have called for him to do. A lawyer advising Trump on ethics issues claimed that it would be too difficult and could create even more conflicts. The OGE and experts have called on Trump to sell his assets and let an independent trustee manage them, following past presidential precedent. This would reduce the possibility that he and his family could use the office to benefit themselves financially. Trump has correctly noted that the president is exempt from criminal conflict of interest laws and said his two eldest sons will manage his businesses with other executives.

Corky Siemaszko and Tracy Connor,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"The suspected shooter in Friday's deadly rampage at a Fort Lauderdale airport was charged on Saturday with federal counts that could carry the death penalty. Esteban Santiago, 26, was charged with performing an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation and two other counts, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida said. Five people were killed in the shooting rampage at the baggage claim of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport at around 12:55 p.m. Court documents say Santiago told the FBI after the shooting that he planned the attack, buying a one-way ticket from Anchorage and checked a box with a Walther 9 mm handgun and the two ammunition magazines he used in the shooting. More from NBC News: Trump Has Been Strikingly Consistent in Denying Russian Hacking Role Despite Objections, Congress Certifies Donald Trump's Election Ohio GOP Votes Out Chairman in Favor of Trump-Backed Candidate Santiago had been treated for mental health issues in Anchorage, where he lived, officials said. His aunt told NBC News that the former National Guardsman was ""not OK"" after returning from a 10-month deployment in Iraq. In November Santiago walked into the FBI office there and complained his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency, the FBI said Saturday. He was taken for a mental health evaluation and his gun was taken from him for safe keeping. The gun was returned in December. The FBI in Alaska said there was no reason to place him on a no-fly list. A federal prosecutor there told reporters there it appeared there was no reason under the law to deny him his gun, and federal law requires a person be ""adjudicated mentally ill"" for the gun to be held by police. Federal guidelines allow for passengers to check unloaded guns in a locked case, and also allows for ammunition to be placed in checked baggage. ""During our initial investigation we found no ties to terrorism,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Anchorage office Marlin Ritzman told reporters. ""He broke no laws when he came into our office making disjointed comments about mind control."" Investigators say Santiago fired ten to fifteen rounds of ammunition from his handgun, shooting all the rounds in one magazine, then reloading and emptying the second. Santiago aimed at his victims' heads during the rampage until he ran out of bullets, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Six people were wounded. Santiago dropped his handgun and got on the ground to wait for police, witnesses said. The charges against Santiago also carry the possibility of life in prison, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. He is expected to appear in a Fort Lauderdale federal court Monday morning. Police said Santiago took off from Anchorage and arrived at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Friday on a connecting flight from Minnesota. At the baggage claim, they said, Santiago retrieved a weapon and began shooting. Why remains a mystery. Santiago's brother said they have family in Florida but had no idea why he was there — or why he allegedly went on a shooting spree. ""He is a regular person, spiritual, a good person,"" Bryan Santiago said. Santiago's aunt and uncle in Union City, New Jersey, said Santiago was the father of a son named Pierre and that the boy and his mother both live in Puerto Rico. They, too, had no explanation for the shooting, but suspected it might have been related to his war experience. ""When he came back from Iraq, he wasn't feeling good,"" Hernan Rivera told NBC News. Santiago's aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, said they were told that he ""got a little sick"" around December, started to hear things, and was in treatment. Santiago was born in Hamilton, New Jersey, and raised in Peñuelas, Puerto Rico, where his mother still lives. His father died four years ago. Six years ago, Santiago enlisted in the Puerto Rico National Guard, his brother said. ""He was pro-America,"" Bryan Santiago said. Two years ago, Santiago moved to Alaska, where he lived with a woman and a child and where he worked as a security guard, his brother said. He also owned a handgun. In January of 2016 he was charged in with criminal mischief and a misdemeanor count of assault after he allegedly broke open the door of a bathroom and yelled and choked his girlfriend, according to police records. The case was dismissed in March, according to online records. A call to an attorney listed as representing Santiago was not immediately returned. Santiago was not harmed during his arrest after the shooting in Florida, and no law enforcement officers fired any shots, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. Investigators believe he acted alone, Israel said. FBI Special Agent in Charge George Piro of the Miami division said Friday night that investigators are not aware of any incident that occurred on the flight or in the baggage claim area before Santiago opened fire. ",Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooting Suspect Esteban Santiago Said He Heard Voices: Officials
Antonio José Vielma,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"A shooter opened fire at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida earlier on Friday, killing five people and wounding multiple others, law enforcement officials said. The shooter was in custody — unharmed and under interrogation — the Broward County Sheriff's office said, but the situation remained ""fluid and active."" Multiple law enforcement sources identified the suspect as New Jersey–born Esteban Santiago, 26, and said he had a military ID on him at the time of his capture. All flights were grounded and additional areas of the airport were being evacuated and cleared. The motive for the attack, which started shortly before 1 p.m., was not known, according to law enforcement officials. Florida Gov. Rick Scott held a news conference with Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel shortly after 5:15 p.m. ET. He reconfirmed the death toll of five people and said he learned about the incident earlier while he was in Fort Myers. The governor said he reached out to President-elect Donald Trump to update him and Vice President-elect Mike Pence as the situation unfolded. Gov. Scott said he and President Barack Obama have not reached to each other. Vice President-elect Pence spoke to reporters outside of Trump Tower in Manhattan around 5:50 p.m., ET, saying the shooting was a ""heartbreaking loss of life"" and ""the hearts of every American are in Fort Lauderdale tonight."" Pence also briefly remarked on the ""constructive and respectful dialogue"" he and Trump had with the leaders of intelligence community during their briefing earlier Friday. In an earlier news conference, law enforcement officials said they did not fire any shots during the gunman's capture. They also confirmed — despite unconfirmed reports suggesting otherwise — that no additional shots were fired at the airport at any time after the attack. SWAT teams and law enforcement officials will work to clear every area of the airport before reopening, they said. As a precaution, the Broward Sheriff's Office bomb squad detonated a suspicious package at the airport. That package was later found to be no threat. The airport tweeted that the shooting took place at the Terminal 2 baggage claim area in the lower level, adding that the airport would be closed for an extended period of time. Shortly after the shooting, the Transportation Security Administration warned people at the airport to shelter in place and described it as an active shooter situation. Sources involved in the investigation told NBC News — and publicly available flight information confirmed — that the gunman flew on two separate Delta Air Lines flights from Anchorage, Alaska, to Minneapolis-St. Paul and on to Fort Lauderdale. In a statement, Delta CEO Ed Bastian extended his condolences to the people of Fort Lauderdale and Broward County. The airline also gave details on how it will proceed with the investigation. ""Delta is working closely with law enforcement in their investigation, and out of respect to that investigation, details about the suspect will come from law enforcement officials,"" the company said. Law enforcement officials had previously told NBC News they believed the shooter had arrived on a flight from Canada, picked up his firearm at baggage claim and began firing. However, Canada's largest airline, Air Canada, confirmed via Twitter that it had no record of any passenger by the gunman's name — nor checked guns — on any of its flights to Fort Lauderdale. Earlier, hundreds of passengers and airport workers could be seen gathering and evacuating via the tarmac. Both the Los Angeles and the Miami international airports said they were deploying additional resources in light of the attack. American Airlines said in a news release it was canceling all of its flights into the Fort Lauderdale airport on Friday. The airline confirmed two of its flights landed safely at the airport and were being held away from the terminal. Two other flights were diverted to other airports. The airport has four terminals and serves more than 73,000 travelers every day. It ranks 21st in the U.S. in total passenger traffic, with more than 650 commercial flights a day. President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence tweeted about the situation. @realDonaldTrump: Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe! @mike_pence: Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and our first responders in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was at the airport at the time of the shooting and tweeted that shots had been fired. @AriFleischer: I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired. Everyone is running. @AriFleischer: All seems calm now but the police aren't letting anyone out of the airport - at least not the area where I am. The FBI told CNBC it was aware of the situation and was in contact with local authorities, but no further information was available.

Jacob Pramuk,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"The U.S. intelligence community on Friday accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 election in its strongest terms yet, alleging Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to undermine faith in the electoral process and developed a ""clear preference"" for President-elect Donald Trump. The conclusions came in an unclassified report released Friday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that goes into the most detail yet on what it deems Russia's motives for meddling in the U.S. election. It excludes some information delivered in a classified report. President Barack Obama previously called for a full review and report on Russia's role in the election. ""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,"" the report said, adding that intelligence agencies have ""high confidence"" in that assessment. It comes after the Obama administration late last month sanctioned nine entities and individuals it believes were involved in the alleged interference, straining tensions with Moscow ahead of the start of Trump's term. The president-elect has consistently questioned that Russia directed a cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee or tried to meddle in the election, seeing the allegations as an attempt to discredit him. The report accuses Putin of seeking to ""undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order, the promotion of which Putin and other senior Russian leaders view as a threat to Russia and Putin's regime."" It said that Putin tried to discredit Clinton in particular because since 2011 he has blamed her for ""inciting mass protests against his regime."" The intelligence community contended that it believes Moscow ""will apply lessons learned from its campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes."" After a briefing with top intelligence officials Friday, Trump did not say whether he agreed with their assessment that Russia tried to influence the election, but acknowledged that Russia and others have mounted cyberattacks against the U.S. He insisted that recent hacks did not affect the election outcome. The intelligence community in a statement Friday said it ""did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election."" It added that it did not believe vote tallying equipment was targeted or compromised. The DNI report alleges the Russian strategy ""blends covert intelligence operations — such as cyber activity — with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or 'trolls.'"" It said the intelligence community assessed ""with high confidence"" that Russian military intelligence used a persona and another platform to release information obtained in cyberattacks to media outlets and WikiLeaks. ""Russia's effort to influence the 2016 US presidential election represented a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations aimed at US elections,"" the report said. Russia has denied directing an effort to influence the U.S. election process. The intelligence community said Russia's operations during the election were ""unprecedented"" but followed a ""longstanding strategy"" designed to be deniable with front and false-flag organizations. It alleges the main Russian intelligence agency, GRU, used cyber operations, previously identified as phishing attacks, to ""compromise the personal email accounts of Democratic Party officials and political figures"" and targeted institutions linked to both major parties. It used the Guccifer 2.0 persona, DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks to distribute information gained in those cyberattacks, the report alleges. Russian intelligence services got access to DNC netowrks in July 2015 and kept it until at least June 2016, the report says. Russian diplomats prepared to publicly question the election results if Clinton won, the report said. It alleges that pro-Kremlin bloggers prepared a hashtag, ""DemocracyRIP,"" to use on Twitter on Election Night. Russia also used propaganda arms to distribute negative coverage of Clinton and portray Trump positively, the report alleges. It said Russian government-funded outlets like RT and Sputnik ""cast President-elect Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional U.S. media outlets that they claimed were subservient to a corrupt political establishment."" The intelligence community also cited those outlets' coverage of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. It gave examples of an English-language RT video from August titled, ""Julian Assange Special: Do WikiLeaks Have the E-mail That'll Put Clinton in Prison?"" and an interview with Assange called ""Clinton and ISIS Funded by the Same Money,"" among others.

Alexandra Gibbs,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"For Barack Obama, the past eight years have been quite a whirlwind as the president of the United States. With his presidency drawing to a close, his farewell address on Tuesday struck a note of hope, just as he did back in 2008 when he was elected. Speaking in Chicago, Obama covered a range of topics from what he'd done during his presidency, to highlighting threats against democracy such as inequality and race divisions. With the inauguration ceremony for Donald Trump due in just over a week, questions are now starting to emerge over what the future holds for the outgoing president. Will Obama stick to his political roots or venture into other fields? ""He's fifty five (years old), this guy's young. Politically, he still has life – he'll be writing and so forth,"" Peter Trubowitz, professor of international relations and director of the U.S. Centre at London School of Economics, told CNBC Wednesday. After Obama finished college, he relocated to Chicago where he helped rebuild communities hit by the closure of locally-based steel plants, and even after he went on to complete his law degree, he continued to stay active in his community. ""But I think one of the things that he would acknowledge is that the Democratic party right now is in trouble at the local level – both at State governorships and in State legislatures."" ""The party needs to be rebuilt at that level, and I think that's a place where he could invest his time and his energy and get payoff."" When looking back at previous presidents, since leaving office former Republican president George W. Bush has kept a relatively low profile, yet has made some public appearances at events. Bill Clinton, meanwhile, has got active in supporting charitable organizations, made public appearances and most recently helped support his wife and former Democrat presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, with her 2016 electoral campaign. However, it seems Obama has his own thoughts on what he'll do when he leaves office. In April 2015, Obama spoke to a group of middle school students at a Discovery Education Webinar event in Anacostia, Washington, D.C. Looking back at how his desire to go into the political field progressed over time, Obama told the audience that when he leaves, he wants to ""find ways to help people"". ""Eventually I had the opportunity to run for President. But I'll be done being President in a couple of years, and I'll still be a pretty young man – not compared to you guys, but I'll still be pretty young,"" Obama said at the time. ""And so I'll go back to doing the kinds of work that I was doing before, just trying to find ways to help people – help young people get educations, and help people get jobs, and try to bring businesses into neighborhoods that don't have enough businesses."" ""That's the kind of work that I really love to do."" ","After leaving the White House, will President Barack Obama continue in mainstream politics?"

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is known primarily for its ubiquitous online retail store. But it has also been gaining renown for the explosive growth of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the increasing popularity of its Prime membership program. With these three impressive pillars forming the foundation of Amazon's business, you might think it has no worlds left to conquer. You'd be wrong. Image source: Pixabay. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes that this innovation will be the next big tech battleground and area of innovation, and could be the fourth pillar of the company's business. In a recent interview, he had this to say: I think it's gigantic. ... It's probably hard to overstate how big of an impact it's going to have on society over the next 20 years. It has been a dream since the early days of science fiction to have a computer that you can talk to in a natural way and actually ask it to have a conversation with you and ask it to do things for you. And that is coming true. If you haven't guessed by now, the technology he is referring to is artificial intelligence, or AI. Image source: Pixabay. Amazon has been working behind the scenes in the area for more than four years. The AI behind recent innovations is machine learning, and more specifically deep learning, which has led to impressive new advances in technology. What is deep learning? A computer simulation of the human brain called a neural network is used to recreate our capacity to learn. It is fed a multitude of examples and complex algorithms that ""teach"" it to recognize similarities and distinguish differences. In its simplest terms, the computer learns to recognize patterns from massive quantities of data. This has led to explosive development in the areas of image recognition, natural language processing, user profiling, and voice recognition. Image source: Amazon.com. Nowhere is this emerging technology more evident than in the areas of voice recognition and natural language processing. Amazon's contribution to the field is Alexa, its AI-driven, cloud-based, voice-activated assistant. Alexa controls a variety of Amazons products including the popular Echo smart speaker and its sibling the Echo Dot. Alexa acts as the software to the Echo hardware. This product ecosystem has a dedicated team of over 1,000 working on its development. Alexa's home in the cloud allows it to learn continuously from all the devices it controls. The Echo and Echo Dot were among the most popular products on the Amazon website this holiday season.  Some estimates put sales of Echo products at over 5 million since their debut two years ago, and they were sold out on the website in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Fun fact: Amazon reported in its most recent conference call that Alexa has received more than 250,000 marriage proposals to date. While Alexa is the company's most public-facing demonstration of AI prowess, Amazon's ambitions in the field don't stop there. Its AWS cloud computing platform provides businesses with server access that can scale from one to hundreds depending on the needs of the business. Image source: Pixabay. Amazon has recently made three AI tools available to these customers: Rekognition, Polly, and Lex. Rekognition, an image recognition protocol, allows developers to build apps that analyze and recognize images. Polly, a natural language processing tool, is able to translate text to speech in one of 47 different voices in 24 languages. Lex, based on the same principles as Alexa, combines voice recognition with natural language processing and allows developers to build conversational bots. These additional tools will likely contribute to greater interest in what is already Amazon's fastest growing and most profitable business segment. AWS produced $3.2 billion in revenue in the last quarter, up 55% year over year, and has an operating profit margin of nearly 32%. Over the past 12 months it has generated over $11 billion in revenue. Making AI available to an already robust business may provide an effective customer-retention tool, as well as an incentive for newer customers. Image source: Pixabay. Amazon Go, its latest AI-based initiative, combines computer vision, data fused from multiple sensors, and deep learning to create what the company calls ""just walk away"" technology. It eliminates the need for checkout lines at its physical store in Seattle. The technology automatically detects what customers have taken from (or returned to) shelves and tracks those items in a virtual shopping cart.

While currently only open to Amazon's employees participating in the beta program, it is slated to become available to the public in early 2017. Across the breadth of its businesses and technologies, Amazon is accelerating the future with its contributions to the AI revolution. These investments may well form the fourth pillar of an already gargantuan business. Jeff Bezos put it best: There's so much more to come. It's just the tip of the iceberg. ... It's the first inning. It might even be the first guys up at bat. It's really early. I think we're on the edge of a golden era. It's gonna be so exciting. He sounds pretty excited about the future.

    Amazon Is Building the Fourth Pillar of Its Business -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Amazon. In CEO Jeff Bezos' annual letter to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders from April 2016, he highlighted the company's three pillars: Prime (its $99-a-year membership), Marketplace (where it sells items), and Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing business). All three have been instrumental to Amazon's success over the past decade-plus and Bezos wrote, ""I assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth [pillar]."" It looks like that fourth pillar could be the Echo smart speaker featuring the Alexa digital assistant. It's been two years since Amazon unveiled the Echo, which can serve as a hub for other smart-home devices like thermostats and lightbulbs, and its functionality has been extended through third-party ""skills,"" which function like voice-controlled apps. Amazon has the scale and infrastructure necessary to grow the Echo and Alexa into its fourth pillar. Nobody expects using voice-activated digital assistants will replace using smartphones or desktop computers, not even Bezos. However, there's clearly a growing trend toward using voice search and interacting with digital assistants. Google recently released a device similar to Echo, Google Home, in order to take advantage of the trend. Additionally, the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary said voice searches tripled over the last two years. As the artificial intelligence (AI) powering these devices improves, their usefulness increases. And as they're used more, the AI improves, creating a virtuous cycle. Amazon has a first-mover advantage in the smart speaker category, and its success with its Kindle line gives consumers confidence in its brand. But Amazon's biggest advantage with the Echo and Alexa is how it can integrate its existing Prime and Marketplace pillars into its Echo business. One of the primary ways Google is considering monetizing voice searches is through commerce. It recently released a development kit for retailers and service providers to create apps for Google Assistant -- the AI powering Google Home and found in several other Google apps -- to connect with potential customers. Eventually, Google plans to take a cut of sales made through these apps. But Amazon already has a direct line to customers and a huge marketplace of items -- one of its three pillars. Customers can order products using Alexa, and Amazon will use your order history to figure out what you want or choose an item based on user reviews and pricing. Of course, that feature is only available to Prime members -- urging more customers to sign up for the service. Non-members can still ask Alexa to add items to their cart for checkout later, but they'd have to finish ordering the old-fashioned way and using your fingers to buy stuff online is so 2014. As such, Alexa serves to support Amazon's Marketplace and Prime and vice versa. Similarly, Prime supports the  Marketplace business by increasing customer loyalty and attracting new third-party sellers to the platform. That, in turn, brings more Prime-eligible products to the Marketplace, increasing the value of Prime. Adding Alexa to the mix strengthens the other two pillars, making it another pillar. Amazon is putting a lot of money behind marketing Alexa. It's been running a television and digital video ad campaign over the last year, including a Super Bowl commercial starring Alec Baldwin. Amazon produced over 100 10-second spots for the campaign based on real-life use cases of the voice assistant. Most recently, Amazon struck a deal with Wynn Hotels to put an Echo device in each of Wynn's 4,748 Las Vegas hotel rooms. The device will be able to control the lights, temperature, drapes, and TV, with potentially more features to come. It's a clever marketing ploy that will introduce thousands of people to the Echo and allow them to have a firsthand experience using it. Behind the scenes, Amazon has over 1,000 employees working on Alexa, according to Bezos. He also said the current functionality of Alexa is ""just the tip of the iceberg."" It's clear from its investments that Amazon sees the huge potential of Alexa. It's not just a stand-alone product, but a potential pillar of its business that supports its other operations -- specifically, Marketplace and Prime. ","

Matthew DiLallo,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. It is very tough to predict the future. At best, analysts and pundits can offer their most educated guesses on what they think might happen. Some forecasts will come to fruition due more to luck than skill, while most will turn out to be bad assumptions. Take my own bold predictions on what I thought might happen in the oil market during 2016. Not more than a year ago, I surmised that oil would bottom out at $20.16 per barrel (yes, I picked that price to poke fun), that a bankruptcy wave would hit the industry, and that deeply troubled natural gas producer Chesapeake Energy would get rescued. Like most prognosticators, I too turned out to be more lucky than good. However, while I had the right outcomes, I only nailed one of my predictions correctly. Still, this review serves as a lesson that, while it is nearly impossible to predict the future accurately, we can use current trends and recent history to develop an informed view of what we might expect to see in the year ahead. With that background, here are my boldest predictions for oil investing in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. At the end of November, OPEC members agreed to end their market-share war and get back to supporting oil prices. They did so by pledging to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels per day starting on the first day of this year. On top of that, OPEC sealed a subsequent agreement with 11 non-member nations that pledged to cut production by 558,000 barrels per day for the first six months of 2017. OPEC expects these cuts to reduce the supply overhang in the market, which if fully adhered to could decrease the market's surplus inventory by 46% within six months. That said, OPEC has a spotty history of following through with its agreements. Because of this, many analysts do not expect full compliance. For example, an analyst with J.P. Morgan predicted that just 80% of the pledged reduction would come to fruition. Opinions elsewhere vary, with most analysts projecting less-than-full compliance. However, I am more optimistic that OPEC will hold firm to this agreement. Driving my view is the fact that OPEC knows that the market is skeptical of these arrangements and wants to prove its detractors wrong. That's why Saudi Arabia has already signaled a willingness to cut below its pledge, if needed, to ensure that this plan works. I fully believe OPEC will deliver this time to save face. Image source: Getty Images. Most analysts believe that OPEC's decision to step in to support the oil market will stabilize oil prices in 2017. On average, analysts expect crude to be at least in the range of mid-$50 per barrel -- though there are some oil bulls out there, including analysts at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, who see crude rising 46% in 2017, hitting $69 per barrel by June due to improving market fundamentals. Aside from that, most analysts see a relatively calm oil market this year. However, one thing that could disrupt the calming influence of OPEC is the potential for a significant supply disruption in 2017. While such events are impossible to predict, they do seem to happen quite regularly. Last year, for example, militant attacks in Nigeria and wildfires in Canada caused millions of barrels of oil to go off line in the spring. In Canada alone, more than 1 million barrels of production per day went off line after leading producers like Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) shut in their facilities to protect them from the nearby fires. In fact, Suncor Energy reported that the forest fires reduced its second-quarter production by 20 million barrels. As a result of these disruptions, crude prices perked up because they forced the market to use up some of its excess inventory. I think that the oil market is ripe for another major disruption in 2017, which I believe could push crude up to $70 per barrel if it happens mid-year. While I am not so bold as to peg the cause, anything from a catastrophic natural disaster in a crucial oil-producing region to a devastating terrorist attack on a major crude-exporting nation could cause prices to spike next year. Image source: Getty Images. While 2016 was a down year for mergers and acquisitions in the oil patch, one of the major trends of the biggest oil and gas acquisitions in the recent past has been a string of mergers between oil-field service companies and equipment makers: What is noteworthy about that last deal is that Baker Hughes had previously agreed to merge with rival Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), but regulators would not bless it due to concerns that the combination would hurt competition in the services sector. Because of those concerns, it is likely that Halliburton's next M&A target will also be an equipment maker, which I predict to be market leader National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV). Such a merger would combine Halliburton's North American shale-focused business with National Oilwell's deepwater equipment expertise. Those divergent focuses likely would not draw scrutiny from regulators. While that transaction would not have the same deal synergies as the Halliburton-Baker Hughes combination, it would enable Halliburton to follow in Schlumberger's footsteps by creating end-to-end solutions for customers. Like most oil-market watchers, I am much more optimistic about 2017 than I was at the beginning of last year. Market fundamentals appear to be heading in the right direction, which should push prices higher. These improving market conditions should fuel more M&A as both producers and service companies seek new opportunities to expand in a market recovery. Bottom line, 2017 appears to be a great year to invest in oil stocks. ","

Shares of electric-car maker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared 17.5% in December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock's rise helped it recover some of its pullback earlier in the year. The Tesla Model S. Image source: The Motley Fool. There's no surefire reason for Tesla's 17.5% gain during the month, but one did stand out as the most likely catalyst for at least a portion of the gain. Tesla stock had pulled back in the weeks following the U.S. presidential election, perhaps because investors were concerned about how Tesla could be impacted during Trump's time as president. Trump has expressed disbelief about global warming and outlined actions for eliminating some government spending related to climate change. But sentiment about how Tesla might fare with Trump as president turned rosier when the president-elect started cozying up to Elon Musk. Trump invited the Tesla CEO to his tech summit meeting in New York City, and even appointed him to his Strategic and Policy Forum. So, Tesla stock may have simply rebounded in December from a sell-off spurred by an overreaction to Trump's election. Of course, there were probably other factors driving the rebound, such as the S&P 500's overall 2% gain during this period, but Trump's warming up to Musk was likely one of the main catalysts for Tesla stock during the month. Investors shouldn't read too much into month-to-month moves like this, but it is notable to see Trump keeping Musk close to his side. Still, investors may want to keep an eye on any political action during Trump's presidency that could impact Tesla. ","

CEO Tim Cook holds the billionth iPhone at an employee meeting in Cupertino. Image source: Apple. Ten years ago today, Steve Jobs introduced the product that would reshape not only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), but also the world. That Macworld presentation will always be considered Jobs' greatest product introduction ever. In what now seems like common sense, Jobs noted that dynamic virtual buttons on a capacitive touchscreen enable endless flexibility and interface innovation, while ""the bottom 40 [percent]"" of all prior phones were occupied by physical buttons. Note that Apple wouldn't actually launch the device until June 2007, a rare instance of the company preannouncing a product. A decade ago, mobile computing meant carrying your laptop around with you and hoping to find a Wi-Fi hotspot. Nowadays, it means having any number of cellular-equipped mobile devices always within reach, be it a smartphone or a tablet. Apple's turnaround had already taken shape circa 2006, and the company was on firm financial footing thanks to the iPod's success, but the iPhone catapulted Apple to becoming the world's most valuable company. Here are 10 charts to celebrate the iPhone's 10th birthday. Last year marked the first time that Apple posted a year-over-year decline in iPhone unit sales. While the initial investor reaction was to fret, it's worth taking a moment to appreciate the incredible run. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. Over the summer of 2016, Apple sold its billionth iPhone. Apple hosted an employee meeting to display the billionth unit (pictured above). Here's how it got there. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. I personally purchased shares of Apple for the first time in 2006, in July of that year for $60.83 (pre-split). Needless to say, buying Apple the year before the launch of the iPhone has been quite an investment. Shares are up 800% since the day of the unveiling. AAPL data by YCharts. Before the iPhone, smartphones were a luxury relegated to the enterprise or high-end power users. The iPhone made smartphones approachable and easy to use, spurring mainstream consumer adoption. There are now over 2.5 billion smartphone users worldwide, according to KPCB's Mary Meeker. Image source: KPCB Internet Trends 2016. The next few don't go as far back, since Apple has changed its financial reporting a couple of times over the years (which breaks financial continuity). On a trailing-12-month basis, the iPhone became a $150 billion business in 2015. With the iPhone stalling in 2016, this figure has come down to ""just"" $137 billion. (The iPhone alone would rank as No. 12 on the Fortune 500.) Compare that to the $2.5 billion in revenue that the iPhone generated in its first year on the market (although Apple was required to account for iPhone sales under subscription accounting back then, stretching out revenue recognition). Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. It's common knowledge at this point that the iPhone is Apple's most important product by far, generating over 60% of sales. This proportion has also risen precipitously over the years, and is currently around 63% on a trailing-12-month basis. In its first year, the iPhone accounted for 8% of sales (same caveat about subscription accounting). Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. TTM = trailing 12 months. A couple of months ago, Strategy Analytics estimated that the smartphone industry collectively generated $9.4 billion in operating profits in the third quarter. Of that pie, Apple bagged a staggering 91% of the industry's profit, thanks largely to its superior pricing power. It also helps that Apple's scale affords it better leverage when negotiating component pricing, helping to reduce costs. Other estimates actually peg Apple's proportion of industry profits at over 100%, since most other companies' smartphone operations only generate losses. Data source: Strategy Analytics. Chart by author. Speaking of superior pricing power, Apple has a unique ability within the smartphone industry to price at a premium with little pressure to reduce prices. Average selling prices (ASPs) are generally resilient (albeit with natural fluctuations), with no signs of deteriorating even amid intense competition. Apple is the only smartphone manufacturer that simply chooses not to participate in lower-end pricing segments. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. Rapid commoditization of Android original equipment manufacturers has led to intense price competition and eroding prices and profits for the entire Android army. Of course, the upside of this approach is dramatic gains in unit share -- Android is by far the most dominant mobile platform today. Data source: KPCB Internet Trends 2016. Chart by author. Estimates for 2016 as of June 2016. With the rise of the iPhone, the App Store has grown in lockstep. Apple announced just last week that it paid out $20 billion in 2016 to developers, and there are now over 2.2 million apps available from the repository. Apple often notes that it has created an entire app economy, and it's not lying. Data source: Apple. Chart by author. It's been a great decade for Apple and its shareholders. As much as investors would enjoy 800% gains from current levels, it would be too much to ask of the next decade. ","

How much of what you think about Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:BHC) is true? Valeant CEO Joe Papa spoke at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday and presented his view about where the company is now and where it's headed. Papa's perspective differs from what some might think about Valeant. Which is the correct view about the embattled company? Let's attempt to separate fact from fiction. Image source: Getty Images. In his presentation at the J.P. Morgan conference, Joe Papa mentioned that some people still think that Valeant ""just buys companies and raises prices."" He said that's fiction -- not fact. Was he right? Valeant came under a lot of fire in 2015 and 2016 for its pricing policies. The company's average price increase in 2015 for 54 drugs was 65.6% -- the highest average increase in the industry. Valeant jacked up the prices of several drugs by more than 500%. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accused the drugmaker of ""predatory pricing."" Based on the company's history, the view that Valeant is only about raising prices has merit. However, Papa consistently talks about a ""new Valeant."" When it comes to pricing, the company truly seems to have turned a new leaf. Papa also mentioned that he hears some people say that Valeant ""can't generate enough cash to meet its needs."" Others have insinuated that the company will have to ""sell assets at distressed prices."" Is Valeant truly that desperate for cash? As for having to sell assets at distressed prices, Joe Papa pointed to the deals Valeant announced this week. On Monday, the company reported the sale of Dendreon to the Sanpower Group for $819.9 million. On Tuesday, Valeant announced the sale of its CeraVe, AcneFree, and AMBI skincare brands to L'Oreal for $1.3 billion. Valeant originally paid $495 million for Dendreon in February 2015. A 65% return in less than two years doesn't sound too distressed. The brands that the company sold to L'Oreal generate annual revenue of around $168 million. That puts the price of the deal at roughly 7.7 times sales. Papa said that the price tag was more than 20 times annual earnings for the products. Those are pretty good multiples. The statements that Papa mentioned people are making are fiction. However, it's definitely a fact that Valeant really wants more cash. The company wouldn't be selling off assets if it didn't. Joe Papa said that Valeant has stabilized and is ready to begin a turnaround. Is his claim fact or fiction? To answer this question, I think we have to look at multiple components. Valeant's stock does seem to have stabilized after a massive drop in 2016. The company's announcements about the two asset sales definitely helped, but Valeant's share price really appeared to have leveled off already. The drugmaker's horrible employee turnover also looks to be under control. Valeant's sales force retention rate has improved from 89.2% in the first quarter of 2016 to 94% in the fourth quarter of 2016. What about Valeant's earnings slide? Papa talked about plenty of reasons to hope that better days are ahead, including growth for antibiotic Xifaxan, expected approval and launch of psoriasis drug brodalumab, other product launches, and several potential pipeline catalysts. However, I think it's too soon to say if Valeant's earnings picture has stabilized. Then there's Valeant's debt. Selling Dendreon and some of the skincare brands helps the company with its goal to reduce debt by over $5 billion within the next 13 months. It's fair to say that Valeant has stabilized its debt and is beginning to decrease it -- but there's a long way to go. So is Papa's statement that Valeant has stabilized fact or fiction? I'd say it's largely fact, with a caveat that there's still uncertainty. Papa also said that Valeant is poised to make a turnaround beginning in 2017. He's stated in the past that the company is ""the turnaround opportunity of a lifetime."" Fact or fiction? My answer is that I just don't know yet. Investors who aren't afraid to take on considerable risk could indeed make a killing on Valeant stock if Papa is right. I'd prefer to wait and see how the company does in the first half of 2017. If earnings begin to rebound some and Valeant's product launches go smoothly, I'd take a serious look at the stock. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:BHC), a drugmaker that's primarily grown by acquisition in recent years, plummeted 86% in 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, making it one of the year's worst-performing stocks. As you may have rightly surmised from the magnitude of the drop, there was a veritable laundry list of issues. To begin with, debt was a major issue for Valeant in 2016. The embattled drug company wound up restructuring the terms of its debt covenants on two separate occasions in order to avoid defaulting on them as a result of its falling EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio. By reworking these terms, Valeant piled on extra fees and accepted a higher interest rate, effectively digging an even bigger hole for itself. Aside from just restructuring its debt covenants, the debt itself has been strangling Valeant's business flexibility. Relatively new CEO Joseph Papa and his management team have been clear that the company needs to sell some of its assets to reduce the $30.4 billion in debt it had at the end of the third quarter. The problem? Valeant hardly made a dent in its debt in 2016, with few takers for its non-core assets. Its peers are well aware of its issues and so aren't willing to pay a premium for its assets. Image source: Getty Images. Valeant was also chastised for its pricing practices, specifically regarding cardiovascular drugs Nitropress and Isuprel, which were acquired in February 2015 and increased more than 500% and 200%, respectively, overnight. Former CEO J. Michael Pearson admitted that he and his company made ""mistakes"" when pricing these drugs, effectively giving lawmakers every reason to be skeptical of Valeant's pricing policies, which have been vital in pumping up sales for its mature drug portfolio. Legal issues also continued to rear their head. Late in the year, federal prosecutors in New York filed criminal charges against a former Valeant executive and the former CEO of drug distributor Philidor Rx Services, which was an owned subsidiary of Valeant. The charges allege that the Valeant exec was steering an undue amount of business Philidor's way, and in turn, he was receiving a cash kickback from Philidor's CEO. Valeant's underlying business model has also been a disaster. The company's flagship dermatology product line saw sales tumble by more than 50%, which was caused by a mixture of poor publicity and its new drug distribution deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance, which is heavily favored to benefit Walgreens. Finally, there were multiple earnings warnings and unfavorable guidance adjustments. Heading into the year, Valeant was expected to earn $13.50 in earnings per share at the midpoint. By year's end, the midpoint was reduced to just $5.40 in EPS. The real bad news for Valeant shareholders is that just because the calendar has changed, it doesn't mean the company is going to get healthier. Valeant has a number of issues to address in 2017, and many may not end well. Image source: Getty Images. For instance, one of the bigger catalysts for the company this year will pertain to the path it takes to reduce its debt. If it continues to believe that selling non-core assets can generate $8 billion, it could be a slow-moving process. It could, however, choose to sell one of its two core assets (Bausch & Lomb or Salix Pharmaceuticals) and take a big bite out of its debt, but it'll also cripple its future growth prospects in the process. Remember, beyond Salix Pharmaceuticals, most of Valeant's drugs are well beyond their patent life and are reliant on price hikes for sales growth. There's also little clarity on the legal front. Even though federal prosecutors have only gone after two parties who are no longer a part of Valeant or Philidor, it doesn't mean Valeant won't be hit with fines and/or sales restrictions for its sales practices. If prosecutors believe that Philidor wasn't acting in the interests of insurers as a middleman, fines could still be waiting. Valeant also has next to no answers as to how it'll kick-start its dermatology business once again. Working out the kinks with Walgreens isn't going to happen overnight. Despite its relative cheapness (just three times Wall Street's estimated 2017 EPS), Valeant remains a value trap worth avoiding. ","

Shares of natural-gas-gathering companies Midcoast Energy Partners (NYSE:MEP) and DCP Midstream Partners (NYSE:DCP) climbed 17.5% and 13.1%, respectively, in December thanks to rising natural gas demand and production. The past couple years have been particularly hard for both Midcoast and DCP Midstream. Natural gas gathering and processing is a part of the natural gas transportation and logistics network that is most vulnerable to changes in production. The further away you go from the end user of a product, the less consistent demand can be. It also didn't help that, in several cases, the services these two companies provided were not on fixed fee or volume-protected contracts. A lot of Midcoast and DCP's woes were from a decline in natural gas prices and volumes, but we're starting to see a change on that frontier. Increased demand from U.S. liquified natural gas exports -- 1.5 billion cubic feet per day last month -- and from new natural gas chemical facilities popping up across the US are leading to higher prices. This is translating to more drilling and greater production. It shouldn't be surprising to see these gains in stock price when you also consider that the total count of active natural gas rigs in the U.S. has grown by 50% in the past six months. One of the reasons this is so important for both DCP and for Midcoast is because they were both considered problem children for their parent companies -- Spectra Energy (NYSE:SE) and Enbridge (NYSE:ENB). It also just so happens that the two parent companies are in the middle of a major merger. MEP data by YCharts. As recently as the second quarter of 2016, Enbridge Energy Partners (NYSE:EEP) was looking into strategic alternatives for Midcoast. Typically, the term strategic alternative is a veiled way of saying sell the business. Likewise, it wasn't that long ago that DCP's sponsor companies, Spectra Energy and Phillips 66, gave the company two long haul natural gas liquids pipelines and $1.5 billion in cash to prop up poor results. Since that time, though, a lot has changed. On top of the rise in gas rigs and consumption, the two companies have taken several steps to improve profitability. Midcoast announced during its most recent earnings release that it had cut costs significantly and would be able to fully support its distribution with cash from operations. DCP Midstream Partners, on the other hand, just announced on Jan. 4th that it would acquire all outstanding assets from the holding company co-owned by Spectra and Phillips 66 and become a stand-alone business. Both Enbridge and Spectra Energy have not made any mention how all of their subsidiary partnerships will be handled when the two combine, or whether it may need to sell some assets. With both Midcoast Energy Partners and DCP Midstream Partners looking like more stable companies lately, it will at a minimum make it easier to find a buyer if the combined company decides to unload these assets. Even though both have shown signs of improving, neither really has the balance sheet strength or operations results to have complete confidence to stand on their own. So until we get some more definitive decisions on what their parent companies plan to do, it's probably best to sit on the sidelines. ","

Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical Company (NASDAQOTH:TKPYY) announced yesterday that it's acquiring ARIAD Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARIA) for $24 per share, or $5.2 billion. The deal removes yet another commercial-stage cancer drugmaker from the market, and the lofty price paid by Takeda, which represented a 75% premium to ARIAD Pharmaceuticals' prior closing price, suggests that the appetite to pay up for promising cancer drug companies remains healthy. Following ARIAD Pharmaceuticals' acquisition, I think pressure could mount for Array Biopharma (NASDAQ:ARRY), Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ:SGEN), and Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) to put themselves up for sale. Should these cancer drug stocks be a part of your portfolio? Read on to find out. Image source: Getty Images. Array BioPharma filed for FDA approval of its melanoma drug binimetinib in June, and an FDA decision is expected sometime in the second quarter of this year. If approved, binimetinimb could offer new hope to patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma. A common cancer, there were 76,380 new cases and over 10,130 deaths because of melanoma last year, and about 20% of those patients have the NRAS-mutation. In trials, median progression-free survival for patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma was 2.8 months on binimetinib versus 1.5 months for the chemotherapy dacarbazine. Patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma who had been previously treated with immunotherapy had progression-free survival of 5.5 months, compared to 1.6 months for dacarbazine. Making Array Biopharma even more attractive to a potential suitor, though, is the potential for binimetinib's use beyond NRAS-mutated patients. Phase 3 trial results suggest that using binimetinib alongside Array Biopharma's exploratory drug, encorafenib, can improve progression-free survival for melanoma patients with BRAF-mutations, too. The median progression-free survival for patients treated with bini/enco was 14.9 months versus 7.3 months for patients treated with dacarbazine, and since up to 50% of melanoma patients are BRAF-positive, that patient population represents a far bigger market opportunity. Seattle Genetics' Adcetris is used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma patients whose disease has returned after a stem-cell transplant, or following at least two chemotherapy regimens, and last summer, the company reported results from a phase 3 trial that may pave the way for Adcetris' use in advanced mature T-cell lymphoma, too. Adcetris' third-quarter sales clocked in at $70.1 million in the U.S. and Canada, where Seattle Genetics maintains sole rights to market it, and the company pocketed another $12.2 million in royalty revenue from Takeda on Adcetris sales outside of those two markets. In both cases, sales were up nicely from a year ago. Adcetris' U.S. and Canada revenue was $59.1 million, and its royalty revenue was $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. Seattle Genetics is also evaluating Adcetris as a front-line therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma, and results are anticipated later this year. Assuming Adcetris' can continue to win use in its current approved setting, and results from the front-line trial pan out, it wouldn't surprise me if another company acquires this one. Perhaps the most intriguing acquisition target of these three is Exelixis. The company's advanced kidney cancer drug, Cabometyx, is off to a fast start, generating annualized sales of $120 million in Q3. However, that nine-figure run rate could be the tip of the iceberg. Afinitor, another second-line drug for advanced kidney cancer, is a billion-dollar blockbuster, and so far, Cabometyx has only captured 20% market share in the second-line setting and 35% market share in the third-line setting. Additionally, recent trials suggest Cabometyx could eventually displace Sutent as the go-to drug in the first-line setting. In head-to-head trials, Cabometyx patients experienced a 31% decrease in risk of death or cancer progression versus Sutent at a median 20.8 months. Progression-free survival was 8.2 months on Cabometyx and 5.6 months on Sutent. Further, Cabometyx outperformed Sutent on overall survival, too. If the FDA gives Cabometyx the OK for first-line patients, then its efficacy advantage over Sutent may be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Through the first nine months of 2016, Sutent's sales totaled $823 million. Cabometyx's potential undeniably makes this company intriguing, and while Exelixis won't come cheap, Takeda paid 22 times forward sales to buy ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, and that multiple suggests Exelixis' take-out valuation of could be as high as $7.1 billion.

 ,01122017,Fool,01052017,"The Ranger comes first in 2019, with the Bronco to follow in 2020. Truck fans, rejoice -- Ranger and Bronco are coming back to the US! Ford may have already unveiled its sole new product for the 2017 Detroit auto show -- the 2018 F-150 pickup -- but it had just a bit more news up its sleeve. At a press conference today, Ford announced that it will bring the Bronco and Ranger nameplates back to the US starting in 2019. This is the current Euro-market Ranger. I can dig it. ""We've heard our customers loud and clear. They want a new generation of vehicles that are incredibly capable yet fun to drive,"" said Joe Hinrichs, Ford's president of the Americas. ""Ranger is for truck buyers who want an affordable, functional, rugged and maneuverable pickup that's Built Ford Tough. Bronco will be a no-compromise midsize 4x4 utility for thrill seekers who want to venture way beyond the city."" That's all we know so far. Ford didn't show off any pictures of the Bronco, but it did say the Ranger would be based on the current Euro-spec model, which is the truck you see here. Both the Bronco and Ranger will be built at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan. This should please at least one Twitter account. Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.

John Rosevear,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) confirmed the worst-kept secret in Detroit on Monday: Production of the midsize Ranger pickup will begin at a Michigan factory late next year -- and a brand-new SUV to be called the Bronco will follow about a year later. Ford's Ranger isn't sold in the U.S. now, but the midsize pickup is still sold in other parts of the world. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Ford Americas chief Joe Hinrichs dropped the news during a presentation at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Monday morning: ""We've heard our customers loud and clear,"" Hinrichs said. ""They want a new generation of vehicles that are incredibly capable yet fun to drive. Ranger is for truck buyers who want an affordable, functional, rugged and maneuverable pickup that's 'built Ford tough.' Bronco will be a no-compromise midsize 4x4 utility for thrill seekers who want to venture way beyond the city."" Hinrichs didn't give much in the way of details beyond that. Here's what we know officially, from what Hinrichs and Ford PR folks said on Monday: The Michigan Assembly Plant has been the center of some recent controversy: It's where the compact Focus is currently built, and Ford has said the next-generation Focus will be built in Mexico. Now we know -- officially -- what Ford will be building there instead. There are a bunch of things we don't know about Ford's new trucks. We don't know when the Bronco will go into production. We don't know (officially) anything about what either vehicle will look like. We can make some very specific guesses about the Ranger (it'll be a midsize pickup in the vein of General Motors' (NYSE:GM) Chevy Colorado and Toyota's Tacoma), but aside from the above we don't know anything (officially) about what Ford has in mind for the Bronco. But the big thing is that we don't know if these will be completely new vehicles. It's striking that Ford isn't using the term ""all-new"" to describe the upcoming Bronco and Ranger. That might be nothing more than an uncharacteristic oversight, but I suspect that it's a hint that the Ranger and Bronco coming to the U.S. will be based on products that currently exist. If so, we might know quite a bit more than Ford has officially said. While Ford stopped building and selling the Ranger in the U.S. in 2011, an all-new version made its debut that year and is currently sold in many markets around the world (including Europe and China). Ford rolled out an updated version of that Ranger for 2015. That's the model shown in the photo at the top of this article. The Ranger-based Ford Everest SUV could be the basis of the upcoming 2019 Bronco. Image source: Ford Motor Company. But what about the Bronco? Some, including your humble Fool, have speculated that the Bronco could be based closely on the Ford Everest, a Ranger-based SUV that (like the Ranger) is sold in many parts of the world, but not the U.S. The Everest is roughly the size of Ford's Explorer, but it's very different, a truck-based SUV esteemed by off-road enthusiasts in places like Australia and China. I've thought for a while that it wouldn't take much to turn the Everest into a fierce competitor to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (NYSE:FCAU) big-selling (and very profitable) Jeep Grand Cherokee for the North American market. I don't expect that we'll hear much between now and then. But your humble Fool will be listening carefully anyway. ","
