,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday as an influential U.S. Federal Reserve official expressed confidence that rising wages would help revive domestic inflation, which has shown signs of softening recently. The yen fell to two-week lows against the greenback and the euro after officials of the Bank of Japan at a meeting on Friday downplayed the likelihood that the bank would begin to roll back emergency stimulus to support the economy. Remarks by New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday that tightening in the labor market should help drive up inflation helped offset concerns by some investors that stubbornly low inflation would not allow policy-makers to raise rates further the rest of this year. “The Fed doesn’t seem to be too concerned about the recent pullback in the inflation data. They are committed to policy normalization,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Last week, the Fed, as expected, raised key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point and left the door open for another rate increase later this year. It also provided details on its plan to reduce its bond purchases in a bid to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent,” Dudley told a local business group in Plattsburg, New York. Traders raised their outlook on a rate hike by the Fed’s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting to 47 percent from 41 percent late on Friday FFZ7 FFF8, CME Group’s FedWatch tool showed. The dollar index .DXY, which gauges the dollar against six other currencies, was up 0.4 percent at 97.537. The euro was down 0.4 percent versus the greenback, to $1.1147 EUR=, while against the yen the dollar increased 0.5 percent, at 111.43 yen JPY=. The euro was up 0.1 percent against the yen, at 124.25 yen EURJPY=. Positioning data showed net bullish bets on the euro reached their highest level in more than six years last week. There was no discernible boost for the single currency from the landslide victory of French President Emmanuel Macron’s government in parliamentary elections on Sunday. Sterling declined 0.4 percent to $1.2732 GBP=D3 as Britain began formal negotiations on its planned exit from the European Union. The UK ruling Conservative Party’s loss of its parliament majority earlier this month raised speculation of a drift toward a “soft Brexit,” which had supported the pound. Many analysts, however, expect developments from the talks would hurt sterling. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s apparent “indifference” toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency’s power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the “cramming” of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a “conspicuous silence” on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short, “gossamer” memo “modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.” Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury’s hands for six months. The CFPB’s role as a public watchdog “extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,” Pauley wrote. “Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,” he added. “It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.” The CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office, which handled legal filings in the case, was reviewing the decision. In court papers, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley’s decision. Pauley has criticized government agencies before, including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research. The case is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v Sprint Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09931. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"June 15 (Reuters) - Metlife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, announced added responsibilities for some of its senior executives, adding to the pool of potential successors to its chief executive. The largest U.S. life insurer named Michel Khalaf president of its U.S. business, effective July 1, to replace Maria Morris who retires from the company this fall. Marty Lippert, the company’s head of global technology and operations will take on added responsibility of MetLife Holdings, the company said. The appointments of Khalaf and Lippert set up a “horse race” for MetLife’s CEO position, held by Steven Kandarian, 65, who currently has no plans to retire from his role, an analyst with Wells Fargo said in a note. Other potential candidates for the top job include Chief Financial Officer John Hele, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart, and Asia head Christopher Townsend, the note said. In June last year, Metlife’s board agreed to waive off its 65-year retirement policy for Kandarian, who has been the company’s president and CEO since May 2011. Ramy Tadros will also join MetLife in September as the new chief risk officer, the company said. Tadros comes from Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, where he served as the global head of insurance. He will replace Stan Talbi, who will retire at the end of August after 43 years with MetLife. (Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp said on Thursday it received U.S. approval for its emergency epinephrine syringes to treat severe allergic reactions that it intends to be a lower cost rival to Mylan NV’s widely used EpiPen, sending its shares up more than 50 percent. The company said it was looking for a marketing partner and would set a price for the product before its launch sometime in the second half of this year. Adamis said its pre-filled epinephrine syringes would be sold under the brand name Symjepi. Mylan has faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations after it doubled the cost for a pair of EpiPens to around $600, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing debate over the high cost of prescription medicines in the United States. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor. “We plan to position the product as a lower cost alternative,” Mark Flather, senior director for investor relations and corporate communications for Adamis, told Reuters. “We want to be part of the solution.” Epinephrine is the life-saving recommended treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications. Mylan has for years owned more than 90 percent of the market for emergency epinephrine injectors and its own authorized generic has recently surpassed sales of the branded version. “With an anticipated lower cost and attractive design, we believe Symjepi will be a meaningful competitor to EpiPen,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a research note. Other rival products are available. Impax Laboratories Inc’s Adrenaclick device is being sold through CVS Health Corp’s drugstore chain for about $110 a pair. Privately held Kaleo earlier this year began selling its Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector that it reacquired from Sanofi SA under an unusual pricing strategy but with little  success so far. The company said it would make the product available at no cost to many consumers but charge insurers $4,500. Sanofi in April sued Mylan, accusing it of engaging in illegal practices to squash EpiPen competition when the French drugmaker held the Auvi-Q rights. Adamis shares soared 53.3 percent to close at $5.75 on the Nasdaq and further rose to $6.00 in extended trading. Mylan shares closed down 2.4 percent at $36.98. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - London-based startup Blockchain has raised $40 million (31.5 million pounds) in a fresh round of funding as the software company rides a wave of enthusiasm for digital currency technology. Nokota Management and Digital Currency Group also participated in the financing round, which boosted Blockchain’s total funding to more than $70 million Tom Hulme, general partner at Alphabet’s venture firm GV, said the firm invested because “the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched.” Founded in 2011, Blockchain makes software that allows consumers and businesses to make transactions using digital currencies such as bitcoin. The firm is named after the internet platform that records and validates transactions between two parties without relying on an intermediary such as a bank. Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product. “Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,” Smith said. “My grandmother uses our product today.” The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology. While far from mainstream, digital currency has enjoyed growing popularity that Smith attributes to the instability of traditional currencies in places such as Brazil, and political uncertainty in Britain and the United States. The day after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Smith said, Blockchain had the second-highest number of new users sign up in a single day. “In you’re in an environment of rapidly deteriorating geopolitical stability,” Smith said, “you are open to new ideas and new products.” (1 British pound = $1.2686) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage of an annual stress test, showing they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession to meet regulatory requirements, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed’s most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year’s level. “This year’s results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,” said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank. “This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.” The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations. Wall Street analysts and trade groups quickly cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis. “We see today’s...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,” said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent. “From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,” he said. Thursday’s results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed’s methodology, using materials they submitted. The second portion of the test, to be released on Wednesday, will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks’ capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed’s. Under the Fed’s worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. However, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks’ aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more of its stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed’s approval. Under the Fed’s examination, Citi’s minimum CET1 ratio in the most stressful scenario was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Citi’s own analysis showed that metric at 10 percent. The Fed’s assessment showed the other five largest banks - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley - having minimum CET1 ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent. Of those, Goldman Sachs had the biggest optimism gap compared with the Fed when it came to the worst-case scenario. Its model produced a 9.8 percent minimum CET1 ratio, 1.4 points better than the Fed’s. Wells Fargo’s metric also fared better in its own test than under the Fed’s, by 0.8 of a point. Conversely, JPMorgan’s analysis appeared to be more dour, with its CET1 ratio coming in 1.3 percentage points below the Fed’s. Bank of America’s was 0.7 of a point worse. Banks that decide to resubmit their plans can only make downward revisions to the amount of capital they plan to use, meaning management teams that were too conservative may regret their submissions even if they pass. “If there is disappointment next week,” said Seiberg, “it is likely because the banks failed to ask for big enough distributions more than it is because the Federal Reserve was too tough.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - It took less than 24 hours for Warren Buffett, one of the world’s savviest dealmakers, to make a C$360 million (US$272 million) paper profit by propping up a major Canadian lender on life support. “It’s a typical Buffett bailout trade,” said Jared Dillian, an independent investment strategist and former trader betting the value of the Canadian dollar and several Canadian banks will fall. “He’s set it up where he’s risking a small amount to make a lot.” Its share price soared 27.2 percent on Thursday to C$19.00, leaving Buffett with a potential 90 percent paper profit on shares he is buying for just C$10 each. Home Capital’s share price nonetheless remains nearly two-thirds below its 2014 peak. “The deal is really low risk,” said John Huber, a portfolio manager at Saber Capital Management LLC in Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns Berkshire stock. “It’s an opportunistic deal that gives him very attractive risk-return terms.” Berkshire’s infusion was much needed by Home Capital, which has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run after being accused of, and then admitting to, concealing mortgage fraud. “The assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving,” said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst. “It implies a seal of approval.” Berkshire’s investment lets Buffett deploy some of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills. “Today’s announcement is a modest positive,” wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst. “But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.” Berkshire’s Columbia Insurance unit is acquiring the Home Capital equity, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, the credit line, if fully tapped, could generate C$180 million for Berkshire. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. His $5 billion Bank of America bet looks particularly savvy: it throws off $300 million in annual dividends, and Berkshire is sitting on an $11 billion gain on accompanying warrants. But with most of those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to requests for further comment. Home Capital’s problems accelerated in mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. “Reputational risk is why he’s getting 9 percent interest” at Home Capital, Seifert said. Berkshire has other investments tied to real estate, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. It also has several investments in Canada, including the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, for which it paid about $C3.1 billion in 2014. Many of Berkshire’s more than 90 business units also offer goods and services in the country, including the Ben Bridge jeweler, Benjamin Moore paints and the BNSF railroad. Despite his paper profit on Home Capital, Buffett believes investment gains and losses in a given period are usually meaningless. Buffett’s foray into Canadian real estate comes amid uncertainty about that country’s housing sector. The Ontario government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is “not going to stop the credit cycle up there,” said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital. “But it’s a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Youth tobacco use in the United States fell to historic lows in 2016, leading public health experts to speculate that a smoke-free generation may be within reach. The number of middle and high school students who used any tobacco product fell to 3.9 million in 2016 from 4.7 million in 2015, figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show, the first such decline since the CDC began reporting the measure in 2011. The number of high school students who smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior to being surveyed fell to 8 percent from 9.3 percent in 2015, the data shows. In 2011 the number was 15.8 percent. “This represents a historic public health victory,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, adding that the dramatic decline was the result of public messaging campaigns directed at youth. The decline in e-cigarette use was even greater, falling to 11.3 percent of high schoolers in 2016 from 16 percent in 2015. “These numbers are astounding,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the department of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health. “It really means that we may be within reach of a smoke-free generation.” The decline in cigarette use follows a broad array of public health campaigns and coincides with the rise of vaping. “This should put to bed any remaining concerns that e-cigarettes are a gateway to cigarettes or will lead to a re-normalization of smoking,” Siegel said. Between 2011 and 2016 overall tobacco use remained unchanged, the CDC’s figures show, though the balance between products changed. As e-cigarette use increased, traditional cigarette use declined. Cigarette use among high school students fell during that period to 8 percent from 15.8 percent while use of cigars fell to 7.7 percent from 11.6 percent. At the same time use of e-cigarettes rose to 11.3 percent from 1.5 percent and use of hookahs rose to 4.8 percent from 4.1 percent. President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes a nearly 20 percent drop in the CDC’s disease prevention and health promotion programs, including eliminating dedicated funding for its Office on Smoking and Health. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement that while the latest figures were encouraging “it is critical that we work to ensure this downward trend continues over the long term across all tobacco products.” He said the agency had issued more than 4,000 warning letters to retailers for selling e-cigarettes, cigars or hookah tobacco to minors since youth access restrictions went into effect last August. Gottlieb, who previously held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, has said publicly that certain e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. The latest data showed no decline in cigarette use among middle school students, where the rate was 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2015. Among middle school students, 4.3 percent used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 5.3 percent in 2015. Analysts with Wells Fargo Securities expect sales of vaping products to reach $4.4 billion in 2017.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters Health) - Tobacco companies have been selling electronic cigarettes as a way to wean smokers off paper cigarettes, but a new study suggests the strategy could backfire. The report in Preventive Medicine found that young adults who occasionally smoked conventional cigarettes smoked more of them if they also used e-cigarettes – battery-powered gadgets that heat liquid nicotine into vapor. “The participants who were vaping ended up using more cigarettes. It’s actually a risk factor for increasing their cigarette use,” lead author Neal Doran said in a phone interview. “They’re not using e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking,” said Doran, a psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Though smokers have been turning to e-cigarettes since they came on the market in 2007 as a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco, little is known about the long-term effects of the practice known as “vaping.” E-cigarette use grew 900 percent among high school students from 2011 through 2015, according to a report from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The 2016 report declares e-cigarettes “unsafe” for youth and young adults (bit.ly/2sKHv9P). The new study’s findings are “consistent with the worry that, regardless of whether vaping is itself unsafe, vaping causes worse outcomes because it leads to more consumption of cigarettes,” Doran said. Stanton Glantz, who directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the study “has tremendous policy implications.” “What this study shows very convincingly is that if they’re using e-cigarettes it’s actually leading them to smoke more conventional cigarettes, not less,” he said. Glantz was not involved with the new study, but the findings are consistent with those of previous research he conducted on adolescents. “The e-cigarettes are having the effect of stimulating conventional cigarette smoking,” he said in a phone interview. “They’re propping up and reinforcing the conventional cigarette market.” Doran and his team studied 319 Californians, ages 18 to 24. At the start, participants did not smoke daily but had smoked at least one cigarette in the prior six months. During the study, they reported their frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use five times at three-month intervals. Those who vaped more also reported smoking 18 percent more cigarettes, the study found. “In the larger scheme of things, e-cigarettes could be good, bad or neutral,” Doran said. “I don’t think we know the answers yet. This is one of the ways in which they could be bad – by people increasing their cigarette use if they’re using both.” Dual users may be exposed to more nicotine and wind up at risk for chronic tobacco use and dependence, the authors write. Previous studies have shown that e-cigarette use increases the risk of smoking tobacco-filled cigarettes. Some prior studies suggest that e-cigarette vapor may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke. But electronic alternatives nonetheless release potentially hazardous chemicals. Sales of vaping products are expected to reach $4.4 billion this year, according to Wells Fargo Securities analysts. With flavors like bubble gum and chocolate peanut butter cup, e-cigarettes or vape pens are often packaged to appeal to youth, who experts believe are more vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering banning flavored tobacco products. Residents opposed to the legislation recently argued that e-cigarettes help them smoke less. But, Glantz said, “This paper shows exactly the opposite is true.” Numbers released this month from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing declines in youth use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes have led some to claim that as proof of the benefits of vaping. But Doran and Glantz don’t see it that way. Instead, Glantz said he views the smoking decreases as evidence of efforts to educate youth about the potential harms of e-cigarettes as well as the results of efforts to regulate e-cigarettes with clean-indoor air laws and minimum-age requirements. States and local jurisdictions have imposed a patchwork of laws pertaining to the use of electronic cigarettes, and some states, including California, now tax vape products. “There’s this Wild West atmosphere with e-cigarettes, and there’s a lot of controversy and disagreement about whether they’re good or bad,” Doran said. “If they’re harmless, and they help people quit, then they’re great. If they make it harder to quit and also encourage people to smoke cigarettes who would not have smoked otherwise, then they’re terrible,” he said. “The truth probably lies in the middle, but where exactly is the key question.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tscS56 and bit.ly/2rBKmg8 Preventive Medicine, online June 3, 2017.

Of course, taking exposure in this controversial industry isn't for everyone, especially if loved ones have paid the price for nicotine addiction. However, buying shares of a company isn't the same thing is supporting their business practices, and it's our job to seek out superior returns wherever we can find them. Strong Asian growth now drives industry profits, along with a resurgence in U.S. consumption triggered by modern vaporizer technology. In addition, the current administration has plans to strip away regulations across a broad swath of industries, making it unlikely that producers will get singled out for criticism in coming years. Given these tailwinds, tobacco stocks are likely to perform well into the next decade. (For more, check out: Back From the Dead: Why Tobacco Stocks Are Soaring.) Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) carries the highest sector capitalization for tobacco producers trading on the U.S. exchanges at $184 billion. It spun off from parent Altria Group, Inc. (MO) at $50 in March 2008 and entered an immediate downtrend that posted an all-time low at $32.04 in March 2009. The subsequent recovery wave reached the upper $90s in 2013, giving way to a multi-year correction that found support in the mid-$70s. The stock rallied above the prior high in 2016 and stalled out, building a base on new support and then spiraling lower in November. That marked the washout low, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reinstated the breakout in January 2017, followed by a powerful trend advance to an all-time high at $122.90 on June 6. Philip Morris stock has been pulling back in a bull flag pattern since that time, while daily stochastics have dropped into the oversold zone. (See also: Philip Morris, the Best Is Yet to Come: Wells Fargo.) Both monthly and weekly indicators have held buy cycles through this period, signaling a bullish divergence and potential pullback buying opportunity ahead of continued upside. Even so, a more advantageous trade entry might come if aggressive sellers break short-term support and knock the stock down to the top of the first quarter range and 50-day EMA at $115. Altria Group expanded into spirits and finance leasing services following the Philip Morris spin-off,​ but tobacco remains its biggest profit component. It fell just 7 points during the 2008 economic collapse, returning to the prior high in 2010, ahead of a 2011 breakout that reached $70.14 in July 2016. A pullback into the fourth quarter settled near $60, ahead of a January 2017 rally into March's all-time high at $76.54. (See also: Altria Optimistic on FDA's Filing of Heated Products.) Altria Group shares sold off into May, testing new support near $70 and turning higher into June, settling into a narrow platform that traded within 60 cents of resistance this week. On-balance volume (OBV) has already risen to a new high, highlighting strong institutional sponsorship that should support a fresh rally leg into the low $80s, where a two-year rising-highs trendline could trigger another reversal. Reynolds American Inc (RAI) rallied above the 2008 high in 2011 and entered a rising channel that accelerated into a steeper channel in 2014, highlighting impressive relative strength. The uptrend stalled near $50 at the end of 2015, giving way to a shallow correction that ended with a high-volume October gap to a new high in the mid-$50s. It took three months to clear the high posted in that session, yielding a long series of new highs into last week. (For more, see: Reynolds Announces Leadership Roles Post Acquisition by BAT.) The stock sold off with the broad market, dropping into the first test at the 50-day EMA since January, and it is still testing that level. Weekly stochastics fell into an unconfirmed sell cycle in reaction to the decline, raising odds for an intermediate correction lasting a minimum of eight to 12 weeks. Given this scenario, a pullback into deep support at $50 could offer a buying opportunity. Tobacco manufacturers and distributors are leading the broad market, resistant to broad headwinds facing other high-yielding instruments.

By the end of the year, the New York City-based company is aiming to increase that number to 35. PM estimates that approximately 1.8 million adult consumers have already quit smoking cigarettes and switched to iQOS. As a result, the Marlboro maker has benefited from strong sequential growth, doubling down on its iQOS products in Japan, where it currently holds nearly 10% of the market. The FDA has started its scientific review of the firm’s Modified Risk Tobacco Product application for iQOS, which would give it a competitive edge by allowing it to label its products as lower risk in the U.S. Investors are looking at the global tobacco giant’s new strategy and weighing whether the firm’s “reduced risk” innovation will offset secular pressures.

Michael J. Kramer,06222017,Investopedia,06152017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs What exactly is Visa Inc. (V)? Is it a financial firm or a credit services provider? What about a technology company? That sounds crazy, right? Or does it? Don't believe me; look at the makeup of the Financial Select Sectors SPDR ETF (XLF) and see the top 25 holdings: There's no Visa. Yeah, it is a company with a market cap of almost $220 billion, bigger than that of Citigroup (C), but it's not in the top 25 of the financials. So if it's not a financial, then what is it? Well, of course, Visa is a tech company! Just look at the Technology Select Sector XLK SPDR (XLK), and there it is: Visa with 3.38 percent weighting in the ETF. By the way, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is also there, with a 2.21 percent weighting. Incredible, right? How come Visa and Mastercard are technology companies while American Express is a financial company? There's a simple answer: The three companies are fundamentally different in a significant way. Visa is an electronic payment network, while American Express issues cards and takes on the debt of its cardholders. Fundamentally, banks and financials depend for the most part on interest rates because when banks lend money, they charge a rate of interest. When rates are low they make less money, and when rates rise they make more money. Currently, interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve all go to a bank's ability to make money. Visa is dependent on how many transactions are occurring on its network charging a fee for the use of the network. Financials also have default risks associated with them that a company like Visa does not. Because banks and financials hold the debts of their cardholders, there is a risk the cardholder will not pay those debts and default on them, resulting in a loss for the card issuer. Again, for a company such as Visa, those risks are not present. Visa's biggest risk would be declining usage of its network. V PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts  All of this matters because of the way investors value the company. Visa is priced as a growth stock with a 2018 forward P/E ratio of almost 28. We can see why. Analysts are looking for Visa's revenue to grow to $21.81 billion by 2019 from $17.88 billion in 2017, a growth rate of almost 22 percent. V Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Compare that to the growth of American Express, where revenue is expected to grow to $35.99 billion from $32.74 billion, a top-line growth rate of only 10 percent. AXP Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The difference is reflected in the performance of the stocks over the past decade or so. V data by YCharts Visa's stock performance resembles that much more of a technology company than a financial company. The market certainly values Visa like a tech company, with a valuation closer to that of Facebook Inc. (FB) and Alphabet Inc.

Jeff Cox,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for the ouster of 12 board members at Wells Fargo due to the fake accounts scandal that has rocked the bank. In a letter sent Monday to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, the Massachusetts Democrat said the scandal has ""revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices."" Warren said the central bank has the authority under federal statute to remove the members who were on the board as the matter transpired. ""We have received the letter and plan to respond,"" a Fed spokesman told CNBC. In an agreement with multiple authorities last September, Wells agreed to pay a $185 million fine in conjunction with a scandal in which some 2 million client accounts were created without the customers' knowledge. More accounts may be involved, according to subsequent allegations. Even after paying the fine, Wells has continued to undergo reputational damage amid congressional inquiries and additional disclosures Warren, who has been a harsh critic, pointed out in the letter multiple instances where she believes the board at Wells failed customers. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices — problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Wells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo shares gained about 1.1 percent in early trading, about in line with the sector. Warren did not limit her criticism to Wells — she also said the Fed ""has done nothing to date"" to punish the bank ""despite its ample statutory authority."" ""I urge you to use the tools Congress has given you to remove the responsible board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country's largest banks,"" she wrote. The scandal arose as bank employees sought to meet aggressive sales demands. Employees would enroll customers in various programs without their consent in order to make quotas that have since been disbanded. Some 5,300 employees have been terminated as a result, and the bank also has a new CEO, Timothy J. Sloan, who took over for John Stumpf. For the Fed to act, it would need to establish that any individual board member's actions were unsafe or unsound to the bank. The Fed likely would need to initiate an enforcement action and prove its case. Yellen told Congress during testimony shortly after the scandal broke in September that the Fed is reviewing all operations for large banks and believes that in cases of wrongdoing, ""senior management (should) be held accountable.""

Antony Currie,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wells Fargo is driving its stagecoach further into the mud. The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers' mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right. The actions at issue might seem to help struggling borrowers: Wells Fargo lowered some customers' monthly mortgage payments, potentially making them manageable. But there are two huge potential problems. First, the bank did this while also extending the duration of the loans – in one case by some 30 years. That greatly increased the total interest borrowers were on the hook to pay over the life of their loans. Second, Wells Fargo made these changes, according to the lawsuits, without getting the consent of either the customers or the relevant bankruptcy courts. Wells Fargo denies this, saying it notified customers and does ""not finalize a loan modification without receiving signed documents"" from the required parties. The trouble is, Wells Fargo has mucked up mortgage lending and modification in the past. It was one of the five lenders that in 2012 agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government and 49 states to rectify poor loan servicing and foreclosure practices. Last year it forked over $1.2 billion to settle claims of reckless lending under a Federal Housing Administration program. Home loans should have been squeaky-clean after all that. Add to that its recent $185 million fine after retail bankers chasing aggressive account-opening targets created 2 million fake bank and credit-card accounts – events that cost former Chief Executive John Stumpf his job – and there's a sense of a bank still not ensuring it has fundamental checks and balances in place. Wells Fargo isn't alone. The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 exposed the many failings of the financial-services industry. For now, though, most of its big rivals appear to have put the worst of their transgressions behind them. Sloan's shop keeps swerving into new ones.

Tae Kim,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wall Street is increasingly worried over the future growth opportunities for the two best-performing stocks in the market during the past year.Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD shares are both down significantly in recent days. Nvidia declined more than 5 percent over the past week through midday Thursday, while AMD fell 12 percent in that time period.The Nvidia decline was in part sparked by a negative Citron Research report on Nvidia Friday.""Take your profits and move on to Google (Alphabet). Exposure to the identical array of 'sexy businesses' with less risk on the downside,"" Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a post entitled ""NVIDIA: The Moment that Separates the Gamblers from the Investors. NVDA to Trade back to $130."" Left cited competition coming from Intel, Google and Xilinx in the data center markets and the likelihood of slowing growth in its gaming graphics card business as reasons for his skeptical view on Nvidia's market value.Wells Fargo is also concerned over rising competition in Nvidia's data center business. The firm reiterated its underperform rating on the company Wednesday.""We think that Nvidia has done very well in establishing itself as the dominant provider of standalone accelerator solutions for data center, but believe that this is already reflected in Nvidia's stock value,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Wong wrote in a note to clients. ""Over time we think additional providers of standalone accelerators might emerge, helping to drive growth in the standalone processor market but reducing Nvidia's market share in this market.""Even with the move lower, Nvidia shares have rallied 218 percent through midday Thursday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 17 percent return. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. AMD is right behind at No. 2 with a 156 percent return in the same time period. In similar fashion to the negative Nvidia notes, Goldman Sachs told investors to sell AMD shares Monday, questioning whether the recent cryptocurrency-driven demand for the company's graphics cards will last. ""According to our checks, the RX 570 and RX 580 graphics cards are sold out at numerous retail websites including NewEgg and Microcenter.

"Sumit Roy, ETF.com",06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Who would have thought that on the day  the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark federal funds rate for the third time in six months, interest rates across the curve would plunge? But that's exactly what happened on Wednesday, confounding many analysts who predicted higher long-term rates. The Fed made its widely expected move, raising its overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent, keying off data that showed the U.S. economy at full employment and growing steadily. The central bank's upgraded ""dot plot,"" which maps where central bank officials see rates headed in the future, suggests that another rate hike could be coming later this year. More from ETF.com:Tech ETFs retreat: Pullback aheadHere's what advisors are worried aboutMuni ETFs: No summer vacation But at least for now, the bond market doesn't care. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped by 8 basis points to 2.13 percent after briefly touching 2.1 percent earlier on Wednesday, its lowest level of 2017 (bond prices and yields move inversely). U.S. 10-Year Treasury Bond Yield In turn, many bond ETFs, such as the $46 billion iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), hit their highest levels of the year. AGG is now up 2.8 percent, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is up 4.6 percent; and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) is up 7.1 percent. Those numbers are particularly impressive considering this was supposed to be a bad year for bonds based on the consensus expectation at the start of 2017. YTD Returns For AGG, LQD, TLT According to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, the moves in bond prices on Wednesday may have less to do with the Fed rate hike than a pair of tepid economic data points released on the same day. Early in the day, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell by 0.1 percent in May, while its core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices) only grew by 0.1 percent, below the 0.2 percent increase that was anticipated. That translates into year-over-year growth of 1.9 percent for the headline CPI and 1.7 percent for the core CPI ― both below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target ― and the lowest reading for the core in two years. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in May sagged by 0.3 percent, much worse than the zero change that was expected and the largest decline in 16 months. ""The data that came out on Wednesday showing a slowdown in inflation and contraction in retail sales has made people question whether the Fed will hike as aggressively as previously thought,"" explained Jacobsen. ""The big move in 10-year yields came around the same time as the CPI and retail sales data came out. Weak consumer spending and slowing inflation means the terminal rate for the federal funds rate may be well below what the Fed's aiming for,"" he added. Perhaps the fall in the 10-year yield shouldn't have been surprising. There's been a familiar pattern in recent years where investors anticipate that rates will finally take off as the economy improves, only to see them come back down as data disappoints. In fact, despite all the hand-wringing about rising rates ever since the Fed embarked on the current tightening cycle in late 2015, it turns out that the 10-year yield is actually lower today than it was when the central bank made its first hike. Currently, the 10-year yield stands at 2.13 percent compared with 2.30 percent on Dec. 16, 2015. Even the five-year yield is lower, at 1.73 percent currently, compared with 1.75 percent on the day of the first hike. Wells Fargo's Jacobsen says that for anyone who's been waiting for higher interest rates to invest in bonds, now may be the time to throw in the towel. ""It could feel like a bus that never shows up if you're waiting for yields to spike higher. If you've been sitting in cash and waiting for yields to rise before getting back to your strategic allocation to fixed income, you may want to start dollar cost averaging toward your target,"" he explained. Equities have taken these lower rates in stride. The S&P 500 remains in record-high territory amid record-low volatility. Investors aren't interpreting lower rates as a bad thing, except for perhaps financials, which is now the second-worst-performing stock market sector behind energy. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up 5.3 percent this year, well behind the 9 percent gain for the broader S&P 500. ""Financials have been hurt by the flattening yield curve,"" Jacobsen noted. ""That doesn't look to be getting any better anytime soon. If the Fed talks up another rate hike before the inflation data actually turns, I'd worry about the Fed being too far ahead of the curve rather than too far behind it.""

Brian Price,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"With bullion recently hitting a three-week low of $1,257, one commodities trader is adamant that the charts are signaling sunshine on the horizon for gold bugs. Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services, is undeterred by what's been a volatile June for gold as he believes the commodity will enter into a long-term uptrend swing. ""I'm a longer-term bull in gold and if you look at the long-term chart the trend is still higher,"" Iuorio said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""What the Fed said yesterday is disconcerting to the market, and that's why the dollar rallied so hard."" The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for only the fourth time since the financial crisis, which was expected. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen took a decisively more hawkish tone despite the fact that inflation has fallen behind estimates. Iuorio feels deteriorating data will soon pull dollar prices down and, if gold stays above $1,235, then the longer trend is ultimately positive for the yellow metal. Historically, the dollar and gold are inversely correlated as a fall in dollar prices increases the value of other currencies. Such a move drives demand for commodities, like gold, as investors seek alternative assets to invest in. However, Iuorio warned that more hawkish rhetoric could indeed deter his thesis. ""I'm going to be wrong if they keep that talk up,"" the trader said. ""Gold's going to go lower. If it settles below $1,230, that's going to change me into a bear."" That said, Iuorio doesn't believe the Fed can continue with its hawkish tone and therefore feels confident in where gold prices are heading. Lastly, another factor for gold prices in the near term could be India. Bob Iaccino, of Path Trading Partners, noted on ""Futures Now"" that a tax on the precious metal is slated to go into effect at the end of the month in that country. This could cause local jewelers and private citizens to rush into the market and purchase gold in bulk before the tax comes into play, which would also help drive prices higher.

Annie Pei,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Crude officially entered a bear market with Tuesday's drop, and one technical strategist is seeing another 30 percent drop in the commodity. On CNBC's ""Futures Now"" Tuesday, Paul Ciana of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that based on the charts, oil is well on its way to dropping to the $30 range, levels unseen since last April. ""It just keeps going down, breaking supports and failing at lower resistance levels,"" said Ciana. ""It's the absolute definition of a downtrend."" But on the same chart of oil, Ciana also pointed out that the crude crush could actually be signaling a rally in the bond market. A note released by BofAML on Tuesday, titled ""Bonds smile as oil cries,"" remarked on the inverse moves between crude and bonds that has been occurring over the past years. According to Ciana, the inverse relationship is playing out once again ""on an even larger scale,"" meaning that if crude continues to fall, bonds could soar even higher. ""Bond prices have risen to exceed the peak of [that double bottom this year, confirming] that the U.S. 10-year yield will likely fall to 1.97 percent this summer, if not sooner,"" he explained. Additionally, stocks could also be in trouble if crude falls. While Ciana doesn't see oil being a direct cause of a downturn in the market, depending on ""how much more the decline accelerates"" in crude, it could intensify any drop that may happen. And the outlook for crude on a fundamental basis isn't too positive, as Ciana also points out that demand for crude may fall during the summer.With Tuesday's drop, oil prices have now sunk 19 percent year to date, largely thanks to supply issues related to OPEC and non-OPEC countries.

Elizabeth Warren hates big banks. But none more so than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Her displeasure with the California-based bank is understandable given that Wells Fargo spent the last decade and a half opening fake accounts for customers in order to artificially inflate its performance and thereby maximize its executives' annual bonuses. The latest example of Warren's ire was on display Monday, when she sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen calling for the removal of 12 members of Wells Fargo's board of directors -- for the record, that'd leave only three. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote, according to CNBC, which first reported on the letter. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices -- problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Senator Elizabeth Warren. Image source: Senator Warren's official website. Wells Fargo's executives deserve the blame and vitriol that have been heaped on them since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed the scam last year. While they make millions of dollars a year, the customers they preyed on were among the most vulnerable citizens in the country -- retirees living on fixed incomes and recent immigrants. To make matters worse, the company then retaliated against employees who sought to blow the whistle on the scam. Under the watch of Wells Fargo's executives and the board's oversight, the 160-year-old bank's once-sterling reputation has been deeply sullied. Given this, it's hard to disagree with Warren's assessment of Wells Fargo. The board was ultimately responsible for policing these types of risks and behaviors. The fact that they didn't, and that the scam was in many ways an indispensable element of Wells Fargo's business model, is prima facie evidence that they bear culpability for it. At the same time, one might find it worth acknowledging that Wells Fargo's directors were deceived in a sense, too. Prior to the fallout, the board's principal liaison with the bank's operating committee was John Stumpf, who at the time, though no longer, was both its chairman and CEO. As the company wrote in its 2015 proxy statement: Mr. Stumpf, with over 33 years of experience at Wells Fargo, has the knowledge, expertise, and experience to understand and clearly articulate to the Board the opportunities and risks facing the Company, as well as the leadership and management skills to promote and execute the Company's vision, values and strategy. The Board believes that Mr. Stumpf, rather than an outside director, is in the best position, as Chairman and CEO, to lead Board discussions regarding the Company's business and strategy and to help the Board respond quickly and effectively to the many business, market, and regulatory reform issues affecting the Company and the rapidly changing financial services industry. This description is laughable in hindsight, but Stumpf and his predecessor Dick Kovacevich had purposefully cultivated such a pristine image by then that few people would have questioned them. Image source: The Motley Fool. There's also value to keeping some of these directors around. They made an enormous and egregious mistake, but one can hope that they learned a lesson in their failure to perform their oversight duties. And that lesson, if it indeed has been learned, could very well make Wells Fargo a stronger organization. That may or may not be a fair assessment, but assuming that it is, there's value to their continued presence on the board. It's like the story of Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, who learned of an employee's mistake that cost the company $1 million. Watson not only refused to fire the employee, but he even rejected the employee's letter of resignation. ""Fire you?"" Watson responded. ""I've just invested one million dollars in your education.""

Image source: Getty Images. The fundamental challenge facing the banking industry is that the core product is a commodity. At its most basic level, every bank offers the same standard bank account, car loan, mortgage, and so on. Thus a bank's ability to provide other services and features that keep their customers coming back is paramount to retaining deposits and making profitable loans. Below, we'll explore the nine banks ranked most highly on customer loyalty as measured by Brand Keys, from first to the worst. Image source: Company. The largest bank by assets in the United States, JPMorgan has its hands in virtually everything related to banking and finance. The company boasts that it has a relationship with 60 million households in the United States. Its Chase credit card unit scores highly among everyday spenders and the affluent alike, receiving high marks for rewards and customer service, which gives it the No. 1 position in cards. Image source: Company. Unlike the others in the Big Four U.S. banks, Citi is really a global banking institution. It operates out of the world's largest metropolitan areas and has only a modest presence in smaller cities in the U.S. Yet it has remarkable reach into consumer spending through its credit cards business, which recently won a partnership with Costco, giving it the ability to tap into the wallets of the wholesale retailers' 53 million members with its highly rated Costco co-brand card. Customers love its cards' Price Rewind feature, which enables its cardholders to get a refund automatically when a product is advertised at a lower price within 60 days after purchase. Image source: Company. When Brian Moynihan took the job as Bank of America's chief executive officer, he made the customer experience paramount in rebuilding the bank's image -- and its profitability. Bank of America has invested heavily in its mobile and online banking services to improve customer satisfaction even as it has reduced the number of branches across the United States. The investment has paid off handsomely in the form of increased customer loyalty and approval ratings. Customers processed 108 million checks through the mobile app versus 170 million deposits in one of its branches last year. The bank brought private banking services to all of its clients with a banking-by-appointment feature so that its customers never have to wait in line to speak to a representative. Image source: Company. Bank of New York is hardly a traditional bank. It operates as a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides the back-end accounting services to keep everything running smoothly. Custody banks have inherently loyal customers due to the fact that moving billions of dollars of assets to another custodian is no easy task, and because the bank benefits from scale that enables it to manage its customers' assets at a price other banks would struggle to match. Image source: Company. Like Bank of America, PNC is ahead of the curve in creating products that are more convenient for customers while being more profitable for the bank. Thanks to investments in its online and mobile banking products, it recently reported that 60% of its customers use its ""non-teller channels"" for the majority of their transactions, up from 40% just three years ago. Its Virtual Wallet service enables its customers to make a budget, manage bills with the help of a calendar, and quickly see how they spend each and every dollar that flows into their accounts. Image source: Company. Once a pure-play credit card issuer, Capital One has become a bona fide banking operation that offers everything from checking and savings accounts to auto loans and even commercial banking services. The bank made inroads with consumers when it acquired ING Direct in 2011, which brought the bank more than 7 million customers who used its online banking services. Capital One has built on its ING Direct acquisition with an online banking service that its customers love -- a recent presentation notes that its mobile applications score the highest ratings in the iOS App Store. The bank also offers some of the highest-yielding money market accounts of any bank on this list, which certainly helps to keep its customers' loyalty. Image source: Company. Once known as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC is a worldwide banking operation that operates primarily as a corporate bank and credit card issuer in the United States. The company makes its ""internationally minded"" customers its priority through HSBC Premier, which provides banking and wealth management services to the mass affluent who live in large cities spanning from Seattle to New York City. With 2.4 million customers in the U.S., it has the smallest domestic operation of any of the banks on this list, given its focus on wealthier, international customers. Image source: Company. Calling itself ""America's Most Convenient Bank,"" TD Bank provides retail banking services to 9 million customers through approximately 1,300 branches along the East Coast. Its TD Select Savings Account offers free ATM services and reimburses customers for ATM fees charged at non-TD ATMs around the country. The company has mastered campaigns designed to promote customer loyalty, famously turning its ATMs into ""Automated Thanking Machines"" to deliver gifts to its customers -- cash, a trip to Trinidad to see a family member, and a unique experience throwing out a first pitch at a Blue Jays home game, for example. Image source: Company. Known colloquially as ""America's largest community bank,"" Wells Fargo has always operated as a simple retail banking institution. Convenience is key to customer loyalty, and Wells Fargo has the largest retail branch network of any U.S. bank, providing service to its customers through 6,200 banking locations and 12,000 ATMs scattered from coast to coast. Thanks to its large mortgage servicing business, it also has a relationship with millions of homeowners who aren't located near one of its branches. ","

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you follow bank stocks and big bank stocks, in particular, you should get acquainted with the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks. I refer to it frequently when I write, and therefore want to give readers a brief overview of exactly what it is, and why investors should care about it. The best way to think about the KBW Bank Index is to analogize it to the S&P 500, which tracks shares of 500 publicly traded companies with the largest market capitalizations in the United States. But instead of being industry agnostic, as the S&P 500 is, the KBW Bank Index focuses on only large-cap banks -- 24 of them, to be precise. These are banks that you've no doubt heard of, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). These are the four biggest banks in the country. They're also -- with the exception of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), the best-run big bank in the country -- the four that are weighted most heavily on the KBW Bank Index. The index weights its components according to a measure of market capitalization, adjusted for a bank's share price. This helps to explain why, as you can see in the table below, Citigroup carries the greatest weight on the Index, even though it has a smaller market capitalization than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, respectively. Name Weight on KBW Bank Index Citigroup 8.82% Bank of America 7.85% JPMorgan Chase 7.83% US Bancorp 7.83% Wells Fargo 7.68% State Street 4.54% Bank of New York Mellon 4.30% Northern Trust 4.03% PNC Financial 3.97% M&T Bank 3.97% SunTrust Banks 3.87% KeyCorp 3.81% BB&T 3.76% Fifth Third 3.63% Citizens Financial 3.52% Capital One 3.48% Regions Financial 3.30% First Republic Bank 2.86% Huntington Bancshares 2.75% Comerica 2.47% SVB Financial 1.80% Zions Bancorporation 1.65% New York Community Bancorp 1.25% People's United Financial 1.06% Source: Invesco. There's one side note that's worth pointing out when it comes to the KBW Bank Index. That is, not all of these banks have the same business model. Some are universal banks, which operate both investment and commercial-banking operations. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup fall most comfortably into this category. A second group consists of so-called custodial or trust banks. The three banks on the list that most naturally fall into this category are State Street, Northern Trust, and Bank of New York Mellon -- and I consider the latter to be a particularly interesting bank. These banks focus less on making loans and taking deposits and more on the administration of fixed-income securities for institutional investors like hedge funds, university endowments, and insurance companies. The final group are pure-play commercial banks, specializing in taking deposits and making loans. When most people think about a bank's business model, this is what they have in mind. The largest among these is Wells Fargo, followed by U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial, and Capital One Financial, respectively. Image source: Getty Images. An index like this is important for investors because it allows you to see whether a particular stock is in line with its peer group. Viewed in isolation, it's impossible to say whether a particular bank stock is cheap or expensive -- or efficient or inefficient -- or whatever metric it is that you're trying to tease out. But if you have a control group against which to compare a bank's valuation, profitability, or efficiency, then you can get a much better idea of its relative value or performance, which explains why I can confidently say that U.S. Bancorp is the best-run big bank in the country. This is what the KBW Bank Index enables one to do. And it's why I recommend that investors have a general understanding of what it is and how to use it. ","

Christy Bieber,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chase announced recently that its Sapphire, Sapphire Preferred, and Sapphire Reserve cardholders would be eligible for 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points if they obtained a mortgage with Chase bank by Aug. 6, 2017.  The offer was available only for current cardholders and only for a new purchase, not a refinance. It was not the first offer of its kind -- Capital One also made an offer of free mileage last year, and Wells Fargo has offered rebates for mortgage loans in the past -- but it was a generous offer, with rewards points worth around 2.1 cents per point. While getting points or other rewards for taking out a mortgage loan seems attractive if you're thinking about buying a home anyway, there are three big reasons why it's unwise to go with a particular mortgage lender just to earn miles or other credit card rewards. Image Source: Getty Images. Chase made its announcement in May and stipulated that cardholders who want the points would have to apply by the deadline on Aug. 6. This is a very limited amount of time to do your research into the mortgage terms offered by different lenders. Most incentive deals that mortgage lenders offer have deadlines, which puts artificial time pressure on you. Your mortgage will likely be the biggest debt you carry during your lifetime. You need time to carefully compare the different fees, interest rates, mortgage points, and other terms various lenders will offer you. The process shouldn't be rushed, and you shouldn't try to move faster than you're comfortable with just so you don't miss out on credit card points, airline miles, or other incentives. Your credit card points will be spent within a matter of months, while airlines miles earned for taking out a loan last only a trip or two. A mortgage is an obligation lasting 15 to 30 years. If you buy a house before you're ready because you don't want to miss out on a mortgage incentive, you'll be stuck with a real estate commission, transfer tax, and a host of other expensive costs if you need to sell the home. Unless you have all of your ducks on a row -- like a 20% down payment at the ready, as well as an emergency fund to cover maintenance and repairs -- you could also end up having to pay for private mortgage insurance or fall into debt if something unexpected happens. If you jump into a loan too fast, you may also feel the need to refinance a few years down the road in order to get better terms. Refinancing is a costly process, as you have to pay for a new appraisal and the closing costs of the new loan. Getting out of one mortgage loan and into another is also a time-consuming process that requires you to produce lots of paperwork. Banks may make up the cost by charging a slightly higher mortgage loan rate -- Chase's rates as of late May were 3.875% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan, while Bankrate had some lenders offering rates as low as 3.750% -- or they may charge more than other lenders for various costs like the credit check, home appraisal, loan origination fee, or underwriting fee. Even a small difference in interest can make a big difference in payments. A $200,000 loan at 3.750% would cost you $926 per month, and the total loan cost would be $333,443. By comparison, the same $200,000 mortgage at a 3.875% interest rate would come with payments of $940 per month, and the total cost of the loan would be $338,571. That tiny difference in the interest rate would cost you an extra $5,000 over the life of the loan -- and odds are the rewards you earned wouldn't come close to that value. Don't cheat yourself out of thousands of dollars by falling for a gimmick. Wait until you're ready to buy a home, carefully research different lenders with good reputations, and choose the best overall deal. If you just happen to get a reward from that lender, that bonus will be icing on the cake. ","
      
    3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Open a Mortgage to Get Rewards -- The Motley Fool

If you're in the market for a bank stock, then valuation is one thing you should keep in mind. Holding all else equal, the cheaper you can buy a stock, the bigger your return is likely to be. It's for this reason that I intermittently check bank stock valuations on the KBW Bank Index, the leading index of large-cap bank stocks headquartered in the United States. The average stock on the index trades for 15.5 times the bank's projected earnings per share over the next 12 months. That's not cheap, but it's far from expensive when you consider that the average stock on the S&P 500 is valued at 35 times forward earnings. But while bank stocks in general are valued at a lower multiple to earnings than the typical large-cap stock, some banks are still cheaper than others. Based on the forward P/E ratio, here are the five cheapest big bank stocks right now: Stock Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) 10.6 Citigroup (NYSE:C) 12.5 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 12.9 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 13.0 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 13.1 KBW Bank Index average 15.5 Data source: YCharts.com. Aside from Capital One, which is heavily concentrated in credit card loans and thus exposed to elevated credit risk, as credit card loans tend to default at higher rates than other types of loans, the four other cheapest big bank stocks have something in common: They're the largest banks in the country. Citigroup is the smallest of the four, yet it still has $1.8 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is the largest, overseeing $2.6 trillion in assets. And Bank of America and Wells Fargo fall in between these two. Why would these banks trade at lower valuations than smaller banks? It seems to me that there are four reasons. First, under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, global systemically important banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup can't operate with as much leverage as their smaller, simpler peers can. This is because they're subject to higher capital requirements, which necessarily reduces leverage and profitability. Second, all of these banks are effectively shut out of the market for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo each hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Therefore, they're prohibited under federal law from acquiring other banks. Citigroup doesn't face the same constraint, as its depositary base is weighted more heavily toward international deposits. But given the New York-based bank's strategy over the past few years of shrinking its balance sheet as opposed to growing it, it's safe to say that Citigroup is not in the market to acquire other banks, either. The net result is that these four banks are all largely confined to organic growth, which could weigh on their returns in the future relative to banks that aren't similarly prohibited from merging with or acquiring other banks. Image source: Getty Images. The third reason is that these four banks are especially difficult to analyze. Much of this comes from their sheer size and the extent of their operations. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup are all universal banks, meaning that they run both investment and commercial banking businesses. Commercial banking is straightforward, consisting of taking deposits and making loans. This yields recurring revenue that doesn't fluctuate widely on a quarterly or annual basis. Investment banking operations are much harder to understand and forecast into the future. This is primarily because an investment bank's top line is influenced by volume and volatility in the credit markets, both of which are all but impossible to predict in advance. Finally, while I've touched on this already, the biggest banks in the country are all subject to much more robust regulatory requirements than smaller banks. Their compliance exams are more intense. They face additional hurdles on the annual stress tests. And the way they structure their balance sheets is much more closely scrutinized by industry overseers. Does this mean you should avoid buying shares of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup? Not necessarily because, remember, while they may face more headwinds than smaller banks, their shares can also be picked up at much lower valuations. That said, as I've written in the past, given the towering heights of the stock market today, I think investors have more to gain than lose from waiting for a potential pullback in the market before diving deeper into stocks.

When I think about banks, I often think about Citigroup (NYSE:C) as being in a league of its own. It isn't because of its performance, which has left a lot to be desired over the past decade. It's rather because of its emphasis on international banking. There are a number of ways to show this, but one of the most obvious is to look at the distribution of Citigroup's deposits. More than half of the New York-based bank's deposits are held in offices outside the United States: Data source: regulatory filings. Chart by author. Even a cursory glance at this chart shows how different Citigroup is from the three other megabanks that sit atop the financial-services industry. JPMorgan Chase, which also has a large international presence, only has 17% of its deposits held in overseas offices. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo and Bank of America both come in at less than 10%. This goes to the core of Citigroup's business model. It was roughly a century ago that the bank became one of the first in the United States to establish a global banking presence, gaining footholds throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America, in addition to its operations in the United States. Citigroup not only has offices in other countries, but its operations abroad also pivot around consumer banking, the primary purpose of which is to attract deposits. This distinguishes it from the three other banks in the chart, whose international operations focus more on investment banking, as is the case with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America in particular. The purpose of investment banking is to help global corporations issue debt and equity, manage risk, and move money around the world. Image source: Getty Images. Citigroup's extensive overseas presence is a double-edged sword. While it serves to distinguish the $1.8 trillion bank from its peers, it also introduces another layer of risk. In the lead-up to the Great Depression, for instance, Citigroup gained notoriety for selling toxic Latin American bonds to its customers in the United States. And throughout the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, Citigroup came within a hair's breadth of failure because of overexposure to soured bonds issued by the likes of Brazil and Argentina. In an effort to reduce risk and simplify its business model since the financial crisis, Citigroup has pared down its operations abroad. In 2008, for instance, it sold its Japanese trust banking unit to Mitsubishi UFG Trust and Banking. Citigroup followed that up a year later by selling its retail brokerage business in Japan. And six years after that, it did the same with its retail banking operations in the East Asian country. These moves have simplified and streamlined Citigroup's business model. They've also helped the bank raise capital and de-risk its operations. But even though they represent a retreat for Citigroup in terms of its long-term focus on global banking, it's clear from the chart that the bank continues to distinguish itself from its peers in terms of the size and reach of its international footprint.

Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","

Last week, the Financial CHOICE Act, a hulking 600-page piece of legislation regarding the banking industry, made its way through the House of Representatives. A full transcript follows the video. John Maxfield: It's going great, Gaby, how are you doing? Lapera: I'm doing pretty good. I had an exciting weekend. I was volunteering at Pride with The Motley Fool, so that was really exciting, and I went rock climbing. What a fulfilling weekend. Maxfield: Nice, that is a really fulfilling weekend. I basically spent the weekend mediating disputes between my five-year-old twin sons. [laughs] That's kind of like the referee in a boxing ring. Lapera: [laughs] Oh my gosh, I'm very impressed. My brother also has twins, and they are young and also a handful. You have the patience and energy of a saint. Talking about patience and energy, let's turn to Congress. Today, we're going to talk about the CHOICE Act, which stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs. Another in a long line of acronyms that are kind of just jammed in together to try to make something that's fun to say. The CHOICE Act just passed the House on Friday. The whole thing with the CHOICE Act, the reason that we're talking about it on the show, is that it's basically there to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is what was regulating all of the banking stuff that we've been talking about for literally, what, two years now, Maxfield? Maxfield: Yeah. Or five years. You and I have been talking about it for two years now. One of the ways that I think is really helpful to think about the Financial CHOICE Act is that, in all industries, particularly banking, you can look at it through the lens of cycles, different types of cycles -- the business cycle, the credit cycle, cycles in consumer confidence. But another cycle that you can use to think about, not only in the financial services sector, but in all sectors, is the regulatory cycle, specifically in terms of whether the industry has more power, or the regulators have more power, at any particular point in time. And after the financial crisis, when the Dodd-Frank Act was passed on largely partisan lines, basically just supported by the Democrats, that shifted a lot of power away from the industry over to regulators. And basically what the Financial CHOICE Act does is it reverses that. And it was passed in the house, like we said last week, on largely partisan lines, but the partisan lines were different: This time, it was Republicans supporting it and Democrats not supporting it. What it tries to do is take that power that Dodd-Frank gave to the regulators and give it back to the industry. Lapera: Yeah. The bill is sponsored, unsurprisingly, by a man named Jeb Hensarling, who is a Republican. As with most things political, things are falling along party lines. I want to take an opportunity to say that Maxfield and I are going to do our best to stay unbiased throughout this discussion, but everyone is a person and we all have opinions, and our opinions don't necessarily reflect that of The Motley Fool, but we're going to try to give you an informed, as objective as possible, discussion. My anthropology roots tell me that there is no way to have a completely unbiased discussion, so I'm going to leave it at that and talk a little bit more about the philosophy behind the CHOICE Act. Basically, a lot of people don't like Dodd-Frank. They think it puts too much pressure on the banks, it's too hard for them to make money the way that Dodd-Frank is structured. There's a few different parts to it, the big parts of the Financial CHOICE Act. But I think the one that a lot of people focus on is, the Financial CHOICE Act is looking to end ""too big to fail."" Maxfield: Right. To your point, Gaby, about the partisan basis, I want to address that before I jump into the too-big-to-fail part. The one thing to keep in mind is, even though Dodd-Frank was passed on partisan basis, and the Financial CHOICE Act made it through the House on a partisan basis, the fact of the matter is, almost everybody agrees, most knowledgeable sources agree, that Dodd-Frank went too far. And I'm somebody who thinks that there needs to be a robust regulatory framework around the banking systems, just because banks are so highly leveraged, and because they play a role in the monetary system of the United States and they're kind of, to a certain extent, an extension of the federal government. So you can't let banks go out there and do what they want, because they are acting, in a sense, on the part of taxpayers. So I think that's some good context to keep in mind. But Dodd-Frank, almost everybody would agree that it did go too far. So now the question is, how far do you tailor it back? Lapera: Yeah. And to get into that about being an extension of the government, it's not just that with the systemically important financial institutions. It's not just our country -- it's the entire world is tied into these financial systems. So people get concerned that if they fail, it's going to be -- to borrow a term from the Vietnam era -- a domino effect with other people's economies. So there is a lot of feelings riding on this, and a lot of this depends on how you view economic theory. I think 90% agree with you that Dodd-Frank potentially went too far. I don't know that the CHOICE Act is the answer, either. We'll see what happens. We'll get a little bit more into it. Let's talk a little bit about the actual components of the Financial CHOICE Act, and what they look like, what they mean in terms of existing legislation. Like I said earlier, too big to fail -- that's one of the big key components, ending too big to fail, of the Financial CHOICE Act. Maxfield: Right, if we go back to the financial crisis, here's an overarching way to think about this too-big-to-fail component. You had Citigroup, Bank of America, and AIG, you had your Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns -- these very large financial institutions. These financial institutions hold trillions of dollars in assets on their balance sheets, and oversee a large chunk of the deposits that you and I and everyone else deposits. So if one of those were to fail, it could cause catastrophic damage to the economy. In fact, if you go back to the Great Depression, the thing that caused the Great Depression, or transformed it from a typical recession into the Great Depression, was the failure of a bunch of banks. So that informed this whole too-big-to-fail idea where, even though it's extremely unpalatable to go in and bail out these huge firms with these executives that make tens of millions of dollars a year, and basically save them from their own mistakes, even though that's very unpalatable on almost every level, it does save the U.S. economy. What the CHOICE Act does is it tries to reduce the ability of regulators to step in and bail these banks out. Let me be clear. There is a very solid theoretical framework behind that, because the thought process is, if you go in and bail out these big banks and they know you're going to bail them out in the future, they have much less incentive to act responsibly. That's that whole thought process. If you go back to the financial crisis, the term -- I'm pulling a blank on the term -- but if you go back to the financial crisis, this was one of the main arguments that they asserted. So what Hensarling's act tries to do is dial that back, and it does it in a couple of different ways. No. 1, it removes the regulator's authority to take over these organizations that are troubled and liquidate them in an orderly way, and it transfers that authority over into the bankruptcy code. Lapera: Just a quick side note for listeners, this is called the Orderly Liquidation Authority, that's OLA, which you might see floating around if you're reading about this online. That's actually codified into law, and it's the way the government stepped in and made sure there was an orderly liquidation during the most recent financial crisis of banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Maxfield: Right. Also, the term I was thinking about earlier was moral hazard. That's the hazard that, if you're going to step in and bail someone out -- an institution -- that institution has less incentive to act responsibly. And like I said, that's grounded in theory. Lapera: And it's actually really funny, because earlier you were talking about spending the weekend refereeing between your two children. This is almost just a parenting concept, that if you reward that behavior, you're going to keep getting bad behavior. Maxfield: Exactly, that's exactly right. And all parents can understand that. Another important thing it does in that too-big-to-fail context is that it seeks to restrict the Federal Reserve's discount window lending to what's known as Bagehot's dictum. Lapera: There's a lot of words in there. What is a discount-window lending? I mean, what is discount-window lending? I sound like an old person... ""What is the Facebook?"" What is discount window lending? Maxfield: Discount window is, when a bank gets into trouble, one of the things that will happen is, its depositors will know it's in trouble, so they will all run on the bank at the same time to withdraw their deposits. That's known as a bank run. The problem with a bank run is, because banks are so leveraged, and they only hold a small amount of actual cash in terms of relative to deposits that they have, that can cause them to be completely illiquid. They can run out of cash trying to satisfy their depositors. What the discount window does is it allows banks to take some of its assets on its balance sheet, go to the Federal Reserve, use those assets as collateral, and then get cash from the Federal Reserve to satisfy depositors, to thereby stop or prevent a bank run. Maxfield: It happened with... the name of the bank is escaping me right now, but it happened with a major bank that was based in California during the financial crisis. And it was actually that bank that was taken over and turned into OneWest, which was the institution that was associated with Steven Mnuchin, who's now the Treasury Secretary. But it does still happen, but it's much less frequent because there is FDIC deposit insurance now, as well, that reduces the incentive for people to have to feel like they need to run on the banks and take their deposits out, because the FDIC will be there to stand behind the banks, anyway. So what Bagehot's dictum does is it says that the Federal Reserve should only allow banks to access the discount window -- or it says that the way the Federal Reserve could use the discount window is to lend freely and early in times of crisis, which is what happened last time -- but it should only do so to ""solvent firms and against good collateral at high interest rates."" It's that high-interest rates part that's really significant, because the idea there is, if you were using a punitive interest rate, banks are going to be less inclined to use the discount window. And if they're less inclined to use the discount window in times of crisis, the thought is that, ahead of time, they will be much more careful about the quality of the assets they put on their balance sheets, and the ability to turn those into cash in the public markets as opposed to having to go to the discount window of the Federal Reserve. Lapera: And you have just revealed the disconnect between Democrats and Republicans -- which is that Republicans believe that banks can be forced to be responsible enough to take care of themselves, and Democrats do not, and that's why they're pushing for all this extra regulation. Right now, that falls along partisan lines. Whatever you think is up to you. That's basically what's going on. Maxfield: I will say, to take politics out of this, I studied banks pretty intensely for a number of years, and I will tell you that in history, the thing that we know is that you need a strong and independent central bank, you need it at all times, but particularly in times of crisis. So you do want to be really careful in terms of both the authorities you give to a central bank in that situation and, in this case, the authorities that you take away from it. But again, this is something that, it will get worked out, and the pendulum swings back and forth between regulators and industry. And right now, this is a bill that swings at way back on the other side. I would say, just like Dodd-Frank went too far swinging the pendulum into the favor of regulators, Hensarling's act seems to me to go too far in the other direction. Which makes sense, given that Dodd-Frank was partisan on the Democratic side and the Financial CHOICE Act is partisan on the Republican side. Lapera: Yeah. Actually, you gave me a good segue earlier to kind of slide into this next big thing that the act is going to do, which is that it's going to significantly cut down on the authority of regulatory agencies. I think one of the most important things to note is that they're going to subject financial Regulatory agencies to the REINS Act. The REINS Act basically says that any agency that wants to impose a rule that costs more than $100 million a year needs to run it by Congress first, and if Congress fails to approve a rule within 70 days after it's been proposed, then the rule would go away -- it would be null and void. Which is hard, because if you have partisan control of committees, rules that would go against whatever the nature of that committee is at the moment can just sit for 70 days and never even get heard, and then it just doesn't happen, and that means that regulation is going to happen much more slowly. Maxfield: Right. The way it works now is that the Federal Reserve, the FCC, the CFPB, all these different regulatory agencies -- and this isn't just in the financial services arena, this is across all regulatory agencies and all industries, that in order to regulate their industries, they are given the authority to pass rules that, like, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to pass rules about appropriate products that can be marketed to customers. And those rules, there is a long process where they get insight from the industry and other interested parties. But then those regulatory agencies have the power to put those rules into place and require the industry to follow them. What the Financial CHOICE Act would do is add another layer in that step, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but here's the problem. That additional layer is Congressional approval of these rules. And you can imagine that that really adds a lot of complications to that whole process. It's not like you're just adding just one more hurdle. You're adding an extremely high hurdle that, depending on who is in control of Congress and the Senate at any particular point in time, these regulatory agencies may not be able to jump over. Again, I think that's probably the whole point of subjecting them to the REINS Act, which passed earlier this year. Lapera: Right, it's to reduce the amount of federal legislation that exists, that's really what the point of it is. But it's hard because, yes, maybe regulatory agencies shouldn't be making up rules without Congressional approval, but on the other hand, Congress takes a really long time to do things sometimes. Sometimes, agencies come up with stuff to protect people or help people, and then it gets codified into law, but until then, they're just responding quickly to the needs as they see them. So it's this really hard to push-and-pull thing that you have with government. Let's talk a little bit also about the Fed, which you mentioned is going to be affected by this act. It's hard, because the Fed has also been subjected to the REINS Act, as well. Maxfield: Right. There's one other piece to this. It's not only the REINS Act that they're subjecting the regulators to. They also subject the regulators to the appropriations process. That's a really important thing. Right now, let's take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is actually an agency within the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve is an independent agency. So you have multiple layers of independence. But one of the principal pieces of independence is that, in the case of the Federal Reserve, it is a profit-making entity -- it has a huge balance sheet full of assets that earn interest in time. So it doesn't have to go to Congress to get money to operate, which gives it independence from Congress. The same thing is true with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- don't quote me exactly on this -- since it was put into operation, and in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it has issued a total of something like $11 [billion] to $12 billion worth of fines to the industry, and it can use those fines to do, among other things, fund its own operations. So it, too, is kind of detached or insulated from that political process that is a part of the appropriations process. And what the Financial CHOICE Act does is, it would take away that independence and require these institutions to go to Congress for the funding, which would have a significant impact on them. Lapera: Yeah. And that's one of the big criticisms of the CFBP, that its critics levied at it, is that the CFPB might start just issuing fines just because it has a financial incentive to, as opposed to doing it because the fines really need to be issued. So that's kind of where that Financial CHOICE Act section, that's what it's trying to get at. Maxfield: Right. Then, to your point about going straight at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve is one of those institutions that, people either don't know anything about it, or they love it or hate it, or they don't know anything about it, and they love or hate it. And one of the things that people tend to think about when they think about the Federal Reserve is that it's some sort of conspiratorial entity that controls the money supply and does so for the economic elites, and things like that. And one of the reasons that these conspiracy theories are able to grow take on the forms that they're able to take is because it's a relatively non-transparent organization, particularly when it comes to managing the money supply. Another main principle of the Financial CHOICE Act is to increase the transparency of the Federal Reserve, both in terms of its overall operations and in terms of the way it manages the money supply. And what I mean by managing the money supply is, when it decides to raise or lower interest rates, because that's the lever that causes the money supply to expand or contract. Lapera: Yeah, and it's not just that. For example, the stress tests, no one is 100% sure what's in them. Maxfield: Exactly. So the stress tests right now, these happen once a year for large banks. The purpose of them is to see how they would perform in a hypothetical economic scenario that is analogous to the financial crisis. This is actually a very good piece of the regulatory pie in the banking industry, because it keeps bankers' eyes on making sure that the assets they put on the balance sheets aren't going to submit them to massive losses if, and when, the economy turns down, like it inevitably will. But the issue with the stress tests is that, when the banks submit all the information to the Federal Reserve for the stress test, when the banks are going through their planning process, in terms of structuring their balance sheets and their operations in a way that will help them make it through the stress test, is that the Federal Reserve doesn't actually give them the exact model that the Federal Reserve is using in the course of the stress test. So the banks are flying blind in this regard. If you talk to bankers, most all of them will say that they think the stress tests are a good thing. I'm talking about the bankers, the CEOs of the very large banks in this country, those are the ones under the most stringent stress-test requirements. They will almost universally say that they think the stress tests are a good thing, but they will also almost universally complain about the fact that the Federal Reserve doesn't share the models it uses in the course of the stress test, so banks are just flying blind. Lapera: Yeah. That actually is kind of paired with another aspect of the CHOICE Act, which is that they are proposing that if banks hold a certain amount of money on their balance sheet, essentially as an emergency fund, that they won't be subject to quite as much regulation as they are now. Maxfield: Right. One of the main narratives that emerged from the financial crisis was that the reason the crisis was able to metastasize the way it did was because banks were overleveraged, they were undercapitalized. Which means, a typical bank will hold $1 worth of equity for $10 of assets. At the time, you had, like, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and companies like that -- Lehman Brothers, at certain points, was leveraged by something like 30:1. What that means was, if its assets fell by just 3%, if the value of its assets fell by just 3%, it would render it completely insolvent. In the wake of the financial crisis, all of these additional capital rules came in to require banks to not only hold more capital, but dictated the type of capital that they were supposed to hold. What the Financial CHOICE Act does is say, ""Look, let's do away with all these complicated capital rules,"" and these capital rules are incredibly complicated, ""and let's replace them with a simple leverage ratio where banks, all you do is compare how much equity or capital a bank has to its assets, and just use that simple ratio."" And if banks meet the threshold laid out in the Financial CHOICE Act, then they can be exempt from all of these additional regulations that Dodd-Frank is imposing, particularly on large banks. So the thought process is, look, if you just make them hold more capital, they're safer, so they don't have to do all these other things. Lapera: So the thing that the Financial CHOICE Act offers for banks that do this, in particular, that's probably very valuable for them is that, right now, really large banks have to go to the Fed before doing stuff like issuing a dividend or changing their business plan. And in theory, if they meet this leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they won't have to ask for permission to do any of that stuff anymore. Of course, it's really interesting, because when you say a simple ratio with assets, just like with people, there are assets that are really easy to move and there are assets that are really hard to move. So I don't know, I personally need a little bit more clarity around what that ratio actually looks like. It's a lot harder to sell a house and get that cash than it is to have cash to pay, and that analogy also holds for banks. They have some assets that are really hard to offload and some that are really easy to offload, so how did they end up calculating that ratio? The reason I don't know the answer to this yet is that I have not actually read all 600 pages of this act yet. I'm working on it, I'll do it eventually. So one of the reasons I haven't read all of it yet is because, it's passed the House and it's about to go to the Senate, and the Senate, in my opinion, is not going to let this pass as originally written. There's probably going to be quite a few amendments, and the language is probably going to change quite a lot, if it passes at all. Maxfield: And here's another really important point. They're saying that, if a bank holds enough capital to satisfy this simplified leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they're calling that an off-ramp -- the off-ramp being, you get off the highway with all these other regulations. Well, one of the really interesting regulations that it's looking like the Financial CHOICE Act is trying to attack and would allow these big banks, in particular, to avoid -- and let me read this from the executive summary of the Financial CHOICE Act. It says it will ""exempt banking organizations that have made a qualifying capital election from any federal law, rule, or regulation that provide limitations on mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions of assets or control ... "" So what does that mean? Through the 1970s-1980s, the banking industry deregulated. It allowed banks to open up house, operate branches, and allowed banks to operate across interstate lines, which is something that, in the past, they generally weren't allowed to do. Well, the quid pro quo in that case was that they were going to allow these banks to grow and do all these things and have more flexibility in terms of their operations, but on the other side of that, they wanted to stop these things from getting so enormous that if one of them were to fail, it would basically wipe out all the wealth of the United States. So they did that by saying, ""If you hold 10% or more of the nation's deposits, you are not allowed to then acquire another depository institution."" And right now, there are three banks that fit that -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. So right now, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, they cannot go out and buy any other banks, they're not allowed to because each one of them holds more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, if I'm reading it correctly, it's saying that, as long as those banks hold enough capital to meet that threshold in the act, they would then be free to merge together or buy other banks. So you could theoretically, in this case, see a merger between JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two biggest banks in the country. And I really doubt that that would happen because their branch bases completely overlap each other, so there would be too much redundancy in doing that. But people should think about, is that something we want to do? Do we want each individual bank to hold, say, 25% or 50% of the nation's deposits? Is that a direction we want to go in, given the fact that since the Civil War, more than 17,000 banks have failed? So it's a good thing to keep in mind. Lapera: Yeah, no, that's a really overwhelming thing to think about. We need to wrap up because we've been here for a while. It's partially because there's just so much stuff in this act to discuss. There's so many little things that could end up having really big impact. We'll continue to track the progress of the bill. Like I mentioned earlier, I really, really do not think this is going to get through the Senate completely unchanged. We'll talk about that more when we know more. Was there anything else you wanted to say, Maxfield? Maxfield: No, I think that's it. The only other thing is, it would dramatically impact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We could talk about that on a different show because that deserves its own conversation. But again, to leave off on the same point I made at the very beginning, the Financial CHOICE Act, like the Dodd-Frank Act, is neither good nor bad. It's just a reflection of the swing of the pendulum back and forth between regulators and industries. We've seen this many times in the past. And generally, when the pendulum swings, regardless of the direction in which it swings, it goes too far. Dodd-Frank went too far. The Financial CHOICE Act went too far. So to your point, Gaby, when this goes through the Senate, it's likely that they're going to tailor it back. Lapera: Yeah. That seems very likely, especially given everything that we've seen during this Administration so far. Who knows what'll happen? Things in D.C. either move at breakneck pace, or very, very slowly. We'll keep you guys up to date, don't worry. If you guys have any questions, definitely email us at industryfocus@fool.com, or by tweeting us @MFIndustryFocus, and let us know what you'd like to hear about next. If you tweet us @MFIndustryFocus, I am actually now in charge of our Twitter feed, so yeah, that will actually be me responding to you. Thank you, Austin, for listening to this very long episode about financial regulation. [laughs] Austin Morgan: Of course. Lapera: He's looking at me like, ""You owe me one, bud."" Maxfield: He's asleep, yeah. Morgan: Just another Monday. Lapera: [laughs] As usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I hope everyone has a really great week. I hope that your week is less stressful than mine. I get stressed out every time we talk about politics on this show, so I'm going to go take an antacid and eat some lunch. Everyone, have a great day! ","
      
    What's the Deal with the Financial CHOICE Act? -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big bank stocks have surged over the past eight months, yet they still look relatively cheap when compared with regional bank stocks. Is this a sign you should buy the former and sell the latter? Not necessarily. The easiest way to see the difference in valuation between banks based on size is to compare the median valuation on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks the two dozen biggest banks in the country, with the KBW Regional Banking Index, which tracks 50 banks with between $5 billion and $40 billion worth of assets on their balance sheets. Index Median Forward Price-to-Earnings Multiple Median Price to Book Value Median Price to Tangible Book Value KBW Bank Index 14.88 1.36 1.92 KBW Regional Banking Index 17.41 1.66 2.18 Data source: YCharts.com. It doesn't matter which of the three primary valuation metrics you use: Regional banks such as Glacier Bancorp (NASDAQ:GBCI) and Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK) generally trade at a higher multiple compared with big banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Based on earnings, which is the metric that should take the lead in an analysis today, the median regional bank on the KBW Regional Banking Index trades for 17.41 times earnings per share over the next 12 months. The figure on the KBW Bank Index is 14.88. The story is the same when you look at valuation as a function of book value. The median regional bank stock trades for 2.18 times tangible book value, while the median big bank trades for a multiple of 1.92. Investors need to appreciate that these figures alone don't mean big banks are better buys than regional banks. A better interpretation of the difference is that regional banks have more opportunities to grow. Regional and community banks are growing like weeds. Image source: Getty Images. There are two ways to grow in the bank industry. The first is through organic growth -- attracting new customers through marketing efforts and gaining more of each customer's overall financial business, be it a mortgage, credit card, car loan, whatever. The second avenue is through mergers and acquisitions. Holding all else equal, a bank that can use both avenues can grow faster than a bank that can use only one. Herein lies the difference in valuation between the nation's biggest banks, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and regional banks, such as Glacier Bancorp and Bank of the Ozarks. As I've discussed in the past, the nation's three biggest banks, which are weighted heavily on KBW's large-cap bank index, are all shut out of the acquisition game, at least insofar as other depository institutions are concerned. That's because Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo each already hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. As such, these three banks are legally prohibited from acquiring other banks. Regional banks aren't similarly proscribed. Because none of the banks on the KBW Regional Banking Index come even close to the 10% deposit threshold, they can still merge with or acquire other banks, thereby supercharging growth. That's exactly what they've been doing. To cite just two examples, Glacier Bancorp has acquired nine banks since the beginning of 2009, and that's on top of 15 other deals it has completed since 1990. The same is true at Bank of the Ozarks, which has purchased a total of 16 other banks since the financial crisis. OZRK Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. The net result is that these two banks have seen their balance sheets expand rapidly over the past decade. Bank of the Ozarks went from $2.5 billion in assets 10 years ago to more than $19 billion today. And while Glacier Bancorp's recent ascent hasn't been as steep, the Montana-based bank has nevertheless more than doubled in size over the same stretch. Thus, the reason big bank stocks seem cheap is that their ability to grow is tightly constrained compared with their smaller, simpler counterparts in the regional banking space. ","

Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has had a total return of about 7%, and the chart above shows that half of the sectors have outperformed that figure while the other half have underperformed. Finally, even if you want to own the whole market, Sector SPDRs give you the opportunity to get some tax benefits. In a rising market, simply owning the S&P 500 ETF as a single holding doesn't give you chances to reap any tax-loss benefits. However, even when the overall market rises, you'll generally find that some sectors lose ground. By using tax-loss harvesting strategies, you can collect tax losses on those underperforming sectors while deferring tax on rising sector ETFs until you sell them well into the future. There are a couple ways in which Sector SPDRs aren't the perfect investment. First, even with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.14%, they're still more expensive than broader-based market ETFs. For instance, you can find ETFs tracking the entire S&P 500 for as little as 0.04%. The other major problem is that like most ETFs, you have to pay brokerage commissions to trade Sector SPDRs. Even those brokers who offer commission-free ETF trading typically don't include the Sector SPDRs, with some instead offering their own proprietary sector-based ETFs. With low commissions available from many brokers, the costs of owning Sector SPDRs doesn't have to be prohibitive, but it is somewhat of a drag on performance. Nevertheless, for investors looking to make plays on specific parts of the market, Sector SPDRs are a good option to consider. With a long history behind them, Sector SPDRs will remain popular ETFs far into the future. ","

Myra P. Saefong,06222017,MarketWatch,06152017,"Published: June 16, 2017 2:23 p.m. ET U.S. output is higher now than when prices traded in triple digits By Don’t expect oil prices to climb into the triple digits soon. “$100 per barrel oil remains a pipe dream,” for a market suffering from “massive overproduction,” said John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo, in a recent note. Global oil producers have said that crude production “should crater with prices around $40-$50 per barrel, [but] they are having a hard time restraining themselves from producing,” he said. That’s particularly true for the U.S., which is producing more petroleum today, with West Texas Intermediate oil prices

                                   at around $45, then it was producing in July 2014—the last time the market saw $100-a-barrel oil, said LaForge. A chart from Wells Fargo shows that U.S. crude-oil and liquid-fuels production stands around 15.5 million barrels a day. It was at just over 14 million barrels a day in mid-2014: Prices of $80 a barrel are likely unattainable as well, “until the world’s oil producers stop overproducing,” said LaForge. Read: Why global oil production looks set to grow in 2018, despite OPEC-led output cuts “We continue to hear that big cutbacks are on the cusp of happening,” he said. “The evidence, however, implies otherwise. And the longer oil prices remain low and range-bound, the harder it will be for prices to bounced above $60—as production costs have dropped significantly since 2014, which keeps more producers in the game.” And each time prices do bounce toward $60, the “temptation to overproduce,” may be “overwhelming for those countries that rely heavily on oil revenues to sustain their economies and social programs,” LaForge said. Given all of that, “we are not expecting the price of WTI crude oil to climb anywhere near $100 per barrel over the next few years,” he said. Instead, Wells Fargo expects it to remain low and range-bound, bouncing between $30 and $60 per barrel. Still, “there is the possibility that the WTI crude-oil price finds its way into the high $30s to low $40s” at year’s end and if that happens, “we could become bullish in the short term,” LaForge said.

                                   on track for the biggest price and percentage gain since Dec. 18, 2014. The previous record close was Wednesday’s close of $46.33, while the previous all-time intraday high of $46.99 was reached on March 16. Don’t miss: Oracle leaps to record as cloud transition hits turning point. Oracle’s results prompted no less than 22 of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet to raise their stock-price targets. The new average target of $53.64 is 6.6% above current levels, and 11%, above the average target of $48.32 the day before the results were released. Analyst Steve Koenig at Wedbush Securities raised his price target to $56, which is 11.3% above current levels, from $44, which was 5% below Wednesday’s close of $46.33. That prompted Koenig to upgrade the stock to an outperform rating, after being at neutral since at least September 2014. Koenig said his new bullish outlook was based on improved software-as-a-service visibility, as Oracle’s applications business “gets over the ‘hump’ of its transition to cloud,” as well as to robust bookings activity and solid database licensing activity. He wrote in a note to clients that he sees potential for “sustained follow-through on positive price action as long-only investors adjust their [Oracle] weightings.” BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman boosted his stock price target to $57 from $48, citing one of Oracle’s “strongest quarters in years,” while J.P. Morgan’s Mark Murphy lifted his target to $55 from $51, saying he believes “this quarter will mark a turning point in investor sentiment.” Benchmark’s Yun Kim lifted the target to $62 from $55, saying the results indicate Oracle has reached the “critical scale” in its cloud business, making the stock “one of the best ways to play the current cloud computing trend.” Kim’s new target ties him with Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White for the second-highest on the Street, according to FactSet, just behind Wells Fargo’s Philip Winslow’s target of $62.50.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"The third-largest U.S. bank on Friday said the accord resolved claims that its Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loans should have been ineligible for guarantees under a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs loan guaranty program. Such claims were raised in a lawsuit filed in 2006 and made public in 2011, in which Georgia mortgage brokers Victor Bibby and Brian Donnelly sought to recoup losses that the government, and by extension taxpayers, suffered on guaranteed loans that went into default. “Wells Fargo made a lot of money passing off charges to the veterans that Wells Fargo was supposed to pay itself,” James Butler, a lawyer for the brokers, said in a statement. Bibby and Donnelly had sued eight lenders to recoup similar losses, and Wells Fargo’s settlement is the seventh and largest. “We are committed to serving the financial health and well-being of veterans,” Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan said in a statement. “Settling this longstanding lawsuit allows us to put the matter behind us and continue to focus on serving customers and rebuilding trust with our stakeholders.” Wells Fargo has in the last 11 months been addressing fallout from other practices, including a scandal over its creation of unauthorized customer accounts, and its charging of borrowers for auto insurance they did not want or need. On Friday, the bank said it is examining whether it may have imposed unnecessary financial harm on customers through residential mortgage fees, frozen deposit accounts, and “add-on” products such as identity theft protection. In 2011, Wells Fargo had reached a $10 million settlement in a separate class action lawsuit claiming it imposed excessive closing costs on about 60,000 refinancing loans for veterans. Friday’s settlement is also notable because the government declined to help Bibby and Donnelly pursue their lawsuit under the federal False Claims Act. Such lawsuits let private whistleblowers sue on the government’s behalf and share in recoveries. Government intervention often results in larger settlements. A lawyer for the eighth lender in the whistleblower case, Mortgage Investors Corp, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is U.S. ex rel.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"At a hearing on insurance fraud, Moran, who chairs the insurance subcommittee that would be at the forefront of any congressional investigation into the issue, said his staff  “is already in communication with Wells Fargo regarding these concerns, and I plan to follow up accordingly to gather additional information on the circumstances and what is being done to address these issues.” Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House, which means Moran has more power to take action on the issue than the many Democrats who expressed outrage after news broke last Friday that Wells had charged 800,000 car loan borrowers for insurance without their knowledge or consent. Ten months earlier Wells paid $190 million to settle charges it had signed customers up for phony accounts and pushed them into products they did not need, which led to dramatic congressional hearings and lawsuits. Political leaders occasionally pay lip service to an issue and then move away from it, but Moran’s spokesman, Tom Brandt, said the senator “is taking this very seriously.” Wells does not comment on specific interactions with lawmakers, but a spokeswoman said the bank “understands and is committed to addressing policymaker concerns.” She added that since it discovered the problems in the middle of 2016 Wells has taken steps such as refunding fees and discontinuing the insurance program to “make things right for our customers.” ","

 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"A Wells Fargo Bank in Charlotte, North Carolina. U.S. (Reuters/Mike Blake) Wells Fargo can’t seem to find the bottom of its scandals. That’s becoming bad news for the entire banking industry. The fake-account mess that originally landed the bank in hot water turns a year old in September and still isn’t resolved. It’s since been joined by a slew of other revelations and accusations. The bank charged more than 800,000 people for auto insurance they didn’t need. It slapped veterans with hidden fees to refinance their mortgages. A group of young immigrants are suing over allegations Wells Fargo denied them student loans and credit cards — a suit Wells tried to have tossed but a federal judge greenlit on Thursday. In a regulatory filing on Friday, the bank signaled it could soon have still more headaches to disclose. And on Monday came the news it's facing regulatory scrutiny from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for not refunding insurance money to people who paid off car loans early. News of the first auto loans controversy alone prompted fresh calls for hearings into the bank’s practices from congressional Democrats on both sides of the Capitol last week —   and one Senate Republican, Jerry Moran of Kansas. All the Democrats on the Senate Banking panel signed on to a request to Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who chairs the committee, for a September hearing with Wells CEO Timothy Sloan and board chairman Stephen Sanger. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) renewed her request of Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen that the central bank use its authority to fire directors who served during the fake-account scandal. The cascade of controversies has marred the bank’s once-sterling brand. Wells now ranks as the least-respected company in America, behind even Big Tobacco, according to a June survey of money managers conducted by Barron’s. And it’s share price has suffered, too, lagging further behind its peers than at any time since 2011. Bloomberg’s Kartikay Mehrotra, Laura Keller, and Margaret Cronin Fisk have a good rundown of the bank’s no-good, very bad year. For the rest of the sector, here’s their key insight: Don’t banks get in trouble all the time? U.S. banks have paid huge sums to settle all sorts of allegations related to market-rigging and investor-fleecing, many involving mortgage-backed securities. But those settlements are almost always related to wholesale banking, as opposed to retail. Wells Fargo’s current scandals are different because they deal with customers in the consumer division. That’s more unusual, and a more politically sensitive problem. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). (Melina Mara/Washington Post) Although Wall Street is a favorite punching bag of both parties — see the 2016 election — refining campaign-trail animus into relatively inscrutable banking regulation is another matter. So less than a decade after a financial crisis that almost destroyed the economy, the debate over banking rules in Washington these days centers on how much relief to provide the industry from the Dodd-Frank law passed in its wake. That's left Democrats who'd like to impose new restrictions on the biggest financial institutions struggling instead simply to hold the line by defending the rules already on the books. The Wells Fargo mess, however, put industry overreach in terms everyday consumers understand. Democratic lawmakers and their allies backing tougher oversight are taking heed. They're marshaling the example of the Wells Fargo imbroglio to try to protect a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule making it easier for consumers to sue their banks. House Republicans already voted to strip that rule, and their Senate counterparts will attempt to follow suit next month. Backers of the so-called arbitration rule argue Wells Fargo customers could have brought the bank's issues to light sooner if they hadn't been forced into contracts that barred them from challenging the bank in court. It's not hard to imagine industry critics making even more hay out of the bank's malfeasance. As Cap Alpha's Ian Katz wrote late last month, the nesting Wells scandals could ""end up being unhelpful to broader efforts to reform Dodd-Frank, because it strengthens the arguments of Democratic lawmakers including Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown that banks need tougher, not lighter, oversight."" ""Sure,"" Katz continued, ""one could argue that Dodd-Frank didn’t prevent Wells Fargo’s sales practices scandal or this auto loans mess. So what good is it? But for the average bloke, that doesn’t translate into a reason for weakening oversight of banks."" President Trump. (AFP/Saul Loeb) — Corporate chiefs in the Obama era made a refrain out of complaining that “Washington uncertainty” was tying their hands and holding back growth-unleashing investments. In the Trump era, they’re still making that complaint. My colleague Damian Paletta reports:  “A Washington Post review of dozens of conference calls in recent weeks between chief executives and analysts show how the fog of policymaking is paralyzing many companies from taking risks that in normal times would help them grow. The conference calls were held as part of a quarterly ritual in which executives discuss their firm's performance and outlook for the future, and they give voice to some of the reasons U.S. economic growth has been so weak at a time when inflation and interest rates remain historically low... Many of the executives did not blame President Trump or Congress directly for the uncertainty, but they remarked that promises made at the beginning of the year have not come to fruition and might not anytime soon.” Trump's stalled trade agenda, specifically, is causing problems for sectors that believed the administration's pledges it would act quickly. The New York Times's Alan Rappaport reports: America’s steelworkers are on edge as they wait for Mr. Trump to fulfill his promise to place tariffs on steel imports. Home builders are desperate for the president to cut a deal with Canada to end a dispute over its softwood lumber exports. And cattle ranchers are longing for a bilateral pact with Japan to ease the flow of beef exports... The Commerce Department was poised to deliver a report to Mr. Trump by the end of June with recommendations for steel tariffs, on the ground that cheap imports pose a national security threat. But the process became bogged down when industries that buy steel objected and other countries threatened retaliation. Mr. Trump said recently that dealing with steel was no longer a top priority, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, signaled to members of Congress in briefings last month that a decision was no longer imminent. Dithering may have made the situation worse for American steel producers. Mr. Gerard said foreign competitors had been flooding the United States market with steel products in anticipation of the tariffs. Some of this is happening in parts of the country that voted for Mr. Trump... One accomplishment that Mr. Trump has notched on trade has been an agreement with China that opened its market to American beef exports. For the beef industry, however, the benefits of that deal pale in comparison with the cost of abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which had been spearheaded by President Barack Obama. It would have provided access to the enormous Japanese market. Instead, Japanese tariffs on American frozen beef, which would have declined under Mr. Obama’s deal, are on the rise. Last week, they increased to 50 percent from 38 percent, making America’s meat even more vulnerable to competition from countries such as Australia. Meanwhile, colleague Heather Long says American steel companies have China to thank for surging prices: ""China is a major factor driving this ""summer of steel."" The Chinese government has finally curbed some steel production, acknowledging that a glut of steel on world markets was causing prices to fall so low that even Chinese companies couldn't turn a profit. At the same time, China is hungry for steel as it upgrades its infrastructure. Lower Chinese supply and higher Chinese demand has sent steel -- and other metal -- prices up around the world. All of this is great news for steel companies."" — Inflation isn't going anywhere, so neither should interest rates, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told the America's Cotton Marketing Cooperatives 2017 Conference in Nashville. From Reuters: ""Bullard's comments are largely in line with those he has been making for over a year. He has argued that the Fed does not need to raise rates until the U.S. economy breaks out of its pattern of low inflation and about 2 percent annual growth. Most of his Fed colleagues have stuck to their forecast that inflation is headed back to 2 percent over the next couple years, even though their forecasts have proven overly optimistic for years. Bullard noted that the dollar has declined in value this year, chalking that move up largely to improved growth forecasts for Europe and the expectation that the European Central Bank will respond by tightening monetary policy."" Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner. (AP/Seth Perlman) — Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) is stiff-arming a request from the state comptroller to issue $6 billion in new bonds to help pay down the state's debt. Instead, he called on the comptroller to tap $600 million in state coffers to pay some bills. Reuters: ""Rauner also said the state cannot go to market with the debt until he works with state lawmakers to identify an appropriation or plan to pay off the new bonds. 'This bonding in and of itself is not the answer,' Rauner told reporters...Illinois has the lowest credit ratings and pays the highest borrowing costs among the 50 U.S. states."" — Meanwhile, the hedge fund Aurelius Capital sued Monday seeking the dismissal of Puerto Rico's bankruptcy case, arguing the federal oversight board trying to hold off the island's creditors was unconstitutionally established. Aurelius was among those that successfully pressed a legal case against Argentina over its sovereign debt. The New York Times's Mary Williams Walsh reports: ""Some of Puerto Rico’s bondholders argue that they bought the bonds on the understanding that their repayments and interest were by law the government’s first priority. They were surprised when they found that Puerto Rico’s five-year plan called for deep cuts in all bond payments, including payments to the holders of general-obligation bonds. The oversight board wants to use the savings to finance government operations for the five-year recovery period. But creditors say this approach is at odds with the Puerto Rican Constitution."" Marc Short, White House Director of Legislative Affairs. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) — The Trump administration is reaching out to a ""few dozen"" House Democrats on a tax overhaul to court their support even as the congressional Republicans driving the process pursue a GOP-only approach. Politico's Rachel Bade and Elana Schor report: ""Even as congressional GOP leaders largely embrace a partisan path on taxes, White House officials have been wooing 15 to 20 centrist House Democrats since early summer. The Trump administration is all too aware of Congressional Republicans’ struggles to come together on a range of hot-button issues — from health care to government spending — and tax reform is littered with political minefields for the party. So the president and his staff are opening a line of communication with moderate Democrats in case a Plan B is needed. At a mid-June dinner at the White House with four centrist House Democrats, President Donald Trump expressed interest in a bipartisan package combining tax reform with infrastructure spending, multiple sources said. Since then, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and top White House staff have huddled with conservative Democrats in the Blue Dog Coalition and the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus."" — Does the economy really need tax cuts? Maybe not, economist Ed Yardini tells CNBC: ""I don't think that given the strength of the labor market and the tightness of the labor market that the economy needs any fiscal stimulus. It ain't broke so there's no reason to fix it."" PayPal founder Peter Thiel exits an elevator after a meeting at Trump Tower in New York. (REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz) — Peter Thiel, the technology investor who became one of Trump's most vocal and important private-sector champions, harbors private doubts his presidency could end in disaster. BuzzFeed's Ryan Mac reports: Donald Trump’s most prominent Silicon Valley supporter has distanced himself from the president in multiple private conversations, describing at different points this year an 'incompetent' administration, and one that may well end in 'disaster.' Peter Thiel’s unguarded remarks have surprised associates, some of whom are still reeling from his full-throated endorsement of Trump at the Republican National Convention. And while the investor stands by the president in public — 'I support President Trump in his ongoing fight,' he said in a statement to BuzzFeed News — his private doubts underscore the fragility of the president's backing from even his most public allies. Preet Bharara,former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) — Trump may finally have found a replacement for Preet Bharara, the head of the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan he fired back in March. BuzzFeed's Zoe Tillman reports: ""The White House is considering Geoffrey Berman, an attorney who practices in New Jersey and New York and one of Rudolph Giuliani’s law partners, to lead the US attorney’s office in Manhattan — one of the most high-profile federal law enforcement jobs in the country. Berman’s name was included as part of a package of proposed candidates for New York judicial and US attorney vacancies sent by the White House in mid-July to New York’s Democratic senators, according to a source familiar with the process. The list offers an early glimpse at the Trump administration’s strategy for filling vacancies in states with two Democratic senators. Berman, who did not immediately return a request for comment, was the only name that the White House proposed for US attorney in the Southern District of New York."" — Sen. Warren has put a hold on Makan Delrahim, President Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division. The move will keep Delrahim sidelined while Justice lawyers continue reviewing AT&T's proposed $85.4 billion tie-up with Time Warner. Bloomberg's Sarah Forden and Billy House report: ""Warren has described the nomination of Delrahim, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division, as an indication that Trump’s administration will ""put the interests of giant corporations ahead of the American people,"" according to an April 3 post on her Facebook page. Delrahim was previously an attorney at law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP and lobbied on behalf of companies pursuing mergers. He worked for insurer Anthem Inc. in its failed bid for rival Cigna Corp., a deal the Justice Department successfully sued to block."" — Edward Kleinbard, writing in the New York Times, thinks we're headed toward a debt default: ""Sometime in October, the United States is likely to default on its obligation to pay its bills as they come due, having failed to raise the federal debt ceiling. This will cost the Treasury tens of billions of dollars every year for decades to come in higher interest charges and probably trigger a severe recession. The debt ceiling is politically imposed, and the decision not to raise it, and therefore to choose to default, is also political. It’s something America has avoided in the past.

 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Wells Fargo Bank joint venture that provides credit card processing services to merchants across the country has been hit with a lawsuit accusing it of using misleading sales tactics and overbilling for its services. The proposed class action, filed on Friday in Brooklyn federal court, said Wells Fargo Merchant Services promised merchants that it would give them transparent pricing but charged them unauthorized fees and disguised the fees with deceptive language in monthly statements. Wells Fargo Merchant Services, a joint venture between Wells Fargo Bank and payment processor First Data Corp, helps process credit and debit card purchases for businesses. “We deny the claims and plan to defend against the misrepresentations outlined in the lawsuit,” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Sara Hassell said. Pricing terms are fair, and the accusations “do not reflect how we operate our Merchant Services business,” she said. First Data spokesman Mark Murphy declined to comment. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of tour operator Queen City Tours in Charlotte, North Carolina, defunct Pennsylvania restaurant Patti’s Pitas, and other merchants across the country who say they were charged unauthorized fees by Wells Fargo Merchant Services. Hundreds of thousands of merchants were likely affected, the lawsuit said. “Promises were made by aggressive sales tactics and then broken,” said Adam Webb, a lawyer for the merchants. The conduct goes back about six years, he added. Wells Fargo has been grappling with a nationwide scandal over unauthorized accounts opened by employees in its consumer banking division and numerous lawsuits over its sales practices. The third-largest U.S. bank last year agreed to pay a $185 million fine to the U.S. government to settle claims about the unauthorized accounts. On Friday, it said it would pay the government $108 million to settle allegations that it charged military veterans hidden fees to refinance mortgages. The lawsuit regarding cards said Wells Fargo Merchant Services hit merchants with unanticipated or unauthorized fees, such as a $35 monthly minimum charge, after they signed three-year contracts that could be terminated only by paying a $500 penalty. Wells Fargo buried some terms in a 63-page, fine-print guide that could never be completely read or understood by a busy merchant, the lawsuit said. Statements sent to merchants described some fees as “interchange charges,” indicating they were imposed by a credit card network, when in reality Wells Fargo Merchant Services kept part of those fees as profit, the lawsuit said. The case is Patti’s Pitas et al v Wells Fargo Merchant Services, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No 17-cv-4583. ","

 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"Betsy Duke, who only joined the board of the third-largest U.S. lender in 2015, will be promoted as Wells tries to repair damage caused by widespread sales abuses against customers. Shareholders gave the board a very thin endorsement at the bank’s annual meeting in the spring, and Duke is likely to become the next chairwoman, said investors, analysts and two people with knowledge of board discussions. Chairman Stephen Sanger reaches the mandatory retirement age of 72 in April, ahead of the next annual shareholder meeting. On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported Sanger would now step down in early September. That step would likely speed the ascension of Duke, a former small town banker from Virginia Beach. Wells Fargo declined to comment. Sanger and Duke did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Some board members discussed making Duke Wells Fargo’s chairwoman last October, when then-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf stepped down and the board decided to split the two roles, a person familiar with the matter said. However, Duke told colleagues she was not ready, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Instead, Duke was elevated to vice chair under Sanger. Pressure on Wells Fargo to make changes has intensified as new problems have surfaced in recent days. Revelations last month that the bank enrolled unknowing borrowers in costly auto insurance prompted New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees public pension funds that hold roughly 11.6 million Wells Fargo shares, to call for Sanger’s replacement. The bank said it may have charged as many as 570,000 auto borrowers for insurance they did not want, leading to an estimated 20,000 wrongful repossessions. Early this month, the bank agreed to pay $108 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit over hidden mortgage fees to U.S. military veterans. Also, in its latest quarterly financial report, Wells Fargo said it was examining whether it had caused unnecessary financial harm to customers through mortgage fees, frozen deposit accounts and “add-on” products like identity theft protection. Last September, the bank settled with regulators over opening accounts for up to 2.1 million customers without their knowledge. Several people who have worked with Duke ticked off multiple reasons they believe she will replace Sanger. They noted that she comes from small-town lenders rather than large Wall Street institutions, making her the ideal leader for Wells Fargo’s board at this time. Anne Conner, president of TowneBank, where Duke had been chief operating officer, said Duke encouraged her to focus on substantive matters that mattered to a bank’s bottom line. “She cares about me as a woman executive in an industry that’s largely dominated by men,” said Conner. Former colleagues at the Fed, where Duke served as a governor from 2008-2013, said they gained valuable insights from her practical knowledge of banking. As Fed officials discussed how to implement the Dodd-Frank banking reforms passed after the financial crisis, Duke voiced concerns excessive regulations would put small banks at a disadvantage, said one former colleague who asked not to be identified. “She brought a deep knowledge of banking and credit to our deliberations on monetary policy and the response to the crisis at a time when that perspective was critical” to the Fed’s planning, said former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, who worked with Duke while she was a governor from 2008-2013. After Wells Fargo’s accounts scandal came to light, one person close to the board said Duke used her Fed experience to take the lead in explaining to fellow directors how regulators would view the bank’s actions. Duke “has put a lot of leadership and effort into helping us manage” implementation of regulatory reforms, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told Reuters in an interview, adding she has become “more heavily involved” in those reforms. Shareholders who spoke about voting against Sanger supported Duke on the grounds that her relatively short tenure on the board gave her less responsibility for Wells Fargo’s scandals. “This is welcome news,” Stringer said in a statement.

 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Young immigrants denied credit by Wells Fargo Bank because they are not permanent U.S. residents can sue the bank under a post-Civil War law barring discrimination on the basis of immigration status, a federal judge ruled. In a decision on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in San Francisco rejected Wells Fargo’s argument that lenders are permitted under a more recent federal anti-discrimination law to consider immigration status before granting loans. Filed in January, the proposed class action accused Wells Fargo of denying student loans and credit cards to immigrants granted work permits under the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program enacted by former Democratic President Barack Obama. The federal initiative allows immigrants who were brought to the United State without documents as children to temporarily avoid deportation and work in the United States. Republican President Donald Trump, who criticized the program during his campaign, has not taken any action to end it since taking office. The decision “reaffirms the right of noncitizens, including those with DACA status, to be offered credit on the same terms as U.S. citizens,” said Michael Litrownik, a lawyer for the immigrants. Wells Fargo spokesman Jason Vasquez said the decision is disappointing but “in no way suggests that the claims ultimately will prevail.” The ruling is another blow to the U.S. bank, which was engulfed in a scandal last year after acknowledging that its workers opened millions of unauthorized accounts to meet sales goals. The lawsuit was brought by the California League of United Latino Citizens, an advocacy group for Hispanic Americans. It was filed on behalf of University of California-Riverside student Mitzie Perez and other young adults denied credit because they are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. They sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, passed after the Civil War to bar discrimination against former slaves on the basis of race. It was amended in 1870 to bar discrimination against non-citizens. In a bid to get the lawsuit dismissed in April, Wells Fargo said the lawsuit ignores the 1974 Equal Credit Opportunity Act and related regulations, which allow lenders to consider prospective borrowers’ immigration status. The bank said loans to DACA recipients pose risks because those individuals have only temporary residency status. Student loans and credit cards are usually not backed by collateral, and it can be impossible to collect if borrowers are removed from the country, Wells said. The case is Mitzie Perez et al v Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. District Court, California Northern District. ","

 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"The Wall Street bank is expected to see the best improvement in return on equity (ROE) and cost of capital among its peers, according to Mayo, who joined Wells Fargo from CLSA Americas in June. Citigroup’s shares had risen 4.1 percent this year through Wednesday’s close. The lender’s ROE will improve to about 9 percent in 2019 and 11 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2016, with the biggest potential driver being buybacks, the analyst said in a client note dated Aug. 9. Buybacks should reduce the bank’s shares by one-third over five years, far more than its peers, Mayo wrote, adding Citi to Wells Fargo’s “priority stock list”. The Federal Reserve on June 28 permitted Citigroup to go ahead with a plan to buy back $15.6 billion (12.03 billion pounds) of stock and pay $3.3 billion (2.54 billion pounds) in dividends over the next 12 months. However, despite the rosy expectations for earnings and stock price, Citi will likely miss its new targets, Mayo warned. By 2019, Citigroup should be able to produce a 10 percent return on common tangible equity, rising to 11 percent in 2020 and 14 percent over the longer term, executives said at the bank’s investor day last month. “Like Morgan Stanley five years ago, (Goldman) has trading shortfalls, a business mix change, and pressure to perform,” Mayo said. Goldman in July reported a 40 percent slump in second-quarter bond trading revenue, worse than many analysts had expected, and posted the weakest commodities results in its history as a public company. Mayo has an “outperform’ rating on Goldman’s stock and a “market perform” on Morgan Stanley. “Morgan Stanley needs to better describe to us how it plans to transition from restructuring to growth,” he said. Mayo, who has a tendency to ask pointed questions during investor events, has garnered a reputation as a blunt critic of bad behaviour in the industry who spots trouble early. Mayo became unemployed in February when CLSA shut down. He turned up at JPMorgan’s most recent investor day less than 24 hours after losing his job at CLSA, identifying himself as a “free agent” where he asked Chief Executive Jamie Dimon about the bank’s brand.

 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. economic expansion will last at least another two years, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters who also forecast growth will not accelerate the way the Trump administration has predicted. The recovery from the devastating 2007-2009 financial crisis has been unusually lengthy. The latest growth stretch has already lasted 96 months, and if the poll predictions come true it would mark the longest economic expansion in more than 150 years. Growth has still not picked up as quickly as thought recently, leading forecasters to lower expectations again slightly in the poll of more than 100 economists taken Aug. 7-10. Still, the U.S. expansion has more than two years to go, according to 34 of 57 economists who answered an additional question on the business cycle. Of those economists, 21 said it would last two to three years and 13 said more than three years. “Expansions don’t go on forever,” said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo, who said there was another two to three years to go. “Steady, moderate growth looks like it could stay in place for a while.” The remaining 23 respondents said the expansion would only last one to two years. None of the economists, based in the United States, Canada and Europe, expected it to end within a year. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration aims to boost annual growth to 3 percent, mainly through sweeping tax cuts. But with the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, significant fiscal stimulus appears less likely and the economy has shown no signs of accelerating to meet that target. Predictions pointed to continued sluggish average growth in the current economic cycle compared with previous cycles of this length, based on National Bureau of Economic Research data. (www.nber.org/cycles.html) GDP likely grew at a 2.6 percent annualized pace in the second quarter, down from 2.7 percent in the July poll. But the trend has yet to break away from roughly 2 percent. The latest poll suggests 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent growth each quarter to the end of next year, slightly down from the 2.2 percent to 2.5 percent predicted the previous month. But growth has not been that steady during this expansion and generally is not in any economy. The modest outlook was still broadly explained by slower spending due to sluggish wage growth even though the economy is close to full employment. Expectations for tax cuts from the Trump administration are also fading. While that has not deterred U.S. stock markets, which have been setting record highs all year, it has pushed the dollar down nearly 9 percent against a basket of currencies. Inflation forecasts have remained lukewarm, with the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge, the core PCE price index, not expected to reach the central bank’s 2 percent target until the final quarter of 2018. Core PCE inflation was forecast to average 1.5 percent to 1.6 percent each quarter from here until the end of 2017. Despite that subdued inflation outlook, the Fed is still expected to announce steps to start shrinking its more than $4 trillion balance sheet in September, according to 94 of 100 economists in the Reuters poll. Five respondents said the announcement would be some time in the final three months of this year and one said early next year. The poll also predicted the Fed would raise interest rates by 25 basis points in October or December, taking the fed funds rate to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent. The Fed is expected to follow up with three more rate hikes of the same amount in 2018. “What the Fed is doing right now is saying the healthy economy combined with strong financial conditions more than make up for the disappointment in inflation,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They are very likely to announce their balance sheet shrinkage in September and see better-than-even odds they will even hike in December.” When asked if the Fed should start shrinking its balance sheet before inflation hits its target, 55 of 62 economists said “yes.” “Yes, they need to lower the balance sheet given emergency conditions are absent,” said Wells Fargo’s Bullard. But not everyone agrees. Some economists worry the envisioned pace of Fed tightening could hurt the economy, especially given the anemic nature of the recovery. “Clearly the idea here is to get ready for the end of the (economic) cycle,” said Harris. “In my view, hiking now so you can cut later is not the right way to think about it. You hike late so you can hike more. Because (if) you get inflation higher, then the hikes aren’t that painful to the economy.” ","

""However, we do not expect any incremental customer remediation costs as a result of these efforts to have a significant financial impact on the Company.""

Wells Fargo one-day performance The bank, once considered the most upstanding of America's financial giants, has been plagued by scandal in the last year. Last fall, the bank paid $185 million in penalties after it was discovered workers had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization since 2011. The workers were trying to meet aggressive sales goals, a practice the bank has since abandoned after clearing out top managers deemed responsible for the problems. Then in late July, news broke that hundreds of thousands of Wells Fargo customers were charged for auto insurance they did not need. The bank said on July 27 it plans to give about 570,000 customers a total $80 million for damages starting in August 2017. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has also begun an investigation into whether customers were affected by Wells Fargo's freezing and, in many cases, closing, of consumer deposit accounts, the filing said.

Mayo said he's not factoring lower taxes, lower regulatory costs, higher interest rates and an increase in capital markets activity into his model, so those numbers could go higher. Banks' cost of capital — which means how much they pay in debt and equity to run their businesses — should fall to 9 percent from 10 percent because banks have reduced risk, Mayo wrote. ""Safety is further enhanced by the strongest balance sheets in a generation, the highest level of equity-to-assets in 80 years, and enough cushion to absorb not one, but two financial crises."" The outspoken analyst is widely followed on Wall Street, but was one of several analysts cut by CLSA Americas in February when it closed its U.S. research operations. His tough questions during analyst calls have gotten him banned by banks in the past, but his criticism of the sector before and throughout the mortgage crisis has won him the praise of Jamie Dimon when it turned out to be correct. He recently called the banking sector the ""Lebron James"" of the stock market.  ""They have incredible defense, the most resilient balance sheets in a generation, but now with this pro-growth agenda, they might also have a little bit of offense, too."" There are some risks to consider, Mayo wrote in his note Wednesday. Sloppy lending, higher costs, poor use of capital, increased risk-taking in trading, unforeseen moves in interest rates and unpredictable regulation are among them. In addition, while the last seven years have been the worst revenue generating years for the big banks since the 1930s, forecasts for improvement could fall short. Citi shares are trading at $68.10, and his price target for 2022 is $140. He rates the stock an outperform. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase also get outperform ratings from Mayo. Bank of America shares trade at $24.61 and his three-year price target is $40. JPMorgan, which trades at $93.06, has a three-year price target of $130. Mayo favors shares of Goldman Sachs, rated outperform, over Morgan Stanley, rated market perform. Goldman's fixed income trading operation has stumbled and is being repositioned but the rest of the bank is performing well, he says. ""It is evolving from FICC (fixed income) to FACC — financing, asset manager client, cash securities, and corporate clients."" Morgan Stanley has moved to emphasize wealth management and its business is more tied to the economy, he said. ",Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo akes bold bullish call on Citi

Silvia Amaro,08102017,CNBC,08032017,"The U.S. dollar index has fallen by around 9 percent since the start of the year but that could be about to change, according to strategists at Wells Fargo, who suggest the stocks and sectors which could be positively affected amid the move higher. Disappointing economic data, political uncertainty and positive developments abroad have sent the U.S. dollar lower despite two rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. ""We review the recent selling as overdone and expect a stronger U.S. dollar from current levels by year-end 2017, a reversal of the current trend,"" Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo, said in a note on Monday. The update in the forecast was due to three reasons: differences among global interest rates, economic growth and inflation; further political risks in the euro area; and investors becoming too negative on the greenback. While in the U.S. the Fed is raising rates and shrinking its balance sheet, in Europe, the central bank is unlikely to deviate from negative rates soon. At the same time growth and inflation in the U.S. have recovered at a faster pace than in Europe. ""While that lead has narrowed as growth and inflation in the euro area have rebounded, it still favors the U.S.,"" the bank said. Furthermore, Wells Fargo recognizes the lower political uncertainty in Europe following the French presidential vote – which could push the euro higher - and a U.S. administration that hasn't delivered on some of its campaign pledges. However, it sees the upcoming Italian elections as a large political and economic risk to the euro area. ""Put another way, at current levels on the currency pair, it seems that expectations for the U.S. government to get anything done are too low and for the euro are too high,"" Samana said. The euro was trading at 1.188 against the dollar early on Tuesday morning. Lastly, analysts at Wells Fargo said that investors have become the most negative on the U.S. dollar since 2014, ""which sets the stage for positive surprises in the U.S. dollar's favor in the second half (of the year)."" ""The most important implications for investors at this point would be to reduce positions in commodities and developed-market debt towards our current tactical underweight stance,"" Wells Fargo suggested. Wells Fargo believes that earnings growth in the second half of 2017 will be lower than in the first six months but suggests that four sectors are set to outperform the wider market: consumer discretionary, financials, health care and information technology. ""We recommend investors use any pullbacks as opportunities to average into shares of quality cyclical companies,"" the note said.

Patti Domm,08102017,CNBC,08032017,"The escalating war of words between the U.S. and North Korea is nerve-wracking, but other events like a possible debt-ceiling crisis and a hawkish Federal Reserve could create a bigger reaction in financial markets. Stocks have been in a slow drift higher this summer, with valuations getting to lofty levels as the indices hit new highs. Solid earnings growth and low expectations for Fed interest rate hikes have been positive catalysts for stocks. The S&P 500 has declined modestly in the past two sessions, as President Donald Trump threatened to bring ""fire and fury"" to North Korea. In turn, North Korea said it could attack Guam. On Wednesday, the S&P traded lower for most of the session before closing flat at 2,474. ""The rhetoric was pretty fiery on both sides,"" said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""We don't know that much about Kim Jong Un, but we see from the president that he likes to tell you what he thinks in plain English. When you have this kind of exchange without the benefit of diplomatic service to go in between, the markets don't know what to think momentarily."" More than a few strategists have been warning of a stock market pullback in late summer or early fall, but equities have been resilient, with volatility low and complacency at a high. While the friction with North Korea sent investors into safe havens, such as bonds and gold, the move is expected to be temporary unless there is further escalation. A number of firms have been warning that a market correction could be coming, but they point to other reasons. They include Doubleline and Bank of America. Wells Fargo's Christopher says there could be a selloff of 5 to 10 percent, and he's been expecting it for a while. ""To me, the fall and late August is all about what the Fed does and what the [European Central Bank] does,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Lindsey Group. ""You have the potential for two major central banks that are pulling back. I think that is the biggest deal for markets. That is quantifiable in terms of psychology. Trying to game the North Korean situation is impossible."" Analysts say North Korea would have to show that its nuclear capabilities and launch ability have improved to get the markets really scared. ""You would have to see the sides give up the possibility for a diplomatic conversation, even if it's not between the U.S. and North Korea. If the U.S. and China were to publicly break over North Korea, that would be a significant negative,"" said Christopher. But for now, strategists see a bigger potential upset for the markets coming from Washington, depending on how Congress handles budget legislation and raising the debt ceiling in September. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned the debt ceiling will be reached Sept. 29 and if no action is taken the U.S. could be in default by October. Congress also has to pass a budget by Sept. 30 or the government will shut down as it did in 2013. While many analysts expect Congress to move ahead on both, there could be battling that takes it down to the last minute and that could upset markets. ""They could pass extensions, but the bottom line is what we've seen with the Republican House, Senate and presidency is that they've accomplished nothing,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. ""To think they'd come back from their recess and it will be smooth sailing is hard to believe. Other years, we'd be worried about this."" The other big market force that could ruffle markets is clearly the Fed, which is expected to begin the untested task of unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in September. The Fed also has forecast another interest rate hike for later this year, but markets are skeptical it will actually take action. The Fed meets Sept. 19 and 20, but investors may also hear hawkish comments from Fed officials and even European Central Bank President Mario Draghi at the annual Jackson Hole Fed symposium later in the month. The ECB is also expected to start pulling back from its easing policies. ""Not only do central banks have less room to ease in order to blunt the impact of the next recession, many are declaring victory on the major dislocation from the financial crisis and have already begun to reduce accommodation. This change in central bank behavior is one of the major pivots investors need to focus on,"" wrote Pimco analysts, who also say investors should reduce risk in view of the potential for more aggressive central banks. Citigroup also warned its clients a correction could be coming amid high valuations and central bank tightening. The market view of the Fed shifted dramatically this summer after Fed Chair Janet Yellen seemingly changed her message on the softening of inflation this year. Fed officials had said weaker inflation was transitory, but Yellen said the Fed was concerned about the weakening when she testified before Congress last month. That pushed back market expectations for rate hikes, and now futures show there is just one expected next year and the odds for a December rate hike this year hover around 50/50. That contrasts with the Fed forecast for three hikes next year and one more this year. Therefore any reading on inflation has become critical. Recent PCE inflation data was a weak 1.5 percent, and the July jobs report showed no sign of a meaningful boost to wage inflation. The market is looking forward now to the CPI consumer inflation data Friday. Christopher said he expects inflation to pick up in the next several months, and at that point, the Fed's forecast and market expectations for fewer interest rates will need to be reconciled. That could cause market volatility if the Fed's view wins. Christopher said he remains positive on stocks into 2018, even with his expectation for a pullback.

The bad news continues to pile up for Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), but does that mean investors should avoid its stock? Not necessarily. The latest unwelcome news about Wells Fargo involves its admission that it charged more than a half million of its customers for auto insurance that they didn't need. The Wells Fargo stagecoach has seen better days. Image source: Getty Images. Well Fargo issued a press release at the end of July noting that it had reviewed policies placed since 2012, identifying approximately 570,000 customers who may have been affected by the scheme to illicitly boost profits. The bank said it will refund customers approximately $64 million in cash and make $16 million worth of account adjustments for a total of $80 million in remediation. To make matters worse, Wells Fargo acknowledged that the additional cost of the unneeded insurance caused approximately 20,000 customers to default on their car loans, resulting in the repossession of their vehicles. ""In the fall of last year, our CEO and our entire leadership team committed to build a better bank and be transparent about those efforts,"" said Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo consumer lending. ""Our actions over the past year show we are acting on this commitment."" These are noble words, but the timing of Wells Fargo's mea culpa could lead one to wonder whether the bank only came forward with it after being caught by the CFPB last year for opening millions of unauthorized checking and credit card accounts for unwitting customers who oftentimes didn't know the accounts had been opened. It wasn't until July 2016 that Wells Fargo got around to initiating an investigation of customer complaints into the allegations of illicit sales of auto insurance. By Wells Fargo's own admission, that was four years after the misconduct began. And the bank only got around to discontinuing the program last September, the same month its fake-account scandal was disclosed. WFC data by YCharts. There's no getting around the fact that these are red flags for investors. Not only do they continue to wear on Wells Fargo's once-stellar reputation for prudent and profitability banking, but they also expose the bank to added legal costs. It's hard to say how much this has affected Wells Fargo's stock, but it's worth noting that it was the worst performing big bank stock in July. Looking forward, there's no doubt that Wells Fargo's profit will suffer as a result of its malfeasance. It's already stopped using sales quotas in its branches in response to the sales scandal from last September. And its efficiency ratio has taken a hit due in part to elevated legal expenses. Yet, Wells Fargo nevertheless remains the nation's third biggest bank by assets. That's a commanding position in an industry where economies of scale have become increasingly important, as the need to invest in new costly technology is necessary to stay competitive. That said, Wells Fargo's stock is far from cheap right now, given the issues it faces and the damage it's suffered to its reputation. It trades for a 49% premium to book value. That's meaningfully below the 75% premium it traded for two years ago, but investors would be excused for wondering if a better price will come along if its troubles continue to mount. ","

John Maxfield,08102017,Fool,08032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Over the past year, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has found itself in an unenviable position. After making it through the financial crisis largely unscathed, it has since run into a number of problems directly related to its sales culture. These problems aren't cheap to resolve, as they've served as a catalyst for legal and regulatory actions. This begs an important question for current and prospective investors in Wells Fargo: Just how much are legal problems likely to cost the bank? Will those costs be material? Or given Wells Fargo's otherwise resplendent bottom line, will any legal settlements and costs that it incurs be insignificant? Image source: Getty Images. It's impossible to say for sure just how much liability Wells Fargo will ultimately face after employees and third-party vendors working on behalf of the bank got caught surreptitiously opening accounts for customers or charging them for auto insurance that they didn't need. Yet, it's getting clearer with each regulatory filing submitted by Wells Fargo that the costs are adding up. In the second quarter of this year, expenses associated with outside professional and contract services increased 31% compared to the same period a year ago. The bank noted in its latest 10-Q: The increase in both periods reflected higher project and technology spending on regulatory and compliance related initiatives, as well as higher legal expense related to sales practices matters. In the whole scheme of things, the increase was far from debilitating, adding up to $326 million. That's a lot of money, to be sure. But keep in mind that Wells Fargo tends to earn more than $5 billion a quarter in net income. Wells Fargo also took the opportunity in its 10-Q to update investors on possible future legal expenses. Whenever a potential liability arises, banks set aside money to cover it -- these are known as accruals. But this is done only once those future losses become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. This is tricky business, as it's impossible to predict how a specific legal action will play out in the future. This is why banks tend to disclose how much future liability they may incur beyond their current accruals. Image source: The Motley Fool. It's here where investors can get a sense for how much Wells Fargo's bottom line could suffer from ongoing legal problems. According to the bank, ""the high end of the range of reasonably possible potential losses in excess of the Company's accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately $3.3 billion as of June 30, 2017."" To be clear, this is just an estimate, a point that Wells Fargo went on to stress: The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. At the end of the day, in turn, the best answer to the question of how much Wells Fargo's legal problems will cost to resolve is an additional $3.3 billion above and beyond what the bank has already set aside to cover them. That's a lot of money, but it's certainly something a bank as big as Wells Fargo can absorb. ","

"Steve Symington, Jason Hall, and Chuck Saletta",08102017,Fool,08032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's easy to admire Warren Buffett. As the longtime CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B), Buffett is widely considered the greatest investor of all time. So perhaps unsurprisingly, he's also consistently ranked as one of the richest men in the world despite giving away billions each year to charity. And there are plenty of other reasons so many people like the lovable billionaire. But there's often one overarching question on the minds of Buffett fans: Which stocks should you buy today? So we asked three top Motley Fool investors exactly that. Read on to learn why they chose Berkshire Hathaway, Trex (NYSE:TREX), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL Steve Symington (Berkshire Hathaway): At risk of oversimplifying the goal of our headline, I think the ultimate stock to buy for Buffett fans is the very company he still leads: Berkshire Hathaway. After all, Berkshire continues to derive its strength from its proven combination of profitable insurance operations (think Geico and General Re, for example), its enviable investment portfolio (the decades-long success of which made Buffett famous), and its diversified group of non-insurance, non-investing businesses that include everything from Burlington Northern to Brooks, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom, See's Candies, Dairy Queen, Pampered Chef, and Benjamin Moore, to name only a few among dozens of other industry leaders and global brands. Of course, with around $95 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of last quarter, you can bet Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger can't wait to shrewdly put more of their company's funds to good use with future acquisitions -- at least, in addition to last month's move to acquire Texas-based electric utility Oncor for $9 billion -- which should only further widen Berkshire's moat and cement its status as arguably the most powerful conglomerate the world has ever seen. Better yet, shares are reasonably priced trading at roughly 1.5 times book value as of this writing, making Berkshire Hathaway perhaps the perfect stock for any Buffett fan to buy today. Jason Hall (Trex Company Inc.): Buffett's success has, quite possibly, become his biggest detriment, since there are a lot of wonderful -- yet small -- companies the Oracle of Omaha can't even consider for Berkshire's portfolio. And Trex is one of my very favorites, with a market cap of just over $2 billion, making it ideal for us ""small"" investors. A few things make Trex a very Buffett investment. To start, it has a quite strong competitive position -- Buffett's ""moat"" -- based on its strong brand appeal, deep ties with decking professionals, and its market-leading distribution. This is why Trex commands over 40% of alt-wood decking sales and grows its share every year. Furthermore, Trex's management has done an incredible job of leveraging sales growth and getting very strong returns on growth investments: TREX Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. Trex has delivered awesome returns for investors over this period as well, with shares up almost 440%. At the same time, there's plenty of future growth potential, since Trex only makes up about 6% of total board-feet of decking sold in North America, when you include wood into the equation. Its stock isn't exactly cheap, trading for 31 time trailing earnings and 24 times forward estimates. But it's also not outrageous, considering the long-term prospects and how well management has been able to wring incremental profits out of sales growth. Bottom line: To paraphrase Buffett, Trex is a wonderful business at a fair price. That's always a better buy than a fair business, even at a wonderful price. Chuck Saletta (Wells Fargo): As Buffett has famously said, ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."" Despite the very real damage that banking titan Wells Fargo has done to its reputation from the fake-account scandal, Wells Fargo remains a strong holding of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Indeed, Berkshire Hathaway owns so much of Wells Fargo stock that it recently had to sell some in order to stay on the right side of U.S. regulators. For Buffett -- who knows a thing or two about the importance of reputation -- to own that large a chunk of a company that has so badly damaged its own reputation, Wells Fargo's underlying business must be really compelling. Wells Fargo was one of the fastest large banks to recover from last decade's financial crisis, and its dividend has recovered past the level it was paying prior to the cuts forced by that meltdown. While the fake-accounts scandal did knock down Wells Fargo's growth trajectory a bit, the bank is still expected to be able to increase earnings by nearly 8% annualized over the next five years. Wells Fargo trades at around 12 times its forward earnings estimate, a reasonable price to pay for that potential growth. With a financial business able to recover that quickly from the largest financial meltdown in a generation trading at a still reasonable valuation for its potential growth, Wells Fargo's attraction becomes clearer. Buffett is no stranger to finding value in scandal-plagued stocks. Wells Fargo looks a lot like a solid business facing temporary tough times. With the patient capital that Buffett likes to deploy over the long haul, its recovery may very well justify his continued confident investment. ","

Thanks to the current low-interest-rate environment, most banking products such as CDs and savings accounts don't pay very much. On the other hand, many bank stocks pay their investors exceptionally well. While that higher reward requires taking greater risk, it could be well worth it considering that the yields on most banking products don't even match inflation these days. Overall, the sector boasts several high-yield options, though three that caught our eye are Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY), and New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB). Brian Stoffel (Wells Fargo): Get this: I'm so disgusted with everything that's come out about the behavior at Wells Fargo over the past two years that my wife and I will be switching banks after being with them for 15 years. And yet, I think if you're looking for a safe banking dividend stock, this might be just the place to go. Image source: Getty Images. That's because changing banks has already proven to be a huge pain in the neck. Over time, people sync tons of payments with their bank accounts, including credit cards, school tuition, and mortgages; it takes a lot of time and effort to coordinate the transition of all of those obligations. My wife and I know about Wells Fargo's transgressions because I write for the Motley Fool. But most customers don't have the time -- or desire -- to make such a move based on principle. The switching costs are just too high. That's why the bank, which is the third-largest in assets in America, is still sitting in an enviable spot. It has economies of scale and customers who are more-or-less locked in. And while the stock is still more expensive than Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase based on price-to-book ratio, it has gotten cheaper over the last three years while the rest have all seen their multiples expand: WFC Price to Book Value data by YCharts. While the current dividend yield of 3% might not seem too high, it's far more than investors have usually been able to score from the company in the past. Tim Brugger (Royal Bank of Canada): (NYSE:RY) Royal Bank of Canada has a current dividend yield of 3.7%. On top of that, it reports consistently outstanding financial results with each successive earnings release, and last quarter was no exception. Both the top and bottom lines improved markedly in RBC's second quarter. Total revenue climbed 8.4% to $8.1 billion, and net income jumped by 9% to $2.2 billion. RBC's solid performance also resulted in a lower provision, freeing up cash for other things like its ongoing stock repurchases. Thanks in part to RBC's solid results and impaired loans shrinking $244.5 million sequentially, its provision for credit losses -- which is representative of the strength of its loan portfolio -- shrank 34% to $238.2 million. Positive performance across nearly all of RBC's business units helped boost earnings per share 11% to $1.85. And, as impressive as RBC's second quarter was, 2017 in its entirety has been even better. Through the first half of the year, RBC's net income has soared 16% to $4.6 billion, and EPS has jumped a whopping 18% to $3.01 a share. Outside of a 5% decline in insurance service sales, each of RBC's other four primary units improved, including a 12% rise in wealth management sales. In addition to its stellar 2017, one reason analysts are so bullish is the significant growth opportunity represented by RBC's expansion in the U.S. Better still, the bank has delivered a total annual return of 15% to shareholders in each of the past five years. Image source: Getty Images. Matt DiLallo (New York Community Bancorp): Investors looking for a high yield in the banking sector should consider New York Community Bancorp. The regional bank (focused on New York City) sports an eye-catching 5.4% current yield, making it the highest-yielding big-bank stock on the market these days. New York Community Bancorp is unique in the sector due not only to its outsized yield but also to its focus. The company's niche is financing rent-controlled apartment buildings in New York City, which default at a lower rate than most other borrowers. While the company attempted to diversify away from this niche by pursuing an acquisition, it abandoned that pursuit last year. This debacle could be a great opportunity for income-seekers. That's because the market never liked the deal: It would have pushed the company's assets above $50 billion and made it subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests. In fact, the company cut its dividend last year to help complete the merger. However, while the stock initially popped on the abandonment news, it has fallen nearly 19% since the start of 2017 due to several factors, including the eroding credibility of its management team. The cloud of uncertainty surrounding what the bank will do next gives yield-starved investors an opportunity to grab a big-time bank dividend for a much lower price. That has the added benefit of providing additional upside potential should the company regain the market's favor. ","

John Maxfield,08102017,Fool,08032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Nashville, Tennessee, lost its last major locally owned bank in 1999, when a larger out-of-state rival acquired First American Corp. The deal would have marked the end of an era for the city once known as the Wall Street of the South, but for the efforts of three former First American executives. A year after First American's sale, Terry Turner, Rob McCabe, and Hugh Queener teamed up to open Pinnacle Financial Partners (NASDAQ:PNFP). They did so to compete against large regional banks like the one that bought their former employer. It was an audacious goal, as economies of scale are much more than just a theoretical construct in the bank industry, but their strategy has proven to be on target. Following its recent acquisition of BNC Bancorp, Pinnacle Financial will have amassed $20 billion in assets in only 17 years. It's an impressive accomplishment by any measure. Unlike other fast-growing banks, moreover, its rapid ascent hasn't come at the expense of shareholder value. Just one other publicly traded bank has generated a higher return for investors over the same span. How did Pinnacle Financial pull this off? That's what I sought to find out from Turner, who has served as CEO since its founding. What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for organization and flow. Pinnacle Financial Partners CEO Terry Turner (left) and BNC Bancorp CEO Rick Callicutt (right) discussing the banks' merger earlier this year. Image source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. The Motley Fool: Tell me the story behind the founding of Pinnacle Financial. Terry Turner: Before founding Pinnacle, I was an executive at First American, a $20 billion bank headquartered here in Nashville, Tennessee. It was a six-state franchise that ran on a diagonal from Roanoke, Virginia, to Shreveport, Louisiana. My role in that company was to run the general bank, which included retail customers as well as owner-managed businesses with annual sales up to $10 million. It was the main slice of the banking business. My longtime running mate in all of this is Rob McCabe. Rob was also a named executive officer at First American and held major roles there, including running the general bank before I did. He had also run the corporate bank and the non-bank businesses and so forth. So we gained a broad base of experience there. The other partner in the founding of this company is Hugh Queener. He's our chief administrative officer. He's built and had responsibility for all the banking operations, systems, and all those sorts of things. We've been working together since the late 1970s, when the three of us met at a small bank in Knoxville, Tennessee, called Park National Bank. First American acquired that company in 1983 so we all ended up migrating from Knoxville to Nashville as a part of that acquisition and then rose through the ranks at First American. The catalyst for forming Pinnacle Financial was the acquisition of First American by AmSouth Bank in 1999, both of which were later rolled into Regions Financial (NYSE:RF). We had seen at the time and had data supporting the fact that client satisfaction went down as the bank industry consolidated. And when client satisfaction goes down, market share can move. So we had market share data over an extended period of time that showed that small, locally owned banks were taking share from large regional banks, which were tied up in consolidation and dealing with all the difficulties that go with that. This company was formed specifically for the purpose of competing against large regional banks in the commercial sector. For us at the time that was AmSouth (i.e., Regions Financial), SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). They had virtually all the clients and virtually all the vulnerability. The Motley Fool: How did you, Rob, and Hugh make the jump from being executives at First American/AmSouth to founding Pinnacle? Turner: Rob and I left First American in October 1999, Hugh stayed a little longer. From when the deal was announced until when we left, we had assignments that we needed to complete. During that period, being ongoing employees of AmSouth, we couldn't take any overt competitive actions. But we were free to think about what we wanted to do and conceptualize that. Rob and I were involved in early-stage discussions about whether to sell First American to AmSouth. At that point, your mind begins to run about what type of opportunities that may present. The two of us and Hugh thought through various combinations and permutations for a month or two -- to go run a bank for somebody else, to gain control of another locally owned bank, what have you. We ultimately decided that we'd be best starting with a clean sheet of paper. The reason we chose to start a bank as opposed to those other alternatives is that we were very intentional about the culture we wanted to build. And if you're intentional about culture, it's easier to build what you want than it is to take something different than what you want and then moving and shaping it into something that you do want. Though, if I had to boil it down to one thing, it really just related to the competitive opportunity. First American was an acquisitive company. So we were familiar with how banks get integrated, what the implications are, and how local banks take share from those banks. All that made us believe that there was a great opportunity because First American was the last large, locally owned bank in Nashville. It dominated this market on almost any market share metric you would look at, whether it's small-business share, corporate share, FDIC deposit share, whatever. So when it was sold to an out-of-state bank, it just presented an overwhelming opportunity. We also believed that Nashville would be heartbroken by the loss of its last large locally owned bank. As late as the mid-1980s, Nashville billed itself as a regional financial center. We had major banks headquartered here, insurance companies, and so forth. But by the end of the 1990s all these were gone. This isn't just emotional, it's a practical concern. If you look at the role First American played here, the chairman and CEO at the time, Dennis Bottorff, was as important as anyone in the process of relocating the Titans to Tennessee. Another example is Hugh McColl. At one time in Charlotte, if you wanted to be a vendor to Bank of America, you needed to lease space in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina. Just think about the power and significance of that to a market like Charlotte, given the vast number of vendors that would want to do business with Bank of America. So, we understood the criticality of a locally owned bank. That was important to us, and we believed it was important to Nashville, and therefore we would engender strong support there. The Motley Fool: What was the original idea for Pinnacle's business model? Turner: We were focused on competing against large regional banks, particularly in the commercial middle-market segment. We felt like the way to do that was to have a distinctive service equation, which involved being an effective advisor. So then you start asking questions about how do you do that? The No. 1 inhibitor if you want to compete on service quality is employee turnover. So what we said is: How do you retain 95% of your people? And the answer is that you need to hire the right type of people. Part of our idea was that we wouldn't hire anyone with less than 10 years' worth of experience in a company for any job. We determined that we wouldn't hire people who applied for jobs, or anyone that was circulating a resume. That group of people, we believed, were either unhappy or unsuccessful where they were, and we'd just as soon let them stay there. We wanted to hire people who were happy and successful. That sounds trite, but it's an important building block in what we've done here. The way you get to work at Pinnacle is that someone here will say: ""Hey, I worked with this person before, and they're good and they share our values."" So we set about recruiting those people. Most of them are happy where they are, so it can take a long time to recruit them. We have people here that we chased for seven years because we knew they were high-performing people and that they met all of our criteria. So the experience level was not only important in terms of how we matched up against competitors, but also for how it drove turnover out of the system, which was part of the original design. The second thing that's worth talking about is that this approach was important to us from the start because it's the only way I know how to create outsized growth with strong asset quality. If you take our revenue-producing people, they have an average of 33 years of experience. When you hire people with three decades of experience, a large book of business, and who know their clients extremely well, they're able to move that book business from where they are to us, which creates rapid growth. But it also creates great asset quality at the same time, for two reasons. One, these are people they've banked for a long time and know what's going on with them. And two, if they do have any bad credits, they leave them behind, which is sort of the opposite of adverse selection. Dick Kovacevich who ran Norwest and then Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was famous for his saying: ""If it's growing like a weed, it is one."" It's common knowledge that a bank that's outgrowing its market substantially is likely taking on more risk than other competitors in the market. But when you deploy this strategy -- hiring experienced bankers who move an existing book of business to you and leaving bad credits behind -- that's the only way I know of to produce outsized growth in a safe and sound way. The Motley Fool: How do you convince high-performing bankers to leave where they are and come to Pinnacle? Turner: There are several things. Generally, the main sales person is someone here who referred that person to us. That's a really powerful thing. The principal selling mechanism is that the associates that work here love it and advocate for us, and so they generally open the doors. Also, to be a client-facing person in a large regional bank is a difficult experience. It's particularly difficult if you're in an outpost market far from the headquarters. It's a bureaucratic deal. You have to get your credits approved by someone outside the market. Those people don't know you, they don't know your clients, and they're not involved in any sort of strategic decisions. So it's disempowering and disengaging for a generally prideful group of people who know how to take care of clients and who want to participate in the firm. The Motley Fool: What specifically is it about the daily life of a banker at Pinnacle that's different from at a large regional bank? Turner: There are several pieces to that. One is that the credit approval process isn't burdened with bureaucracy. If you're hiring people who have 30 years of experience, you can build a different control infrastructure. That's much more freeing and much more attractive to people with that much experience. We run a signature system as opposed to a committee system. I've believed from the founding of this company that when something is everybody's job, it's nobody's job. The idea of a signature system is that a lender and their manager can do $1 million credits. And then two of them and a senior credit officer can generally do $10 million. That group of three is always proximate to each other, so they can reach a decision in short order for a $10 million credit, which covers the vast majority of transactions we do. That speed is important. I don't find the committee system to be particularly good for credit approval. If it looks like the person who chairs that committee likes a credit, then you like it, and if it looks like he doesn't like it, then you don't like it. There's really no value to the committee. All it does is burden and slow down the process. Flexibility is also important. Again, because of our experienced workforce, we're able to make appropriate exceptions. If you're in a big company, you have to lay down bright-line rules that people need to follow. We do surveys where we ask employees to tell us what they like, what they don't like, and anything else. The most frequent answer in terms of what they like is that there isn't micromanagement. If you're at a regional bank, they're typically running some type of call program, expecting you to make a certain number of calls a month. You have to call on so many A clients, B clients, so many prospects, you have to work on a product cross-sell ratio. Here we don't do that. We turn people lose to go get their clients, know them well, and meet their needs. For years when I talked with institutional investors, a lot of them would say: Tell me about your sales culture. Well we don't have one. And they'd look at me like: ""This poor bumpkin from Tennessee doesn't really get it."" What we have instead is a service culture. If you called up every relationship manager in this company, not one of them could tell you what their product cross-sale ratio is. I don't know what it is for any individual, either. But if you look at the data, we have the highest cross-sale ratio among the banks we compete against. And the reason is that we're just trying to know our clients and take care of their needs, which results in an extraordinary amount of revenue. The Motley Fool: You've made six acquisitions since founding Pinnacle, yet you don't follow the traditional strategy that's worked so well for, say, M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) of buying banks cheap during a downturn in the credit cycle. Why is this? Turner: So much of the energy in this company is about advancing the ball, moving forward. We want people to be excited and engaged about where we're going. We believe that the success that we've had will continue to breed more success. And so there's a real positive momentum and energy in this company. Buying fixer-uppers is a different game. It's not a bad game. And let me be clear here, Robert Wilmers at M&T Bank is the world champion. I mean, he's done it over a long period of time and he's fabulous at it. But our strategy is different. We're not bump-and-grind operators. It's just like our approach isn't to cut expenses, it's to grow the asset base, the revenue base, taking clients, moving share. That's just a different mindset than saying: ""How do I take this thing that's broken and convince all these people that we're going to turn it around?"" It's just a game that we don't want to play. Others like M&T Bank are great at it, but it just doesn't match our cultural strategy. The thing that's always important for me is the linkage here between the associate experience that we create and our results. When I talk to most analysts and institutional investors about this, their eyes glaze over and they want me to get to the real stuff. But that is the real stuff. We've bet the whole farm on this strategy of hiring the best people in our markets and moving their books of business over. And so if we're successful at that, we create a distinctive client experience. But all of that has to produce a great shareholder return. I talk to a lot of banks that say, ""Hey, we're creating this great work environment, but the shareholder return is nothing."" We're trying to measure ourselves on three things: What we're doing in terms of the client and associate experiences, and what impact that has on returns. The Motley Fool: Why are you confident that you can spread this model of attracting high-performing bankers into banks you acquire, and into BNC Bancorp specifically, given that it's your latest and biggest deal? Turner: BNC has been a commercially focused company, but its focus has been on commercial real estate (CRE) loans, not commercial and industrial (C&I) loans like us. Its CEO Rick Callicutt and his team recognized several years ago that this would be a limiting factor for two reasons. First, because it leaves you with a huge concentration in real estate, which makes getting deals approved and all those things difficult, because regulators are focused on banks that have more than 100% of risk-based capital in construction exposure and 300% in commercial real estate exposure. And second, it's hard to fund your balance sheet with that model, because commercial real estate developers are heavy users of funds, but seldom if ever providers of funds. So they set out to build a strategy around C&I loans. They had success in beginning, but then ran into three basic objections that from C&I bankers that they tried to recruit from bigger, more established C&I lenders. Some would say, ""I'm a C&I guy through and through. You guys are just getting started with this and I don't know if you know enough about it or if you're even going to stay in the business. I don't know if I want to bet my career on coming to work with a bunch of CRE guys that are trying to experiment with a new product."" The second objection was that BNC had a treasury management suite that was OK, but it wasn't good enough to attract clients out of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and BB&T (NYSE:BBT). The third objection was that BNC, at $7.4 billion in assets, couldn't do big enough deals to bring clients over from those banks. Our acquisition remedied all three of those objections. Rick has hired six C&I people since we announced this deal. That's an extraordinary thing. I don't know many banks that are able to make meaningful hires while they're changing the flag. It's indicative of what our opportunity is and what we can do over there. If people who are capable and don't like working in these large regional banks have a good alternative, which we are, they'll have a preference to work here as opposed to there. They'll move their books of business, creating rapid growth with strong asset quality. I get asked by institutional investors all the time: ""How do you compete with this little bank or that little bank?"" And my response is: ""I don't know. That's just not where the line of scrimmage is for us."" Our company is engineered to compete with Regions Financial, SunTrust Banks, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. That's where we draw the line of scrimmage. We don't have to compete against local banks. That resonates with people. Once that light comes on, and you develop confidence that you can bring those people over to a less micromanaged environment, and bring their books of business and so forth, it just creates a different target for who they're hiring and how they do so that's pretty powerful. The Motley Fool: You approach efficiency the same way U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) does, by driving it through revenue growth not expense cuts. This has proved to be very effective at both Pinnacle and U.S. Bancorp. What led you to this approach? Turner: The temptation is to improve the efficiency ratio by cutting expenses. You don't have to be good to do that. So that's the lever most people pull on because it's the most obvious and easy to control. But the truth is, if you go back to this idea that we're trying to create a great workplace that allows us to hire the best bankers and keep them engaged and excited about working here, it's hard to do that in an expense-cutting mode. It breaks down trust between people, which cuts against everything we're trying to do here. So we've always gone about it in a different way. When we came out of the crisis, all the numbers were messed up, people wanted to see what expenses you could cut, because that's where they thought your profit lever would come from. We said, ""That isn't us. We're going to create a great efficiency ratio. We're going to drive our expense-to-asset ratio down, but the way we're going to do that is we're going to grow the asset base of this company. People enjoy playing offense, which is about revenue production. People here love it that we're growing and taking share. It creates a mentality that feeds on itself inside the company in exactly the same way that expense cutting does in reverse, which unwinds morale and momentum. A revenue-focused approach drives that momentum and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. ","
      
    A Conversation With Terry Turner, CEO of Pinnacle Financial Partners -- The Motley Fool

  "
 ,08102017,Fool,08032017,"Since 2000, Michael Turner has been at the helm of Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc (NASDAQ:PNFP) which has grown to a market capitalization of USD$4.85B. Turner’s total compensation over the past year stood at $2,848,522. An executive receiving a large part of compensation through stocks is considered more aligned with shareholder expectations of strong total returns — the reason behind a vast majority of S&P companies opting for performance-based stock grants with stock-based compensation accounting for nearly 60% of the overall payouts in 2015. Maximum CEO Comp = (0.5% * Net Income + 0.03% * Market Cap)  Executive compensation has been a controversial subject due to its historically non-transparent nature and the influence of executive management over the board, which is set up to uphold shareholders’ interests. Higher transparency resulting from new financial regulations have forced companies to disclose its executive remuneration structure in detail, offering investors some information around the appropriateness of this expense. Above is a simple equation I use to determine whether the compensation of S&P500 CEOs are paid at the appropriate level compared to the rest of the market. Using the equation with PNFP’s data, the output tells us that its CEO compensation is acceptable. This means that Pinnacle Financial Partners is not paying its CEO too much compared to how much net income was generate last year, and relative to other CEOs in companies with a similar market cap. Salary paid by Pinnacle Financial Partners to the CEO seems slightly out of line compared to market standards, though growth in compensation isn’t completely incongruous with the company’s EPS performance. Although CEO remuneration can be a useful sign for the alignment between a company’s CEO and its performance, it is certainly not sufficient to base your investment decision solely on this factor. Now that you know to keep in mind CEO compensation when putting together your investment thesis, I recommend you take a look at our latest free analysis report on Pinnacle Financial Partners to see PNFP’s fundamentals and whether it could be considered an undervalued opportunity.

John Maxfield,08102017,Fool,08032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The headquarters of Pinnacle Financial Partners in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. Image source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. Pinnacle Financial Partners (NASDAQ:PNFP) offers a compelling story about how to grow a bank in a rapid and responsible way. The secret to its success has been its unique approach to organic growth, catalyzed by a series of acquisitions that it's made over the past dozen years. Since Terry Turner and two fellow executives from a previous bank founded Pinnacle 17 years ago, its balance sheet has grown from a figment of their imaginations to just under $21 billion in assets today. An investment in Pinnacle's stock at its initial public offering in 2000 has increased in value by a factor of 13.3. Only one other bank can boast a better return over this span. In this way, Pinnacle has proven to be an exception to the rule that ""if it's growing like a weed, it probably is one,"" as former Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) CEO Dick Kovacevich was known to say. The Nashville, Tennessee-based bank's principal strategy revolves around recruiting experienced bankers from larger regional banks, who then bring their books of business over to Pinnacle. ""When you hire people with experience, a large book of business, and who know their clients extremely well, they're able to move that book of business from where they are to us, which creates rapid growth,"" says Turner. ""It also creates great asset quality. These are people they've banked for a long time and know what's going on with them. So, if they do have bad credits, they leave them behind, which is sort of the opposite of adverse selection."" Pinnacle Financial Partners co-founder and CEO Terry Turner (left) with BNC Bancorp CEO Rick Callicutt (right) discussing the merger of their banks earlier this year. Image source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. An important catalyst for Pinnacle has been the consolidation wave that's washed over the bank industry since the 1980s. As Turner says: To be a client-facing person in a large regional bank is a difficult experience. It's particularly difficult if you're in an outpost market far from headquarters. It's a bureaucratic deal. You have to get your credits approved by someone outside the market. Those people don't know you, they don't know your clients, and they're not involved in any sort of strategic decisions. So it's disempowering and disengaging for a generally prideful group of people who know how to take care of clients and who want to participate in the firm. Turner and his co-founders, chairman of the board Rob McCabe and chief administrative officer Hugh Queener, speak from experience. They were executives at Nashville's last major bank, First American Corp., when it was bought in 1999 by a larger out-of-state rival, which in turn was bought by an even larger bank, where it resides today as part of Regions Financial (NYSE:RF). The buyout presented ""a great opportunity because First American was the last large, locally owned bank in Nashville,"" says Turner. ""We had market share data over an extended period of time showing that small, locally owned banks were taking share from larger regional banks, which were tied up in consolidation and dealing with all the difficulties that go with that."" This insight has influenced just about every aspect of Pinnacle's business model from the start, informing its culture, compensation, and risk management systems, as well as the characteristics of bankers it seeks to ""lift out"" of the regional banks it competes against. It's hard to come away from a conversation with Turner without believing that he genuinely views Pinnacle's culture as a competitive advantage. ""When I talk to most analysts and institutional investors about [culture], their eyes glaze over and they want me to get to the real stuff,"" says Turner. ""But that is the real stuff. We've bet the whole farm on this strategy."" Rob McCabe, co-founder and chairman of the board of Pinnacle Financial Partners. Image source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. ""There's a broad reputation among bankers that it would be a good thing to have the opportunity to work at Pinnacle,"" says Turner. ""We're able to leverage that to source and recruit and hire and onboard and retain a large number of the best and most productive revenue producers in our markets."" Pinnacle requires 10 years of experience at another bank for revenue-producing positions. It also won't give jobs to people who submit unsolicited applications or are circulating resumes. ""That group of people, we believed, were either unhappy or unsuccessful where they were, and we'd just as soon let them stay there,"" says Turner. ""That sounds trite, but it's an important building block in what we've done here."" To work at Pinnacle ""someone here will say: 'Hey, I worked with this person before, and they're good and they share our values.' So we set about recruiting those people,"" says Turner. ""Most of them are happy where they are, so it can take a long time to recruit them. We have people here that we chased for seven years."" The proof is in the pudding. Three of Pinnacle's highest-profile hires over the past few years include a former Tennessee state president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT), the former head of the capital market's origination group at SunTrust Bank (NYSE:STI), and the former head of private banking in Memphis at First Horizon Corp. (NYSE:FHN). An important advantage of this approach is that it reduces turnover. In Pinnacle's first 15 years, it lost only two revenue producers to other banks, while dozens came the other way. ""What we said is: How do you retain 95% of your people? And the answer is that you need to hire the right type of people,"" says Turner. ""So the experience level was not only important in terms of how we matched up against competitors, but also for how it drove turnover out of the system, which was part of the original design."" ""If you're at a regional bank, they're typically running some type of call program, expecting you to make a certain number of client calls a month,"" Turner continues. ""Here we don't do that. We turn people loose to get clients, know them well, and meet their needs."" Hugh Queener, co-founder and chief administrative officer at Pinnacle Financial Partners. Image source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. Another advantage of Pinnacle's focus on recruiting experienced and high-performing bankers -- the average revenue producer at Pinnacle has 33 years of experience -- is that it has enabled the bank to use a less cumbersome control system. ""[Our] credit approval process isn't burdened with bureaucracy,"" says Turner. He went on to explain that Pinnacle runs a signature system to approve loans, not a committee system: I've believed from the founding of this company that when something is everybody's job, it's nobody's job. So, I don't find the committee system to be particularly good for credit approval. If it looks like the person who chairs that committee likes a credit, then you like it. If it looks like he doesn't like it, then you don't like it. There's really no value to the committee. All it does is burden and slow down the process. The idea of a signature system is that a lender and their manager can do $1 million. And then generally the two of them and a senior credit officer can do $10 million. That group of three is always proximate to each other, so they can reach a decision in short order for a $10 million credit, which covers the vast majority of transactions that we do. That speed is important. Flexibility is also important. Again, because of our experienced workforce, we're able to make appropriate exceptions. If you're in a big company, you have to lay down bright-line rules that people need to follow. We do surveys where we ask employees to tell us what they like, what they don't like, and anything else. The most frequent answer in terms of what they like is that there isn't micromanagement. Pinnacle doesn't have an entirely pristine track record in this regard. It reported annual losses in 2009 and 2010, stemming primarily from construction and development loans that went into default following the financial crisis. But those loans came from banks it acquired in 2005 and 2007, which lent to residential developers on the outskirts of Nashville during the housing bubble. In other words, the losses had nothing to do with Pinnacle's credit approval process or lending standards, which is consistent with Turner's confidence in a less-bureaucratic credit approval process. Pinnacle's organic growth strategy has been effective, yet it accounts for only about half (44%) of the $21 billion on Pinnacle's balance sheet. The other half (56%) came by way of six acquisitions. Acquisitions by Pinnacle Financial Partners Assets Date Announced BNC Bancorp $7.4 billion January 2017 Avenue Financial Holdings $1.2 billion January 2016 Magna Bank $589 million April 2015 CapitalMark Bank & Trust $968 million April 2015 Mid-America Bancshares $1.1 billion August 2007 Cavalry Bancorp $605 million September 2005 Data source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. Pinnacle's first two acquisitions, the ones in 2005 and 2007, added to its presence in Nashville. But since then, with one exception, Pinnacle has used acquisitions to expand to new markets. It purchased a pair of banks in 2015 for footholds in Chattanooga and Memphis. And it bought BNC Bancorp earlier this year, nearly doubling Pinnacle's balance sheet and taking it for the first time outside of Tennessee, to the Carolinas and Virginia. The BNC deal more than any other previous acquisition will test Pinnacle's ability to inoculate its culture into banks located further afield, as it's done successfully with smaller in-state acquisitions. On the same day Pinnacle bought Magna Bank in Memphis, for example, it brought in a team of eight bankers from First Horizon Corp., the parent company of First Tennessee Bank. The head of that team had been the leader of First Horizon's Memphis-based private banking group. It remains to be seen if Pinnacle can replicate this success without the home-field advantage of attracting Tennessee bankers to a Tennessee bank, but the early signs are auspicious. After BNC had previously struggled to recruit experienced commercial lenders away from larger regional banks, it has already brought in six just since its acquisition by Pinnacle was announced in January. ""I don't know many banks that are able to make meaningful hires while they're changing the flag,"" says Turner. ""It's indicative of what our opportunity is and what we can do over there.""

    How Pinnacle Financial Partners Cracked the Nut on Rapid and Responsible Growth -- The Motley Fool

  "
John Maxfield,08102017,Fool,08032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There are a handful of banks in the United States that have separated themselves from the competition over the past decade. One of them is BB&T (NYSE:BBT), a $221 billion bank based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. BB&T's performance through the financial crisis leaves no doubt about this. Even through the depths of the crisis, BB&T didn't record a single quarterly loss. That puts it in an exclusive club, joined by banks such as U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB), both of which have similarly proven over long periods of time to be exceptional institutions. The person most responsible for BB&T's success over the past three decades is John Allison, who joined the bank in 1971 and served as its CEO from 1989 through 2008; he remained on the board for five more years before retiring to lead the Cato Institute. I reached out to Allison recently for his thoughts on the industry today. What follows is a transcript of select portions of our conversation, edited for organization and flow. John Allison, CEO of BB&T from 1989-2008. Image source: The Cato Institute. The Fool: How has banking changed since the financial crisis? John Allison: The big shift was a radical increase in regulation and micromanagement of the industry by regulators, including down to the loan level, telling you what kind of loans you could make. That was particularly discouraging for companies like BB&T that had come through the crisis and done very well. The somewhat encouraging news is that there is some effort by the current administration to roll back the regulatory attack on the industry, and we're seeing some evidence of that in terms of seeing banks regain the ability to increase dividends, as an example. If I were running a bank today, I'd like to go back to taking care of my customers and do what we were doing before the crisis. Given that our company went through the crisis without a quarterly loss, it's clear that what we were doing was fundamentally sound. Healthy companies like ours should have been allowed to continue doing what we were doing, but the regulatory environment isn't allowing that to happen. The Fool: What's the biggest problem with the current regulatory environment? Allison: I started my career as a small business lender, and the kind of loans that I made then couldn't be made today. Those are the kind of loans where you did a financial analysis, but you primarily made a judgment of the individual, their character, and their idea. We had great success doing that kind of lending. But the banking examiners have clamped down on that even though there's no evidence it contributed to the crisis. What had happened was that the regulators had gutted their practices around safety and soundness in the long period of time before the crisis when losses in the industry were low. They built up their compliance side instead. Then when the crisis came, they hired a bunch of young people who had no idea what banks ought to be doing in terms of lending and told them that all banks were making bad loans. This led them to clamp down on lending practices in markets that weren't causes of the crisis. If you have a business that doesn't need to borrow money, it's fine. But if you want to start a small business today, it is much harder to get financing from a bank. This is especially true in the real estate market. If you own a small shopping center and you want to use the equity in it to buy another one, you can't do that anymore. You have to come up with cash, which is difficult for the small guy, the guy starting up. The lending standards have become much tighter, imposed by the regulators, than they were in my 40-something-year career in banking. And it kills small business start-ups. A lot of people get confused when they look at total loan growth, which isn't that bad. But that's because big companies are borrowing a lot of money at low interest rates. But that distorts what's happening with the entrepreneurial small business owners, who are huge job creators. And many of those are good jobs, innovative jobs. The Fool: Why are regulators coming down so hard on small business loans? Allison: There's an obsession with mathematical modeling. Small business loans don't fit well into mathematical models because there's an element of character that's huge. A number of loans that I was able to make early in my career that created thousands of jobs, you simply couldn't make today. You have to make a judgment about an individual, their idea, and their commitment to getting the job done. You can't do that anymore. The mortgage market is a particularly interesting case because the approval standards for small mortgage loans are not tight at all. In fact, at least in theory, they're probably too loose. But in practice, if you get the paperwork wrong, then the borrower doesn't owe you any money. They can choose not to pay their mortgage. The Fool: What are your thoughts on consolidation in the industry since the crisis, especially after the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010? Allison: Dodd-Frank has distorted consolidation and competition in the industry in an odd way. We've seen very few start-ups since the crisis because the entry costs are much higher now. We've also seen a lot of smaller banks that have merged away because they couldn't absorb the regulatory costs. And then you get to these arbitrary barriers [at $10 billion, $50 billion, and $250 billion in assets], which are ironically helping the very large banks. They've been penalized in a certain sense, of course, with a huge regulatory burden, but relatively they're penalized less. When I started at BB&T we were a small bank. The impact of regulatory costs on a small bank is more dramatic than on a big bank because the CEO has to be involved personally on the regulatory side. The CEO of a large bank is involved as well, but he can hire people who are good at handling that stuff. The intellectual talent of people in a small bank is critical, and when they're focused on regulations as opposed to growing their business, that distorts their ability to run their bank and do what they're supposed to do in the community. I would argue that the big banks have an implicit guarantee from the federal government, and I'm just talking about five or six banks. They let Washington Mutual fail, but they saved Citigroup (NYSE:C). They failed Wachovia, but saved Citigroup. The market is not stupid, and no matter what people claim Dodd-Frank says, what it practically says is that we're going to bail out a handful of very large institutions. I'd let big companies fail, and I'd let the market understand that. At that point, I don't think you'd have the consolidation problem. I think the consolidation problem has largely been driven not by economics, but instead by government policy. It's created an unfair playing field for a handful of organizations that should have failed, like Citigroup, which would have been broken up by the market, and we wouldn't have the concentration today. The Fool: What are your thoughts on profitability in the industry since the crisis? Allison: From the beginning of the crisis until just recently, returns in the industry have been below the cost of capital, with a number of large banks trading below book value. An industry can't be healthy over the long term if they're earning less than their cost of capital. It has happened in the past in certain industries, and when it does, something dramatic happens to those industries. The returns are improving, but they're still low relative to what they need to be to have a really viable banking industry. If you look, there's a high correlation between economic growth and healthy banks. You can't name a country with a healthy economy that hasn't also had healthy banks. So the fact that banks are struggling to make satisfactory returns means that it has a negative impact on economic growth, which is partly reflected in the inability to make small business loans that spur job creation. Dodd-Frank is structured in a way that could kill the industry long term. What they're asking for is more capital and at the same time imposing massive new regulatory costs. The banks can have more capital and reduce risk, but they can't have more capital and incur these regulatory costs. I'm a big advocate of the Financial CHOICE Act, which would require banks to hold more capital but in return allow them to opt out of Dodd-Frank. I think banks can have strong capital positions, but they can't have that and at the same time be micromanaged and have this huge burden of regulatory costs. Banks can't afford both. The Fool: In your opinion, what caused the crisis? Allison: I view the crisis differently than a lot of people. I was a long-serving CEO when the crisis struck and I think the whole thing was caused by regulatory policy. Yes, some big banks made mistakes. But it was a combination of government housing policy, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in particular, which had $5 trillion in liabilities and $2 trillion in subprime mortgages when they failed, and the Federal Reserve, which held interest rates below inflation, that contributed to the bubble in the housing market, along with bubbles in other markets. I don't believe the whole industry was failing. I think that's ridiculous. It was a relatively small number of large institutions that were in trouble. Banks like Citigroup. I think they should have been allowed to fail and the world would be a better place today. The whole idea that everybody would have gone broke if one of the big banks failed was absurd. We had been doing business with investment banks like Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), but we controlled our risk with those companies just like we did with any borrower. If they had gone broke, we would have lost money, but not nearly as much as we lost to residential builders in the marketplace. It was a relatively small number of large banks and a handful of small banks that were in trouble. It was not an industrywide crisis, except to the degree that the regulators created a crisis by choosing to fail Wachovia, save Citigroup, fail Lehman Brothers, save Bear Stearns. The uncertainty caused by that response took what was going to be a normal correction and transformed it into a crisis, making everything worse than it had to be. The Fool: How did regulators' response to the financial crisis differ from their responses in past crises that you witnessed? Allison: I went through the financial correction in the early 1980s, which should have been more severe because we were in bad trouble economically after the inflation of the 1970s. I also went through the correction in the early 1990s. In neither case did we have a panic. And the reason we didn't have a panic was because at least you knew what to expect. Thousands of banks and thrifts failed in the 1980s and 1990s. The unwillingness to let banks fail in the latest crisis -- they were effectively bailing out everybody -- prevented the natural correction process from happening. We had rule of law in the past. In this crisis, we had no rule of law. When Washington Mutual failed, instead of taking the losses out of the FDIC fund, they took it from bondholders. That crashed the capital markets, which then caused Wachovia to fail. That was a regulatory decision. What was actually going on at the time was a huge flight to quality. BB&T and companies like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) were buried with cash. This idea that there was a liquidity crisis was absurd. The healthy banks were buried with cash, it was just a flight to quality. Bank deposits went up in the crisis, they just went to good banks like us, U.S. Bancorp, and M&T Bank. So allowing the market to work would have been bad in the short term but good in the long term because it would have cleaned up irrational institutions and redirected capital to where it should have been. We needed a correction. I think corrections are healthy because we get overly optimistic. But the response to the crisis has had much bigger implications than the actual correction itself because it led to bad legislation. All those things made the crisis worse than it needed to be. The Fool: What was the impact from Dodd-Frank on well-run banks like BB&T, U.S. Bancorp, and M&T Bank? Allison: Because our bank stayed healthy through the crises in the 1980s and 1990s, the examiners let us grow. We continued to take care of our customers. We didn't change our lending standards one iota. And we took on a lot of customers from failed institutions. Even bad banks have a lot of good customers. So we were able to grow through those crises and actually help the economy. This time, because of ignorance on the regulatory side, the regulators tightened down on healthy banks so that we had to put thousands of customers out of business that didn't have to go out of business and that would still be creating jobs today. One of the roles of a bank is helping well-run businesses through difficult times. If a problem is cyclical, where you're confident that a business will be healthy in the future, then you should help them through the cycle. And we did that. But this time, regulators came in and on a loan-by-loan basis told us which borrowers we could help and which loans we could modify. That ruined many businesses and had a huge impact on the economy.

    A Conversation With John Allison, the CEO Who Led BB&T Through the Financial Crisis -- The Motley Fool

Going into the financial crisis, the bank industry was fertile territory for growth investors, who sought to ride the consolidation wave that resulted in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and other banks amassing trillions of dollars in assets on their balance sheets. But since then, things have changed, as low interest rates and higher compliance costs have caused growth investors to stay on the sidelines, leaving the space to value investors. With this in mind, it's worth looking at whether a bank like Bank of America, which grew rapidly before the crisis, is cheap enough to attract value investors in the crisis' wake. Image source: The Motley Fool. The most common metric used to assess this is the price-to-book value ratio. This compares a bank's stock price to its book value per share -- i.e., its shareholders' equity divided by its outstanding share count. Generally speaking, banks are considered cheap when their shares trade for a discount to book value. Alternatively, banks tend to be considered expensive if they trade for two or more times book value. In Bank of America's case, its shares are currently priced at $24.96 per share, as of Monday's closing price. Its book value per share is $24.88. Thus, its price-to-book-value ratio comes out to just above 1.0. This suggests that Bank of America's stock is neither cheap nor expensive, but rather right between the two. You can get more context into Bank of America's valuation by comparing it to other big bank stocks. To this end, the average bank on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large cap banks, trades for 1.49 times book value, according to YCharts.com. The most expensive stock on the index, First Republic Bank, trades for 2.6 times book. The cheapest, Capital One Financial, trades for 0.84 times book value -- that is, at an 16% discount to book value. Aside from Capital One and Citigroup, in fact, Bank of America's shares are priced at the lowest multiple to book value of any bank on the KBW Bank Index. Image source: Bank of America. There are multiple reasons for this. One is that Bank of America's profitability is below the average among large cap bank stocks. Its return on equity over the past 12 months was 8.12%. That's below the 10% rate that analysts and investors typically expect from a bank the size of Bank of America. It's also below the 9.47% average on the KBW Bank Index. Another reason that Bank of America's shares trade for less than the average of other large cap banks is because it can't grow as quickly. Given that it already holds 10% of domestic deposits, it's legally prohibited from acquiring other banks. This leaves organic growth as the sole means for Bank of America to get bigger. Only two other banks are in this same boat: JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, the first- and third-biggest banks by assets in the country, respectively. Consequently, while Bank of America's shares may seem cheap relative to other bank stocks, there are reasons for why this is the case. This doesn't mean investors should avoid the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's stock, but it does imply that it isn't the screaming bargain that most value investors are on the hunt for.

Many investors see derivatives as inherently dangerous, pointing to the role that derivatives have played in events like the 2008 financial crisis and several other stock market downturns. Even Warren Buffett has pointed out the dangers of derivatives. Yet by themselves, derivatives are just tools, and the risk comes from how any particular investor uses them. Different investors mean different things by the idea of a derivative ETF, but dozens of funds use derivatives prudently to get exposure to certain parts of the market. The following five ETFs make use of derivatives in very different ways, but they each appeal to a certain cross-section of the market. ETF Assets Under Management Expense Ratio 5-Year Average Annual Return United States Oil (NYSEMKT:USO) $2.5 billion 0.77% (21.5%) PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking (NYSEMKT:DBC) $1.8 billion 0.89% (10.9%) iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (NYSEMKT:VXX) $1.04 billion 0.89% (56.8%) PowerShares U.S. Dollar Bull (NYSEMKT:UUP) $558 million 0.80% 2% PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite (NYSEMKT:PBP) $318 million 0.75% 6.9% Data source: Fund providers. For instance, the United States Oil ETF and the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking ETF both use futures contracts in an attempt to track the prices of the commodities on which they focus. The oil ETF focuses solely on crude, while the commodity ETF has exposure to energy, grains, and metals. Yet as the long-term performance of the oil ETF shows, futures contracts don't always track the price of the underlying asset over long periods of time. Certain behaviors among derivatives can create tracking problems that will detract from returns if investors use the ETFs that own those derivatives for long-term investing purposes. The iPath VIX exchange-traded note is an even more extreme example of using derivatives. The ETN tracks futures contracts in the S&P Volatility Index, which in turn is determined by looking at the prices of various options on the S&P 500 stock market index. This ETN has performed poorly in part because volatility in the stock market has declined dramatically in recent years, but the way that the volatility futures contracts themselves trade has exacerbated the decline for ETN investors. Yet not all futures-based ETFs have to be losers. The U.S. Dollar Bull fund has exposure to futures contracts in the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the value of the dollar against several major foreign currencies. Owning the stock involves betting that the dollar will appreciate against those foreign currencies over time. That's been a winning bet over the past five years, even though a long period of weakness in the euro has come to an abrupt halt in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Derivatives can actually reduce risk in a portfolio. The PowerShares Buy-Write Fund uses a covered call strategy, which involves writing call options against positions in stocks. The strategy has less volatility than just investing in stocks and produces greater amounts of income, at the expense of giving up a piece of the upside on the stocks the ETF owns. With a distribution rate of more than 3% and solid returns during the bull market, the PowerShares ETF aims to give more conservative investors a way to participate in the stock market without necessarily having the full risk of a pure unhedged long stock position. ETFs that invest in derivatives aren't for everyone, and not all derivative ETFs actually function the way that most investors would want them to. By knowing the ins and outs of each particular ETF, you can make sure that you don't get any nasty surprises in your portfolio. ","

,08102017,MarketWatch,08032017,"Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events THE TICKER A Wells Fargo Bank in Charlotte, North Carolina. U.S. (Reuters/Mike Blake) Wells Fargo can’t seem to find the bottom of its scandals. That’s becoming bad news for the entire banking industry. The fake-account mess that originally landed the bank in hot water turns a year old in September and still isn’t resolved. It’s since been joined by a slew of other revelations and accusations. The bank charged more than 800,000 people for auto insurance they didn’t need. It slapped veterans with hidden fees to refinance their mortgages. A group of young immigrants are suing over allegations Wells Fargo denied them student loans and credit cards — a suit Wells tried to have tossed but a federal judge greenlit on Thursday. In a regulatory filing on Friday, the bank signaled it could soon have still more headaches to disclose. And on Monday came the news it's facing regulatory scrutiny from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for not refunding insurance money to people who paid off car loans early. News of the first auto loans controversy alone prompted fresh calls for hearings into the bank’s practices from congressional Democrats on both sides of the Capitol last week —   and one Senate Republican, Jerry Moran of Kansas. All the Democrats on the Senate Banking panel signed on to a request to Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who chairs the committee, for a September hearing with Wells CEO Timothy Sloan and board chairman Stephen Sanger. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) renewed her request of Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen that the central bank use its authority to fire directors who served during the fake-account scandal. The cascade of controversies has marred the bank’s once-sterling brand. Wells now ranks as the least-respected company in America, behind even Big Tobacco, according to a June survey of money managers conducted by Barron’s. And it’s share price has suffered, too, lagging further behind its peers than at any time since 2011. Bloomberg’s Kartikay Mehrotra, Laura Keller, and Margaret Cronin Fisk have a good rundown of the bank’s no-good, very bad year. For the rest of the sector, here’s their key insight: Don’t banks get in trouble all the time? U.S. banks have paid huge sums to settle all sorts of allegations related to market-rigging and investor-fleecing, many involving mortgage-backed securities. But those settlements are almost always related to wholesale banking, as opposed to retail. Wells Fargo’s current scandals are different because they deal with customers in the consumer division. That’s more unusual, and a more politically sensitive problem. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). (Melina Mara/Washington Post) Although Wall Street is a favorite punching bag of both parties — see the 2016 election — refining campaign-trail animus into relatively inscrutable banking regulation is another matter. So less than a decade after a financial crisis that almost destroyed the economy, the debate over banking rules in Washington these days centers on how much relief to provide the industry from the Dodd-Frank law passed in its wake. That's left Democrats who'd like to impose new restrictions on the biggest financial institutions struggling instead simply to hold the line by defending the rules already on the books. The Wells Fargo mess, however, put industry overreach in terms everyday consumers understand. Democratic lawmakers and their allies backing tougher oversight are taking heed. They're marshaling the example of the Wells Fargo imbroglio to try to protect a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule making it easier for consumers to sue their banks. House Republicans already voted to strip that rule, and their Senate counterparts will attempt to follow suit next month. Backers of the so-called arbitration rule argue Wells Fargo customers could have brought the bank's issues to light sooner if they hadn't been forced into contracts that barred them from challenging the bank in court. It's not hard to imagine industry critics making even more hay out of the bank's malfeasance. As Cap Alpha's Ian Katz wrote late last month, the nesting Wells scandals could ""end up being unhelpful to broader efforts to reform Dodd-Frank, because it strengthens the arguments of Democratic lawmakers including Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown that banks need tougher, not lighter, oversight."" ""Sure,"" Katz continued, ""one could argue that Dodd-Frank didn’t prevent Wells Fargo’s sales practices scandal or this auto loans mess. So what good is it? But for the average bloke, that doesn’t translate into a reason for weakening oversight of banks."" President Trump. (AFP/Saul Loeb) — Corporate chiefs in the Obama era made a refrain out of complaining that “Washington uncertainty” was tying their hands and holding back growth-unleashing investments. In the Trump era, they’re still making that complaint. My colleague Damian Paletta reports:  “A Washington Post review of dozens of conference calls in recent weeks between chief executives and analysts show how the fog of policymaking is paralyzing many companies from taking risks that in normal times would help them grow. The conference calls were held as part of a quarterly ritual in which executives discuss their firm's performance and outlook for the future, and they give voice to some of the reasons U.S. economic growth has been so weak at a time when inflation and interest rates remain historically low... Many of the executives did not blame President Trump or Congress directly for the uncertainty, but they remarked that promises made at the beginning of the year have not come to fruition and might not anytime soon.” Trump's stalled trade agenda, specifically, is causing problems for sectors that believed the administration's pledges it would act quickly. The New York Times's Alan Rappaport reports: America’s steelworkers are on edge as they wait for Mr. Trump to fulfill his promise to place tariffs on steel imports. Home builders are desperate for the president to cut a deal with Canada to end a dispute over its softwood lumber exports. And cattle ranchers are longing for a bilateral pact with Japan to ease the flow of beef exports... The Commerce Department was poised to deliver a report to Mr. Trump by the end of June with recommendations for steel tariffs, on the ground that cheap imports pose a national security threat. But the process became bogged down when industries that buy steel objected and other countries threatened retaliation. Mr. Trump said recently that dealing with steel was no longer a top priority, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, signaled to members of Congress in briefings last month that a decision was no longer imminent. Dithering may have made the situation worse for American steel producers. Mr. Gerard said foreign competitors had been flooding the United States market with steel products in anticipation of the tariffs. Some of this is happening in parts of the country that voted for Mr. Trump... One accomplishment that Mr. Trump has notched on trade has been an agreement with China that opened its market to American beef exports. For the beef industry, however, the benefits of that deal pale in comparison with the cost of abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which had been spearheaded by President Barack Obama. It would have provided access to the enormous Japanese market. Instead, Japanese tariffs on American frozen beef, which would have declined under Mr. Obama’s deal, are on the rise. Last week, they increased to 50 percent from 38 percent, making America’s meat even more vulnerable to competition from countries such as Australia. Meanwhile, colleague Heather Long says American steel companies have China to thank for surging prices: ""China is a major factor driving this ""summer of steel."" The Chinese government has finally curbed some steel production, acknowledging that a glut of steel on world markets was causing prices to fall so low that even Chinese companies couldn't turn a profit. At the same time, China is hungry for steel as it upgrades its infrastructure. Lower Chinese supply and higher Chinese demand has sent steel -- and other metal -- prices up around the world. All of this is great news for steel companies."" — Inflation isn't going anywhere, so neither should interest rates, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told the America's Cotton Marketing Cooperatives 2017 Conference in Nashville. From Reuters: ""Bullard's comments are largely in line with those he has been making for over a year. He has argued that the Fed does not need to raise rates until the U.S. economy breaks out of its pattern of low inflation and about 2 percent annual growth. Most of his Fed colleagues have stuck to their forecast that inflation is headed back to 2 percent over the next couple years, even though their forecasts have proven overly optimistic for years. Bullard noted that the dollar has declined in value this year, chalking that move up largely to improved growth forecasts for Europe and the expectation that the European Central Bank will respond by tightening monetary policy."" Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner. (AP/Seth Perlman) — Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) is stiff-arming a request from the state comptroller to issue $6 billion in new bonds to help pay down the state's debt. Instead, he called on the comptroller to tap $600 million in state coffers to pay some bills. Reuters: ""Rauner also said the state cannot go to market with the debt until he works with state lawmakers to identify an appropriation or plan to pay off the new bonds. 'This bonding in and of itself is not the answer,' Rauner told reporters...Illinois has the lowest credit ratings and pays the highest borrowing costs among the 50 U.S. states."" — Meanwhile, the hedge fund Aurelius Capital sued Monday seeking the dismissal of Puerto Rico's bankruptcy case, arguing the federal oversight board trying to hold off the island's creditors was unconstitutionally established. Aurelius was among those that successfully pressed a legal case against Argentina over its sovereign debt. The New York Times's Mary Williams Walsh reports: ""Some of Puerto Rico’s bondholders argue that they bought the bonds on the understanding that their repayments and interest were by law the government’s first priority. They were surprised when they found that Puerto Rico’s five-year plan called for deep cuts in all bond payments, including payments to the holders of general-obligation bonds. The oversight board wants to use the savings to finance government operations for the five-year recovery period. But creditors say this approach is at odds with the Puerto Rican Constitution."" Marc Short, White House Director of Legislative Affairs. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) — The Trump administration is reaching out to a ""few dozen"" House Democrats on a tax overhaul to court their support even as the congressional Republicans driving the process pursue a GOP-only approach. Politico's Rachel Bade and Elana Schor report: ""Even as congressional GOP leaders largely embrace a partisan path on taxes, White House officials have been wooing 15 to 20 centrist House Democrats since early summer. The Trump administration is all too aware of Congressional Republicans’ struggles to come together on a range of hot-button issues — from health care to government spending — and tax reform is littered with political minefields for the party. So the president and his staff are opening a line of communication with moderate Democrats in case a Plan B is needed. At a mid-June dinner at the White House with four centrist House Democrats, President Donald Trump expressed interest in a bipartisan package combining tax reform with infrastructure spending, multiple sources said. Since then, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and top White House staff have huddled with conservative Democrats in the Blue Dog Coalition and the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus."" — Does the economy really need tax cuts? Maybe not, economist Ed Yardini tells CNBC: ""I don't think that given the strength of the labor market and the tightness of the labor market that the economy needs any fiscal stimulus. It ain't broke so there's no reason to fix it."" PayPal founder Peter Thiel exits an elevator after a meeting at Trump Tower in New York. (REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz) — Peter Thiel, the technology investor who became one of Trump's most vocal and important private-sector champions, harbors private doubts his presidency could end in disaster. BuzzFeed's Ryan Mac reports: Donald Trump’s most prominent Silicon Valley supporter has distanced himself from the president in multiple private conversations, describing at different points this year an 'incompetent' administration, and one that may well end in 'disaster.' Peter Thiel’s unguarded remarks have surprised associates, some of whom are still reeling from his full-throated endorsement of Trump at the Republican National Convention. And while the investor stands by the president in public — 'I support President Trump in his ongoing fight,' he said in a statement to BuzzFeed News — his private doubts underscore the fragility of the president's backing from even his most public allies. Preet Bharara,former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) — Trump may finally have found a replacement for Preet Bharara, the head of the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan he fired back in March. BuzzFeed's Zoe Tillman reports: ""The White House is considering Geoffrey Berman, an attorney who practices in New Jersey and New York and one of Rudolph Giuliani’s law partners, to lead the US attorney’s office in Manhattan — one of the most high-profile federal law enforcement jobs in the country. Berman’s name was included as part of a package of proposed candidates for New York judicial and US attorney vacancies sent by the White House in mid-July to New York’s Democratic senators, according to a source familiar with the process. The list offers an early glimpse at the Trump administration’s strategy for filling vacancies in states with two Democratic senators. Berman, who did not immediately return a request for comment, was the only name that the White House proposed for US attorney in the Southern District of New York."" — Sen. Warren has put a hold on Makan Delrahim, President Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division. The move will keep Delrahim sidelined while Justice lawyers continue reviewing AT&T's proposed $85.4 billion tie-up with Time Warner. Bloomberg's Sarah Forden and Billy House report: ""Warren has described the nomination of Delrahim, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division, as an indication that Trump’s administration will ""put the interests of giant corporations ahead of the American people,"" according to an April 3 post on her Facebook page. Delrahim was previously an attorney at law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP and lobbied on behalf of companies pursuing mergers. He worked for insurer Anthem Inc. in its failed bid for rival Cigna Corp., a deal the Justice Department successfully sued to block."" — Edward Kleinbard, writing in the New York Times, thinks we're headed toward a debt default: ""Sometime in October, the United States is likely to default on its obligation to pay its bills as they come due, having failed to raise the federal debt ceiling. This will cost the Treasury tens of billions of dollars every year for decades to come in higher interest charges and probably trigger a severe recession. The debt ceiling is politically imposed, and the decision not to raise it, and therefore to choose to default, is also political. It’s something America has avoided in the past. This time, though, will be different."" — Jared Bernstein, writing in The Post, thinks Republicans are on track to pass a deficit-busting tax cut for the wealthy: ""Thus far, the administration has shown neither skill nor interest in the work of legislating, which requires analysis, organizing stakeholders and close work with your congressional partners. But while much of the focus will be on the process of tax reform, it’s essential to recognize that there is as yet no tax reform. There are only highly regressive, revenue-losing tax cuts. Real tax reform, meaning tax changes responsive to the needs of the majority of the American people now and in the future, would push back on, instead of exacerbate, market-driven inequalities and raise the necessary revenue to meet the many challenges we face.""

                                    first came to light last year, when regulators led by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined the bank $185 million for improperly opening about 2 million bank and credit card accounts without customers’ knowledge or approval. During the course of the regulators’ investigation, about 5,300 Wells employees were fired, and about a month after the disclosure, Chairman and CEO John Stumpf resigned and was forced to forfeit millions of dollars in compensation. Also read: Wells Fargo CEO’s $41 million ranks only third among executive-pay clawbacks, forfeitures And the hits just keep coming. Last month, the New York Times first broke the news that Wells had charged hundreds of thousands of customers for auto insurance they did not request or need. Because that additional coverage cost more, thousands of customers had overdrawn accounts, bank fees, dinged credit scores, or even defaults that led to car repossessions. And just days later, the bank notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that the number of unauthorized bank accounts it had created could be much higher than previously reported, sending shares tumbling. In light of the insurance problems, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of Wells’ regulators, was considering taking additional action against the bank. And New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Oliver Wyman, a consultant engaged by Wells to identify problematic practices, like the auto insurance charges. Even before news of the auto insurance charges broke, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren was calling for the removal of Wells’ board. “The Federal Reserve must hold the Wells Fargo Board members accountable for their risk-management failures,” Warren wrote to Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen. Yellen later confirmed that the central bank does have the legal authority to take such a step. Also read: Yellen says she could oust Wells Fargo directors S&P Global Market Intelligence notes that regulators would likely rely on a federal law known as Section 1818, which allows for removal of a banker or officer if that person compromises the safety and soundness of the institution. The fake accounts scandal met that test, regulators said. And there is precedent for such a step. In 1984, when Continental Illinois failed, its bailout plan included removal of the company’s top management and board of directors, S&P Global Market Intelligence wrote. But Continental Illinois was unable to function on its own and had to be taken over by the government, and Wells, though tarnished, isn’t quite there yet. Its stock is down 4.7% for the year to date, compared to a 5.6% gain for the KBW Bank Index

                                   . Still, as David Long, a Raymond James analyst, wrote on Tuesday, Wells’ predicament is “getting worse before it gets better.” Long reiterated his underperform rating, writing that headline risk “will make it even more challenging for the bank to maintain customers and employees, let alone attract new customers and employees, in our opinion. As a result, we are reducing our 2018 EPS estimate, and believe negative headlines will continue to weigh on the stock and its relative valuation.” And just Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the San Francisco Fed, which is the region in which Wells is headquartered, was investigating the bank for not refunding so-called guaranteed auto protection insurance money to customers who paid off car loans early. Tens of thousands of customers may have been affected, the Times said. In April, shareholders repeatedly interrupted the bank’s annual meeting, and most members of the board were able to keep their seats with only meager margins. In an email, a spokesman for the bank told MarketWatch, “Wells Fargo’s board and management team have taken many actions in response to its retail sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, executive accountability actions and numerous steps to ensure we make things right with our customers and other stakeholders. That work continues and remains a core part of our efforts to build a better Wells Fargo for the future.” Also read: Housing crisis has led to breakdown of the social order, author says After the first car insurance revelations, Warren wrote again to the Fed, again urging Yellen to remove Wells’ board. “Fines alone will never do the job,” she said. “Given an uneven history, politicians agitating for change at Wells Fargo might have a tough time convincing regulators to act. But if scandals continue to pile up and public outrage accumulates further, regulators might see an opportunity to quell populist rage that spawned ‘Audit the Fed’ and Occupy Wall Street movements,” S&P Global Market Intelligence wrote.

The number of brand-wide promotional days was also down, by 42 days. “We believe that this is absolutely the right long-term decision for our brand, despite near-term sales pressure,” Idol said. Total revenue was down 3.6% for the quarter to $952.4 million from $987.9 million for the year-ago period. Wholesale revenue dropped to $303.6 million from $394.4 million.

                                   , Michael Kors has sought to lower the number of discounts on its merchandise by lowering distribution in the wholesale channel. Michael Kors has also focused some of its energies on shifts to the merchandise, adding embellishments like studs, perforations and leather inlays, which the company says has been well-received by consumers so far. Also like Coach, which recently added Kate Spade & Co. to its brand portfolio, Michael Kors, in the words of John Idol, is “forming a global fashion luxury group” with the purchase of Jimmy Choo. Though things are looking up, some analysts aren’t so quick to celebrate. See: Buying clothes online gets personal as styling services sign up members “[I]t is clear that the group still has an incredible amount of work to do in rebuilding the brand and reconnecting with customers,” wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a note. “In this regard, we believe Michael Kors is a long way behind firms like Coach on its journey to recovery.” Saunders calls attention to the same-store sales decline as a reason for concern and proof that the company has not regained its “go-to luxury brand” status even with all of the changes. Read: Makeup companies L’Oreal and Covergirl are targeting a new market: men Also:  Victoria’s Secret has a bra problem “Individually, some of these initiatives have found success; collectively, they are insufficient to reframe the image of Michael Kors in the minds of many consumers who will associate the brand with its ubiquitous past,” Saunders said. “In our opinion, Michael Kors needs a much more cohesive brand reinvention if it is to drive future success.” Michael Kors shares are up 17.1% for the past three months, and up 5.3% for the year so far.

Including today’s session, the S&P 500 has gone 281 trading days without a pullback of 5% or more. In addition to heightened tensions with North Korea, Winer said there are plenty of reasons for a possible pullback out there — central banks becoming more aggressive at tightening than expected, or reality setting in that 3% GDP growth isn’t going to happen — but for now, markets are complacent with the upward momentum.

                                   shares finished down 0.4%, after an earlier gain of more than 1%. Investors have become increasingly bullish on the group. Wells Fargo on Monday reiterated that it was one of four sectors — along with consumer discretionary, health care and tech — that “currently appear poised for the biggest outperformance.” Separately, Oppenheimer noted that the group had been “the top-performing sector against falling interest rates since May, when the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield peaked at 2.4%,” adding, “We view positive reactions to bearish information as a sign that the bad news has been discounted and the underlying asset is primed to rally.” Goldman Sachs listed five reasons why portfolio managers were “ignoring the micro story” of financials, suggesting that even though they are the top-performing sector over the past 12 months — up more than 30% — they still had room to grow. The reasons include their trading at a relative valuation discount, deregulation tailwinds that weren’t priced into shares, and increases in both buybacks and dividends, which the investment bank said would rise at three times the pace of the overall S&P 500.

Ryan Vlastelica,08102017,MarketWatch,08032017,"Published: Aug 10, 2017 4:57 a.m. ET Leveraged commodity products have seen steep inflows this year By Traders are going where the action is. Amid an historic calm in the U.S. equity market, which has provided few opportunities for short-term market participants to ride momentum or cash in on volatility, traders have instead been gravitating toward commodities, where exchange-traded products offering leveraged returns on major assets have seen a surge in interest. The products — which are considered highly risky, are designed to be one-day holdings, and are principally used by sophisticated, as opposed to retail, traders — have had massive inflows and heavy volume this year, in some cases eclipsing the vanilla commodity funds in popularity.

                                   has had about $620 million. Trading has also spiked. About 223.4 million shares exchanged hands over the month of July, compared with 53.5 million in July 2016, meaning there was a more than four-fold increase in year-over-year activity. This isn’t due to investors chasing performance, necessarily: the product has lost more than 75% of its value thus far this year, alongside a nearly 22% tumble in natural-gas prices. The fund rose 6.4% on Wednesday and moved on volume of more 18 million shares, well above its 30-day average of 10.3 million. “Oil and natural gas attract a lot of speculative money and investors, and they’re one of those investments were as the price goes down, people seem to buy more,” said William Rhind, the chief executive officer of Granite Shares, which sponsors broad-based commodity exchange-traded funds like the GraniteShares Bloomberg Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 ETF

They’re used to gain leverage and leveraged exposure on a short-term basis. The inflows indicate people are trying to take advantage of moves, and for natural gas it is a bullish indicator, a sign they expect prices to go up.” While leveraged commodity products remain a niche category, increased usage has been a broad trend this year. Four of the top 15 commodity ETPs this year, in terms of inflows, are leveraged. Other ones seeing heightened usage are the VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"Sanger will retire at year-end, earlier than his previous plans to depart in April upon reaching a mandatory retirement age of 72. The two longest-serving directors, Cynthia Milligan and Susan Swenson, will retire at the same time. Juan Pujadas, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers principal, will join as an independent director on Sept. 1. The board also detailed changes to four of its committees and said it would make more changes over time, trying to balance competing needs for directors with Wells Fargo experience and those with new perspectives on the company. Wells Fargo had long maintained a reputation as a well-run, highly profitable institution that managed to sell more products to customers than any of its big-bank rivals. That image was shattered nearly a year ago when it revealed that thousands of its employees created as many as 2.1 million phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. Since then, the bank has ousted executives, clawed back pay, changed incentive structures for low-level employees and implemented a new risk-management structure. Nonetheless, it still facing numerous lawsuits and regulatory probes and in recent weeks detailed new problems in its mortgage, auto loan and retail banking operations. In a joint interview, Duke and Sanger said the board expedited changes to its structure and composition after discussions with investors, who offered most directors relatively little support in a vote earlier this year. “This company is going to end up being a better bank than it would have been without this incredible wakeup call,” Duke said. “It had been so successful for so long it was difficult to recognize the need for change.” Changes Wells Fargo has made “enable us to have our arms around sales practices issues in a way that we obviously didn’t before,” Sanger said. Issues found within business units are being elevated to the board and regulators, and are then being addressed, much more quickly than before, he added. Sanger, who has been on Wells’ board for 14 years, became chair in October after then-Chair and Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf abruptly departed and the board decided split the two roles. Investors told directors they had not made changes to the board’s structure and composition quickly enough, prompting the hiring of Mary Jo White, former Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to conduct an internal review. White, who now works at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, interviewed directors about who the next chair should be and consulted with regulators before handing down an assessment, Sanger said. Duke said she saw herself as someone who can ensure Wells Fargo changes from a sales-driven institution to one focused on service. “I am a community banker to my very toes,” she said, pointing to her experience at small banks in Virginia and at the Federal Reserve. The two Wells Fargo board members who received the lowest vote totals, Enrique Hernandez and Federico Peña, will remain on the board, but director Karen Peetz will replace Hernandez as chair of the risk committee. Sanger said investors told him they did not have a particular problem with any individual, but voted against directors who held leadership positions on the board or its committees. He characterized Hernandez as one of the “very strongest directors” whose departure would be bad for shareholders. ","

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"Betsy Duke, who only joined the board of the third-largest U.S. lender in 2015, will be promoted as Wells tries to repair damage caused by widespread sales abuses against customers. Shareholders gave the board a very thin endorsement at the bank’s annual meeting in the spring, and Duke is likely to become the next chairwoman, said investors, analysts and two people with knowledge of board discussions. Chairman Stephen Sanger reaches the mandatory retirement age of 72 in April, ahead of the next annual shareholder meeting. On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported Sanger would now step down in early September. That step would likely speed the ascension of Duke, a former small town banker from Virginia Beach. Wells Fargo declined to comment. Sanger and Duke did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Some board members discussed making Duke Wells Fargo’s chairwoman last October, when then-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf stepped down and the board decided to split the two roles, a person familiar with the matter said. However, Duke told colleagues she was not ready, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Instead, Duke was elevated to vice chair under Sanger. Pressure on Wells Fargo to make changes has intensified as new problems have surfaced in recent days. Revelations last month that the bank enrolled unknowing borrowers in costly auto insurance prompted New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees public pension funds that hold roughly 11.6 million Wells Fargo shares, to call for Sanger’s replacement. The bank said it may have charged as many as 570,000 auto borrowers for insurance they did not want, leading to an estimated 20,000 wrongful repossessions. Early this month, the bank agreed to pay $108 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit over hidden mortgage fees to U.S. military veterans. Also, in its latest quarterly financial report, Wells Fargo said it was examining whether it had caused unnecessary financial harm to customers through mortgage fees, frozen deposit accounts and “add-on” products like identity theft protection. Last September, the bank settled with regulators over opening accounts for up to 2.1 million customers without their knowledge. Several people who have worked with Duke ticked off multiple reasons they believe she will replace Sanger. They noted that she comes from small-town lenders rather than large Wall Street institutions, making her the ideal leader for Wells Fargo’s board at this time. Anne Conner, president of TowneBank, where Duke had been chief operating officer, said Duke encouraged her to focus on substantive matters that mattered to a bank’s bottom line. “She cares about me as a woman executive in an industry that’s largely dominated by men,” said Conner. Former colleagues at the Fed, where Duke served as a governor from 2008-2013, said they gained valuable insights from her practical knowledge of banking. As Fed officials discussed how to implement the Dodd-Frank banking reforms passed after the financial crisis, Duke voiced concerns excessive regulations would put small banks at a disadvantage, said one former colleague who asked not to be identified. “She brought a deep knowledge of banking and credit to our deliberations on monetary policy and the response to the crisis at a time when that perspective was critical” to the Fed’s planning, said former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, who worked with Duke while she was a governor from 2008-2013. After Wells Fargo’s accounts scandal came to light, one person close to the board said Duke used her Fed experience to take the lead in explaining to fellow directors how regulators would view the bank’s actions. Duke “has put a lot of leadership and effort into helping us manage” implementation of regulatory reforms, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told Reuters in an interview, adding she has become “more heavily involved” in those reforms. Shareholders who spoke about voting against Sanger supported Duke on the grounds that her relatively short tenure on the board gave her less responsibility for Wells Fargo’s scandals. “This is welcome news,” Stringer said in a statement.

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge-fund manager David Tepper, known for taking positions in out-of-favor companies in his Appaloosa Management hedge fund, added stakes in embattled Wells Fargo Co and several energy companies in the second quarter as the price of oil fell, according to quarterly filings released Monday. Among the six new energy companies Tepper added to his fund were Antero Resources Corp, Southwestern Energy Co, and Chesapeake Energy Corp. Shares of each company are down by 20 percent or more year-to-date as part of a broad sell-off in energy companies. The price of oil hit a 9-month low in June due to concerns about a glut of supply. Overall, energy companies in the S&P 500 are down 12.7 percent for the year through Friday, compared with a 9.3 percent gain in the broad index. Tepper, who manages roughly $17 billion overall, bought approximately 681,000 shares of Wells Fargo during the quarter. Shares of the company are down 4 percent for the year as the company faces the ramifications of a scandal over unauthorized account openings and lawsuits that charged it modified borrower’s mortgages without their authorization. Overall, shares of financial stocks in the S&P 500 gained 6.9 percent for the year through Friday. In addition to energy and financial companies, Tepper took a roughly 3.7 million-share stake in Chinese online retailer Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd, making it the third-largest holding in the fund. Dan Loeb’s Third Point once again has a stake in Alibaba, having bought 4.5 million shares during the second quarter. Shares of the company are up 76 percent year-to-date after the company raised its revenue forecast in June. Other new additions to the fund included down-market retailer Dollar General Corp, mall-based retailer L Brands Inc, and travel bookings site Expedia Inc, filings show. Among technology stocks, Tepper added approximately 449,000 shares of Facebook Inc, increasing his stake in the company by 23 percent, and sold all of his shares of Snap Inc. Shares of the social media company have slid 14 percent since its $3.4 billion initial public offering in March on increased investor concerns that the company may never turn a profit. ","

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"Steven Peikin, the new co-head of enforcement at the SEC, held as much as $9 million worth of stock in dozens of blue-chip companies as of Aug. 8, according to a disclosure filing obtained through a public records request. Peikin also said in paperwork filed with the Office of Government Ethics that he or his former employer, law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, represented several big banks during his time there. In a separate filing, William Hinman, the SEC’s director of corporate finance, said his former law firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, represented big banks as well as technology companies. Should those companies come before the SEC, potential conflicts of interest could arise. Having such conflicts is not unusual for senior SEC officials, whose stints at the agency are often bookended by private sector roles. The SEC has stricter rules than other government institutions about conflicts, and a detailed guide on how to handle them during and after roles at the agency. “Steve and Bill are subject to and complying with all applicable ethics laws, rules, and regulations, and both are working with the agency’s ethics counsel as needed,” SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns said in a statement. Peikin and Hinman had no further comment beyond the SEC’s  statement. Peikin is co-head of enforcement alongside Stephanie Avakian, allowing him to recuse himself from matters that present conflicts. Thomas Sporkin, a partner at Buckley Sandler LLP, who previously led the SEC’s Office of Market Intelligence, said that having two enforcement chiefs is “incredibly valuable” to avoid conflicts while ensuring a senior official is involved with important cases. Conflicts of interest have long been a point of contention between those who argue the SEC benefits from hiring people with real-world experience, and critics who say the revolving door makes it impossible to regulate effectively. That debate has heightened under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has stocked his administration with former business executives, and pledged to slash regulations. In July, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, who is also a former corporate lawyer, outlined ways he plans to do that at the SEC. “Their careers have been representing the industry that they’re now supposed to regulate and they’re going to bring to the job the mindset of the regulated parties,” Robert Weissman, president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. “Their orientation is serving Wall Street, not the public.” Peikin, 51, and Hinman, 62, are two of the most prominent appointments by Clayton, who faced questions from lawmakers about his own conflicts of interest during a confirmation hearing in March. Peikin said in his disclosure form confidentiality obligations prevented him from disclosing the identity of 18 other former clients, five of whom are the subject of “pending non-public government investigations.” Stephen Cohen, the director of Palantir Technologies, which signed a contract worth more than $43 million with the SEC in 2015, was another firm client during Hinman’s employment. The contract was for five years, with years two through five being optional, an SEC spokeswoman told Reuters at the time. ","

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"The Wall Street bank is expected to see the best improvement in return on equity (ROE) and cost of capital among its peers, according to Mayo, who joined Wells Fargo from CLSA Americas in June. Citigroup’s shares had risen 4.1 percent this year through Wednesday’s close. The lender’s ROE will improve to about 9 percent in 2019 and 11 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2016, with the biggest potential driver being buybacks, the analyst said in a client note dated Aug. 9. Buybacks should reduce the bank’s shares by one-third over five years, far more than its peers, Mayo wrote, adding Citi to Wells Fargo’s “priority stock list”. The Federal Reserve on June 28 permitted Citigroup to go ahead with a plan to buy back $15.6 billion (12.03 billion pounds) of stock and pay $3.3 billion (2.54 billion pounds) in dividends over the next 12 months. However, despite the rosy expectations for earnings and stock price, Citi will likely miss its new targets, Mayo warned. By 2019, Citigroup should be able to produce a 10 percent return on common tangible equity, rising to 11 percent in 2020 and 14 percent over the longer term, executives said at the bank’s investor day last month. “Like Morgan Stanley five years ago, (Goldman) has trading shortfalls, a business mix change, and pressure to perform,” Mayo said. Goldman in July reported a 40 percent slump in second-quarter bond trading revenue, worse than many analysts had expected, and posted the weakest commodities results in its history as a public company. Mayo has an “outperform’ rating on Goldman’s stock and a “market perform” on Morgan Stanley. “Morgan Stanley needs to better describe to us how it plans to transition from restructuring to growth,” he said. Mayo, who has a tendency to ask pointed questions during investor events, has garnered a reputation as a blunt critic of bad behaviour in the industry who spots trouble early. Mayo became unemployed in February when CLSA shut down. He turned up at JPMorgan’s most recent investor day less than 24 hours after losing his job at CLSA, identifying himself as a “free agent” where he asked Chief Executive Jamie Dimon about the bank’s brand.

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. economic expansion will last at least another two years, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters who also forecast growth will not accelerate the way the Trump administration has predicted. The recovery from the devastating 2007-2009 financial crisis has been unusually lengthy. The latest growth stretch has already lasted 96 months, and if the poll predictions come true it would mark the longest economic expansion in more than 150 years. Growth has still not picked up as quickly as thought recently, leading forecasters to lower expectations again slightly in the poll of more than 100 economists taken Aug. 7-10. Still, the U.S. expansion has more than two years to go, according to 34 of 57 economists who answered an additional question on the business cycle. Of those economists, 21 said it would last two to three years and 13 said more than three years. “Expansions don’t go on forever,” said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo, who said there was another two to three years to go. “Steady, moderate growth looks like it could stay in place for a while.” The remaining 23 respondents said the expansion would only last one to two years. None of the economists, based in the United States, Canada and Europe, expected it to end within a year. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration aims to boost annual growth to 3 percent, mainly through sweeping tax cuts. But with the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, significant fiscal stimulus appears less likely and the economy has shown no signs of accelerating to meet that target. Predictions pointed to continued sluggish average growth in the current economic cycle compared with previous cycles of this length, based on National Bureau of Economic Research data. (www.nber.org/cycles.html) GDP likely grew at a 2.6 percent annualized pace in the second quarter, down from 2.7 percent in the July poll. But the trend has yet to break away from roughly 2 percent. The latest poll suggests 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent growth each quarter to the end of next year, slightly down from the 2.2 percent to 2.5 percent predicted the previous month. But growth has not been that steady during this expansion and generally is not in any economy. The modest outlook was still broadly explained by slower spending due to sluggish wage growth even though the economy is close to full employment. Expectations for tax cuts from the Trump administration are also fading. While that has not deterred U.S. stock markets, which have been setting record highs all year, it has pushed the dollar down nearly 9 percent against a basket of currencies. Inflation forecasts have remained lukewarm, with the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge, the core PCE price index, not expected to reach the central bank’s 2 percent target until the final quarter of 2018. Core PCE inflation was forecast to average 1.5 percent to 1.6 percent each quarter from here until the end of 2017. Despite that subdued inflation outlook, the Fed is still expected to announce steps to start shrinking its more than $4 trillion balance sheet in September, according to 94 of 100 economists in the Reuters poll. Five respondents said the announcement would be some time in the final three months of this year and one said early next year. The poll also predicted the Fed would raise interest rates by 25 basis points in October or December, taking the fed funds rate to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent. The Fed is expected to follow up with three more rate hikes of the same amount in 2018. “What the Fed is doing right now is saying the healthy economy combined with strong financial conditions more than make up for the disappointment in inflation,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They are very likely to announce their balance sheet shrinkage in September and see better-than-even odds they will even hike in December.” When asked if the Fed should start shrinking its balance sheet before inflation hits its target, 55 of 62 economists said “yes.” “Yes, they need to lower the balance sheet given emergency conditions are absent,” said Wells Fargo’s Bullard. But not everyone agrees. Some economists worry the envisioned pace of Fed tightening could hurt the economy, especially given the anemic nature of the recovery. “Clearly the idea here is to get ready for the end of the (economic) cycle,” said Harris. “In my view, hiking now so you can cut later is not the right way to think about it. You hike late so you can hike more. Because (if) you get inflation higher, then the hikes aren’t that painful to the economy.” ","

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Sliding loan pricing and increased repayments are continuing to curb the profitability and growth of Business Development Company (BDC) funds that lend to private U.S. midsized companies. BDC share prices have been under pressure as investment income has fallen, which is raising fears about dividend coverage and even dividend cuts, as the funds report results for the three-month period ended June 30. An upturn in the rates of non-performing loans is also seen as a threat. Of the 67 BDCs that have reported earnings to date, 20% have shown an increase in the value of their loan investments from when the loan was booked to its fair value today, according to BDC Collateral. The sector is trading at an average 7% discount to Net Asset Value (NAV), which measures mutual funds’ price per share. At the beginning of May the sector was trading at book value. “Earnings are still under pressure. It’s more of the same. A very competitive environment marked by tight spreads, and more opportunistic refinancings taking out high-yielding assets. Growth continues to be difficult when you are getting repaid faster than you can originate deals,” said Meghan Neenan, senior director at Fitch Ratings. “We do expect to see some dividend cuts by the end of the year.” The red-hot US leveraged loan market has been repricing loans for more than a year, which is hitting BDC’s interest income and shrinking portfolios or curbing growth as companies slash borrowing costs on leveraged loans. The funds are also absorbing increased loan repayments which are eroding portfolio yields as the proceeds are reinvested into lower-yielding loans. PennantPark Investment Corp’s (PNNT) portfolio shrank after US$199m of repayments exceeded US$89m of new investments, which left the fund with US$103m in cash at quarter-end, Wells Fargo BDC analysts said in a report. Capitala Finance Corp (CPTA) deployed a total of US$6.5m in the most recent quarter, but had US$49m in repayments, which is curbing portfolio growth, Jefferies analysts noted. FS Investment Corp (FSIC) reported that its total commitments to direct originations, including unfunded commitments, in the second quarter was US$197.1m while the investments that it exited, including partial paydowns, totaled US$218.3m. FSIC also said that although it declared its third quarter dividend unchanged, it expects to cut its dividend by 15% in the fourth quarter and the fund’s adviser agreed to waive a portion of its 1.75% base management fee starting in October. The wall of cash that has flowed into U.S. middle market lending strategies in the last 18 months has made leveraged loan origination and underwriting significantly more aggressive on terms and price. Around US$35bn has been raised for middle market lending in 2017 so far, compared to US$60bn raised in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Nearly two thirds of the money raised in 2017 has been allocated to direct lending funds while BDC’s equity capital makes up less than 5%. Middle market Collateralized Loan Obligation funds account for 20% of 2017 fundraising and mezzanine strategies make up close to 13%. Despite an increasingly crowded and competitive field, some BDCs are continuing to outperform their peers, which is differentiating them from the pack. TPG Specialty Lending Inc (TSLX) was praised by analysts for its continued strong yet conservative dividend coverage and emphasis on extracting prepayment fees when loans are refinanced. TSLX generated an annualized 13% return on equity on repayments, Wells Fargo analysts said, noting that “credit quality was again pristine …  and NAV increasing slightly to $16.15/share.” Ares Capital Corp’s (ARCC) also turned in a strong performance in the second quarter. Jefferies analysts said that while yield compression drove lower than forecast interest income, ARCC remains one of the best positioned BDCs for growth based on leverage capacity and existing liquidity. “Ares has seen significant repayments and yet is consistently able to generate a significant amount of underwriting every quarter showing that scale and deal origination capabilities do differentiate platforms,” said Neenan. With its quarterly results, ARCC also announced the purchase of the remaining US$1.6bn in loans in the Senior Secured Loan Program which concludes the winding down of a legacy joint venture with GE Capital. The resolution provided an immediate portfolio yield boost which increases the fund’s capacity to invest in higher yielding assets and ramp up its replacement—the Senior Direct Lending Program—more quickly.

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week, and the Reuters stories related to them. 1/ JAW-JAW, SELL-SELL An unnerving war of words between Washington and Pyongyang has pushed the cost of insuring South Korean debt against default to its highest in 1-1/2 years and the expected volatility of the Korean won is creeping higher. Gauges of market risk have been rising but are far off their peaks as the expectation still is that diplomacy would prevail and prevent a nuclear conflict. But investors are increasingly jittery and some are wondering what other threats to the benign environment in markets may be lurking below the radar. (Graphic: Korean markets reaction to U.S.-North Korea tensions reut.rs/2hPtW3Z) Immediate winners as tension ratcheted higher over the Korean peninsula were U.S. defense industry stocks. Raytheon, maker of the Patriot anti-missile system notched up an 8 percent gain for the month on the day of President Trump’s “fire and fury” warning, slightly outperforming Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s No. 1 weapons supplier. Overall, defense stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up about 4.3 percent, more than twice the gains of the wider index. (Graphic: U.S. defense stocks in the past month - reut.rs/2hQBS5i) The dollar’s nearly 9 percent fall this year has exposed a stark divergence of fortunes between U.S. companies with high international sales and those that rely on domestic revenues. Goldman Sachs’s basket of U.S. stocks with high domestic sales (which includes Wells Fargo, Charter Communications, Altria) is up 4 percent so far this year, significantly underperforming the S&P’s 9 percent gain. Their index of stocks with high international sales (including McDonald’s, Tiffany, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Boeing), has forged ahead, up 14 percent. Among S&P stocks, almost 30 percent of total revenues are generated overseas, according to Goldman. Earnings season is wrapping up with S&P earnings estimated to increase 11.9 percent - which would mark the first consecutive increase over 10 percent since the second and third quarters of 2011. An above-average number of companies are beating analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Still, data from market research platform Sentieo shows that dollar mentions in earnings were on balance weighted negative in the month to Aug. 9, with 388 transcripts during the month seemingly mentioning a foreign exchange effect in a positive way and 455 with a negative bias. (Graphic: U.S. stocks with high international sales have outperformed as the dollar has fallen - reut.rs/2fxe4m3) Talks in the coming week between the United States, Canada and Mexico on updating/renegotiating/ditching (depending on who’s talking) the North America Free Trade Agreement come at something of a crossroads for world trade. Trump’s campaign pledge to renegotiate or ditch NAFTA raised concerns in many countries about a re-emergence of protectionism and an unwinding of the globalization that supporters say has lifted millions of people out of poverty. The latest trade figures from China, Germany and Britain were all much weaker than forecast, raising worries over the level of demand in major economies as central bank take steps towards tighter monetary policy. What happens next may depend on whether the dollar stays weak. Most trade is in dollars and a weaker U.S. currency makes financing such operations more attractive. Oxford Economics has plotted the inverse relationship between the dollar and world trade and find that trade is growing at its fastest rate since 2010. (Graphic: Global Trade and the dollar - reut.rs/2fvPGRT) The euro zone economy outperformed both the United States and Britain in the first half of the year. Economists polled by Reuters expect growth of 2.0 percent in 2017. But Germany’s slowing trade has raised questions about the strength of demand in leading economies just as central banks consider scaling back their stimulus programs. Gross domestic product data from across the bloc due in the coming week will be closely watched. German flash second quarter growth is expected to pick up to 0.7 percent from 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year. Overall, euro zone economic activity is forecast to have expanded by 0.6 percent, the same as in Q1. Italy is picking up - its Q1 GDP growth was revised up to 0.4 percent from an initial 0.2 percent and that strength is expected to have been maintained in the three months to end-June.

Mark Kolakowski,08172017,Investopedia,08102017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The prospects of rising market volatility, global political uncertainty and a major market pullback are prompting many investors to look for stocks that hedge against a market downturn. The $44.3 billion MFS Value Fund (MEIAX) has beaten 89% of its large-cap peers for the year-to-date by searching for companies with ""durable business models,"" ample free cash flow, judicious reinvestment thereof and attractive valuations, Barron's reports, citing data from Morningstar Inc. Fund co-manager Nevin Chitkara told Barron's that among MFS Value Fund's favored stocks are: banks Citigroup Inc. (C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB); tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc. (PM); drug makers Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ); and medical equipment maker Medtronic PLC (MDT). All eight were in the fund's top 11 holdings as of June 30 and accounted for slightly more than 24% of the portfolio's total value, as of that date, according to Morningstar. While the managers of the MFS Value Fund look for attractive valuations, they are not hunting for extreme bargains, according to Barron's. That is, they don't look for distressed companies selling at huge discounts. Instead, they seek out solid companies with strong balance sheets and excellent long-term prospects, which they tend to hold for an average of eight years, Barron's adds. The fund usually lags when the broader market is experiencing a rapid surge or when investors are piling into distressed stocks. For the year-to-date through August 10, the fund delivered a total return (including dividends) of 8.65%, versus 10.25% for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), per Morningstar. Chitkara told Barron's for its August 10 story that banks have strengthened their balance sheets since the financial crisis, and are still attractively priced despite their post-election appreciation. Additionally, they are generating significant amounts of cash that can be returned to shareholders. He also indicated that ""there is the potential for regulation to get a bit easier,"" while rising interest rates would be ""an additional catalyst."" (For more, see also: Banks Are Hidden Gems For Investors, Goldman Says.) Philip Morris is viewed as an ""overlooked staple"" by Chitkara. The stock has been in the fund's portfolio since 1996, he added, and a new reduced-risk product called Iqos, which seems to be much safer than cigarettes because it heats rather than burns tobacco, has had promising trials. (For more, see also: Why Philip Morris Is Up 24% in 2017.) Global drug companies, such as Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, are diversified against the risk of pricing pressure in the U.S. market, he says. President Trump has raised this risk by promising to take action against drug price hikes. The fund tends to avoid biotech companies that concentrate on one product. Medical equipment maker Medtronic, meanwhile, is generating significant free cash flow and is returning it to investors, shrinking the share base and thus propelling both EPS and its share price upwards. Moreover, Chitkara says that the company is an innovator with pricing power. ",8 Undervalued Stocks to Weather a Market Downturn | Investopedia
Nathan Reiff,08172017,Investopedia,08102017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Warren Buffet's 13F report is undoubtedly one of the most highly-anticipated filings each quarter. Alongside other major investors, Buffet and his behemoth conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway report their holdings at the end of each quarter to the SEC through a filing known as a 13F. Considering that Buffett is one of the wealthiest and most highly respected investors alive today, outsiders with an interest in investing routinely look to him for ideas on how to move their money around. Now, with the 13Fs from the second quarter of the year newly available to the public, analysts are poring over the billionaire's recent investment decisions. At least two major shifts occurred in Buffett's holdings over the course of Q2 of this year, according to the 13F and reported on by USA Today. First, Buffett built up a new position in Synchrony Financial (SYF), purchasing a massive stake of 17.46 million shares over the course of April to June. Based on the closing price of $29.64 per share as of yesterday afternoon, this means that Berkshire's position as of June 30 would be worth $518 million today. On news that Buffett had invested, shares of Synchrony climbed by about 4.5% in after-hours trading. Synchrony is known for providing private label credit cards and was formerly part of GE Capital before spinning off toward the end of 2015. The second major purchase in Berkshire's portfolio is an addition to an older position. Buffett reportedly increased his holdings of Bank of New York Mellon (BK) by more than 50%. Berkshire bought more than 17 million shares of BK stock, an increase of 52% from its 33.01 million shares at the end of the first quarter. Buffett also trimmed back or eliminated some of his holdings. His company dumped the remaining 10.6 million shares of General Electric (GE) over the course of last quarter. The billionaire also trimmed down his position in IBM (IBM), dropping his total share count by nearly 10.5 million shares. As of June 30, Buffett held 54.08 million shares of the company. Buffett is famous for selecting a small number of companies and investing in them for the long term. His holdings in Apple, Coca-Cola, and Wells Fargo are famous for their size and for the length of time he has owned them. It seems that there were no major changes to these cornerstone positions in Berkshire's portfolio for the second quarter of the year. Nonetheless, it's important to keep in mind that Buffett's 13F shows his holdings as of June 30, and that he may have altered his portfolio in small or large ways since that time.

Evelyn Cheng,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Wells Fargo announced a board shakeup Tuesday, including the coming retirement of three directors, in a restructuring effort following the bank's consumer sales scandal. Elizabeth, or ""Betsy,"" Duke will take Stephen Sanger's position as independent chair effective Jan. 1, 2018, according to the bank's announcement. Cynthia H. Milligan and Susan G. Swenson, who both joined the board in the 1990s, will retire at the end of the year ""to help facilitate Board refreshment and provide for an appropriate transition of committee membership,"" the release said. ""The changes announced today reflect a thoughtful and deliberate process by the Board that was informed by the company's engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders, as well as the Board's annual self-evaluation that was conducted after the 2017 Annual Meeting and prior to its typical year-end timing,"" Sanger said in a statement. The bank also said Juan Pujadas, a retired principal of PricewaterhouseCoopers, will join the board as a new independent director. As a result of the changes, the board will have 13 members. The board plans to add one to three more directors over the long term. The bank also announced Enrique Hernandez, Jr. will take over as chair of the risk committee, whose oversight was expanded to include Wells Fargo's new Conduct Management Office. The board also announced changes to the leadership of its governance and nominating committee, corporate responsibility committee, and audit and examination committee. Duke became a director in 2015, according to the bank's proxy statement earlier this year. She is a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. ""Betsy's regulatory expertise has been invaluable to Wells Fargo, and I know that the combination of her banking and risk management experience will continue to serve the Board and the company well in her new role as Chair,"" Timothy Sloan, CEO and president, said in the statement. Sloan took over the company in October 2016 after the bank paid $185 million in penalties following the revelation that since 2011, workers trying to meet aggressive sales goals had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization. The bank has since abandoned those sales goals after clearing out top managers deemed responsible for the problems. Similar issues have arisen in the last few months for the bank, which was once considered the most admired of America's financial giants. In late July, news broke that hundreds of thousands of Wells Fargo customers were charged for auto insurance they did not need. The bank said on July 27 it plans to give about 570,000 customers a total $80 million for damages starting in August 2017.

Evelyn Cheng,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Wells Fargo's Stephen Sanger will likely step down as nonexecutive chairman as part of the board's effort to restructure the bank in the wake of its consumer sales scandal, Dow Jones reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Wells Fargo declined to comment to CNBC. Directors are planning to make final decisions on any changes by Labor Day, the news wire said, citing some of the sources. Last Friday, Wells Fargo said in a quarterly SEC filing that its Board of Directors is reviewing the structure, composition, and practices of the bank, which is ""expected to result in actions in third quarter 2017."" Sanger is expected to step down by the bank's shareholder meeting next spring, the report said, citing one source. Vice Chair Elizabeth Duke, who was a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors during the financial crisis, is then likely to take the spot, the report said, citing some of the people. Sanger was elected chairman of the board in Oct. 2016 and was chairman of General Mills for more than a decade until he retired in May 2008, according to Wells Fargo's website. Sanger is also a director of Pfizer, the site said. Wells Fargo shares traded about 0.9 percent lower, near session lows, after the report. The stock is down 5 percent this year. Wells Fargo, once considered the most upstanding of America's financial giants, has been plagued by scandal in the last year. Last fall, the bank paid $185 million in penalties after it was discovered that since 2011, workers trying to meet aggressive sales goals had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization.

Liz Moyer,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Citigroup's stock price should double in the next five years after shaving more risk off its books than any other large bank in the last few years, according to a new research report by veteran banking analyst Mike Mayo. Citi, his top stock pick, should show the best improvement in return on equity and cost of capital of any of its large bank peers, Mayo wrote in his first note from Wells Fargo Securities, where he recently landed after leaving CLSA Americas earlier this year. Banks are becoming companies that create value rather than destroy it for the first time in 20 years, Mayo wrote in his note. Their returns are rising and risk has been reduced, as has their cost of capital. Investors still remember the sting of the financial crisis, however, making bank stocks a ""show me"" story, he said. Return on equity for the 10 largest banks should increase to 11 percent from 9 percent, Mayo wrote, as revenue growth of 25 percent outstrips expense growth of 15 percent. Mayo said he's not factoring lower taxes, lower regulatory costs, higher interest rates and an increase in capital markets activity into his model, so those numbers could go higher. Banks' cost of capital — which means how much they pay in debt and equity to run their businesses — should fall to 9 percent from 10 percent because banks have reduced risk, Mayo wrote. ""Safety is further enhanced by the strongest balance sheets in a generation, the highest level of equity-to-assets in 80 years, and enough cushion to absorb not one, but two financial crises."" The outspoken analyst is widely followed on Wall Street, but was one of several analysts cut by CLSA Americas in February when it closed its U.S. research operations. His tough questions during analyst calls have gotten him banned by banks in the past, but his criticism of the sector before and throughout the mortgage crisis has won him the praise of Jamie Dimon when it turned out to be correct. He recently called the banking sector the ""Lebron James"" of the stock market.  ""They have incredible defense, the most resilient balance sheets in a generation, but now with this pro-growth agenda, they might also have a little bit of offense, too."" There are some risks to consider, Mayo wrote in his note Wednesday. Sloppy lending, higher costs, poor use of capital, increased risk-taking in trading, unforeseen moves in interest rates and unpredictable regulation are among them. In addition, while the last seven years have been the worst revenue generating years for the big banks since the 1930s, forecasts for improvement could fall short. Citi shares are trading at $68.10, and his price target for 2022 is $140. He rates the stock an outperform. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase also get outperform ratings from Mayo. Bank of America shares trade at $24.61 and his three-year price target is $40. JPMorgan, which trades at $93.06, has a three-year price target of $130. Mayo favors shares of Goldman Sachs, rated outperform, over Morgan Stanley, rated market perform. Goldman's fixed income trading operation has stumbled and is being repositioned but the rest of the bank is performing well, he says. ""It is evolving from FICC (fixed income) to FACC — financing, asset manager client, cash securities, and corporate clients."" Morgan Stanley has moved to emphasize wealth management and its business is more tied to the economy, he said. ",Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo akes bold bullish call on Citi

Diana Olick,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"U.S. homebuilders bounced back in August from a recent funk, as current sales and sales expectations leaped forward. A monthly index of builder sentiment rose 4 points to the highest level since May. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index now stands at 68. Anything above 50 is considered positive sentiment. The index was at 59 last August. Builder sentiment had jumped to a cyclical high in March, following a move by the Trump administration to ease water regulations. Builders say over-regulation at the federal, state and local levels have hampered production and driven up the cost of new construction. Sentiment had dropped more recently due to rising material costs, especially lumber. The Trump administration imposed a tariff on Canadian lumber, causing the price to spike. Builders say over-regulation at the federal, state and local levels have hampered production and driven up the cost of new construction. Sentiment had dropped more recently due to rising material costs, especially lumber. The Trump administration imposed a tariff on Canadian lumber, causing the price to spike. Now it appears builders are less concerned with policy and more enthused about the economy. They say they are seeing rising demand from buyers, who seem ready to pay a premium for new construction. New home sales in June were 9 percent higher compared with a year ago, according to the latest reading from the U.S. Census. ""This is due to ongoing job and economic growth, attractive mortgage rates, and growing consumer confidence,"" said NAHB Chairman Granger MacDonald, a homebuilder and developer from Kerrville, Texas. The index's three components all saw gains in August. Current sales conditions rose 4 points to 74. Sales expectations over the next six months jumped 5 points to 78, and buyer traffic increased 1 point to 49 — the only component still in negative territory. The new-home industry is also benefiting from a severe shortage of existing homes for sale. Most buyer demand, however, is on the lower end of the market, where builders have trouble meeting margins. Construction is still running well behind even normal levels, never mind the strong, pent-up demand. Most builders are also still concentrating on the move-up market, rather than entry-level. ""The fact that builder confidence has returned to the healthy levels we saw this spring is consistent with our forecast for a gradual strengthening in the housing market,"" said Home Builders Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ""GDP growth improved in the second quarter, which helped sustain housing demand. However, builders continue to face supply-side challenges, such as lot and labor shortages and rising building material costs."" Regionally, on a three-month moving average, builder sentiment in the Northeast rose 1 point to 48. The West, South and Midwest were unchanged at 75, 67 and 66, respectively.

 ,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"The U.S. economic expansion will last at least another two years, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters who also forecast growth will not accelerate the way the Trump administration has predicted. The recovery from the devastating 2007-2009 financial crisis has been unusually lengthy. The latest growth stretch has already lasted 96 months, and if the poll predictions come true it would mark the longest economic expansion in more than 150 years. Growth has still not picked up as quickly as thought recently, leading forecasters to lower expectations again slightly in the poll of more than 100 economists taken Aug. 7-10. Still, the U.S. expansion has more than two years to go, according to 34 of 57 economists who answered an additional question on the business cycle. Of those economists, 21 said it would last two to three years and 13 said more than three years. ""Expansions don't go on forever,"" said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo, who said there was another two to three years to go. ""Steady, moderate growth looks like it could stay in place for a while."" The remaining 23 respondents said the expansion would only last one to two years. None of the economists, based in the United States, Canada and Europe, expected it to end within a year. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration aims to boost annual growth to 3 percent, mainly through sweeping tax cuts. But with the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, significant fiscal stimulus appears less likely and the economy has shown no signs of accelerating to meet that target. Predictions pointed to continued sluggish average growth in the current economic cycle compared with previous cycles of this length, based on National Bureau of Economic Research data. GDP likely grew at a 2.6 percent annualized pace in the second quarter, down from 2.7 percent in the July poll. But the trend has yet to break away from roughly 2 percent. The latest poll suggests 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent growth each quarter to the end of next year, slightly down from the 2.2 percent to 2.5 percent predicted the previous month. But growth has not been that steady during this expansion and generally is not in any economy. The modest outlook was still broadly explained by slower spending due to sluggish wage growth even though the economy is close to full employment. Expectations for tax cuts from the Trump administration are also fading. While that has not deterred U.S. stock markets, which have been setting record highs all year, it has pushed the dollar down nearly 9 percent against a basket of currencies. Inflation forecasts have remained lukewarm, with the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, the core PCE price index, not expected to reach the central bank's 2 percent target until the final quarter of 2018. Core PCE inflation was forecast to average 1.5 percent to 1.6 percent each quarter from here until the end of 2017. Despite that subdued inflation outlook, the Fed is still expected to announce steps to start shrinking its more than $4 trillion balance sheet in September, according to 94 of 100 economists in the Reuters poll. Five respondents said the announcement would be some time in the final three months of this year and one said early next year. The poll also predicted the Fed would raise interest rates by 25 basis points in October or December, taking the fed funds rate to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent. The Fed is expected to follow up with three more rate hikes of the same amount in 2018. ""What the Fed is doing right now is saying the healthy economy combined with strong financial conditions more than make up for the disappointment in inflation,"" said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. ""They are very likely to announce their balance sheet shrinkage in September and see better-than-even odds they will even hike in December."" When asked if the Fed should start shrinking its balance sheet before inflation hits its target, 55 of 62 economists said ""yes."" ""Yes, they need to lower the balance sheet given emergency conditions are absent,"" said Wells Fargo's Bullard. But not everyone agrees. Some economists worry the envisioned pace of Fed tightening could hurt the economy, especially given the anemic nature of the recovery. ""Clearly the idea here is to get ready for the end of the (economic) cycle,"" said Harris. ""In my view, hiking now so you can cut later is not the right way to think about it. You hike late so you can hike more. Because (if) you get inflation higher, then the hikes aren't that painful to the economy.""

Shawn M. Carter,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"With rising health care costs, economic uncertainty and escalating rhetoric, as well as rising tensions between the United States and North Korea, now is an excellent time to start or continue saving for an emergency. Having an emergency fund could be essential in the case of job loss or an unexpected crisis, whether personal or political. ""It's not just about the economy,"" Suze Orman, financial expert and former CNBC host, said at a June 12 eMerge Americas conference in Miami. ""What if you get sick? What if you're hit by a car? What if something happens crazy in this world?"" ""We live in the craziest world I've ever seen in my life right now, and the only way you can take craziness out is for you to make yourself secure."" However, many Americans aren't textbook financially secure. A 2016 GOBankingRates survey pegs 69 percent as having less than $1,000 in total savings and 34 percent as having no savings at all. That's a far cry from what experts suggest you should have saved. To cover necessary expenses such as food and housing, LearnVest sets a goal of three, six or nine months of savings. Orman suggests saving even more. ""You need as much money in the bank that makes you feel secure,"" she says. It could take eight to 12 months of savings to cover unexpected expenses or extended unemployment. Putting away small amounts of money on a regular basis, as opposed to large amounts sporadically, can help build an emergency fund over time, according to a Vanguard emergency savings guide. Try automating your savings so that money transfers over directly from your paycheck, and then increasing the amount of those transfers gradually over time. ""This should happen before you accelerate any other financial goals, like paying more than the minimum owed on your credit cards, fast-tracking your student loan repayment or saving for the down payment on your future dream home,"" suggests LearnVest. Self-made millionaire David Bach agrees: His famous advice is that you pay yourself first. Save one hour's worth of income each day, he says. ""If you're not saving that much of your income right now, you are working too much for others and not enough for yourself."" You don't have to get distracted by suggestions that you buy gold or Bitcoin. Likewise, placing your money in mutual funds, stocks or other vehicles intended to be long-term investments could lead to loss of value if you need to withdraw quickly. Instead, the money you save should, ideally, go into a safe, interest-earning bank account that can be accessed without triggering taxes or penalties, Wells Fargo says. While Americans as a whole say they don't have much money in savings, new Bankrate data shows millennials aren't that bad off. Seventy-two percent say they have at least some money saved, as opposed to 64 percent of baby boomers. Overall, ""Americans are working on improving their financial habits,"" reports CNBC Make It's Ester Bloom. ""Most Americans now have emergency savings. Thirty-one percent have enough to cover six months' of living expenses — up from 22 percent in 2015 and 28 percent last year — which is the highest that rate has been in seven years. ""And 68 percent now have at least something saved."" Experts from across the aisle would probably agree that, especially now, an emergency savings plan is a wise investment.

Over the past year, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has done its best to contain the fallout from recent scandals that have cast the once-revered bank in a disturbingly menacing light. Its moves up until now, however, have been inadequate, as the damage to its reputation continues to pile up. But it seems as though the leadership at Wells Fargo may be starting to appreciate the magnitude of the damage done to its brand. Rumors began circulating this week that the bank will soon replace the newly appointed chairman of its board of directors, a guy by the name of Stephen Sanger, who led General Mills, a packaged-food producer and distributor, from 1995 until 2008. The Wells Fargo stagecoach is in disrepair. Image source: Getty Images. Sanger became chairman last year after its former chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, retired under pressure following revelations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that the bank had opened as many as 2 million accounts for customers without the customers' approval and often knowledge to do so. However, not unlike other things Wells Fargo has done of late, there's more to Sanger's potential retirement than meets the eye. Namely, Sanger has to relinquish the chairmanship next year anyhow, because that's when he'll reach the bank's mandatory retirement age for members of the board. It's an empty gesture, in other words. In law, it's akin to a contract without consideration. To be fair, Sanger will allegedly step down before actually reaching the mandatory retirement age. But if Wells Fargo thinks cutting its chairman's tenure short by a few months will assuage regulators and show sufficient repentance for the bank's growing pattern of malfeasance, one would be excused for questioning its leaders' strategy and judgment. Ever since Wells Fargo came into being during the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, its name has been associated with trust. Gold miners trusted it to transport and store their gold. Later, after transitioning away from stagecoaches and into banking, millions of people trusted it to act as an honest and secure steward of their savings. The California-based bank more than earned this trust over a century and a half by giving its customers a safe port through the many financial storms that have struck along the way. This dates all the way back to the Panic of 1855, just a few years after the bank was founded. The panic was set off by a drought that made it impossible to placer mine for gold. And it ended in the failure of every other major stagecoach line, but Wells Fargo. More recently, its prudent approach to risk management enabled it to not only survive the financial crisis of 2008, but also to thrive through it, ultimately more than doubling its size by purchasing the ailing Wachovia. Sadly, all of this is now water under the bridge. Wells Fargo's reputation for being a trustworthy steward of its customers' money began to suffer after the CFPB's revelation last year. And it has gotten worse since then, as other units of the bank have been caught doing similar things. The latest revelations come from the bank itself. They involve illicit sales of collateral protection insurance, or CPI. In short, if you get a car loan from Wells Fargo, you have to maintain insurance on the car. If you don't, Wells Fargo will purchase insurance on your behalf and charge you for it. This is done, understandably, to protect the car's collateral value. But the problem was that Wells Fargo charged 490,000 customers for CPI even though they carried adequate insurance. And ""for approximately 20,000 customers, the additional costs of the CPI could have contributed to a default that resulted in the repossession of their vehicle,"" according to the bank. To make matters worse, the bank didn't discontinue the program until last September -- the same month its fake-account scandal came to light. It seems fair to presume that Wells Fargo may not have discontinued the illicit practice had the bank not been caught with its hand in another cookie jar. Through this whole time, moreover, when millions of fake accounts were being created for customers and hundreds of thousands of other customers were being charged for services that they shouldn't have been, Sanger sat on Wells Fargo's board of directors. In fact, he was its lead independent director. At some point, the bank needs to make genuine amends. And cutting a few months off its chairman's otherwise expiring tenure doesn't seem to get the job done -- particularly when Sanger observed all of this from the boardroom equivalence of the on-deck circle. The need for a more genuine gesture is not just for Wells Fargo's customers; it's also for the bank's employees and shareholders. They deserve to be led and represented by ethical leaders who are committed in both words and deeds to ethical behavior. After all, as the men and women who ran Wells Fargo years ago proved through more than a century and a half, its single most important competitive advantage has always been its stakeholders' trust.

John Maxfield,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. One of the most visible bank analysts is out with a bold prediction. Mike Mayo, who recently joined Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) from CLSA Americas, predicts that shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C) could double in four to five years. It's a bold call. And it could happen. But is it reasonable for investors to expect it to? Probably not. Mayo's logic is twofold. In the first case, he sees Citigroup's profitability improving meaningfully over the next few years. Its return on average common equity over the past six quarters has fluctuated between 6.2% and 7.4%. Mayo sees this climbing to about 9% in 2019, and then to 11% in 2021. Data source: Citigroup. Chart by author. On top of this, Mayo sees the bank buying back as much as a third of its outstanding common stock over the next five years. In this year's stress test -- here are the results -- the Federal Reserve approved Citigroup's request to buy back $15.6 billion worth of stock between now and the end of the second quarter of 2018. That equates to about 8.5% of its current market cap. If you multiply that by five, you get 43%, or a little more than the third predicted by Mayo. This is a bold call by Mayo because it's complete guesswork. Trying to predict Citigroup's profitability next year is all but impossible. Doing so five years would require a magic eight ball to even get in the ballpark. And the same is true for buybacks. There's no telling what the economy will do between now and then, which would impact share repurchases. There's also no telling what Citigroup's valuation will do between now and then, which would impact their efficacy. This is the single most complicated bank in the United States. It's nothing like Wells Fargo, for example, a conventional domestic lender with a much more predictable stream of revenue from its massive loan portfolio. As a universal bank, Citigroup not only has substantial Wall Street operations, which yield a notoriously volatile revenue stream, but its entire business model is predicated on serving as a global bank with operations and exposure that reach around the world. The Citigroup Center in New York City. Image source: Getty Images. To put all of this in perspective, when I think and talk about the nation's biggest banks -- those like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo -- I don't even include Citigroup in the discussion. It's just too unique. On top of this, or perhaps as a result of it, Citigroup has almost invariably found itself smack dab in the middle of every major financial crisis since and including the Great Depression. Its actions in the 1920s were the primary impetus for the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, separating investment and commercial banking operations. It came within a hair's breadth of failure during the less-developed loans crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. And, of course, it wouldn't have survived the financial crisis but for multiple bailouts from the federal government. The point being: While Citigroup is an incredibly important financial institution, and one of our oldest, it's silly for anyone that knows anything about banks to go out on a limb and proclaim that its stock will double in four to five years. It makes for good headlines, but isn't grounded in reality. ","

 ,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Since 2000, Michael Turner has been at the helm of Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc (NASDAQ:PNFP) which has grown to a market capitalization of USD$4.85B. Turner’s total compensation over the past year stood at $2,848,522. An executive receiving a large part of compensation through stocks is considered more aligned with shareholder expectations of strong total returns — the reason behind a vast majority of S&P companies opting for performance-based stock grants with stock-based compensation accounting for nearly 60% of the overall payouts in 2015. Maximum CEO Comp = (0.5% * Net Income + 0.03% * Market Cap)  Executive compensation has been a controversial subject due to its historically non-transparent nature and the influence of executive management over the board, which is set up to uphold shareholders’ interests. Higher transparency resulting from new financial regulations have forced companies to disclose its executive remuneration structure in detail, offering investors some information around the appropriateness of this expense. Above is a simple equation I use to determine whether the compensation of S&P500 CEOs are paid at the appropriate level compared to the rest of the market. Using the equation with PNFP’s data, the output tells us that its CEO compensation is acceptable. This means that Pinnacle Financial Partners is not paying its CEO too much compared to how much net income was generate last year, and relative to other CEOs in companies with a similar market cap. Salary paid by Pinnacle Financial Partners to the CEO seems slightly out of line compared to market standards, though growth in compensation isn’t completely incongruous with the company’s EPS performance. Although CEO remuneration can be a useful sign for the alignment between a company’s CEO and its performance, it is certainly not sufficient to base your investment decision solely on this factor.

The headquarters of Pinnacle Financial Partners in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. Image source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. Pinnacle Financial Partners (NASDAQ:PNFP) offers a compelling story about how to grow a bank in a rapid and responsible way. The secret to its success has been its unique approach to organic growth, catalyzed by a series of acquisitions that it's made over the past dozen years. Since Terry Turner and two fellow executives from a previous bank founded Pinnacle 17 years ago, its balance sheet has grown from a figment of their imaginations to just under $21 billion in assets today. An investment in Pinnacle's stock at its initial public offering in 2000 has increased in value by a factor of 13.3. Only one other bank can boast a better return over this span. In this way, Pinnacle has proven to be an exception to the rule that ""if it's growing like a weed, it probably is one,"" as former Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) CEO Dick Kovacevich was known to say. The Nashville, Tennessee-based bank's principal strategy revolves around recruiting experienced bankers from larger regional banks, who then bring their books of business over to Pinnacle. ""When you hire people with experience, a large book of business, and who know their clients extremely well, they're able to move that book of business from where they are to us, which creates rapid growth,"" says Turner. ""It also creates great asset quality. These are people they've banked for a long time and know what's going on with them. So, if they do have bad credits, they leave them behind, which is sort of the opposite of adverse selection."" Pinnacle Financial Partners co-founder and CEO Terry Turner (left) with BNC Bancorp CEO Rick Callicutt (right) discussing the merger of their banks earlier this year. Image source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. An important catalyst for Pinnacle has been the consolidation wave that's washed over the bank industry since the 1980s. As Turner says: To be a client-facing person in a large regional bank is a difficult experience. It's particularly difficult if you're in an outpost market far from headquarters. It's a bureaucratic deal. You have to get your credits approved by someone outside the market. Those people don't know you, they don't know your clients, and they're not involved in any sort of strategic decisions. So it's disempowering and disengaging for a generally prideful group of people who know how to take care of clients and who want to participate in the firm. Turner and his co-founders, chairman of the board Rob McCabe and chief administrative officer Hugh Queener, speak from experience. They were executives at Nashville's last major bank, First American Corp., when it was bought in 1999 by a larger out-of-state rival, which in turn was bought by an even larger bank, where it resides today as part of Regions Financial (NYSE:RF). The buyout presented ""a great opportunity because First American was the last large, locally owned bank in Nashville,"" says Turner. ""We had market share data over an extended period of time showing that small, locally owned banks were taking share from larger regional banks, which were tied up in consolidation and dealing with all the difficulties that go with that."" This insight has influenced just about every aspect of Pinnacle's business model from the start, informing its culture, compensation, and risk management systems, as well as the characteristics of bankers it seeks to ""lift out"" of the regional banks it competes against. It's hard to come away from a conversation with Turner without believing that he genuinely views Pinnacle's culture as a competitive advantage. ""When I talk to most analysts and institutional investors about [culture], their eyes glaze over and they want me to get to the real stuff,"" says Turner. ""But that is the real stuff. We've bet the whole farm on this strategy."" Rob McCabe, co-founder and chairman of the board of Pinnacle Financial Partners. Image source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. ""There's a broad reputation among bankers that it would be a good thing to have the opportunity to work at Pinnacle,"" says Turner. ""We're able to leverage that to source and recruit and hire and onboard and retain a large number of the best and most productive revenue producers in our markets."" Pinnacle requires 10 years of experience at another bank for revenue-producing positions. It also won't give jobs to people who submit unsolicited applications or are circulating resumes. ""That group of people, we believed, were either unhappy or unsuccessful where they were, and we'd just as soon let them stay there,"" says Turner. ""That sounds trite, but it's an important building block in what we've done here."" To work at Pinnacle ""someone here will say: 'Hey, I worked with this person before, and they're good and they share our values.' So we set about recruiting those people,"" says Turner. ""Most of them are happy where they are, so it can take a long time to recruit them. We have people here that we chased for seven years."" The proof is in the pudding. Three of Pinnacle's highest-profile hires over the past few years include a former Tennessee state president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT), the former head of the capital market's origination group at SunTrust Bank (NYSE:STI), and the former head of private banking in Memphis at First Horizon Corp. (NYSE:FHN). An important advantage of this approach is that it reduces turnover. In Pinnacle's first 15 years, it lost only two revenue producers to other banks, while dozens came the other way. ""What we said is: How do you retain 95% of your people? And the answer is that you need to hire the right type of people,"" says Turner. ""So the experience level was not only important in terms of how we matched up against competitors, but also for how it drove turnover out of the system, which was part of the original design."" ""If you're at a regional bank, they're typically running some type of call program, expecting you to make a certain number of client calls a month,"" Turner continues. ""Here we don't do that. We turn people loose to get clients, know them well, and meet their needs."" Hugh Queener, co-founder and chief administrative officer at Pinnacle Financial Partners. Image source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. Another advantage of Pinnacle's focus on recruiting experienced and high-performing bankers -- the average revenue producer at Pinnacle has 33 years of experience -- is that it has enabled the bank to use a less cumbersome control system. ""[Our] credit approval process isn't burdened with bureaucracy,"" says Turner. He went on to explain that Pinnacle runs a signature system to approve loans, not a committee system: I've believed from the founding of this company that when something is everybody's job, it's nobody's job. So, I don't find the committee system to be particularly good for credit approval. If it looks like the person who chairs that committee likes a credit, then you like it. If it looks like he doesn't like it, then you don't like it. There's really no value to the committee. All it does is burden and slow down the process. The idea of a signature system is that a lender and their manager can do $1 million. And then generally the two of them and a senior credit officer can do $10 million. That group of three is always proximate to each other, so they can reach a decision in short order for a $10 million credit, which covers the vast majority of transactions that we do. That speed is important. Flexibility is also important. Again, because of our experienced workforce, we're able to make appropriate exceptions. If you're in a big company, you have to lay down bright-line rules that people need to follow. We do surveys where we ask employees to tell us what they like, what they don't like, and anything else. The most frequent answer in terms of what they like is that there isn't micromanagement. Pinnacle doesn't have an entirely pristine track record in this regard. It reported annual losses in 2009 and 2010, stemming primarily from construction and development loans that went into default following the financial crisis. But those loans came from banks it acquired in 2005 and 2007, which lent to residential developers on the outskirts of Nashville during the housing bubble. In other words, the losses had nothing to do with Pinnacle's credit approval process or lending standards, which is consistent with Turner's confidence in a less-bureaucratic credit approval process. Pinnacle's organic growth strategy has been effective, yet it accounts for only about half (44%) of the $21 billion on Pinnacle's balance sheet. The other half (56%) came by way of six acquisitions. Acquisitions by Pinnacle Financial Partners Assets Date Announced BNC Bancorp $7.4 billion January 2017 Avenue Financial Holdings $1.2 billion January 2016 Magna Bank $589 million April 2015 CapitalMark Bank & Trust $968 million April 2015 Mid-America Bancshares $1.1 billion August 2007 Cavalry Bancorp $605 million September 2005 Data source: Pinnacle Financial Partners. Pinnacle's first two acquisitions, the ones in 2005 and 2007, added to its presence in Nashville. But since then, with one exception, Pinnacle has used acquisitions to expand to new markets. It purchased a pair of banks in 2015 for footholds in Chattanooga and Memphis. And it bought BNC Bancorp earlier this year, nearly doubling Pinnacle's balance sheet and taking it for the first time outside of Tennessee, to the Carolinas and Virginia. The BNC deal more than any other previous acquisition will test Pinnacle's ability to inoculate its culture into banks located further afield, as it's done successfully with smaller in-state acquisitions. On the same day Pinnacle bought Magna Bank in Memphis, for example, it brought in a team of eight bankers from First Horizon Corp., the parent company of First Tennessee Bank. The head of that team had been the leader of First Horizon's Memphis-based private banking group. It remains to be seen if Pinnacle can replicate this success without the home-field advantage of attracting Tennessee bankers to a Tennessee bank, but the early signs are auspicious. After BNC had previously struggled to recruit experienced commercial lenders away from larger regional banks, it has already brought in six just since its acquisition by Pinnacle was announced in January. ""I don't know many banks that are able to make meaningful hires while they're changing the flag,"" says Turner. ""It's indicative of what our opportunity is and what we can do over there.""

"Matthew DiLallo, Tim Brugger, and Brian Stoffel",08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Income is the lifeblood of retirement, but by definition, once you quit working, your income will be coming from new sources -- like your portfolio. To cover your needs, you could regularly sell some assets, but for a number of reasons, many retirees don't see that as the most appealing option. That's why so many seek out high-yield dividend investments that provide steady streams of cash flow to their owners. One difficulty with that strategy, though, is that many of those options carry higher levels of risk -- which is the bane of the retiree's portfolio. The trick, then, is to find high-yield investments that moderate that risk. It isn't easy, but there are several excellent choices. One of the best is to buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that also sports a high yield, because these investments tend to spread out their bets -- and diversification reduces risk. We asked a trio of Foolish investors to pick their favorites in that category, and to explain why they recommend them. Their choices: iShares Preferred Stock Index ETF (NASDAQ:PFF), iShares Residential-Real Estate (NYSEMKT:REZ), and Vanguard REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:VNQ). Image source: Getty Images. Matt DiLallo (Vanguard REIT ETF): Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a great place to find high yields because these companies must distribute 90% of their earnings each year to investors. That said, with so many REITs to choose from, picking one can be a daunting task. That's why REIT ETFs are a great option because they're a one-stop shop for investing in the sector. One of the best of them, in my opinion, is the Vanguard REIT ETF, in part because its expense ratio is 90% lower than funds with similar holdings. Those fees can really add up. As the following chart shows, the Vanguard REIT ETF currently sport a significantly higher yields than the similar iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:ICF) and SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:RWR). VNQ Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts Over time, that yield differential can have a noticeable impact on an investor's total return. For example, let's assume that a $10,000 investment in a REIT ETF generates a 9% annualized return over the next decade. That hypothetical investment in an average fund with a 1.24% expense ratio would result in an investor paying $2,777 in fees over that 10-year period. Meanwhile, investors in the Vanguard REIT ETF would only pay $283 in fees. That makes the Vanguard REIT ETF a top-notch high-yield buy. Tim Brugger (iShares Preferred Stock Index ETF): Preferred stocks are a sometimes overlooked investment alternative, but there are several upsides to them, particularly for retirees in search of predictable income. Preferred stock holders generally don't have voting rights; however, owners of preferred stock are entitled to dividend payouts before common shareholders, and those dividends -- certainly in the case of iShares Preferred Stock Index -- are akin to those one would get from a high-yield bond. The iShares ETF differentiates itself from its peers in several ways: It's been around for over 10 years, its dividend yield is 5.6%, and with an asset management fee of just 0.46%, it is one of the least expensive around. That minimal fee means more of your funds are used to generate income rather than pay overhead, and the difference can be substantial. With nearly $19 billion in assets that track the S&P 500 preferred stock index, the iShares Preferred Stock Index ETF is well diversified. For some perspective, its top holdings are two series of preferred stock from Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) with a $775 million combined ownership stake, yet they account for just 4.16% of the portfolio. In addition to its impressive yield, it rarely undergoes wild swings in value. For example, in the past year, the iShares Preferred Stock Index ETF's share price has traded within a narrow range of $36.69 to a high of $40.34 a share. Minimal risk, outstanding income, and industry-low fees make this ETF a great alternative for retirees in search of income. Image source: Getty Images. Brian Stoffel (iShares Residential Real-Estate): The trouble with ETFs that invest in dividend-paying stocks is that they are often very popular. That leads investors to bid up the price of ETF shares, thus lowering the relative payout. The secret, then, lies in finding under-followed ETFs that have exposure to stocks with large and reliable dividends. In iShares Residential-Real Estate, we have an ETF that fits the bill. By buying shares, you get exposure to three key real estate segments in America: residential, healthcare, and storage. While many are worried about a slowdown in the real estate market right now, that has more to do with lack of supply than demand, which is good news for the companies that this ETF invests in. To give you an idea, the ETF's three largest holdings   -- which account for 25% of its portfolio -- are Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) and its eponymous storage locations; Avalon Bay Communities (NYSE:AVB) with its 75,000 apartment units across both New England and the West Coast; and Welltower (NYSE:WELL) and its network of senior and assisted living houses that are expected to experience booming demand as more and more baby boomers retire. Currently yielding 4.6%, I believe this ETF deserves consideration as part of a well-balanced portfolio for any income-focused investor. ","

Image source: Getty Images While participation in a 401(k) is important, even more important is the free money employees can receive in the form of matching contributions. Among employees who participate in their 401(k)s, about 21% -- or roughly 1 in 5 -- don't contribute enough to receive the full employer match, according to a study by Alight Solutions. So if your company matches up to 6% of your gross annual pay and you're only contributing 3%, that could amount to a lot of free money each year you're missing out on. Three percent may not seem like much money, so it's tempting to think that by not maxing out your employer matching contributions, you're not missing much. But that money adds up quickly. To see these numbers in action, let's look at a hypothetical example. Say your company matches 100% of your contributions up to 3% of your annual gross pay and that you're earning a salary of $50,000 per year. Let's also say right now you're contributing 2%, or $1,000, per year to your 401(k). Assuming you don't make any changes to your saving or investing strategy, here's what your total 401(k) contributions will look like if you continue saving 2% and if you bump up your savings rate to 3%: Chart by author. Note that these calculations don't include any return on your investments -- they're simply the contributions you and your employer are making. So although in this example you're only contributing an extra $500 each year, that relatively small number can amount to a $40,000 difference over a lifetime. The difference is even more pronounced if your company offers a better match or you're earning a higher salary. For example, if your company offers to match 100% of your contributions up to 6% of your annual pay and you're earning $80,000 per year, that's $4,800 per year in free money that is just waiting to be added to your 401(k). If you know you're not earning as much as you could be, how can you start saving more? It's best to take a gradual approach and make saving a habit. Start by setting up automatic deposits into your 401(k). Most employers will allow you to set money from your paycheck aside before it even reaches you, which makes saving easier. If you're struggling to save, start small by setting aside 1% of your yearly income to put toward your 401(k). Once you start earning more (or cutting back to trim your expenses), bump your savings goal up to 2%, then 3%. And when you do reach your employer match, give yourself a pat on the back and keep pushing yourself to save more. In 2017 the maximum amount you can contribute to a 401(k) is $18,000 (or $24,000 if you're 50 or older), so you can't go wrong with saving a few extra dollars here and there. If you're fortunate enough to have an employer who matches 401(k) contributions, it's wise to take advantage of it. While a 1% difference may not seem like a lot of money, it can make all the different come retirement time. ","

You don't want to send your creditors any more of your hard-earned cash than you have to, so it's worth taking a look at both whether you're being charged common fees that cardholders pay and whether there's anything you can do to avoid these fees. Here are six of the most common credit card fees that you should be on the lookout for -- along with some tips to stop sending your creditors this extra cash. If you have a card with an annual fee, one of your best options is to call the card issuer and ask to have the fee reduced or waived. When cardholders called their creditors to negotiate a lower fee, more than 8 in 10 were successful: 31% of callers were able to reduce the annual fee, and 51% were able to get the fee waived entirely. If your card issuer won't budge and the fee is high, you could close your account -- but be aware that this could adversely impact your credit score by reducing your available credit and lowering your average account age. You can mitigate the damage by making sure you have other open cards with a lot of available credit so you don't get penalized for a high credit utilization ratio. Almost every card -- 99 out of 100 -- charges a late payment fee if you don't get your bill paid on time. Late payment fees were capped at $37 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2015, but lenders were allowed to raise the fee to $38 in 2016. Just 18 of the creditors kept to the $37 max fees, while the rest who charged a late fee bumped it up to $38. Paying either $37 or $38 just for not getting a payment in on time is a huge waste of money. To avoid this, set up an autopay from your bank account for at least the minimum due on your card every month. While paying your balance in full is always best, you may not want to set up an auto-debit of the full balance due unless you're confident you'll always have enough cash in your bank account to cover it. But, if you at least auto-debit the minimum, you won't have to worry about getting hit with a late charge. If you do get assessed a late fee, you can also call your creditor and ask to have it waived. Almost 90% of cardholders who asked for a waiver of their late fees were successful. Of course, your card issuer is much more likely to work with you if the late fee is a one-off, rather than a pattern of behavior. Cash advance fees -- fees charged for getting cash from your credit card issuer -- were charged by 98 out of 100 cards. These fees are often the greater of $10 or 5% of the cash advance amount.  You will probably also be charged a higher interest rate if you take a cash advance than the interest you pay when you charge items on your card . To avoid cash advance fees, don't take a cash advance. You'll also want to read your agreement with your card issuer to find out if you can be charged a cash advance fee for buying ""cash equivalents,"" or items like money orders that could easily be converted into cash. If so, avoid these purchases as well. Personal loans from banks are often much less expensive than a cash advance if you need to borrow cash you don't have. Out of 100 cards, 76 charged a fee for balance transfers. A balance transfer allows you to move money from one card to another. Typically, fees are equal to the greater of 3% of the total balance transferred or a set minimum of around $5 to $10 per transfer. If you are transferring money from a high interest credit card to a low interest card -- like a card that charges you 0% for a set period of time -- paying the balance transfer fee might make financial sense. But, if you can avoid this fee, you'll be even better off. You can try simply asking your cardholder to waive the balance transfer fee, as six out of ten cards charging fees -- including cards offered by Wells Fargo and Chase -- waived or reduced this fee for new cardholders. You can also shop around for balance transfer offers that do not require you to pay a fee. Foreign transaction fees have become rarer, with just 56 out of 100 cards now charging a foreign transaction fee compared with 77 cards that charged this type of fee in 2015. If your card does charge a fee, the fee could add 3% or more to any foreign charge. That's a big fee, especially if you spend a few thousand dollars on your European vacation. And, you could pay this fee while you're still on American soil if you make purchases online from overseas merchants. To avoid this fee, you'll have to use a credit card that does not charge it, like one of the many credit cards targeted toward travelers. Otherwise, skip using your credit card when you're abroad and consider alternatives like travelers checks. A returned payment fee was charged by 80 out of 100 cards and was usually around $37, so you'll pay a hefty sum if you send a check to pay off your credit card bill and that check bounces. To avoid these fees, consider making online credit card payments, which are usually deducted from your account within a day or two. You can check your bank account balance before sending the payment to make sure you have the cash to cover it. You could also balance your checkbook to make sure you have money to cover the checks you write, or keep a cushion in your checking account so you aren't in danger of bouncing a check. The good news is, by following these tips for avoiding fees, you should be able to keep more of your cash in your accounts -- instead of sending it to creditors -- so you'll have a better cushion to avoid bounced checks and hopefully won't have to worry about this big returned check fee.

    Tips to Avoid the 6 Biggest Credit Card Fees -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The definition of portfolio management is the act of making investment decisions for an investment portfolio, either for oneself or someone else, in order to meet an investor's goals. Portfolio managers determine appropriate asset allocation, select investments, take steps to mitigate risk, and perform periodic portfolio maintenance. Portfolio management refers to the act of making decisions about an investment portfolio. And while there are numerous activities that could be a part of managing an investment portfolio, these are some of the main portfolio management activities: Portfolio management generally refers to these activities done by a professional, although many individuals choose to manage their own investments. Effectively managing your own portfolio requires a thorough understanding of investment instruments such as stocks and bonds, as well as the time needed to properly research investment choices and to perform maintenance activities such as rebalancing. Image source: Getty Images. A major step in the portfolio management process involves determining an appropriate asset allocation strategy -- that is, how much of your portfolio should be in stocks and how much should be invested in fixed-income investments or bonds. You can read our thorough discussion of asset allocation, but the general idea is that while stocks have the best potential for long-term returns, they also have the most short-term volatility, making them most suitable for younger investors. Fixed-income investments don't have quite as much return potential, but also tend to be less volatile and can create a steady income stream, making them more appropriate for older investors. One general rule of thumb is that if you take your age and subtract it from 110, you can determine an appropriate stock allocation, as a percentage of your portfolio's assets. For example, if you're 40, this implies that 70% of your assets should be invested in stocks, with the rest in bonds. Once the appropriate asset allocation has been determined, the next step in portfolio management is to start thinking about which investments to choose. As an example, if you determine that a portfolio with a 70% stock allocation is appropriate for you, a passive strategy might include investing in an S&P 500 index fund, a small-cap stock index fund, and a foreign stock index fund -- or a target-date fund, which can not only passively invest your money but also adjusts your asset allocation over time, could be a good choice. On the other hand, an active management strategy might involve selecting 15-20 individual stocks to invest in or simply a handful of actively managed mutual funds. While it's impossible to completely avoid risk when investing, one of the major objectives of portfolio management is to mitigate your risk. Systematic risk can be mitigated by practicing smart asset allocation strategies and by choosing some investments that help to offset systematic risk. For example, allocating some of your bond investments to inflation-protected bonds can help reduce your inflation risk. Choosing some stock investments that have a low beta, or low volatility, can help mitigate the risk associated with market crashed. Or, if you want to lower the risk of interest rates rising, you could create a bond ladder with your fixed-income investments. On the other hand, diversifying your investments is the best way to mitigate your unsystematic risk. In other words, if Apple only makes up a small portion of your portfolio, it won't be devastating if iPhone sales come in weaker than expected. Investing in mutual funds or ETFs can be an effective way of diversifying, as can choosing a portfolio of a dozen or more stocks that operate in a variety of industries. Finally, it's important to realize that portfolio management is truly an ongoing process. For one thing, you'll need to properly allocate your new investment capital over time and make sure that your portfolio remains well diversified. Also, you'll need to check on your portfolio over time to make sure it's still properly allocated and make changes if necessary, a concept known as rebalancing. Here's why this is so important. Consider a simplified example of a portfolio that contains four stocks -- for instance, Apple, ExxonMobil, Wells Fargo, and Berkshire Hathaway -- each of which initially makes up 25% of the portfolio. Let's say that over the next year, Apple doubles in price, while the other three stocks stay right where they are. If this happens, Apple will now make up 40% of the portfolio, while the other three will only account for 20% each. In other words, your investment portfolio's performance is now highly dependent on Apple, so it would be a good idea to sell some of the position and add to the other three to rebalance your investments. As I mentioned, this was a simplified example, but this is an important concept that can prevent your investment performance from becoming too dependent on any single stock, fund, or asset class. If you have the time, knowledge, and desire to manage your own investment portfolio, there's nothing wrong with doing so. If you're lacking in any of these three areas, it can be a smart idea to consult a financial advisor who can create and implement a portfolio management plan for you. ","
      
    What Does Portfolio Management Actually Mean? -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Book value is a measure of the net worth of a company, so it may come as a surprise that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) trades for a premium of roughly 50% to its book value. However, if you understand what book value is and its shortcomings, this discrepancy makes perfect sense. With that in mind, here's the reason why Berkshire is worth more than its book value would lead you to believe. Also referred to as a company's net worth, book value can be easily calculated from a company's balance sheet. Book value is the total value of the company's assets minus its outstanding liabilities. Dividing the book value by the number of outstanding shares of stock gives the book value per share, which investors often use to compare with the company's share price, known as the price-to-book ratio. Image Source: The Motley Fool. Theoretically, book value is the amount of money a company would be left with if it closed its doors, sold all of its assets, and paid off all of its debts. Admittedly, book value isn't perfect -- some of the items on a balance sheet aren't a perfect reflection of asset values, such as depreciation deductions. And many intangible items are difficult, or impossible, to accurately value. Book value is a commonly used metric in value investing, as it tends to give a baseline value of what a company is ""worth."" For example, if you can buy a company's stock for 80% of its book value, it can be a smart value play. However, a company's profitability and future potential also factor into share price, so it's not uncommon for stocks to trade for significantly higher than book value. Wells Fargo, for instance, has historically been one of the most efficient and profitable banks, so it trades for 1.46 times its book value as of this writing. In addition, book value doesn't accurately reflect certain types of intangible assets, such as intellectual property. Therefore, businesses that rely heavily on intellectual property to make products often trade for several times book value, and may still be attractive investments. I consider Apple to be an extremely cheap stock by most valuation methods, but the company trades for about 6.3 times its book value, precisely because of the shortcomings of the book value calculation method. As of the end of 2016, Berkshire's book value per share (Class A shares) was $172,108, while the stock trades for $265,800 as I write this, a premium of roughly 54%. The easy explanation is that the difference is the result of Berkshire's business model that focuses on acquiring entire companies. Here's the (slightly) longer version. Until the 1990s, Berkshire's book value and its stock price were roughly the same. This was because Berkshire's primary focus was investing in marketable securities (stocks), which are regularly revalued when included in the company's book value. It's also worth mentioning that Berkshire's book value and its stock price don't always move in the same direction, or with similar magnitude. For example, in 2016, Berkshire's book value increased by 10.7% while its stock price increased by more than double this rate. Conversely, Berkshire's book value grew by 6.4% in 2015, but its stock price actually fell by 12.5%. Over time, Berkshire's stock price has increased faster than its book value, which makes sense, given the explanation of why Berkshire is worth more than book. Over the 52-year period from 1965 through the end of 2016, Berkshire's book value has increased at an annualized rate of 19%, while its stock price has risen at an even more impressive rate of 20.8%.

Earlier this week, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that nearly every type of active stock-based manager underperformed their respective benchmarks over a 10-year time horizon. Among the categories with the fewest number of alpha-generating managers was small-caps, a part of the market that has typically been considered more friendly to active managers. More detail: Active managers just lost one of their best arguments Active managers have been doing particularly poorly over the past decade given the high level of correlation, which means stocks rise and fall together in response to macroeconomic developments, rather than on their own individual fundamentals. Now, Jacobsen said, equities “have started to march to the beat of their own drummers,” estimating that the 20-day trailing correlation of daily returns for U.S. equities is below 0.2, compared with 0.41 in June 2016. A reading of 1.0 represents perfect correlation, while 0 would mean no correlation at all. As correlations drop, there are signs that short-term performance by active managers has improved. There is also data indicating that broader active outperformance is cyclical, and could be poised for a rebound. According to July data from J.P. Morgan, 53% of equity managers are outperforming thus far this year, compared with just 32% over the same period of 2016. Outperformance could be related to the fund managers investing in a particular size company over another, or by favoring strategic investing styles, like “value” or “growth,” rather than broad holdings. According to data from Wells Fargo, while only 30% of core large-cap managers outperformed their index in the first half of 2017, 68% of large-cap value managers and 51% of growth managers did so. Similar results were seen for mid-cap and small-cap categories. In a particularly strong divergence, only 17% of core mid-cap managers outperformed their index, while 62% of mid-cap growth funds outperformed. Read an interview with investing icon Burton Malkiel, one of the first advocate of passive investing Jacobsen disputed the idea that dispersion was behind the aggregate outperformance, saying that lower correlations only “weakly” correlate with better performance by active mangers. This view was corroborated by Jim Rowley, a senior investment strategist in Vanguard’s investment strategy group. “I say current conditions are ‘no more, no less’ challenging [for active management outperformance] because current dispersion levels look to be pretty normal relative to those in the past, even as passive market share has grown,” he wrote in a report. Rowley suggest there was a place for active management, noting that historically speaking, more than 60% of index components either outperform or underperform the underlying index by at least 10 percentage points. “I would argue that represents a pretty decent opportunity set,” he said. “Of course, dispersion is a measure of how extreme returns are relative to those of the index in either direction. Therefore, the opportunity for larger outperformance must be weighed against the equivalent opportunity for larger underperformance.” And of course, investors need to be in the right actively managed fund to take advantage of any outperformance. However, identifying the right fund ahead of time is so difficult that Jeffrey Ptak, global director of manager research for Morningstar, recently wrote it “belongs in what Warren Buffett has called the ‘too hard’ pile.” The solution for investors, then, isn’t choosing between active and passive funds, but instead opting for a diverse portfolio, Jacobsen said. “Lower correlations among stocks mean investors may benefit from a more broadly diversified equity portfolio, rather than benefiting only from getting the sector or theme du jour correct,” he wrote to clients.

Ryan Vlastelica,08172017,MarketWatch,08102017,"Published: Aug 16, 2017 10:44 a.m. ET Bitcoin has more than doubled over the past 30 days, meeting one analyst’s definition of a bubble By If you’ve heard about the massive gains being enjoyed by bitcoin recently, then googled the digital currency to see what all the fuss is about, some of the cryptocurrency’s investors may want to thank you. Bitcoin prices show a notably high correlation with Google search trends for the word “bitcoin,” according to Chris Burniske, a bitcoin expert who was previously a blockchain analyst at ARK Invest. In a series of recent tweets, Burniske speculated that an increasing price drives the kind of interest in bitcoin that sends people looking for information about it online, and “that interest further drives the price of $BTC,” something he joked was “a virtuous Satoshi cycle,” in reference to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the mysterious creator, or creators, of bitcoin. Such a correlation seems to be unique to bitcoin, which is increasingly followed by investors but remains a small and thinly traded asset relative to stocks or bonds.

See a chart of the biggest digital currencies in the world Bitcoin’s rally has been among the strongest gains seen of any asset in 2017, although Ether—bitcoin’s chief rival, which runs on the Ethereum network—has soared more than 3,800%. According to Google trends, the search term “bitcoin” is reaching peak popularity in August 2017, while searches for “ethereum” have tapered off. (Bitcoin is in blue in the following chart.) The growth in bitcoin this year has come alongside growing interest in overall cryptocurrencies, as well as increased regulatory interest and public debates over how it can manage at its current size. Recently, a new digital currency—called Bitcoin Cash—erupted out of the original version to more rapidly process transactions in larger units, an issue related to bitcoin “scability.” The gains have been so large that major Wall Street banks have started to weigh in on the nascent sector. Both Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs recently published primers on bitcoin for their clients, while one Morgan Stanley analyst called it a poster child for speculation. The investment bank had previously said that in order for bitcoin to rise further—it had been trading around $2,750 at the time—government regulation would be necessary. See also: Bitcoin is up over 400% in the past year—what’s stopping it from going mainstream? Bitcoin’s evident connection to internet search interest—when combined with its continuing move into the mainstream—may suggest that prices have nearly unlimited upside potential, something some proponents more or less agree with. John McAfee, the founder of his namesake antivirus software company, as well as a former fugitive and passionate cryptocurrency backer, recently tweeted that he would “eat [his] d--k on national television” if bitcoin didn’t hit $500,000 within three years. Burniske disputed that general idea, noting that three peaks in Google search trends were accompanied by “three of bitcoin’s six price bubbles.” “The virtuous Satoshi cycle can overheat though, as Google search activity divorces from its tight tango with bitcoin’s price,” he tweeted earlier this week. Burniske defines bitcoin bubbles as the price doubling or more in a 30-day period. That is currently the case, as it was below $2,000 per bitcoin on July 16. “After every bubble there’s a crash,” he tweeted, with some drops exceeding 90%. However, he added that “those were *very* different bitcoin markets” [emphasis in original] as they had “thin liquidity, fragile exchanges, and a fraction of the users and investors,” something he suggested could limit downside in the event of another sharp downtrend.

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"Wells, the third-largest U.S. bank, disclosed in a regulatory filing on Aug. 4 that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is looking into the matter, one of many regulatory probes the bank faces over its treatment of depositors and borrowers. A Reuters review of the regulator’s complaints database found several instances of customers reporting financial hardship in recent years after Wells Fargo unexpectedly froze or closed their accounts. Some of the complaints described fraudulent deposits of unknown origin. Others said they were victims of identity theft and Wells Fargo closed their accounts and refused to reopen them or open new ones. One customer said the bank closed an account after a hacker changed personal information, and then Wells Fargo improperly sent funds to the wrong address. The complaints had consistent themes of confusion about why accounts were frozen or closed, and reflected desperation over being unable to access money, as well as frustration over not getting help from Wells Fargo’s customer service. “I moved money from my mother’s savings account into her checking account the day before she passed away,” one Wells Fargo customer wrote. “This checking account has been ‘locked’ by the fraud department for almost 3 months ... Now her debts are delinquent and mortgage about to go into foreclosure.” Reuters could not independently confirm reported details because the CFPB does not make complainants’ identities public. Well Fargo’s major competitors did not report similar issues or regulatory probes in their quarterly filings. “We continue to work with our regulator on this matter. As always, our goal is to protect our customers and the bank from fraud, and we want to do so in ways that minimize the risk and impact on our customers,” Wells Fargo spokesman Kristopher Dahl said in an email to Reuters. A spokesman for the CFPB declined to comment. Wells Fargo’s troubles started nearly a year ago when it said it had opened as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers’ names without their permission. Since then, the bank has said it charged customers for insurance they did not request, may have required others to pay unnecessary mortgage fees and also may have inappropriately tacked products like identity theft protection on to customers’ accounts. Unlike those issues, which stemmed from Wells Fargo trying to generate more revenue from customers, the frozen accounts appear to have arisen from an abundance of caution. Banks have had to contend with a rising number of scams. As a rule, lenders are “very zealous in protecting against suspicious activity,” said Brad Rustin, partner at law firm Nelson Mullins, who counsels financial companies on compliance. That has been driven partly by other regulators, like the U.S. Treasury Department, which require banks to root out fraud, money laundering and other financial crimes. It is not clear whether Wells Fargo was particularly aggressive in that regard or if a broad review of operations after the phony accounts scandal erupted led the bank to discover issues with improper account closures.

It has grown to include other areas, such as auto insurance. Prior to taking her current role, Anderson led the bank’s consumer credit card business. Her new responsibilities include Wells Fargo-branded cards as well as “private label” ones,  partnerships with retailers and other companies. She also oversees collections. Prior to the scandal, Wells Fargo executives had targeted credit cards as a business with big growth opportunities.

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"Steven Peikin, the new co-head of enforcement at the SEC, held as much as $9 million worth of stock in dozens of blue-chip companies as of Aug. 8, according to a disclosure filing obtained through a public records request. Peikin also said in paperwork filed with the Office of Government Ethics that he or his former employer, law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, represented several big banks during his time there. In a separate filing, William Hinman, the SEC’s director of corporate finance, said his former law firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, represented big banks as well as technology companies. Should those companies come before the SEC, potential conflicts of interest could arise. Having such conflicts is not unusual for senior SEC officials, whose stints at the agency are often bookended by private sector roles. The SEC has stricter rules than other government institutions about conflicts, and a detailed guide on how to handle them during and after roles at the agency. “Steve and Bill are subject to and complying with all applicable ethics laws, rules, and regulations, and both are working with the agency’s ethics counsel as needed,” SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns said in a statement. Peikin and Hinman had no further comment beyond the SEC’s  statement. Peikin is co-head of enforcement alongside Stephanie Avakian, allowing him to recuse himself from matters that present conflicts. Thomas Sporkin, a partner at Buckley Sandler LLP, who previously led the SEC’s Office of Market Intelligence, said that having two enforcement chiefs is “incredibly valuable” to avoid conflicts while ensuring a senior official is involved with important cases. Conflicts of interest have long been a point of contention between those who argue the SEC benefits from hiring people with real-world experience, and critics who say the revolving door makes it impossible to regulate effectively. That debate has heightened under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has stocked his administration with former business executives, and pledged to slash regulations. In July, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, who is also a former corporate lawyer, outlined ways he plans to do that at the SEC. “Their careers have been representing the industry that they’re now supposed to regulate and they’re going to bring to the job the mindset of the regulated parties,” Robert Weissman, president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. “Their orientation is serving Wall Street, not the public.” Peikin, 51, and Hinman, 62, are two of the most prominent appointments by Clayton, who faced questions from lawmakers about his own conflicts of interest during a confirmation hearing in March. Peikin said in his disclosure form confidentiality obligations prevented him from disclosing the identity of 18 other former clients, five of whom are the subject of “pending non-public government investigations.” Stephen Cohen, the director of Palantir Technologies, which signed a contract worth more than $43 million with the SEC in 2015, was another firm client during Hinman’s employment. The contract was for five years, with years two through five being optional, an SEC spokeswoman told Reuters at the time. ","

Altria stock was flat in afternoon trading Thursday, while the broad S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent. The dividend increase pushes its yield up to approximately 4 percent, a level nearly double the S&P 500’s yield of 2.3 percent. Analysts have pointed to Altria’s history of raising its dividend in August as a reason to buy its shares. “We believe the recent dramatic pullback in Altria’s stock makes a compelling argument for the board to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders,” noted Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo. Herzog expected the company to raise its dividend by 9 percent in 2018 and has a price target of $80 on its shares, a roughly 25 percent increase from its current trading price of $63.69. Annual dividend increases have helped Altria shares rise an average of 3.3 percent every August since 1981, according to Reuters data, compared with a 0.8 percent gain for the S&P 500. Overall, gains in that month have accounted for roughly one-quarter of the stock’s 14.3 percent annualized price return since August 1981. ","

Alan Farley,09072017,Investopedia,08312017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Bank stocks have struggled since topping out in March, hampered by a persistent downturn in commercial lending as well as low inflation that has forced the Federal Reserve to delay its aggressive rate hike schedule. Sector funds have now dropped into intermediate support, signaling possible breakdowns that bring into play deeper support at November 2016 breakout levels. The sector got bought aggressively in November and December, underpinned by high expectations that the business-friendly Trump administration would institute tax cuts and deregulatory actions to generate higher U.S. growth rates. The first nine months of the new presidency have failed to achieve those goals, inducing many shareholders to dump positions and pursue profits in more rewarding venues, including big tech. (See also: How Trump Can Unilaterally Deregulate Big Banks.) The reality of an aging business cycle is also hitting home, with the U.S. now engaged in the ninth year of an economic expansion. In addition, geopolitical tensions are generating a risk-averse environment that is forcing large chunks of institutional capital to rotate out of growth plays and into more defensive instruments, including bonds and precious metals. In turn, this global shift could finally end the long expansion and drop the economy into a recession. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) stalled at the 50% retracement​ of the 2007 to 2009 bear market in 2014, dropping into a choppy sideways pattern that found support at the .386 retracement level in March 2016. It bounced to resistance in November and broke out, stalling within three points of the .786 retracement level in March 2017. The subsequent pullback found support near $40.50 in late March, while the ensuing upturn fizzled out above $44. The fund has traded within those narrow boundaries for the past four months, denying multiple breakout and breakdown attempts. It has been hovering near range support for more than three weeks, failing to attract even minor buying interest, suggesting that it will finally break down and head into a test of the November breakout near $35. The long-term technical tone will remain bullish as long as that level holds, while a breakdown could signal the start of a multi-year downtrend. (For more, see: 5 Reasons to Buy Bank ETFs Despite Low Rates.) JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has led the banking sector since the 2008 economic collapse, emerging from the maelstrom with a stronger balance sheet than its rivals. It returned to the 2000 rally high at $67.20 in 2015 and ground sideways into a November 2016 breakout that stalled near $94 in March 2017. July and August breakout attempts failed, giving way to a decline that carved the outline of a small-scale head and shoulders pattern. The stock broke the neckline on higher-than-average volume on Monday and is now testing new resistance. A sell-off through $89 would confirm the breakdown, favoring continued downside into January and May support near $80. In turn, that price action could mark the next stage in a progressive decline that brings the November 2016 breakout into play. On-balance volume (OBV) is waving a red flag in that regard, failing to bounce during the summer breakout attempt. (See also: Bank Stocks Are Poised to Fall Further.) Wells-Fargo & Company (WFC) has traveled a different path in recent years, first outperforming its peers and then plunging after scandalous disclosures about fake accounts. The stock topped out at $58.76 in July 2015 and entered a volatile correction that found support at a two-year low in the mid-$40s in October 2016, ahead of a post-election rally that generated a false breakout in February 2017. Price action since that time has carved a multi-wave decline that is nearing a 10-month low. More importantly, Wells Fargo is the first big bank to give up gains posted immediately following the November election. At this point, continued selling pressure into the upper $40s would generate a wave of bearish signals that could presage a trip into the 2016 low and the completion of a multi-year double top.

Mark Kolakowski,09072017,Investopedia,08312017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs  Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is known for his golden touch when it come to stocks, and he remains positive on the equity markets. Even though the tripling of stock prices since 2009 has sharply boosted valuations and made equities less attractive, Buffett still says that stocks are still a better buy than bonds, Bloomberg reports. ""You pay 45 times earnings on a 10 year [U.S. Treasury] bond and the earnings aren't going to go up,"" as he told Bloomberg TV. As Buffett notes, the price of 10 Year U.S. Treasury Note is about 45 times its annual interest payment, or about twice the P/E ratio on the S&P 500 Index (SPX). Another negative for bonds is that interest payments on these instruments are fixed. Buffett acknowledges that finding bargains among stocks is becoming more difficult. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) is holding about $100 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which Buffett would like to invest $80 billion. He's taking his time because, as he also told Bloomberg TV, ""Stocks won't earn more just because you pay more for them."" One stock that Buffett holds in particularly high regard right now is computer and smartphone maker Apple Inc. (AAPL). Berkshire added to its Apple position in the second quarter, raising its ownership stake, now worth around $21 billion, or about 2.5% of Apple's shares outstanding, per an interview Buffett gave to CNBC. Buffett refused to comment on whether Berkshire has continued to buy Apple shares in the third quarter. He also has called Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) a ""terrific"" bank about which he has no concerns as a long term investment, despite a series of scandals in the past year, according to Reuters. Berkshire has become the largest shareholder in Bank of America Corp. (BAC), per Reuters. Preferred shares in BofA that Berkshire acquired six years ago were recently converted into common shares, producing a paper gain of $11 billion, according to Bloomberg. Buffett has also sharply boosted his stake this year in Home Capital Group Inc. to 38 percent from 20 percent. The company is a Canadian-based home lender. Beyond high valuations, a slowdown in corporate earnings growth is the another impediment to further gains in stock prices, as Robert Doll writes in Barron's. Doll is the chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, having previously held similar positions at BlackRock Inc., Merrill Lynch, and Oppenheimer Funds Inc. While earnings growth was strong in the first half of 2017, it was in comparison to a weak 2016, he notes. ""We expect earnings growth to slow to the mid-single-digit range by next year, which could drag on investment sentiment,"" he writes. Nonetheless, ""we believe equity prices are more likely than not to rise over the coming year,"" Doll indicates. He finds the global economic outlook to be ""relatively upbeat"" and says the chances for tax reform in the U.S. are ""improving."" Additionally, Doll writes, ""we doubt Fed policy will disrupt economic growth or the equity bull market."" That may be good news for investors.

Jeff Cox,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"The headlines keep getting worse for Wells Fargo in its fake account scandal, but the latest disclosures actually could represent a turning point. Revelations on Thursday that some 3.5 million accounts were affected should constitute a full disclosure of the problem and allow the beleaguered bank to begin putting the scandal behind it, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note. ""The fact that the company has completed its comprehensive third-party account review and has communicated the finality of its customer remediation plans is a positive in our view,"" KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note. ""The retail sales practice scandal settlement was announced nearly a year ago, and at this stage we now expect the trickle of new information to slow considerably."" Wells Fargo shares took a hit from the announcement, falling 0.8 percent by mid-Thursday afternoon. It's been a terrible year for the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, marked by a big reputational hit that has sent shares down about 7.6 percent year to date. By comparison, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is off about 1.2 percent in what has been a rough year for financials overall. However, Kleinhanzl thinks Wells Fargo can begin to repair some of the damage. He noted that the bank already had gone public that there would be a further review that would show more accounts affected. ""As the company puts the retail sales practice scandal in the rearview mirror, then we would expect to see the year-to-date underperformance reverse — as long as no new issues arise,"" he said. The scandal came to light following an investigation into the bank's cross-selling program — a practice in which employees were pushed to sell as many products to customers as possible across multiple lines. Initially, the company said some 2 million accounts were involved. Fallout from the scandal saw the former CEO and other executives pushed out. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has called for the removal of all the board members who were in place during the time in question. The bank already has paid a $185 million fine and settled a class-action suit for $142 million. Additional refunds and compensation are expected to cost $10.7 million more, Kleinhanzl said. The payouts are not expected to have a material impact on earnings. However, he noted that the bank still has outstanding issues regarding auto and collateral protection insurance. Previous revelations indicated that Wells had been putting some customers into auto insurance plans they didn't need. The bank has said it will refund $80 million to 570,000 affected customers.

But according to Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker, there may yet be magic in the stock. She upgraded the stock to ""outperform"" on Tuesday, noting that Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming service, which the media giant announced last month, could lead to meaningful upside. Ryvicker also believes the current stock prices offers an attractive entry point for investors. At 15X forward earnings, Disney trades at a discount relative to the market. ""Halftime Report"" trader Pete Najarian has owned Disney for a number of years, and he believes the media giant's move into direct-to-consumer streaming could push the stock to $120. ""They have brought the competition...streaming is where everyone is moving to. Disney has been very slow, but now I think that's starting to accelerate which is why I'm even more bullish,"" Najarian said. Trading at 15X forward earnings, Disney might also be on the verge of a break out. Najarian notes that ""this has been the level in the past where it's been a base and it starts to move to the  upside."" Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown believes the streaming platform is a step in the direction, but he argues that it shouldn't really be seen as an innovative move -- but rather one of necessity. ""Let's not look at it like they [Disney] are playing offense. This is defense. They are screwed if they don't do it."" He is positive on the stock, but said not to ""expect fireworks...This is not going to be a name that all of a sudden there's a streaming boom and Disney stock goes up because of it. They are playing defense."" Joe Terranova and Jim Lebenthal are staying on the sidelines for now since they believe there are better entry opportunities.

The decision has been met with sharp criticism by business leaders like Javier Palomarez, CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Palomarez resigned from Trump's Diversity Coalition saying, ""As a nation of immigrants, we have a moral responsibility to support and defend 'Dreamers,' who arrived to this country — at the average age of six — through no fault of their own. These individuals have already become dynamic contributors to our American economy and play an important role in our communities.""

Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"The United States must make it easier to encourage legal immigration if it wishes to see the economy grow, JPMorgan strategist David Kelly told CNBC on Friday. ""We have a labor force problem,"" Kelly said on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""That's part of what's slowing the labor side of the economy down. We just don't have enough people available and ready to work. So we need to make sure we have strong growth in legal immigration to help our labor force grow."" Growth in immigration likely won't happen anytime soon. After a crackdown on illegal immigration, President Donald Trump last month supported legislation by Republican senators to cut legal immigration by more than 50 percent over 10 years. But some economists say such a bill could actually hurt Trump's plan to grow the U.S. economy. As early as Friday, Trump also may rescind the Obama administration's ""dreamer"" policy, which protects from deportation nearly 800,000 immigrants who entered the country illegally as children. According to a closely watched government report Friday, the U.S. economy created 156,000 jobs in August, less than the 180,000 expected by economist surveyed by Reuters. In addition, the latest report revised downward the totals for new jobs for June and July. Kelly said the report shows the economy is ""stuck in second gear"" in some places, such as the labor market, but he thinks the economy is doing well in other areas. He also said investors will get some sort of tax cut by the Trump administration this year. The promise of business-friendly legislation by Trump is partly responsible for the stock market's rise since the election, some analysts say. Kelly said the Federal Reserve will likely hike interest rates in December. But Wells Fargo Securities economist John Silvia said on the show that the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey could put any Fed rate hike this year on hold. The Fed has already raised rates twice in 2017. ""It really looks more and more given Harvey, less and less of a chance of a Fed move in December,"" Silvia said.

Sarah O'Brien,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Republican leaders recently offered reassurances that when Congress tackles taxes this fall, the mortgage interest deduction will be protected. This begs the question: Who really benefits from it? The vast majority of people see no tax benefit from the deduction, because just 20 percent of filers use it, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And if Republicans successfully deliver generous increases in the standard deduction while eliminating other deductions, its utility could decline even more. ""At that point, very few people would claim the mortgage interest deduction,"" said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center. ""It may be the case that a lot of taxpayers wouldn't care if it went away, but it's a politically difficult thing to touch."" In an analysis of the GOP tax plan released last year, the Tax Policy Center estimated that of the 45 million filers who itemize, 38 million, or 84 percent, would opt for the $24,000 standard deduction proposed under the Republican plan because it would exceed the combined value of other deductions available to them. The tax break for mortgage interest has remained unchanged since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, when it survived the legislative ax to deductions for other forms of consumer interest (such as on credit card debt). The provision generally lets taxpayers deduct the interest on mortgage debt up to $1 million, along with interest on home-equity debt up to $100,000. To claim it, you must itemize deductions on your tax return, which only about a third of taxpayers do. Of those one-third, 74 percent take the mortgage interest deduction, according to the Tax Policy Center. The biggest benefits tend to go to higher-income taxpayers. The 7.18 million filers with incomes of $200,000 or more who claim the deduction will reduce their taxable income by an aggregate $29.78 billion this year, according to recent tax expenditure estimates released by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. In comparison, the 14.6 million filers with incomes of $100,000 to $200,000 will save less: $24.85 billion. Filers with incomes below that have even smaller tax savings. Another group of taxpayers who find the deduction appealing  are those in high-cost housing areas such as New York or San Francisco. Often, taxpayers in high-cost ZIP codes also claim other deductions, including those for property taxes and state and local income taxes. It's unclear whether those deductions and others will remain as legislators identify ways to offset promised tax cuts with new sources of tax revenue. The deduction for mortgage interest is among the most expensive individual tax breaks, costing an estimated $357 billion in revenue from 2016 through 2020, according to Joint Taxation Committee's recent report. President Donald Trump's one-page tax plan released in April and the 35-page GOP tax reform blueprint released last year included elimination of all deductions except those related to charitable contributions and mortgage interest. Since then, however, rumors have swirled on Capitol Hill that while the deduction might not go away, the cap on interest could be lowered to mortgage debt of $500,000, which would echo a provision in a Republican draft bill in 2014. Supporters of the deduction include the National Association of Realtors, which says any changes would harm homeowners whether they have a mortgage or not. The group released a study in May showing that if elements similar to GOP's plan went into effect, home values would fall by more than 10.2 percent on average in the near term. The study also found that homeowners with income of $50,000 to $200,000 would face an average tax increase of $815 while non-homeowners in that range would get an average tax cut of $516. Kathryn Hauer, a certified financial planner with Wilson David Investment Advisors in Aiken, South Carolina, said it's not just wealthy homeowners who like the mortgage interest deduction. She sees plenty of middle-class households where two earners bring in a combined $80,000 or so annually and rely on the break every year. ""For many homeowners, taking a deduction for that mortgage interest cost, which can be thousands of dollars, really helps lower their tax burden,"" Hauer said.

The first step in addressing a problem is recognizing that there is one. That's a lesson Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) seems to have taken to heart. On Thursday, the bank released the results of a third-party review of its sales practices dating back to 2009. The review found that as many as 3.5 million accounts may have been improperly opened by Wells Fargo branch employees from January 2009 through September 2016. The Wells Fargo stagecoach has seen better days. Image source: Getty Images. The updated figure marks a meaningful increase over the bank's previous estimate of as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts. But that estimate was confined to a narrower time frame, from May 2011 through mid-2015. By extending the analysis back by two-and-a-half years, Wells Fargo uncovered an additional 981,000 accounts identified as potentially unauthorized. The latest estimate also used new techniques to reassess potential improper account openings during the original time frame. By doing so, Wells Fargo upped its original estimate to 2.55 million accounts identified as potentially unauthorized. It's by adding the two figures together, in turn, that the California-based bank came up with its 3.5 million estimate of the extent of its fake-account scandal, which had been revealed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in September of last year. ""We apologize to everyone who was harmed by unacceptable sales practices that occurred in our retail bank,"" said Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan. ""To rebuild trust and to build a better Wells Fargo, our first priority is to make things right for our customers, and the completion of this expanded third-party analysis is an important milestone. Through this expanded review, as well as the class action settlement, free mediation services, and ongoing outreach and complaint resolution, we've cast a wide net to reach customers and address their remaining concerns."" The review looked as well into the enrollment of customers into online bill pay services over the eight-year stretch. It uncovered approximately 528,000 potentially unauthorized enrollments into the service. And all of this comes on top of another recent acknowledgment by the bank that approximately 570,000 of its customers with car loans had been charged by Wells Fargo for a particular type of auto insurance that they neither needed nor wanted. It's worth noting that the bank's latest estimates, released this week, likely overstate the population of impacted customers. As Wells Fargo explained in a press release that announced the results of the updated analysis: The analysis identified, as potentially unauthorized, accounts with only one minimal payment and no further use of the service. Some customers may have made an authorized introductory payment and then elected not to use the service. Therefore, the analysis did not definitively identify whether an enrollment was authorized by a customer or not, and properly authorized enrollments are likely part of this total. Wells Fargo's fake-account scandal has done considerable damage to the bank's reputation. It has also weighed heavily on the bank's stock, curtailing gains that the rest of the industry have benefited from over the past 10 months. WFC data by YCharts. Yet, as time goes on, and as Wells Fargo continues to identify and remedy the root causes of its sales scandal, it's fair to presume that its stock will eventually emerge out from under the dark cloud that's currently settled over the bank. Helping out in this regard is the bank's biggest shareholder, Warren Buffett. In an interview with CNBC earlier in the week, the 87-year-old billionaire chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said that all of the bad news hasn't changed his opinion that Wells Fargo is a ""terrific bank"" and a solid long-term investment.

    Wells Fargo Now Says 3.5 Million Accounts May Have Been Unauthorized -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Thanks to its ongoing fake-accounts scandal, which we recently discovered was worse than initially reported, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has been among the worst performers in the banking industry. In fact, over the past year, the financial sector has been one of the hottest areas of the market, up by more than 22%, while Wells Fargo has fallen by 0.4%. Here's a rundown of Wells Fargo's problems, it's recent business results, and whether it could be a smart long-term investment now. WFC data by YCharts To make a long story short, in September 2016, Wells Fargo revealed that employees may have opened just over 2 million unauthorized accounts to meet ambitious sales targets. As a result, the bank agreed to pay $185 million in fines, made significant leadership changes, and ended its sales culture of trying to maximize cross-selling success at any cost. Many of Wells Fargo's customers have discovered accounts that they didn't authorize. Image source: Getty Images. A recently released third-party review, which covered a longer time period than the original estimate, found that the problem was even worse than originally thought. The number of improperly opened accounts rose to as many as 3.5 million. In addition to the fake-accounts drama, the bank has been the subject of a few smaller scandals as well. In July, it was revealed that Wells Fargo wrongly charged more than 800,000 car loan borrowers for auto insurance they didn't need. About a month before that, the company was accused of making unauthorized changes to many of its home loans. In August, the bank faced additional scrutiny for failing to refund guaranteed auto protection insurance money to some borrowers. Most recently, the bank has been accused of improperly raising customers' mortgage rates. Despite these setbacks, the damage done to Wells Fargo by these scandals may not be as bad as you think. The first quarter of 2017 definitely showed a slump in earnings and revenue, and a lower level of efficiency than is typical for the bank. In its second-quarter earnings report, however, the bank showed characteristically strong return on assets and return on equity metrics, as well as an improvement in efficiency. Wells Fargo typically runs a leaner and more profitable operation than the rest of the ""big four"" U.S. banks, and it doesn't look as if the fake-accounts scandal is going to change that -- although the gap has narrowed a bit. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts To be clear, Wells Fargo is certainly guilty of some bad behavior over the past decade or so. And its business could continue to suffer as a result. However, from a long-term perspective, these issues should all be temporary in nature. Wells Fargo has made appropriate changes to address the problems with its sales culture, and in the wake of the recent scandals coming to light, you can bet that the bank will be on its best behavior for the foreseeable future. Wells Fargo's largest shareholder is Warren Buffett-led conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), and Buffett has stood by the bank. Shortly after news of the fake-accounts scandal broke, Buffett called the bank an ""incredible institution"" that made a terrible mistake. Just recently, when asked about the possibility of more negative Wells Fargo headlines, Buffett didn't seem too concerned. ""What you find is that there's never just one cockroach in the kitchen,"" Buffett told CNBC. In other words, when one bad behavior is brought to light and everyone starts to take a closer look, it's common to find more issues. However, Buffett said he's still not concerned about the bank as a long-term investment: ""It's a terrific bank. ... There were some things that were very wrong done there, but they are being corrected."" I agree with Buffett. We could certainly see even more negative headlines, and it's entirely possible that Wells Fargo could continue to underperform its sector in the near term. From a long-term perspective, however, this could be an opportunity to get into a great bank at a discount. ","

John Maxfield,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has had its fair share of troubles over the past year, beginning 12 months ago when regulators revealed a massive multiyear sales scandal that had taken place at the bank. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the California-based bank is a bad investment. If you're a dividend investor, in fact, there's a lot to like about Wells Fargo. You can see this by looking at the bank's performance on the three most important metrics for dividend investors. Image source: Getty images. 1. Dividend yield The dividend yield is the most commonly known metric when it comes to income investing. This measures how much a stock pays in dividends each year relative to its share price. In Wells Fargo's case, it has paid out $1.56 per share in dividends over the trailing 12 months. Meanwhile, its shares are currently priced at $50.97 each. By dividing the former by the latter, you get Wells Fargo's dividend yield of 3%. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. That's a healthy yield when you consider that the average yield on the S&P 500 is 2%. It's even more impressive when you look only at big banks. Out of the 20 largest banks, shares of Wells Fargo have the highest yield. 2. Dividend growth Aside from the yield, which tells you how much a stock is currently paying out, the second most important metric for dividend investors is the growth rate of a particular stock's quarterly distribution. When Wells Fargo raised its dividend earlier this year following the conclusion of the 2017 stress tests, it did so by a smaller amount than many of its peers did, boosting it by only a penny, from $0.38 per share up to $0.39 per share. WFC Dividend data by YCharts. However, if you look back on Wells Fargo's history of dividend increases, what sticks out is its consistency. It has increased its dividend per share every year since 2010. This doesn't necessarily mean that Wells Fargo will continue to do so, but a history of consistent increases certainly seems to make it more likely as opposed to less likely that it will keep up this trend. 3. Dividend payout The final major dividend metric that investors use to assess the quality of income-producing stocks is the payout ratio. This measures the percent of income that a company pays out in dividends each quarter. There is no hard-and-fast rule when it comes to payout ratios. That being said, a lower ratio is better than a higher ratio from the perspective of future dividend growth. Moreover, most banks seek to distribute at least a third of their income to shareholders, while using a third to buy back stock, and retaining the final third to fund organic growth. Data source: Yahoo! Finance, YCharts.com. Chart by author. In Wells Fargo's case, it paid out 41% of its earnings over the last 12 months. That compares to an average of 30% among the nation's 20 biggest banks. In sum, while Wells Fargo's high payout ratio suggests that its dividend won't grow as quickly as at some of its peers, its voluptuous yield combined with its consistent annual increases make this stock a worthy contender for any income investor's portfolio.

The most important person in the bank industry isn't a banker -- it's Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). He cemented that role this week by exercising warrants Berkshire Hathaway held to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Berkshire is now the biggest shareholder of the nation's second-largest bank by assets. Data source: Nasdaq. Chart by author. An ownership stake in such a large bank is notable in and of itself, yet it's only one of many banks in which Berkshire Hathaway is a leading shareholder. Since the early 1990s, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has also been the biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), the nation's third-biggest bank by assets. Data source: Nasdaq. Chart by author. Berkshire also has major positions in M&T Bank, U.S. Bancorp, Bank of New York Mellon, and American Express. Bank Stocks Owned by Berkshire Hathaway Number of Shares Owned Holding Value Wells Fargo 468 million $23.8 billion Bank of America 700 million $16.7 billion American Express 151.6 million $13.0 billion U.S. Bancorp 85.1 million $4.4 billion Bank of New York Mellon 50.2 million $2.6 billion Goldman Sachs 10.9 million $2.5 billion M&T Bank 5.4 million $798 million Data source: CNBC's Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Tracker. And his role doesn't stop there. During the depths of the financial crisis, Buffett injected $5 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway's capital into Goldman Sachs, giving the Wall Street investment bank a much-needed confidence boost just as its competitors were failing or being rescued by larger institutions. Moreover, while Berkshire Hathaway doesn't have a position in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the nation's largest bank by assets, Buffett has admitted in the past that he personally owns shares of the bank and holds its chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, in high regard. Buffett went so far as to tell CNBC at one point that Dimon ""writes the best annual letter in corporate America."" Lest there be any doubt on the latter point, I encourage you to read about Dimon's 2006 shareholder letter. Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. It's worth noting as well that one of Buffett's lieutenants recently became a member of JPMorgan Chase's board of directors. Todd Combs, an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway, became a director of the bank last year. ""Todd Combs is an extraordinary leader, investor and thinker, with a deep understanding of finance and business,"" said Dimon at the time. ""We're pleased he has agreed to serve on our Board of Directors, and our company and our Board will benefit from his wisdom and judgment."" Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Image source: The Motley Fool. What is it about banking that is so appealing to Buffett? In the first case, it exhibits similar dynamics to insurance, as both industries are in the business of managing risk. And in the second case, success in both industries is predicated on maintaining discipline through the ups and downs of the business cycle, which is among Buffett's most prominent strengths. Consequently, if you're interested in learning about the proper and prudent approach to operating or investing in a bank, then it's worth spending time reading through Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. Intermixed with his folksy wisdom on investing are timeless lessons about identifying the best-run banks in the country. ","

Earlier this year, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) announced that it would increase its dividend by 60%, boosting its quarterly payout from $0.075 per share up to $0.12 per share. That's a hefty increase by any measure. While it's true that Citigroup's (NYSE:C) dividend jumped by an even larger margin when the bank doubled its payout at the end of June, Bank of America's dividend hike nevertheless left its two other primary peers in the dust. Following the conclusion of this year's stress tests, in which large banks apply for permission to raise their dividends, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) announced a 2.6% increase in its dividend while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) ratcheted its payout higher by 12%. Bank Current Dividend Per Share Previous Dividend Per Share Change Citigroup $0.32 $0.16 100% Bank of America $0.12 $0.075 60% JPMorgan Chase $0.56 $0.50 12% Wells Fargo $0.39 $0.38 2.6% Data source: Company news releases. Why is Bank of America in a position to grow its dividend so quickly? In the first case, it's because Bank of America currently pays out a smaller share of its earnings each year to shareholders than JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo do. Bank of America's payout ratio over the trailing 12 months is only 24%, up from 18% following its latest distribution. JPMorgan Chase's comes in at 33%, while Wells Fargo's is 41%. And looking at big banks more broadly, the average on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap bank stocks, is 34%. The reason Bank of America's payout ratio is so much lower traces back to the financial crisis, when the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank had to cut its dividend to $0.01 per share in order to preserve capital to survive the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Since then, under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, banks no longer have unfettered discretion to raise their payouts. They must instead get the Federal Reserve's approval to do so as a part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which is the second of the annual stress test's two phases. Image source: Bank of America. In the first year of the stress tests, in 2011, Bank of America requested a dividend increase but was denied -- click here for Bank of America's stress test history. It then didn't ask again until 2014, at which point it was able to boost its quarterly payout from $0.01 per share up to $0.05 per share. It took another pass in 2015, but then was given approval to up its dividend again in 2016, to $0.075 per share. And it was in the wake of the most recent stress test that Bank of America's dividend grew to its current quarterly payout of $0.12 per share. Citigroup has been in a similar situation over the past seven years, only raising its payout three times as well. By contrast, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have been given the go-ahead every year since the new regulatory regime under Dodd-Frank took effect. It's for this reason, in turn, that Bank of America was able to increase its dividend by 60% this year, yet still have a payout ratio that's below the average of its peer group. ","

It's been a great year for Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) shareholders so far. The biotech stock is up more than 35% year to date. However, most of those gains were made in the first quarter, thanks to positive clinical results. Over the last five months, Jazz stock has retreated every time it seems to pick up momentum. Jazz Pharmaceuticals CEO Bruce Cozzad sat down at the Wells Fargo Healthcare Conference on Wednesday to field questions. Perhaps the most important question posed to Cozzad related to what investors should watch for in the rest of 2017 and into 2018. Here are the five key things Jazz's CEO listed in his response. Image source: Getty Images. Jazz won FDA approval on Aug. 3 for Vyxeos in treating two types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The company launched the drug in the U.S. roughly one week later. Jazz's third-quarter results should show some sales activity for Vyxeos, but the fourth-quarter results will be a better sign of how the launch is going. Vyxeos is expected to generate peak annual sales north of $200 million. It will be interesting to see how the drug fares in the early days of the launch, considering that Vyxeos combines two chemotherapies, daunorubicin and cytarabine, that are already on the market. However, in a phase 3 study, patients taking Vyxeos survived a median 9.6 months after treatment, compared with 5.9 months for patients taking the two chemotherapies separately. Cozzad mentioned several upcoming regulatory submissions planned by Jazz. Three should happen by the end of this year: European filing for Vyxeos in treating AML, and U.S. filings for JZP-110 in treating excessive sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and narcolepsy, and for an additional indication for Xyrem in treating pediatric narcolepsy. Another key regulatory submission should take place in the first quarter of 2018 for JZP-507, which is a low-sodium version of Xyrem. The submissions themselves won't move the needle for Jazz Pharmaceuticals stock, of course. However, Cozzad stressed that these are important for investors to monitor because they're prerequisites for winning approval and launching the drugs. Jazz picked up Vyxeos with its acquisition last year of Celator. The company recently bought option rights to ImmunoGen's (NASDAQ:IMGN) two early-stage, hematology-related antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) programs, as well as an additional program to be determined later. Cozzad said investors should watch for more deals, although he wouldn't predict when they might happen. The size of Jazz's deals could be bigger in the future than they've been in the past. Cozzad stated that Jazz is now a bigger company and should be able to invest more capital in larger deals ""that make sense."" He doesn't think the company necessarily needs to be in a hurry, though. Sales growth for Xyrem in the first half of 2017 was sluggish. Cozzad predicted a return to stronger growth for the drug in 2018. Jazz launched an educational campaign earlier this year to help narcolepsy patients better understand the disease. Cozzad thinks this campaign could potentially lead to an uptick in sales for Xyrem. He noted that there are around 13,000 patients taking the drug currently, but there are roughly 60,000 patients diagnosed with narcolepsy in the U.S. and many more on top of that who haven't yet been diagnosed. Jazz removed a key obstacle earlier this year by settling with Hikma Pharmaceuticals in a deal that allows Hikma to launch an authorized generic version of Xyrem in 2023. The company also settled with three other generic drugmakers in agreements that allow them to market generic versions of Xyrem after 2025. Cozzad said to watch for more settlements in the future. There are four other companies that have filed abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of Xyrem. Litigation between Jazz and these four companies has been combined into one case for which the trial date has not yet been set. Cozzad expects the trial to begin no earlier than the first half of 2018. He said that settlements could be more likely as the trial date approaches. ","

The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) is a passively managed exchange-traded fund that invests in several hundred stocks with above-average dividends. Although the stock market looks generally expensive right now, the fund could still be a smart choice for your portfolio. Here's what investors should know about this ETF and why you might want to consider it. As the name implies, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF invests in stocks that pay high dividend yields. Specifically, the ETF tracks an index known as the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which contains approximately 400 stocks with above-average dividend yields, specifically excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs). Image Source: Getty Images. The index tracked by the fund is weighted, meaning that larger components make up more of the fund's assets. So, although the fund owns more than 400 stocks (404 to be exact), the 10 largest holdings make up 30.9% of its assets, as of July 31, 2017. These 10 holdings, ranked by the percentage of the fund's assets they represent, are: Company % of VYM Assets Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 5.8% Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) 3.8% ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) 3.6% JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 3.4% Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 2.6% AT&T (NYSE:T) 2.5% Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) 2.5% General Electric (NYSE:GE) 2.4% Chevron (NYSE:CVX) 2.2% Verizon (NYSE:VZ) 2.1% Data source: Vanguard. Percentages may not add up perfectly due to rounding. Because all of the stocks in the index pay above-average dividend yields, so does the ETF. As of this writing, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF pays a 2.9% yield, as compared with 1.84% for the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF, which simply tracks the S&P 500 index. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF is a passive fund, meaning that it simply tracks an index as opposed to being actively managed, where professional managers handpick investments. As a result, the ETF has a rock-bottom 0.08% expense ratio. This means that for every $10,000 you have invested, your annual expenses are just $8. In a nutshell, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF is a good investment for people who: To be clear, the market does look rather expensive as a whole right now, but that doesn't mean you should try to time the market and stop investing. Sure, we could get a 10% correction in the near future like many experts are predicting, or we could still have a lot of room to the upside. ","

If you were to make a list of the most influential bankers in the United States, few would surpass Hugh McColl, the former CEO of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). It wasn't just that McColl was largely responsible for building Bank of America into the behemoth it is today. He was also the driving force behind legislation that opened up interstate banking across the country. A full transcript follows the video. Gaby Lapera: I'm going to tell you a little bit of a meandering story, a little bit of a Maxfield story, if you will. [laughs] I'm going to start with this challenge that was posed hypothetically to myself, which is to pick the top three bankers in the United States. The first one is Alexander Hamilton, which kind of goes without saying. He was the one who was like, ""You know what we should do? We should have central banking. Also, America's future is not agrarian."" You know, I think he called the right shot on both counts with that one. Second banker that I think everyone can agree was huge for the American financial system is J.P. Morgan. He helped bail out the American financial system, he created these connections with Europe. Without him, I don't really know where we would be as a country. But then, if forced to pick a third one, and I know that Maxfield definitely agrees with me on this, I would pick Hugh McColl of Bank of America. I don't know if listeners know this, but you know how you can go to Bank of America and there's a Bank of America in basically every state -- except for Nebraska, much to my ire. There's a Wells Fargo in Nebraska. Anyway. Before, you couldn't do that. Before, it was really hard for banks to have branches, and it was illegal in a lot of states for banks to have more than one branch. And that was for a variety of reasons. But, back in the day, Hugh McColl, he was in North Carolina, one of the few states that allowed banks to have more than one branch, and he really pushed for legislation to be changed so that banks could branch outside of their state. Without that, we wouldn't have the financial system that we have today. John Maxfield: Yeah. I think that's a great overview. Alexander Hamilton wasn't actually a banker, and I think this is exactly the point you're trying to make -- if you look at the bank industry that we have today and you had to pick three people who had the most significant contribution to how it has evolved, the first one, yeah, Alexander Hamilton, because he set this thing up. The second one, J.P. Morgan, because he was the link between us and Europe during the American Industrial Revolution or the Gilded Age, which is really where the United States of America gained its power. And then, more recently, Hugh McColl. To your point, when he started banking, Hugh McColl joined a small bank in North Carolina in 1959. When he started banking, it was called unit banking at the time. Unit banking meant that you could basically just have one location in most states. You couldn't have branches in most states. And you couldn't operate across interstate lines. And think about how different that is relative to what we have today, where we have a bank like Bank of America and a bank like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, literally, the branch networks span the North American continent. And the person who is most responsible for that is Hugh McColl. What he did is, he really proactively pushed, he saw the importance of expanding branches across interstate lines and having larger branch networks. Lapera: I think listeners are probably thinking to themselves, ""This is a wonderful story!"" Thank you, listeners. We really appreciate that. Secondly, they're probably also wondering, ""What is this meant to illustrate?"" And I think the thing that we're trying to get at here is that really great bankers and really great banks are really proactive at seizing opportunities and making opportunities for themselves. Lapera: Yeah. I think, how that's applicable today is, what banks should be looking for, generally, the opportunities that they're going to need to seize to create opportunities for themselves, are probably going to be in the tech arena. So they stay relevant, and not just relevant but push beyond that, and find the next thing that will make them bigger, more stable, draw more customers in. Maxfield: Oh my God, that's such a good transition, Gaby. The reason that such a good transition is because one of the benefits of Bank of America today, one of its advantages is, because of Hugh McColl's work, building that banking to what it is today, the behemoth that it is, it has the economies of scale to invest in technology. And technology is where the battle of banking is being fought right now, and really will be fought in the future. And it's because of the scale that Hugh McColl built that they're going to be able to compete effectively in that arena. ","

If you want to comprehensively understand a bank from an investment perspective, you need to look at it through several different lenses. Fundamental metrics are important, including those that measure profitability, efficiency, and growth. Investing metrics matter too, such as earnings per share, growth in book value, and dividend yield. But there are softer, less quantifiable things that should be taken into consideration as well. Image source: Getty Images. At the top of this list is a bank's culture. Bank executives tend to extoll their institution's culture as a competitive advantage. Yet, most of the time they come across as just paying lip service to the idea, which is safe to do because culture is so hard to measure. But this doesn't mean it's impossible to quantifiably assess culture, as there are proxies that can be used. In this case, I'm referring to employee approval scores of their CEO, which you can get from glassdoor.com, a popular employment and recruiting website. With this in mind, here are how the CEOs of some of the biggest commercial banks in the United States stack up: Bank CEO Employee Approval Number of Reviews Capital One (NYSE:COF) Richard Fairbank 93% 2,543 U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) Richard Davis* 92% 2,297 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Jamie Dimon 91% 5,247 Citigroup Michael Corbat 88% 2,326 BB&T Kelly King 88% 747 Wells Fargo Timothy Sloan 82% 991 Bank of America Brian Moynihan 80% 6,595 PNC Financial William Demchak 78% 1,236 SunTrust Banks William Rogers 76% 733 Fifth Third Bancorp Greg Carmichael 74% 156 *Davis retired earlier this year as CEO, but remains chairman of U.S. Bancorp. Data source: Glassdoor.com. At the top of the list is Capital One Financial CEO Richard Fairbank, who has led the credit card-focused bank since it was spun off from a former parent company in 1995. Fairbank earned the approval of 93% of the bank's employees on glassdoor.com. Since the spinoff, Capital One has expanded far beyond credit cards, becoming a full-fledged commercial bank. It did so by buying multiple traditional banks, and is today the seventh-largest commercial bank in the United States. U.S. Bancorp's Richard Davis ranks second, with 92% of employees approving of his performance. It's worth noting that Davis is no longer CEO of U.S. Bancorp, passing the baton earlier this year, but he remains the chairman of the bank's board of directors. Chairman of U.S. Bancorp, Richard Davis. Image source: U.S. Bancorp. If you're unfamiliar with Davis, I encourage you to read about his prudent and profitable approach to banking that enabled U.S. Bancorp to not only survive the financial crisis but thrive through it. In third place is JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon. Like Fairbank and Davis, it's hard to overstate the value that Dimon brings to a bank, as has been the case through his entire career. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Dimon has focused JPMorgan Chase on maintaining a fortress balance sheet, was the first big bank executive to predict the onset of the financial crisis, and, as a result, was responsible for positioning the nation's biggest bank by assets to buy not one but two major banks at the behest of the government during the 2008 downturn. After these three, the rest of the CEOs who made the list have employee approval scores below 90%. That's not necessarily a red flag from an investor's perspective, but it's not as much of a glowing endorsement, either. ","

Socially responsible investing (SRI) means choosing your investments based on your moral and ethical beliefs. For example, if you believe that tobacco companies are unethical, you would refrain from buying stocks or bonds issued by those companies. Although socially responsible investing has been around as a concept for decades, it's really taken off in the last few years. One out of every six professionally managed dollars is invested based on an SRI strategy nowadays. As a result, the number of SRI-based mutual funds has increased dramatically.

Before investing in any SRI fund, take a look at the fund prospectus and the list of companies it's chosen to invest in, so that you'll have a clear idea of the direction the fund is likely to take. For example, many SRI funds shun tobacco and fossil-fuel stocks, but may or may not care about how companies treat their employees or whether they're law-abiding. The fund prospectus should indicate which criteria are used to pick its stocks. You can also check the fund's ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) rating to see how it ranks in the qualities that are most important to you. Most, if not all, of the major investment research companies include an ESG rating for the funds they assess. Ethical issues aren't the only yardstick you should use when choosing an SRI fund. It's also important to study the factors that relate to the fund's performance -- after all, socially responsible investing shouldn't bar you from making a tidy profit on your investments. In particular, look at the fund's past performance, fees and expense ratios, and risk rating, and consider how the fund fits into your overall portfolio. One of the biggest funds in the SRI space is Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund Investor Shares (NASDAQMUTFUND:VFTSX). This large-cap fund has the advantage of being passively managed, meaning that fees and transaction-related taxes will typically be much lower than for a similar actively managed fund. It seeks to track the FTSE4Good U.S. Select Index, which picks stocks based on ESG criteria. The fund is large, with 434 holdings. This helps to spread out risk, but it also increases the odds that one or more of the included stocks won't meet a specific investor's criteria for SRI. For example, while the fund doesn't include coal-related stocks, it does own oil stocks, including ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum Corp. The Parnassus Endeavor Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:PARWX) is another large-cap fund, but it has a mere 30 or so holdings, making it far less diversified than the larger Vanguard fund. The Endeavor Fund chooses companies that ""offer outstanding workplaces"" and are not in any way involved with fossil-fuel extraction or processing. Importantly, however, Parnassus' idea of ""outstanding workplaces"" may not jibe with some investors. As of this writing, for instance, the fund owns shares of Wells Fargo, a company that's been through several recent scandals due to the pressure it puts on its sales personnel that has resulted in unethical behavior. Socially responsible investing isn't limited to stocks these days: If you're looking for an SRI bond fund, consider the TIAA-CREF Social Choice Bond Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:TSBIX). Like the stock funds, this fund picks its bonds based on ESG criteria and aims to keep at least 80% of its assets in investment-grade bonds, including some Treasury securities. This fund doesn't bar fossil-fuel companies; as of this writing it owns bonds issued by National Oilwell Varco. With over 200 SRI mutual funds in existence, there's bound to be one out there that fits your preferences and portfolio. All you have to do is look. ","

The bank paid $185 million to regulators and recently agreed to pay $142 million more to customers to settle a class-action suit. Peter Conti-Brown, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania told MarketWatch, “Consent decrees are reached through a negotiation process, but they are different from private contracts. If the September 2016 decree placed the 2011 start date as the result of misleading information, the CFPB, OCC, and LA County not only can reopen the settlement, but must.” The bank disclosed on Thursday that the number of “unauthorized” customer accounts opened by bank employees to achieve aggressive sale goals is now 3.5 million, a 67% increase from the number, 2.1 million, disclosed by the bank last fall. See also: New York Fed’s Dudley failed to disclose family ties to Wells Fargo The 2.1 million estimate was used to determine the bank’s settlement with regulators. The estimate was based on a total of 1.534 million “unauthorized” deposit accounts and 565,000 unauthorized credit card accounts that had bene identified since PricewaterhouseCoopers was hired as an outside consultant in 2015. There was no information considered at the time of the settlement regarding the number of unauthorized online banking accounts or unauthorized debit cards. Read: Where was KPMG, Wells Fargo’s auditor, while the funny business was going on? The bank’s agreement with regulators covered what it called “inappropriate sales practices” during the “relevant period”, January 1, 2011 to effective date of agreement of Sept 8, 2016. However, the analysis available at the time was limited to May 2011 and July 2015, not the entire period. After the settlement was announced, former CEO John Stumpf promised the Senate Banking Committee that the bank would go back an additional two years, to 2009, looking for more customers who may have been harmed. The expanded and expanded analysis performed by PwC reviewed more than 165 million retail banking accounts opened between January 2009 through September 2016, according to a Wells Fargo press release, and identified the new total of approximately 3.5 million potentially unauthorized consumer and small business accounts. The bank also said that the amount of estimated monetary harm to customers had also increased based on approximately 190,000 accounts that were now believed to have incurred fees and charges, up from 130,000 previously identified accounts that incurred fees and charges. Wells Fargo plans provide $2.8 million in additional refunds and credits over and above the $3.3 million previously refunded as a result of the original analysis.

In light of the recent revelations, why should anyone believe anything this bank says?” Jennifer Dunn, the bank’s vice president for government and community relations communications wrote MarketWatch, “Wells Fargo routinely communicates with our regulators on many topics, including sales practices generally and the consent orders entered into in September 2016. At that time, the third party’s account analysis included January 2011 forward, which became the baseline for remediation under the consent orders. For the past year, we have publicly discussed our commitment to expand the third party account analysis to include 2009 and 2010, and to proactively compensate those customers in the same way as customers impacted from 2011 forward.” Spokesmen for the CFPB and OCC declined comment on the new Wells Fargo disclosures and their impact on the settlement. A spokesman for the Los Angeles County City Attorney did not respond immediately to a request for comment. See also:  Warren to Yellen: Fire Wells Fargo directors The consent decree Wells Fargo signed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said that the regulator “releases and discharges” Wells Fargo from all potential liability for violating the law related to the “inappropriate sales practices” described in the order that occurred before September 8, 2016, but only if the CFPB knows about them as of that date. Lisa Gilbert of vice president of legislative affairs for Public Citizen told MarketWatch, “As more Wells Fargo dishonesty comes to light, the outrage of consumers, investors, and the public at large is reaching epic proportions. The victims tally is now legion, and the information suppression from the company is appalling. This should be reason enough to increase congressional oversight and to consider reopening the settlement agreement.” Dunn from Wells Fargo told MarketWatch, “We remain fully committed to making things right for customers affected by improper sales practices no matter the time period and we will make refunds of any inappropriate charges.” ","New revelations may send Wells Fargo, regulators back to negotiating table - MarketWatch"
Emily Glazer,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 5, 2017 10:37 p.m. ET By Two former managers have sued Wells Fargo & Co., claiming they were unfairly fired over the bank's sales-practices issues. Reza Razzaghipour and Marla Razzaghipour claimed their dismissals were retaliation for them raising issues with senior managers about the questionable sales practices, such as falsification of bank records, according to a lawsuit filed Aug. 31 in Los Angeles Superior Court. The former managers, who are husband and wife, were fired in March 2017 from positions overseeing regions in Southern California. Combined, the two managed about 3,500 staff, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. A Wells Fargo spokesman said in a statement Tuesday that the bank ""denies the allegations of these two former regional presidents. The termination decisions were not retaliatory as alleged in the complaint. The company terminated the employment of these two individuals for legitimate and lawful reasons."" Wells Fargo was ordered to pay a $185 million fine last year over its sales practices and has since faced public and political pressure as the scandal erupted. More than 5,300 employees were fired over a five-year period for the behavior. The bank said last week up to 3.5 million customer accounts may have been unauthorized. The lawsuit alleges that Mr. Razzaghipour reported one type of employee fraud in 2013 and fired a ""significant number of employees involved."" The lawsuit also alleges that Mrs. Razzaghipour, known to some at work as Marla Clemow, ""reported the illegal and unethical sales practices at the highest levels multiple times."" Both former managers ""never fired or disciplined anyone for failing to meet the bank's impossible and fraudulent sales goals,"" the lawsuit claimed. But some current and former employees and managers have told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. and Mrs. Razzaghipour pushed them to engage in questionable sales tactics. ""My clients were fired in retaliation for complaining of illegal conduct at Wells Fargo, including the bank's improper sales practices,"" the managers' lawyer Emanuel Shirazi, of Los Angeles-based Shirazi Law Firm, said in a statement. ""Despite knowing this, Wells Fargo chose to scapegoat Mr. & Mrs. Razzaghipour."" The lawyer didn't comment specifically on the employee allegations. The Razzaghipour's lawsuit also names several retail-banking executives, some of whom are still employed by the bank and others who were fired, as the real ""bad actors."" The managers requested their payroll and personnel files from Wells Fargo, which refused to produce them, according to the lawsuit. They then filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. In the lawsuit they ask for damages of at least $50 million.

Greg Robb,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 1, 2017 3:15 p.m. ET Outside review says New York Fed President’s lack of disclosure was ‘minor’ By A top Federal Reserve official with close ties to Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Friday admitted that he failed to disclose his half-sister worked at Wells Fargo as required by the central bank’s disclosure rules. In a statement, New York Fed President William Dudley described the lack of disclosure was inadvertent. ”I deeply regret this omission and am embarrassed by my failure to read these important disclosures more thoroughly,” he said. Dudley failed to notice that sibling employment should be disclosed in the standard disclosure form. The Bank of England’s deputy governor, Charlotte Hogg, resigned earlier this year over a similar lack of disclosure. Dudley has been the president of the New York Fed since 2009. He has been a sharp critic of the lack of ethics in banking exhibited in the run up to the financial crisis. The New York Fed chief also has a pivotal voice on interest-rate policy. He is the only one of the 12 regional Fed presidents who has a vote at every interest-rate meeting. Dudley joined the Fed in 2007 and never listed his half-sister’s employment at Wells Fargo

It was not until the spring of 2017 that Dudley realized his mistake and reported it to his board of directors. In a statement, Sara Horowitz, the chair of the New York Fed’s board, said the panel decided to bring in an outside law firm to conduct an independent review. That review, by the law firm Jenner & Block, said Dudley would not have needed a waiver even if had disclosed with the family relationship.

                                   , the report noted. In addition, Dudley’s half-sister did not occupy a high-level decision-making position that would have caused her to intersect with the Fed. “We have uncovered no evidence that Mr. Dudley made any decision or recommendations specific to Wells Fargo or that he involved himself in any matters specifically related to the bank,” the report concluded. The review also agreed with Dudley that the lack of disclosure was inadvertent, and found no evidence that Dudley provided information about the Fed that would be relevant to Well sFargo, or vice versa. “We are satisfied with the review’s findings that Bill’s failure to disclose was inadvertent and a relatively minor violation of the New York Fed’s Code of Conduct, and that he was forthcoming and genuinely contrite,” Horowitz said. “We do not believe any further action is warranted,” she added. Wells Fargo has been under a close of scandal for the past year, ever since the firm paid $185 million fine for opening accounts with fictitious or unauthorized customer information. Soon after, it underwent congressional hearings, its then-CEO abruptly retired and it continues to face federal and state investigations. Earlier this week, the firm said around 3.5 million customer accounts were not authorized, more than 1 million more than initially announced.

 ,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Keep Me Logged In Disney has trailed the broader market this year, with shares falling almost three percent compared to the S&P 500's nearly ten percent gain. But according to Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker, there may yet be magic in the stock. She upgraded the stock to ""outperform"" on Tuesday, noting that Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming service, which the media giant announced last month, could lead to meaningful upside. Ryvicker also believes the current stock prices offers an attractive entry point for investors. At 15X forward earnings, Disney trades at a discount relative to the market. ""Halftime Report"" trader Pete Najarian has owned Disney for a number of years, and he believes the media giant's move into direct-to-consumer streaming could push the stock to $120. ""They have brought the competition...streaming is where everyone is moving to. Disney has been very slow, but now I think that's starting to accelerate which is why I'm even more bullish,"" Najarian said. Trading at 15X forward earnings, Disney might also be on the verge of a break out. Najarian notes that ""this has been the level in the past where it's been a base and it starts to move to the  upside."" Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown believes the streaming platform is a step in the direction, but he argues that it shouldn't really be seen as an innovative move -- but rather one of necessity. ""Let's not look at it like they [Disney] are playing offense. This is defense. They are screwed if they don't do it."" He is positive on the stock, but said not to ""expect fireworks...This is not going to be a name that all of a sudden there's a streaming boom and Disney stock goes up because of it. They are playing defense."" Joe Terranova and Jim Lebenthal are staying on the sidelines for now since they believe there are better entry opportunities. The stock ""seems to be stuck between $100 and $105,"" Terranova said on Tuesday's ""Halftime Report."" While he thinks 2018 will be a strong year for Disney at the box office and at its theme parks, he's not getting in the name until there are ""some consecutive quarters of earnings acceleration."" Lebenthal's key level for the stock is $95. He's watching two possible negatives that could pressure the stock in the near-term -- the streaming service could potentially be cannibalistic for Disney's broadcast subscribers, and 2018 earnings estimates have come down. ""I would like to get this [Disney] as a gift. If the market has a sell-off and you get this at $95...that would be a great price to get it at. I just don't think you have to chase it here,"" he said. Trader Disclosure: Pete Najarian owns Disney. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

In a blog post following Disney’s streaming announcement last month, BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said Disney could lose up to $2 billion a year with third-party licensing revenue. “Uncertainty regarding potential [over-the-top] investment losses has held back many investors from buying Disney shares,” wrote UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson in a note to investors. While Disney management has offered little to no details to help settle uncertainty, Mitchelson believes investors’ concerns are overblown. Ryvicker said she expects management to clear up concerns during the company’s investor conference on Thursday. But she too thinks concerns are overblown. In the last three months, Disney shares have declined 4.5%.

She did, however, lower estimates for 2018, but remains above consensus. “We’ve had time to digest BAMTech and the related streaming apps and think the street’s negativity is overdone,” Ryvicker wrote. “Even ‘modest dilution’ from BAMTech is probably conservative. In fact, like Lucas, we may see no real dilution given offsets from other parts of the business. “We like this entry point as Disney’s 15x next twelve months price to earnings ratio has tended to be the trough for the past four years.

Ryan Vlastelica,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 1, 2017 7:37 a.m. ET By Vanguard, the biggest name in passive investing, is starting to act more like an activist. In an open letter addressed to the directors of all public companies, most of which it is a sizable investor in, the asset-managing giant called on U.S. companies to improve their governance, and outlined new factors—including ones related to diversity and climate issues—that it said were increasingly important in its evaluation of such practices. See also: Vanguard voted against Wells Fargo directors A push by Vanguard could be enough for boards to change their policies, particularly if it threatens to use its voting rights on these topics. The letter comes at a time when Vanguard is amassing massive inflows as investors move to the kind of low-fee passive products the firm is synonymous with. According to June data from Morningstar, Vanguard has taken in more than $177.3 billion in inflows across its products thus far in 2017, about as much as its 10 closest competitors combined. Meanwhile, more than half of the 852 fund families Morningstar follows had outflows.

                                   another major player in the passive investing space, is taking a similar tact. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said “passive managers have to become more active—not to the point that they’re becoming activists, but they need to be more active in the dialogue they’re having with the management.” He added: “We have to be a change agent, if necessary.” More detail: Passive funds aren’t afraid to throw their weight around as activists Vanguard’s letter outlined what it called the “four pillars” it looks at in evaluating corporate governance practices, including the composition and experience of the company’s board of directors, governance structures, risk oversight, and appropriate compensation. While many of these themes are standard, Vanguard highlighted how gender diversity among corporate boards is something it is increasingly aggressive in pushing for. “Gender diversity is one element of board composition that we will continue to focus on over the coming years. We expect boards to focus on it as well, and their demonstration of meaningful progress over time will inform our engagement and voting going forward,” read the letter, which was written by William McNabb, Vanguard’s chief executive officer. In pushing for greater gender diversity, Vanguard follows State Street, which in July voted against the reelection of directors at 400 companies, citing gender diversity issues. Separately, Morgan Stanley in February advocated for looking at gender issues when evaluating companies for their investment prospects. “There is compelling evidence that boards with a critical mass of women have outperformed those that are less diverse,” Vanguard’s letter read. “Diverse boards also more effectively demonstrate governance best practices that we believe lead to long-term shareholder value. Our stance on this issue is therefore an economic imperative, not an ideological choice.” Related: Why it matters that women are underrepresented among portfolio managers Read: This ETF bets that companies with female leadership will outperform While the letter didn’t say so explicitly, it implied that Vanguard might be compelled to vote against a slate of nominees with few or no female candidates. Vanguard noted that it had recently joined the 30% Club, an organization dedicated to increasing the number of female directors to 30%. While 73.5% of U.S. companies have at least one female director, according to a 2015 report from MSCI, just 20.1% have three or more. The other issue Vanguard newly highlighted was climate change, which it classified under its risk-oversight category. It called climate risk “an example of a slowly developing and highly uncertain risk—the kind that tests the strength of a board’s oversight and risk governance.” It called for “materially-driven, sector-specific disclosures” on climate issues—for example, a company’s carbon footprint—that it said “will better illuminate risks in a way that aids market efficiency and price discovery.” As with gender diversity, Vanguard argued that its advocacy for climate disclosures “is based on the economic bottom line for Vanguard investors,” adding, “As significant long-term owners of many companies in industries vulnerable to climate risk, Vanguard investors have substantial value at stake.” Read: Trump’s environmental policies are ‘galvanizing’ use of green ETFs Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

Paul Ziobro,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 6, 2017 6:59 p.m. ET By Toys ""R"" Us Inc. has retained lawyers from Kirkland & Ellis LLP to help restructure $400 million in debt due next year, a person familiar with the matter said, the latest move by the toy chain as it struggles with growing online competition. The Wayne, N.J.-based retailer has been burdened with debt since private-equity owners Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust took it private in 2005 for $6.6 billion. It has swapped debt coming due this year and next for longer-term debt with a higher interest rate, and analysts had expected it to do the same with a $400 million bond due next year. Toys ""R"" Us could successfully restructure its debt without seeking bankruptcy protection, Wells Fargo analyst Tim Conder said in a research note. But he added lenders are becoming leery working with retailers given the number of bankruptcies and online competition from Amazon.com Inc. and others. Toys ""R"" Us, which operates about 875 stores in the U.S. and another 765 abroad, has previously indicated it was working with bankers at Lazard on a potential debt refinancing. Kirkland & Ellis's restructuring group, with more than 100 lawyers, has long been one of the go-to law firms for companies looking to revamp operations or to restructure their finances. The law firm has represented a number of troubled retailers -- including Payless, Gymboree, BCBG Max Azria and rue21 -- that have sought bankruptcy protection within the past year. CNBC earlier reported that Toys ""R"" Us had hired Kirkland. Toys ""R"" Us says it is looking at a number of options in managing its debt load, which stood at $5.2 billion in June. The company had a net loss of $36 million on revenue of $11.5 billion for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. It has been unprofitable in each of the last four years. ""As we previously discussed on our first-quarter earnings call, Toys ""R"" Us is evaluating a range of alternatives to address our 2018 debt maturities, which may include the possibility of obtaining additional financing,"" spokeswoman Amy von Walter said. The company plans to update investors on the refinancing activities and other plans during a second-quarter earnings call later in September, she said. In a research report released Wednesday, Fitch Ratings warned the company will continue to lose market share to Target, Wal-Mart and Amazon and need to invest in lower prices and its online operations. The ratings firm said Toys R Us ""will not be able to grow out of its capital structure and will largely remain dependent on favorable credit markets to refinance debt on an ongoing basis."" It rates the company's debt at CCC, which indicates it is a substantial credit risk. Toys ""R"" Us said in June that sales fell 4.9% for the quarter ended April 29, compared with the year-earlier period. The decline followed a weak holiday season for the company, a critical period in which sales at U.S. stores open at least a year fell 2.5%. The sales have recently been hit by tough competition for baby products, as well as weak performances by some of its top brands such as Lego AS. Lego earlier this week reported its first decline in sales in 13 years and said it would cut 8% of its workforce. Another toy maker, Mattel Inc., replaced its chief executive earlier this year after a slide in holiday sales. Soma Biswas contributed to this article.

Hollywood has had its worst summer box office in more than 10 years, with a summer movie season that won’t crack the $4 billion mark. BMO analysts say the total U.S. box office is down about 5% this year. “In addition to lackluster performance at the box office, we blame an over-saturated movie market, fatigue in certain properties associated with multiple sequels, and competition from entertainment from other screens for underperformance of movie-related toys,” BMO said. See also: Hollywood is already trying to put dismal summer box office behind it Lego A/S announced that sales for the first half of 2017 fell 5% year-over-year, its first revenue decline in 13 years. The company plans to cut 1,400 jobs as a result. Sales had gotten a boost from toy sets tied to movies. However, sales in mature markets like the U.S. and Europe have slowed and, according to Jørgen Vig Knudstorphe, Lego brand group chairman, the company’s structure has grown “overly complex.” See also: Lego sales hit brick wall; 8% of workforce cut Shares of both Hasbro Inc.

Investor expectations about the contribution of these toys to company profits have risen in kind. However, BMO analysts contacted industry executives about sales of toys tied to movies and got “overwhelmingly negative” responses. “The main reason for underperformance, in our view, is that there are too many movies being released and released too frequently,” BMO wrote. “Aside from cannibalization, the rapid release of new movies makes each movie less relevant, less able to stand out amongst a crowded field, and limits general buzz.” BMO rates Hasbro shares market perform, but cut its price target to $90 from $95.

KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts are more bullish about toys. “We expect the toy industry to continue to benefit from several fundamental drivers, including developed and emerging-market household formation, accelerating industry shifts toward entertainment and content-driven properties, and an adoptable business model in an evolving retail landscape (e-commerce),” analysts wrote in a note published last week. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng called “entertainment-backed toys” a differentiator for toy manufacturers, and said Hasbro was “best-in-class” due to products tied to Marvel, “Star Wars,” Disney Princess and Transformers. KeyBanc also favors Hasbro over Mattel because of Hasbro’s “integrated content model and entertainment calendar.” Don’t miss: Everything new on Netflix in September, and what’s leaving Mattel’s Chief Executive Margo Georgiadis said on the company’s July earnings call that “Cars 3” toy sales were shaping up to be on the lower end of the company’s plan. In more recent retail checks conducted by Stifel analysts, several entertainment properties, including “Cars 3” and “Despicable Me 3” were discounted. Domestic box office numbers for both of those movies, along with “Transformers: The Last Knight,” the latest installment of the Transformers franchise, were down from their predecessors. “August is typically a slower period (at retail) for the category, but provides some confirmation around product that worked/didn’t work during calendar second-quarter, and a glimpse of what’s to come for the holidays,” Stifel said in a Tuesday note. Stifel rates Hasbro, Mattel and Jakks Pacific shares hold. “Based on these and other findings, from a trading perspective, we have a neutral/slightly negative near-term bias on the group,” the Stifel note said.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ordered a federal district judge to revisit the case, which concerned behavior predating the 2008 financial crisis and recent scandals concerning Wells Fargo’s own practices, after the Supreme Court made it easier for some whistleblowers to sue. “We look forward to stating our legal position with the district court,” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Elise Wilkinson said. Robert Kraus, a former Wachovia Corp controller, and Paul Bishop, a former World Savings Bank mortgage salesman, had accused their employers of hiding mortgage improprieties and billions of dollars of losses. They said this enabled the lenders, along with San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, to falsely certify their compliance with banking laws, and borrow or receive aid from the Federal Reserve at favorable rates. Wachovia bought World Savings’ parent Golden West Financial Corp, an adjustable-rate mortgage specialist, for $24.2 billion in 2006, and Wells Fargo took over both for $12.7 billion at the end of 2008. The plaintiffs sued under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers pursue claims that the government was defrauded and, if successful, share in recoveries. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn dismissed the case in 2015, and the appeals court upheld his decision in May 2016. But the next month, the Supreme Court ruled in another case that some courts made it too hard to pursue False Claims Act cases, and said whistleblowers could sue over misrepresentations that were “material to the government’s payment decision.” Ordered to reconsider Kraus’ and Bishop’s case, the appeals court directed Cogan to apply this new materiality standard to their claims. Tejinder Singh, a partner at Goldstein & Russell representing the whistleblowers, in an interview said the decision serves as a warning for companies. “Going forward, companies will likely feel far less safe taking undue advantage of government programs, and when they do transgress it will be easier for whistleblowers and the government itself to obtain redress,” he said. Wells Fargo is also combating fallout from practices including its creation of up to 3.5 million unauthorized accounts, charging 800,000 borrowers for unneeded auto insurance, and enrolling a potential 528,000 customers for online bill-paying without permission. The case is U.S. ex rel. Bishop et al v Wells Fargo & Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-2449. ","

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"Tim Sloan, CEO of the third-largest U.S. bank, said at an industry conference hosted by Barclays that expenses will likely account for 60 percent to 61 percent of revenues in the second half of 2017, down slightly from the previous three quarters. However, Sloan said the expense estimate does not include nonrecurring costs, including litigation costs that exceed the amount the bank has already set aside. Wells Fargo does not disclose how much it sets aside for litigation, but said in its second-quarter financial filing that such costs could exceed that amount by as much as $3.3 billion. That number was $2 billion in the bank’s first-quarter filing. Sloan, who has called Wells Fargo’s efficiency ratio unacceptable, said he expects the bank to return to its long-term target efficiency ratio of 55 percent to 59 percent some time next year. Wells Fargo shares rose 1.2 percent to $51.27 on Tuesday. The bank’s full-year net interest income will likely increase by the low- to mid-single digits from 2016, the CEO said. Third-quarter lending will be slowed by reduced activity in autos, the runoff of its junior lien mortgage portfolio, and what Sloan called a “slower and more competitive” environment for commercial real estate lending. He said the declines would be partially offset by increased nonconforming residential first mortgage lending. Wells Fargo’s business has been under pressure for the past year after the bank initially disclosed it had opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customer authorization over several years. The ensuing scandal led to a company-wide review that turned up problems with other products, including auto and life insurance. Last month, Wells Fargo said the unauthorized accounts totaled as many as 3.5 million. Sloan’s predecessor John Stumpf resigned last year and other senior executives and board members have resigned or been fired. On Tuesday, Sloan faced questions over whether new issues would emerge. “I can’t promise its exactly over,” he said. He noted management changes, internal reviews and other steps the bank has taken since the scandal emerged. “We’ve been very focused on opening every door and turning over every rock in the company,” he said.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial institutions with exposure to U.S. properties hit by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are tempering their loss estimates, as the damage to homes and businesses has been far less severe than expected. Late last week, before Irma hit Florida, reports that the vast majority of homeowners hit by Harvey had no flood insurance stoked fears about a wave of foreclosures and substantial losses for heavily exposed banks. Now that lenders have had a chance to survey the damage, they are not nearly as concerned. Irma ranked as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes until it barreled into the Florida Keys on Sunday, and was downgraded to a tropical storm early on Monday. Harvey, which hammered Louisiana and Texas in late August, was also downgraded to a tropical storm and lost steam as it moved inland. “There will be some issues but relatively few compared to what I would have thought a week ago.” Texas Capital Bancshares Chief Executive Keith Cargill said at an investor conference hosted by Barclays on Monday. Regions Financial Corporation, based in Birmingham, Alabama, with operations throughout the U.S. Southeast, estimated it could lose $10 million to $20 million out of $3.2 billion in total exposure to Hurricane Harvey, according to a financial filing early Monday. The bank has 25 branches in Houston. Regions still has no estimates for Irma, which forced it to close 460 branches, but Chief Financial Officer David Turner said at the conference that estimates for past hurricanes had a history of being excessive. Citing Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005, Turner said, “We originally thought our loss estimates were going to be around $100 million, and we lost less than $10 million.” Shortly after Harvey hit, data firm CoreLogic estimated $18  billion to $27 billion of residential uninsured flood loss for affected counties. Those losses would be borne by banks, bondholders, government agencies and people who own their homes outright, analysts said. Investors will have a better idea of whether those estimates prove too high when the largest U.S. consumer banks speak at the conference on Tuesday. Executives from Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co are all scheduled to give presentations. ","

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada’s dollar, which has soared over 12 percent against its U.S. counterpart since May, will give up some of those gains in coming months as the boost from Bank of Canada interest rate hikes begins to fade, a Reuters poll found on Monday. The loonie notched its strongest level since May 2015 on Friday at C$1.2063 after the BOC surprised some investors on Wednesday with its second rate increase in three months. The BOC’s moves have driven Canadian bond yields above their U.S. peers for the first time in about three years, adding to the loonie’s allure. However, the central bank is likely done raising interest rates this year, a Reuters poll of primary dealers showed on Thursday, though the central bank is seen charting a more aggressive tightening path for 2018 than had been anticipated earlier. “Just as the Bank of Canada turned on the rate hike cycle with very short notice, they could also turn it off very quickly if the currency strengthens too much,” said Daniel Katzive, head of FX strategy North America at BNP Paribas. The Canadian dollar was seen weakening to C$1.2300 in a month from around C$1.2160 on Monday, the median forecast in a poll of over 40 foreign exchange strategists showed. From there, the currency is expected to soften to C$1.2400 in three months before stabilizing. “While there is scope for further (BOC) tightening (over the coming months), we would expect that it would occur at a more gradual pace,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo. Gains for the loonie have come despite the uncertain prospects of the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, given that most of Canada’s exports go to the United States. Canadian, U.S. and Mexican officials began negotiations last month to update the trade pact. However, U.S. President Donald Trump recently said he would probably need to terminate NAFTA to get what he considers a fair trade deal. The Canadian currency has also shrugged off recent volatility in crude oil prices, one of the country’s major exports. U.S. crude prices tumbled more than 3 percent on Friday on worries energy demand would be hit hard by Hurricane Irma, and they extended their decline early on Monday. “In our view we are already overshooting a little bit in USD-CAD relative to what’s a long term sustainable level,” Katzive said. His estimate of fair value for the currency is around C$1.2700. While primary bond dealers’ prevailing view in a Reuters poll was of no more BOC rate hikes in the rest of 2017, the overnight index swap market reflects traders’ view of a nearly three-in-four chance of the central bank hiking again by December. “We still think the Bank of Canada is going to move again later on in the year, but this one (a rate hike by December) is priced in,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial. “What’s not priced in is a Federal Reserve hike. If we are right (and the Fed hikes in December), the U.S. dollar could make a comeback later in the year or the beginning of next year,” he added. ","

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Elizabeth Warren, who opposes efforts to dismantle a new rule allowing customers to sue financial companies in class actions, released letters on Tuesday from U.S. bank CEOs in which they declined to defend lobbying against the measure and several said they already comply with it. Warren asked the bank CEOs if they believed the rule should be reversed. “Despite the claims of their paid lobbyists, not a single one of the 16 CEOs I wrote was willing to defend efforts to gut the (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s) pro-consumer arbitration rule,” she said in a statement. The letters to liberal Warren showed Capital One , Bank of America, Ally Financial, T.D. Bank and HSBC North America rarely use mandatory arbitration clauses, where customer must give up the right to sue and agree to take possible future disputes to closed-door mediation as a condition of opening accounts. American Express, Citi, JPMorgan Chase & Co, PNC and SunTrust give new customers the opportunity to opt out of the clauses within a limited timeframe, the letters show. The rule, finalized by the CFPB in July, does not end arbitration. Instead, it says customers cannot be forced to only use arbitration in settling disputes. The practice has spread like wildfire across industries following the Supreme Court 2011’s decision that the clauses are legal. The banking industry says the rule, effective next year, will drive up costs with time-consuming class actions. It also says arbitration is more effective in delivering restitution to individuals. A CFPB study found customers receive higher awards through arbitration than lawsuits on average but noted fewer arbitration cases lead to awards. Saying the rule only benefits trial attorneys, Republicans in the House of Representatives swiftly voted to kill it. The Senate, where Democrats and some conservatives say the rule restores customers’ constitutional rights to due process, has been slower to act. Under the Congressional Review Act, both chambers must approve a repeal resolution to kill the rule. Democrats also say arbitrations are rigged against customers because they are handled out of the public eye and arbitrators are often paid by companies. Mandatory arbitration clauses have grabbed the spotlight over the last year, after they blocked customers from suing Wells Fargo & Co in the phony account scandal. Equifax Inc included arbitration clauses when it offered credit monitoring to victims of its recent hack, but then removed them under public pressure. ","

The sale of the business is the first step in the planned divestment of non-core assets and the proceeds would be used to repay term loan debt, Teva said. Saddled with about $35 billion in debt, Teva has speeded up plans to divest non-core assets, Reuters reported last month, citing sources. “Investors will like this news, as in addition to a good price for the asset, and the recent share decline has been likely due in part to investor worries that the debt burden is high,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a note. Teva’s U.S.-listed stock has halved since early August when it cut its forecasts. The company said on Monday it continued to look for divestiture opportunities, including the sale of the remaining assets of its global women’s health business, as well as its oncology and pain businesses in Europe. Teva said it expects to generate at least $2 billion in total proceeds from the sale of these businesses, as well as additional asset sales to be executed by the end of 2017. The deal with Cooper includes Teva’s manufacturing facility in Buffalo, NY, which makes Paragard exclusively. Paragard, an intrauterine copper contraceptive device, posted revenue of about $168 million for the year ended June 30.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"(Reuters) - Mike Cagney, one of the most prominent executives in the U.S. financial technology sector, will step down as chief executive of Social Finance, the online lender he co-founded, before the end of the year. In a note to employees on Monday night, Cagney said “a combination of HR-related litigation and negative press have become a distraction from the company’s core mission” focusing attention on him personally. One of the most valuable private financial technology startups in the United States, the San Francisco-based company known as SoFi launched an investigation this month into claims that current and former employees were sexually harassed at work. SoFi said Cagney would stay in his role as CEO until a successor was found. He will be immediately replaced as chairman by Tom Hutton, managing director of a venture capital firm focused on insurance and financial technology and an early investor in the company. “I want SoFi to focus on helping members, hiring the best people, and growing our company in a way consistent with our values. That can’t happen as well as it should if people are focused on me, which isn’t fair to our members, investors, or you,” Cagney wrote in the company-wide memo. A former Wells Fargo trader and hedge fund manager, Cagney co-founded SoFi in 2011 with a mission to take on the banks in the student loan market. He targeted so-called HENRYs - High Earners Not Rich Yet - from elite institutions such as Stanford and Harvard. The timing proved fortuitous – young students were skeptical of traditional banks in the wake of the financial crisis and flocked to the new platform. Since then, the company has branched out into a variety of financial services businesses, ranging from mortgages to an in-house hedge fund. But it has stayed true to its non-traditional roots, hosting cocktail parties, yoga sessions and singles meetups for its customers, which it refers to as members. Cagney told Reuters last year that those types of activities were “critical to brand,” but would make it hard for the firm to win approval from regulators for a banking license. Without a deposit base, the company has relied on investors to fund its lending business. The company has lent over $20 billion to more than 350,000 borrowers in the past six years. SoFi was valued at more than $4 billion at its most recent funding round, which happened earlier this year. It is the second-most valuable venture-backed financial technology startup in the United States, and its backers include investment heavyweights such as SoftBank and Silver Lake Partners. The company’s recent woes echo problems elsewhere in the technology sector. Ride-hailing company Uber, also based in San Francisco, is struggling to overcome allegations of sexual harassment and executive misconduct and venture capitalists have also faced criticism over their treatment of female entrepreneurs.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"(In 4th paragraph, corrects company name to Aberdeen Standard Investments, not Aberdeen Standard Life) By Noel Randewich and Sinead Carew SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Investors have flocked to U.S. defense stocks amid escalating tensions with North Korea and President Donald Trump’s promises to boost the military, but with towering valuations, their steepest gains may be behind them. The S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense index has risen 23 percent year-to-date, more than double the S&P 500’s 10 percent increase, and is set for its strongest annual gain since 2013. Partly due to North Korea, the index is now valued at about 20.5 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, its highest since 1999, according to analysts. While defense stocks may continue to spike briefly when rhetoric between the United States and North Korea is at its most aggressive, strategists question whether valuations can expand much more. “To have significant outperformance, it would take large-scale military operations, or a belief the global economy is significantly weakening,” said Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston. The defense sector’s fortunes may depend more on budgetary matters. If North Korea tensions stay high, it may be easier for a deeply divided Congress to pass the 2018 budget, Morris said. Still, investors should be realistic about spending growth. “The expectation is that you are going to have a larger increase in the defense budget, but I think some of that is a little too bullish,” said Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins, pointing to fiscal hawks in the Republican Party. Trump, a Republican, tweeted on Tuesday that he would let Japan and South Korea buy more U.S. military gear, but government approval of weapon sales to foreign countries can take years. The potential profit boost from a war with North Korea is difficult to estimate. Such a conflict could require additional U.S. spending of at least $100 billion, according to research firm Capital Alpha Partners. The military cost of invading and occupying Iraq from 2003 through 2010 was about $715 billion, it said, citing a Congressional Research Service report. Lockheed Martin Corp, the maker of F-35 fighter jets and the Pentagon’s No. 1 weapons supplier, said in August that customers were increasingly asking about missile defense systems. But while the U.S. invasion of Iraq helped Lockheed increase 2003 sales by 19 percent, according to the company’s quarterly filings, it did little for the stock price. The shares jumped 8 percent in the week before the March 20, 2003, invasion but were down 5 percent a year later. If a stock market correction occurs, the defense sector may prove more resilient because weapons are still must-have items for governments. But the sector’s financial performance does not look poised to catch up with stock gains. While analysts expect S&P 500 aerospace and defense companies to increase earnings per share by 10.3 percent in 2017, they see revenue growth of only 1.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Maybe the bottom line is that the stocks are a little ahead of fundamentals,” said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth will take a mild hit in the current quarter from Hurricane Harvey that slammed into Texas, but the outlook for the coming year remained steady in the latest Reuters poll, suggesting lost output will likely be recouped. Harvey was the most powerful storm to hit Texas in more than 50 years, killing over 60 people and displacing more than 1 million citizens. It also forced a temporary closure of refineries and the governor of Texas said the damage was around $180 billion. Asked about the impact of Hurricane Harvey on economic growth in the current quarter, the median forecast from 48 economists who answered an extra question was for a 0.3 percentage point hit to seasonally adjusted annualized growth. But the impact was expected to be short-lived according to economists, who responded to the survey Sept 7-12 before and as another powerful storm, Hurricane Irma, ripped through the Caribbean and then Florida, killing more than 60, displacing and leaving millions of households without power. Previously, major hurricanes like Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012 had cost more than half of the GDP growth rate for the respective quarters the storms hit. But data following those storms also suggest that the U.S. economy was able to add solid job numbers and bounce back from government reconstruction efforts. “A storm of this magnitude is likely to have negative near-term effects on nationwide economic data. If flooding remains disruptive for several weeks, we would expect a drag on non-farm payrolls, but the historical experience here is mixed,” said James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse. “The effect on GDP is even more ambiguous, since many costs of dealing with the storm actually boost growth, offsetting some of the lost income and output.” President Donald Trump’s administration struck a deal with Democrats that includes $15.25 billion in aid for areas affected by Hurricane Harvey and other natural disasters. Still, the range of forecasts suggests not everyone is convinced of just a mild dent in growth. “Hurricane Harvey could pose a sizeable drag, given the presence of high-value-added energy sectors in the Gulf Coast region and the timing of the storm’s landfall,” wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, in a note to clients. Barclays predicted a 1.0 to 1.5 percentage point hit, which was the most pessimistic call in the poll. Despite that, the latest Reuters poll consensus was for the U.S. economy to expand an annualized 2.6 percent in this quarter and 2.5 percent in the next. That was up a bit from the previous predictions of 2.5 and 2.4 percent for the respective quarters in the August poll as economists had already begun upgrading their growth forecasts for the current quarter before Hurricane Harvey struck. But inflation expectations have been lowered slightly from the previous month, with the core PCE price index - the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation - not expected to reach the central bank’s 2 percent target at least until 2019. The consensus is for core PCE inflation to average 1.4-1.9 percent in each quarters from the current through the end of next year. In the August poll, the predictions were for it to average 1.5-2.0 percent. Still, the Fed is widely expected to announce steps at its meeting next week to start shrinking its balance sheet, worth over $4 trillion. The survey of nearly 100 economists showed the central bank is expected to raise the federal funds rate once more in the final three months of this year, to 1.25-1.50 percent. But 44 of 73 economists who answered an extra question said their conviction for another Fed rate hike this year has decreased. The remaining 29 said it had stayed the same. “We still have a December rate hike call, but recent developments are making the path to a December rate hike more narrow,” said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo. That lack of confidence amongst poll participants is mainly driven by the divide among Fed policymakers on the outlook for inflation and future interest rate hikes.

""We are not bullish on the stock market,"" Christopher Harvey, the firm's head of equity strategy, said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""We think that investors should start moving up the quality ladder."" According to Harvey, this year won't end the way it began with stocks ripping to new highs. He expects the S&P 500 to drop about 1 percent this year from current levels. His year-end price target is 2,475. ""Hold on to your gains. You want to start protecting,"" he added.

Harvey's goal is to play more for rotation and small, incremental gains. ""We think there are opportunities on an individual basis,"" he said. ""We like staples over consumer discretionary. We like REITs over utilities. We like hardware over semiconductors."" Yet, there is something that could push Harvey back into bullish territory— one that has nothing to do with pro-business legislation such as tax cuts potentially coming out of Washington. ""What we want to see is a healthy repricing for risk. Something in or around 5 percent seems about right. We're not arguing that the fundamentals are bad,"" Harvey said. ""What we're arguing is price isn't all that attractive for us. So, if we get a correction or we get a pullback on price, that would make us more excited.""

Jeff Cox,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"Nearly eight years to the day from when Lehman Brothers collapsed and set fire to the financial world, widely followed analyst Mike Mayo said the industry has fully rebounded. ""I don't feel as though the world understands just how strong U.S. banks are. Banks have the strongest balance sheets in a generation,"" Mayo, an analyst now with Wells Fargo Securities, told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" program. ""They have enough capital to absorb not one financial crisis but two financial crises."" That wasn't the case on March 15, 2009, when Lehman lost its ability to obtain the short-term financing critical to its operations. After a weekend of heavy wrangling to find the buyer, the government chose to let Lehman go under rather than provide a buyout. The ensuing liquidity crisis saw a prominent money market fund fail to meet its own obligations and triggered a crisis that necessitated a massive Wall Street buyout. Fast-forward to 2017, and conditions have changed dramatically, Mayo said. ""We think banks are on the cusp of creating value for the first time in a decade,"" he said. ""This is back-to-school. Take out your pencil, sharpen it, do the math. When you do the math, you see these banks are very resilient."" While Mayo spoke glowingly of the industry, he is most focused these days on Citigroup. Mayo estimates the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets could double in price over the next five years, with a long-term target of $140. There's irony in that call, seeing that Mayo is well-known for haranguing Citi in the past. In 2010, he ripped the bank for what he called ""aggressive"" accounting and said it needed a substantial write-down in assets. ""We love Citigroup,"" he told CNBC. As far as the industry is concerned, he said, ""this is the biggest structural risk reduction the bank industry has had for decades. These structural changes are what's going to continue to drive banks."" Despite the optimism, the sector has fared poorly in the market this year. The SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund is down about 3.3 percent for 2017, well off the S&P 500's gain of more than 11 percent. But analysts continue to favor the sector. Moody's Investors Service said earlier this week that it was putting Bank of America on notice for an upgrade of its credit rating. BofA currently carries a Baa1 rating, which on the Moody's scale is at the lower end of investment grade. However, the ratings service said it is encouraged by ""recent improvements to BAC's profitability and management's commitment to a conservative risk profile."" Moody's also said the bank is shaking loose of the mortgage legacy and litigation issues it had that were related to the financial crisis. Bank of America's purchase of Countrywide Financial, in particular, left it with costs related to mortgage improprieties.

Liz Moyer,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"People who are worried about whether their personal information was compromised in the Equifax data breach may be in for another unpleasant surprise: being forced to settle claims against the credit reporting company in arbitration instead of joining forces with other wronged consumers to sue in court. Equifax is allowing people to sign up on its website for free identity theft protection and credit file monitoring following the disclosure Thursday of the data breach, which Equifax said was detected July 29 and affected 143 million consumers. But the credit monitoring service, through an Equifax company called Trusted ID, has a provision that limits liability to the company, and consumers who sign up for what is billed as a free service will be charged for it after a one-year trial period if they don't call the company to cancel their subscription. The provisions, buried in the fine print of Trusted ID's terms of service, added to confusion on Friday about how much help consumers are being offered. In a broader set of terms on Equifax's website, visitors are told they must accept certain terms, including arbitration, before being permitted to register for and purchase any product from its site. ""You also agree to be bound by this agreement by using or paying for our products or taking other actions that indicate acceptance of this agreement,"" it says. TrustedID's terms also include this mandatory arbitration provision. But Equifax's general terms have an arbitration opt-out provision for consumers who know to look for it and notify Equifax in writing within 30 days to a snail mail P.O. box address in its headquarters city of Atlanta. TrustedID's terms do not include that opt-out provision, something that could trip up consumers if they sign up for the service. ""You're not going to find a lot of consumers who would read the lengthy terms of use, especially when they've been told on the previous page that they will get it for free,"" said Allison Zieve, the director of litigation for Public Citizen, a consumer protection group, who adds she believes Equifax's general opt-out clause wouldn't apply to TrustedID. Scott Nelson, who is also a lawyer at Public Citizen, says Equifax uses broad terms to cover activities that fall under arbitration, though he notes that many consumers have never intentionally entered into a formal customer relationship with Equifax. Equifax is one of three major credit reporting companies that collect data on hundreds of millions of people. That data is used by lenders to judge individuals' creditworthiness to buy a home, take out a credit card or obtain insurance. But there is no requirement that people go to the credit reporting firms to access that information, much less look at their websites, Nelson said. Companies have pushed consumers to accept arbitration for a broad range of financial services and ""it hasn't always held up. Courts look at it on a case-by-case basis,"" Nelson said. Most recently Wells Fargo has pushed back at lawsuits over its own arbitration requirements in the fake account scandal, Nelson added. Arbitration usually results in less money recovered for consumers in disputes with companies. On Friday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a relatively new consumer watchdog agency created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, issued a statement calling Equifax's required arbitration for credit monitoring ""troubling."" ""It is troubling that Equifax is forcing people to waive legal rights in order to receive fraud monitoring after the company's breach put their personal information at risk. Equifax could remove this clause so that consumers can receive this service without condition."" The agency has been battling Republicans over a new rule set to go into effect next year that would prevent companies from forcing consumers to waive their rights to class-action lawsuits. The rule will apply to new transactions beginning next March, but House Republicans have already voted to repeal it and the Senate could take up its own repeal measure as early as next week. New York's Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, likewise said in a post on Twitter Friday that the arbitration language was ""unacceptable and unenforceable,"" adding that his staff had contacted the company to get them to remove it. His office opened an investigation into the data breach. Equifax's website says the arbitration provision (again, assuming one doesn't opt out) applies to ""any claim, dispute, or controversy between You and Us relating in any way to Your relationship with Equifax, including but not limited to any Claim arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Products or this Site, or any information You receive from Us, whether based on contract, statute, common law, regulation, ordinance, tort, or any other legal or equitable theory, regardless of what remedy is sought."" But there is another out for consumers in the small print: an individual can take Equifax to small claims court, where disputes are usually for amounts of $10,000 or less, as long as the claim isn't combined with the claim of another person.

Yen Nee Lee,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"Economic disruptions caused by a back-to-back pummeling from hurricanes in the United States may just seal the deal for the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates intact for the rest of this year, experts told CNBC on Monday. Hurricane Irma is still making its way up Florida's coast, but Goldman Sachs and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch have slashed their growth projections for the third quarter by 1 percentage point and 0.4 percentage point, respectively, due to Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana. ""I think it may be an excuse for the Fed to hold back again from raising interest rates. I think that will be a logical conclusion,"" Hugh Young, Aberdeen Standard Investments' Asia head, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" on Monday. Fed officials, in their most recent projections, had indicated one more rate hike this year on top of the two they already approved in March and June. But weak inflation data have led to dovish statements from Fed speakers, leading market participants to believe the next hike won't happen until well into 2018. New York Fed President William Dudley, in an interview with CNBC on Friday when Irma was poised to begin battering Florida, acknowledged that the two hurricanes could impact the timing of rate hikes. But he said rebuilding efforts following the storms will boost economic activity in the long run. Beyond the hurricanes, there are other factors standing in the way of a rate hike this year. One factor is the uncertainty over who the next Fed chair will be, noted Frank Lavin, chief executive of business consultancy Export Now. ""Don't forget we've got several Fed vacancies now and that typically, historically, mitigates against Fed movements because everybody takes more of a wait-and-see attitude. They don't want to politicize the hearings of the next chair … so everybody tends to just quieten down a bit,"" he said on CNBC's ""The Rundown"" on Monday. As market participants continue to ponder the timing of the Fed's next move, what's certain for now is insurance and reinsurance firms will take a hit to earnings due to the back-to-back hurricanes, the experts said. ""I think by and large, for the re-insurers and the primary insurance companies as well, this is going to be an earnings event. You'll see this ease into earnings. By and large, not everyone will report profits for the full year,"" said Elyse Greenspan, equity research analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday. Greenspan projected the insurance industry to lose around $60 billion, with $40 billion from Irma and $20 billion from Harvey.

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Thanks to its ongoing fake-accounts scandal, which we recently discovered was worse than initially reported, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has been among the worst performers in the banking industry. In fact, over the past year, the financial sector has been one of the hottest areas of the market, up by more than 22%, while Wells Fargo has fallen by 0.4%. Here's a rundown of Wells Fargo's problems, it's recent business results, and whether it could be a smart long-term investment now. WFC data by YCharts To make a long story short, in September 2016, Wells Fargo revealed that employees may have opened just over 2 million unauthorized accounts to meet ambitious sales targets. As a result, the bank agreed to pay $185 million in fines, made significant leadership changes, and ended its sales culture of trying to maximize cross-selling success at any cost. Many of Wells Fargo's customers have discovered accounts that they didn't authorize. Image source: Getty Images. A recently released third-party review, which covered a longer time period than the original estimate, found that the problem was even worse than originally thought. The number of improperly opened accounts rose to as many as 3.5 million. In addition to the fake-accounts drama, the bank has been the subject of a few smaller scandals as well. In July, it was revealed that Wells Fargo wrongly charged more than 800,000 car loan borrowers for auto insurance they didn't need. About a month before that, the company was accused of making unauthorized changes to many of its home loans. In August, the bank faced additional scrutiny for failing to refund guaranteed auto protection insurance money to some borrowers. Most recently, the bank has been accused of improperly raising customers' mortgage rates. Despite these setbacks, the damage done to Wells Fargo by these scandals may not be as bad as you think. The first quarter of 2017 definitely showed a slump in earnings and revenue, and a lower level of efficiency than is typical for the bank. In its second-quarter earnings report, however, the bank showed characteristically strong return on assets and return on equity metrics, as well as an improvement in efficiency. Wells Fargo typically runs a leaner and more profitable operation than the rest of the ""big four"" U.S. banks, and it doesn't look as if the fake-accounts scandal is going to change that -- although the gap has narrowed a bit. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts To be clear, Wells Fargo is certainly guilty of some bad behavior over the past decade or so. And its business could continue to suffer as a result. However, from a long-term perspective, these issues should all be temporary in nature. Wells Fargo has made appropriate changes to address the problems with its sales culture, and in the wake of the recent scandals coming to light, you can bet that the bank will be on its best behavior for the foreseeable future. Wells Fargo's largest shareholder is Warren Buffett-led conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), and Buffett has stood by the bank. Shortly after news of the fake-accounts scandal broke, Buffett called the bank an ""incredible institution"" that made a terrible mistake. Just recently, when asked about the possibility of more negative Wells Fargo headlines, Buffett didn't seem too concerned. ""What you find is that there's never just one cockroach in the kitchen,"" Buffett told CNBC. In other words, when one bad behavior is brought to light and everyone starts to take a closer look, it's common to find more issues. However, Buffett said he's still not concerned about the bank as a long-term investment: ""It's a terrific bank. ... There were some things that were very wrong done there, but they are being corrected."" I agree with Buffett. We could certainly see even more negative headlines, and it's entirely possible that Wells Fargo could continue to underperform its sector in the near term. From a long-term perspective, however, this could be an opportunity to get into a great bank at a discount. ","

John Maxfield,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For investors in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), one of the most important questions right now facing the bank is whether, in the wake of its fake-account scandal, it can continue producing the same type of returns and growth that made it a market darling in the not-so-distant past. The early indications aren't good. You can see this in the chart below, which compares the year-over-year growth rate of Wells Fargo's book value per share to the average of the six largest banks in the country. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. Prior to the third quarter of last year, Wells Fargo would almost invariably grow faster each quarter than its largest rivals. Over the three preceding years, there was only one quarter out of 12 in which this wasn't the case. Since the third quarter of 2016, however, everything has changed. That was when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed that Wells Fargo's unreasonably high sales quotas led thousands of its employees to create millions of fake accounts for customers. In the four quarters since then, including the quarter in which the scandal was disclosed, Wells Fargo's book value per share growth has lagged its megabank peers every quarter. Most recently, in the three months ended June 30, Wells Fargo's book value per share grew only 3.1% compared to the average among the six largest banks of 4.9%. The Wells Fargo Center looms over downtown Portland, Oregon. Image source: Getty Images. It's impossible to say for sure at this point whether this is a sign of things to come for Wells Fargo or, rather, just a temporary setback. On the one hand, elevated expenses associated with the scandal's legal fees will eventually dissipate. But, on the other hand, Wells Fargo's decision, which it had no choice but to make, of scrapping its former in-branch sales strategy, could indeed throttle the bank's long-term growth. Historically, one of the principal levers that Wells Fargo pulled on to fuel its growth has been cross-selling products to existing customers. If you have a checking account and walked into a branch, the bank's tellers would try to sell you a credit card or savings account. But Wells Fargo abandoned sales quotas in the wake of its scandal, causing new account openings to fall on a year-over-year basis by 30% to more than 40%, depending on the account type. The net result is that, while Wells Fargo and loyal shareholders like Warren Buffett continue to claim that the bank hasn't lost any of its long-term mojo, there's a growing amount of quantitative data to suggest otherwise.

    Wells Fargo's Growth Rate Is Slowing Down -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. This year is almost certainly one that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) would like to have a do-over, as the performance of its stock proves. Since the beginning of 2017, shares of the nation's third-biggest bank by assets have lost 10%. That in and of itself makes Wells Fargo's performance seem dismal. But making it even more so is the fact that the S&P 500 has gained 10% over the same stretch. KBWB data by YCharts. Wells Fargo's disappointing performance can be traced to two causes, the first of which is that bank stocks in general have underperformed the market this year. As you can see, the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap banks, is only marginally higher for the year compared to the 10% rally in large-cap stocks more generally. There isn't anything wrong with banks per se. The issue rather is that they seem to be taking a breather after an impressive 2016 performance, when the KBW Bank Index grew by 26% relative to the S&P 500's 10%. KBWB data by YCharts. This is the opposite of the Dogs of the Dow effect, in which the worst-performing stocks in one year have in the past tended to be among the best-performing stocks the next year. In addition to this larger industry trend, Wells Fargo has also suffered from serious self-inflicted wounds over the past 12 months. It was at this time last year, that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau revealed that the California-based bank had spent years opening up as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts for customers without customers' approval or often even their knowledge. This story was soon followed by a tsunami of negative headlines about Wells Fargo's alleged retaliation against employees within the bank who had tried to bring the practice to the attention of their superiors, the board of directors, and even the former chairman and CEO John Stumpf, who resigned in the wake of the scandal. John Stumpf, the former chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo. Image source: Wells Fargo. More recently, Wells Fargo has disclosed that similar practices led 500,000 auto-loan customers to be charged for a type of vehicle insurance that they did't want or need. An estimated 20,000 of those ended up defaulting on their loan payments as a result of the added charge and had their cars repossessed. And just this past month, the bank updated its estimate of the number of illicit accounts opened in the original scandal, which had been disclosed by the CFPB last year. Wells Fargo now believes that closer to 3.5 million accounts were wrongfully opened. Suffice it to say, none of this has been good for Wells Fargo, which has seen its fundamental performance lag while the sentiment toward its stock has soured throughout the market. It's for these reasons, in turn, that shares of Wells Fargo have trailed its industry and the broader market more generally since the beginning of the year. ","
      
    Here's Why Wells Fargo Stock Has Underperformed This Year -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're an investor, arguably the last thing you want or expect to see from any of the companies you own is a scandal or public relations nightmare. But let's face the facts: It happens from time to time. Usually when a company or its management team is alleged of wrongdoing, it becomes a red flag for Wall Street and investors, and as you might expect, it tends to have a decisively negative impact on the share price of a stock in question. Sometimes these PR flubs turn into genuine nightmares for investors, while others tend to blow over and create excellent buying opportunities. Put plainly, it's impossible to predict which side of the dial a PR scandal will land in (Dumpster fire or buying opportunity) with perfect accuracy. Nevertheless, I would suggest that three recent scandals present an intriguing buying opportunity for long-term investors with an open mind. Image source: Getty Images. Teva is also standing on the right side of a numbers game. As the leading manufacturer of generic drugs, it stands to benefit from an elderly population that could grow dramatically in the decades to come. Seniors require more prescription medicines than younger adults, thus volume can be a key to Teva's success. Though generic drug pricing isn't all that strong now, it should stabilize within the next year or two, which will again put the ball back into Teva's court. Having recently inked a new CEO and valued at just five times forward earnings, Teva could be worth a shot for opportunistic investors. Image source: Getty Images. Syndros is a drug that Wall Street believes could generate approximately $300 million in annual sales, which is roughly what Subsys was bringing in on an extrapolated basis at its peak. Assuming Insys receives some clarity on Subsys, takes its lumps, and stabilizes sales of the drug, it's not out of the question that it will be bringing in around $1 in full-year EPS by the end of the decade. We could be talking about a cash flow positive, single-digit P/E stock in just a few years, which is what makes Insys a potentially intriguing buy. Image source: Getty Images. Investors should also take into account that Wells Fargo has been a top-notch bank for a long time. Even though it may not be in consumers' good graces at the moment, it avoided catastrophe during the Great Recession by staying away from risky derivative plays and focusing on the bread and butter of banking: loans and deposits. The company's most recent quarterly results showed a healthy return on assets of 1.21%, low net charge-offs, deposit and loan growth, and a well-capitalized balance sheet. Though there could be a short-term period of weaker growth stemming from the company's fake-account scandal, it's unlikely there will be a multiyear follow-through that adversely impacts its results. Therefore, opportunistic value and income seekers may want to give Wells Fargo a closer look. ","
      
    3 PR Scandals Creating Intriguing Buying Opportunities  -- The Motley Fool

Keith Speights,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is one of the most underappreciated big pharma stocks on the market right now. That's the thought that occurred to me as I listened to Brent Saunders, Allergan's CEO, speak at the Wells Fargo Healthcare Conference on Thursday. One thing's for sure, though: Underappreciated stocks don't stay that way for too long. Investors eventually begin to see the value in the stock, interest increases, and the stock moves higher. I think that's going to happen with Allergan. Here are three top reasons investors should consider buying this big pharma stock right now. Image source: Getty Images. Allergan stock trades at less than 13 times expected earnings. That alone gives the stock a more attractive valuation than many big pharma stocks. But there's an even better reason Allergan is a bargain: its growth potential. The consensus among Wall Street analysts is that Allergan will grow earnings by more than 13% annually over the next five years. Is that doable? I think so -- and I'll point out why shortly. Factoring in that rate of growth, Allergan's PEG ratio is only 1.06. There are only three large-cap biopharma stocks on the market that have lower PEG ratios -- AbbVie, Celgene, and Shire. Why is Allergan positioned well for growth over the long run? Let's start with its medical-aesthetics business. Botox continues to be a rock-solid product for Allergan, with sales increasing 13.5% year over year in the second quarter. Juvederm sales jumped more than 17% higher than the prior-year period. The company also acquired Zeltiq Aesthetics earlier this year, a move that bolsters its lineup in medical aesthetics. Consumer penetration for Allergan's medical-aesthetics products is really low -- between 5% and 10%. The company sees the market for men and millennials as great growth opportunities. There is also huge potential for what Allergan calls its ""six stars."" These pipeline candidates include migraine drugs ubrogepant and atogepant, and uterine-fibroids drug Esmya. Two late-stage programs that intrigue me even more, though, are abicipar and cenicriviroc (CVC). Abicipar could be one of the most powerful treatments for age-related macular degeneration ever, while CVC holds promise in treating what some have dubbed the ""next hepatitis C"" -- non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. You've no doubt heard the old saying ""Bet on the jockey, not on the horse."" My view is that both jockey and horse are important. Allergan is the horse, while CEO Brent Saunders is the jockey. I think both are good bets. I respect Saunders for his leadership on drug pricing with Allergan's social contract announced last year. His is a voice of sanity that balances responsibilities to shareholders with acknowledging the important role drugmakers have in society. But I also think Saunders has made some very smart business moves. Selling off the Actavis generics business to Teva (NYSE:TEVA) was one of them. While it was a good deal for Teva, it was even better for Allergan. The company should be able to achieve more success focusing on specialty drugs. Another smart move, in my view, was Saunders' decision to partner with Editas Medicine (NASDAQ:EDIT) to develop CRISPR gene-editing drugs for eye diseases. Allergan became the first big pharma to collaborate with the small gene-editing pioneer earlier this year. In January, Saunders said he thought the biopharmaceutical industry was ""entering what could be a golden age"" with advances including CRISPR genomic editing. I think he's right -- and that the alliance with Editas could pay off tremendously over the next few years. The wild card that could really change the dynamics for Allergan is the prospects for acquisitions. Allergan's previous growth stemmed largely from making deals. Saunders hasn't been shy about scooping up smaller companies, including Zeltiq earlier this year. He mentioned at the Wells Fargo conference that Allergan is likely to make more bolt-on acquisitions. However, Saunders also said he thinks ""there will be another wave of consolidations"" in the industry. He added that he'd like for Allergan to ""be on the offense"" with respect to this wave. That could mean bigger deals lie ahead. ","

With approximately $6.1 trillion in assets under management, hedge funds have the ability to throw considerable weight around the market. Sometimes it can seem like a herd mentality as the smart money begins buying up the same stocks. To find out which stocks the smart money has formed a consensus on, personal finance website WalletHub examined the most recent SEC disclosures filed by more than 400 hedge funds to find their biggest holdings, newest positions, and recent exits. Below are the five most popular stocks owned by the smart money crowd. Image source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is literally just a few dollars away from becoming the first company to be valued at $1 trillion. If Apple was a country, CNBC says the tech giant would be one of the world's top 20 economies. As the world awaits the introduction of the eighth iteration of the iPhone, it seems only a matter of when, not if, Apple crosses the threshold of that landmark achievement. Although Apple still generates almost two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone, its services business is enjoying phenomenal growth and is the segment to watch. It started from a small base, but it's been piling on double-digit growth rates and has become Apple's second-largest segment behind iPhones, generating more than $24 billion in sales last year. Apple has proven it is more than a one-trick pony, it's understandable why hedge funds have made this the most popular stock. Similarly, it would be a dumb move if the smart money wasn't heavily backing the most successful investor of all time. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) has set a solid foundation for the portfolios of those who put their faith -- and money -- with the Oracle of Omaha. Historically, Berkshire has delivered performance beyond that achieved by the market indexes, which, given Buffett's typical disdain for investing in risky stocks, has made his level of outperformance all that more remarkable. BRK.B data by YCharts Still, Buffett has grown more comfortable with stocks he once shunned. For example, although once being averse to buying tech stocks, Buffett has been buying up large tranches of Apple stock since last year and today Berkshire Hathaway owns about 130 million shares, giving it a 2.5% stake in the device maker and earning Buffett billions of dollars in return. Image source: Facebook. While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the third most popular stock among the smart money crowd, they've shown a willingness to pay up for the leading social media platform. Over the first six months of 2017, the period of the WalletHub analysis, Facebook's stock rose 30% while the market itself only gained 7%. Since then, Facebook has padded its lead -- it's now up 50% year to date -- and trades at 37 times trailing earnings and 26 times next year's estimates. FB data by YCharts. Yet with the social network still expected to grow its earnings at least 26% over the next five years, its multiple is not as excessive as you might think considering the potential for expansion. Because Facebook is positioning itself to capitalize on some major trends, it's a bet that should pay off for years to come. After gaining for much of 2017, Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) suffered a bit of a summer swoon in June only to rebound in July before succumbing again and trading sideways in August. Still, its performance has justified the bet the smart money placed on it. Now, however, the tech giant is embroiled in a number of controversies that take away from the growth potential of its ad revenue monetization policies. That revenue continues to climb higher, rising 18% year over year as advertising shifts from television to digital. From the $2.7 billion fine the EU slapped on Google for its search results manipulation to being accused of pressuring a think tank to fire a scholar who applauded the move, there's a lot of sound and fury swirling around Alphabet's policies that's temporarily drowned out its potential. Image source: Wells Fargo. But if you're looking for a poster child for scandal, you really can't do any worse than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), the fifth most popular stock among hedge funds. And unlike the others on this list, the banking giant's stock has woefully underperformed and is down more than 7% year to date, whereas rivals like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (the sixth most popular stock) is up 8% in 2017. The numerous sales scandals that have plagued Wells Fargo and beaten down its shares are likely what is causing the smart money to see an opportunity to buy the stock on the cheap. Most of the negative press has been factored into the share price, and it would take another major scandal flaring up again (always a possibility) to weaken it further. If Bank of America can rise again after knowing scandal itself, Wells Fargo can bounce back too. Rich has been a Fool since 1998 and writing for the site since 2004.

    These Are the 5 Most Popular Smart Money Stocks -- The Motley Fool

"Travis Hoium, Jeremy Bowman, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos",09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Index funds and exchange-traded funds can be some of the easiest ways to invest in the market without doing the research or taking the risk investors should put into owning individual stocks. And depending on what kind of financial goals you have and where you see investing opportunities, there are dozens of funds that can meet your goals. We asked three of our investors for their favorite index funds or ETFs and Fidelity MSCI Information Tech (NYSEMKT:FTEC), Vanguard High Dividend Yield (NASDAQMUTFUND:VHDYX), and SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:SPY) were at the top of the list. Here's a look at why they're great ways to invest today. Image source: Getty Images. Jeremy Bowman (Fidelity MSCI Information Tech): It's no secret that tech stocks have surged this year as the five biggest stocks on the market (Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon.com) now all hail from the tech sector. And as technology seeps into more industries such as autos and payments, the sector will get even bigger. But picking your own basket of tech stocks can be tricky as the market is volatile and full of disruption. That's why I'd suggest going with an index fund like Fidelity MSCI Information Tech. FTEC offers exposure to the biggest tech companies -- the top four holdings are Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook -- and also holds consistent winners like Visa. Year to date, the ETF is up 25% and it's gained 30% over the last year. Since its inception in 2013, the fund has essentially doubled the S&P 500's returns, 81% to 41%. FTEC has a small expense ratio of 0.08%, meaning investors will pay just $0.80 on a $1,000 investment for management of the funds. The fund also offers a 1% dividend yield to reward investors just for holding the stock. Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Vanguard High Dividend Yield): Many income investors are looking for ways to boost their portfolios' yield. But in reaching for unusually high rates, you're usually taking on a big risk of a future dividend cut or freeze. Consider spreading out your bets instead with an index fund like Vanguard High Dividend Yield. This investment is tilted toward big U.S.-based companies that pay higher rates than the broader market. As a result, its overall yield is 3%, or a full percentage point above that of the S&P 500. The stocks that populate the fund aren't especially risky, either. In fact, investors will recognize many of the top holdings as true blue chips, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)). Vanguard's high dividend fund carries an absurdly low expense ratio, 0.15%, which will allow your investment to grow unburdened by the hefty fees that many managed funds charge. Its emphasis on slower-growing companies, meanwhile, might ensure periods of underperformance against the broader market. However, the fund's total return is likely to closely track stocks in general, especially if you choose to reinvest those hefty quarterly dividend payouts. Travis Hoium (SPDR S&P 500 ETF): Whether you're just starting investing or diversifying a large portfolio, getting exposure to the market as a whole can be a great investment decision. SPDR S&P 500 ETF is a fund that seeks to generate returns that ""correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index."" In other words, this is a way to buy every stock in the S&P 500 with very little in expenses. One of the big advantages of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF is that its $243 billion in assets under management means the sheer size allows it to charge very low fees. The expense ratio is just 0.0945% annually, likely making it more cost-effective for individual investors to buy than pay commissions to buy a highly diversified portfolio that holds even a fraction of the S&P 500's individual stocks. By definition, SPDR S&P 500 ETF isn't going to be a market-beating investment, but if you're looking to stay in the investing game without taking the risk of owning individual stocks, this is one of the best funds to accomplish that goal at very low cost.

    3 Top Index Funds to Keep You in the Investing Game -- The Motley Fool

Keith Speights,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's been a great year for Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) shareholders so far. The biotech stock is up more than 35% year to date. However, most of those gains were made in the first quarter, thanks to positive clinical results. Over the last five months, Jazz stock has retreated every time it seems to pick up momentum. Jazz Pharmaceuticals CEO Bruce Cozzad sat down at the Wells Fargo Healthcare Conference on Wednesday to field questions. Perhaps the most important question posed to Cozzad related to what investors should watch for in the rest of 2017 and into 2018. Here are the five key things Jazz's CEO listed in his response. Image source: Getty Images. Jazz won FDA approval on Aug. 3 for Vyxeos in treating two types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The company launched the drug in the U.S. roughly one week later. Jazz's third-quarter results should show some sales activity for Vyxeos, but the fourth-quarter results will be a better sign of how the launch is going. Vyxeos is expected to generate peak annual sales north of $200 million. It will be interesting to see how the drug fares in the early days of the launch, considering that Vyxeos combines two chemotherapies, daunorubicin and cytarabine, that are already on the market. However, in a phase 3 study, patients taking Vyxeos survived a median 9.6 months after treatment, compared with 5.9 months for patients taking the two chemotherapies separately. Cozzad mentioned several upcoming regulatory submissions planned by Jazz. Three should happen by the end of this year: European filing for Vyxeos in treating AML, and U.S. filings for JZP-110 in treating excessive sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and narcolepsy, and for an additional indication for Xyrem in treating pediatric narcolepsy. Another key regulatory submission should take place in the first quarter of 2018 for JZP-507, which is a low-sodium version of Xyrem. The submissions themselves won't move the needle for Jazz Pharmaceuticals stock, of course. However, Cozzad stressed that these are important for investors to monitor because they're prerequisites for winning approval and launching the drugs. Jazz picked up Vyxeos with its acquisition last year of Celator. The company recently bought option rights to ImmunoGen's (NASDAQ:IMGN) two early-stage, hematology-related antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) programs, as well as an additional program to be determined later. Cozzad said investors should watch for more deals, although he wouldn't predict when they might happen. The size of Jazz's deals could be bigger in the future than they've been in the past. Cozzad stated that Jazz is now a bigger company and should be able to invest more capital in larger deals ""that make sense."" He doesn't think the company necessarily needs to be in a hurry, though. Sales growth for Xyrem in the first half of 2017 was sluggish. Cozzad predicted a return to stronger growth for the drug in 2018. Jazz launched an educational campaign earlier this year to help narcolepsy patients better understand the disease. Cozzad thinks this campaign could potentially lead to an uptick in sales for Xyrem. He noted that there are around 13,000 patients taking the drug currently, but there are roughly 60,000 patients diagnosed with narcolepsy in the U.S. and many more on top of that who haven't yet been diagnosed. Jazz removed a key obstacle earlier this year by settling with Hikma Pharmaceuticals in a deal that allows Hikma to launch an authorized generic version of Xyrem in 2023. The company also settled with three other generic drugmakers in agreements that allow them to market generic versions of Xyrem after 2025. Cozzad said to watch for more settlements in the future. There are four other companies that have filed abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of Xyrem. Litigation between Jazz and these four companies has been combined into one case for which the trial date has not yet been set. Cozzad expects the trial to begin no earlier than the first half of 2018. He said that settlements could be more likely as the trial date approaches. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Over the past year, the financial sector has been one of the best-performing areas of the stock market. In fact, while the S&P 500 has gained 13%, the financial sector has risen by more than 20%. Despite this high level of performance, there are many excellent financial companies that still trade for surprisingly low P/E ratios. Company Recent Share Price Dividend Yield P/E Ratio (TTM) Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $49.88 3.1% 12.3 New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) $11.95 5.7% 13.1 BofI Holding (NYSE:AX) $25.35 N/A 12.6 Financial Sector Average   16.5 Data source: Share prices, dividend yields, and TTM P/E ratios from TD Ameritrade as of 9/7/2017. Sector P/E from gurufocus.com. Wells Fargo has been one of the worst performers in the financial sector over the past year, down by about 1% while the sector is up more than 20%. If you follow the financial news, you know the main reason for the poor performance. The bank has been the subject of several scandals, including the infamous fake-accounts scandal, in which bank employees improperly opened as many as 3.5 million accounts over a period of several years. Image Source: Getty Images. New York Community Bancorp has gotten absolutely crushed over the past couple of years, after a failed merger with Astoria Financial. The bank had made preparations for the merger, which included higher compliance expenses and a dividend cut, and it seems that investors have a general distrust of the bank's management as a result of the cancellation. As my colleague John Maxfield wrote, the bank made a pretty big mistake from which it has yet to fully recover. Even so, the bank's core business remains solid. New York Community Bancorp's main business focus is lending on rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartment buildings in New York City, which tend to have excellent tenant retention and minimal delinquencies. As a result, the bank's efficiency ratio is among the best in the sector, and default rates have been incredibly low, no matter what the market is doing. To be clear, I'm disappointed in the bank's execution over the past couple of years, but I do believe the stock represents a compelling long-term value. And in the meantime, shareholders get a 5.7% dividend yield while they wait for the dust to settle. With about $9 billion in assets, BofI Holding is much smaller than the other two banks on the list. It is about one-fifth the size of NYCB and just 0.5% the size of Wells Fargo. However, BofI is growing rapidly, which is the main reason I think it's a compelling investment at its current valuation. BofI, which stands for ""Bank of Internet,"" reported annual earnings growth of 13%, and impressive 16% and 14% growth in loans and deposits, respectively. In addition, the bank is venturing into new areas of the business, such as auto lending and unsecured personal loans, and it also expanded its relationship with H&R Block to exclusively provide the tax preparer's refund anticipation loans. In a nutshell, there's still a lot of untapped growth potential. Also, because of its online-only business model, BofI is one of the most profitable and efficient banks around. The bank's return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) are more than twice the industry's benchmarks, and total non-interest expense is less than half of the bank's peer group average, as a percentage of assets. BofI is a relatively young company and is likely to be the most volatile of the three stocks discussed here, but it also has the highest reward potential if its growth story continues. To be clear, a stock's P/E ratio is just one piece of the puzzle, and there are several other metrics that can be used in the valuation of stocks -- especially bank stocks. Price-to-book, price-to-tangible book, ROA, ROE, and efficiency ratio are just some examples of other useful metrics to take into consideration. Having said that, a low P/E ratio can still be a good indicator that stocks are trading cheaply, and I believe that to be the case with these three stocks. ","
      
    3 Rock Solid High-Yield Financial-Sector Dividend Stocks With a P/E Under 15 -- The Motley Fool

Eric Volkman,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's the investment vehicle of arguably the most legendary investor in the world, its portfolio never seems to stop growing, and its historical returns have been leagues better than many stock investments. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The main one is the most blatantly obvious. Berkshire Hathaway has produced shareholder returns that are nothing short of outstanding -- and through several economic recessions and scary market pull-backs, no less. Over the last 25 years, Berkshire Hathaway's total return has hit nearly 3,000%. No, I didn't accidentally add any zeroes to that figure. This trounces the growth of the S&P, which in itself is considerable at nearly 500%. That's because of the second reason I'm enamored of the company -- its laser-sharp eye for finding quality companies at bargain prices. Warren and his lieutenants achieve this through down-to-earth value investing, snapping up promising stocks when they're cheap and keeping them in the portfolio as they rise. It's the ultimate buy-and-hold strategy, and it works beautifully. Even some of the classic Berkshire stocks that have fallen out of favor with the market -- unhealthy beverage maker Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and scandal-prone bank Wells Fargo, to name two notable examples -- still boast returns that would make any portfolio manager's eyes water. If we reach back to the late 1980s, when Berkshire bought the Coca-Cola stake, we see that the soda giant has risen by over 1,700%. Tracking Wells Fargo since Berkshire's entry in the same timeframe shows that the bank's stock is up by nearly the same level, despite the company's many recent difficulties (and despite a sell-off of a tiny portion of Berkshire's big stake). Finally, although it's famous for a thoughtful, long-term investing strategy, Berkshire is admirably quick and flexible when it comes to opportunities that pop up in the market. A great recent example of this is its cashing out of 700 million Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) warrants, the culmination of a neat deal it engineered in 2011. Back then, Bank of America was one of the most wounded casualties of the previous decade's financial crisis, and the market largely shunned its stock even as other bank stocks rebounded. Betting big that it would recover, Warren and company pounced on the opportunity to eventually own a big stake in one of the four biggest U.S. lenders. That faith in Bank of America paid off. Actually, that's an understatement -- Berkshire's initial $5 billion investment is now worth more than three times that figure. At the beginning of this year, the once tech-adverse Buffett and his investment vehicle doubled down on its stake in Apple. Following that, the iPhone maker reported fiscal Q1 results that smashed records, and the stock saw a nice pop. It's generally moved higher since. There are countless examples in the sprawling Berkshire portfolio of ingeniously timed purchases like the Bank of America deal or the Apple buy. Over half a century ago, there was the massive American Express buy-in, at a time when it seemed an ugly financial scandal would encourage investors to leave the don't-leave-home-without-it company in droves. In other words, little has changed for Buffett and Berkshire. They have been making well-conceived and brilliantly timed investments for longer than some of us, myself included, have been alive. It's a remarkable, sustained performance, and the company richly deserves all of the investor love that flows from it. ","

Tonya Garcia,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 14, 2017 11:14 a.m. ET Wells Fargo finds the brand might be losing favor with core customers By L Brands Inc.’s Victoria’s Secret is losing customers on price, according to a consumer study conducted by Wells Fargo, and even the brand’s efforts to stock popular items like bralettes won’t bring them back. Wells Fargo’s study finds that 48% of customers polled had shopped at Victoria’s Secret less in the past year. And 28% said they plan to shop there less in the next 12 months. Of those who had shopped less over the past year, 58% said prices were too high, which, Wells Fargo said, makes it the top explanation for the attrition. “As L Brands has been known to take price up a bit each year with little resistance, it appears that the brand may be approaching a price ceiling, as prices may now be driving customers away,” the Wells Fargo note said, adding that Victoria’s Secret bras sell for 50% more than the competition, on average. See also:  L Brands problems extend beyond Victoria’s Secret bras to Bath & Body Works Victoria’s Secret also “may be falling out of favor,” with 68% of respondents saying they like the brand less than they used to. Of that group, 60% say they think the brand feels “forced” or “fake.” Wells Fargo analysts think a shift toward natural beauty and body acceptance may be putting Victoria’s Secret out of fashion. “We believe that new management in place at Victoria’s Secret recognizes the change in consumer attitude, and is attempting to tweak the Victoria’s Secret image to one that is more in line with current trends—brand imagery is now leaning toward more natural looks and relatable beauty,” analysts led by Ike Boruchow wrote. “However, given how fundamental the ‘sexy’ image is to the Victoria’s Secret brand, we believe a full-brand pivot to catch up with current trends may be challenging to execute.” Analysts note a decline in ratings for the televised Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.

Sales also fell 1% for the month to $842.1 million. The brand has a few problems working hand-in-hand. Victoria’s Secret has said that it wants to reinvigorate its “constructed bra” business, the lined, push-up bras the brand is known for. But those bras are usually more expensive than bralettes. There is the aforementioned trend toward a more natural look, which has led to sales growth for bralettes, undergarments that are unlined and popular with millennials and women who like sheer fashions.

These key shoppers are what analysts call “basic bra customers,” and their survey found that they are among those who say they plan to shop there less in the coming 12 months. “This could imply that as the company diversifies into auxiliary product categories, they are taking shelf space away from more productive categories that appeal across a broad range of consumers, and are thereby turning a large segment of their customer base away,” the note said. Analysts findings show that those who don’t buy Victoria’s Secret bralettes, don’t buy bralettes at all. Wells Fargo rates L Brands market perform, and cut its price target to $40 from $45.

                                   has $71.7 billion in assets. The rising popularity of the S&P-tracking funds reflects a multiyear shift into passive investing, where investors effectively buy an index of stocks. That’s in contrast to actively managed funds, where the holdings are individually selected by a portfolio manager. Not only do passive funds perform better than their actively managed peers over the long term, according to repeated studies, but they typically come with much lower fees. Eight of the top 10 funds in August charged an expense ratio of 20 basis points or less, which translates to $20 for every $10,000 invested. The iShares S&P fund charges a fee of 0.04%. More detail:  Active managers just lost one of their best arguments The August data is likely to rankle ETF critics, who charge that indiscriminate buying of all of an index’s components artificially inflates prices beyond what is justified by fundamentals. UBS, in a recent research report, wrote that such trends has sparked concerns about market price discovery and liquidity, adding, “we believe these worries are misguided and the concerns overblown.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Also: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Index funds dominated the list of August’s most popular funds, with an ETF tracking developed markets

The ProShares fund saw about $900 million in inflows in the month, accounting for a huge portion of its assets, which currently stand at about $1.5 billion, according to FactSet. As volatility has been trading near record lows, investors have been using inverse volatility products as a way to bet on further calm in the market.

Anneken Tappe,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 13, 2017 4:58 p.m. ET Sterling heads lower as U.K. wage data disappoint By The U.S. dollar rose against most of its major rivals Wednesday, as traders shook off a weaker-than-expected read of producer prices to focus on Thursday’s consumer-focused inflation figures. In Wednesday’s data, the headline producer-price index, and the core rate that strips out volatile food and energy, came in at 0.2% for August, compared with median estimates of 0.3%. The federal budget deficit for August amounted to $108 billion, meaning that the budget deficit in the year leading up to August was $674 billion—9% higher than a year ago. Those lackluster figures may put more emphasis on August consumer price inflation, due at 8.30 a.m. on Thursday, which is expected to come in at 0.3% on the month, up from 0.1% in July. The data will also provide a first read of the economic impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, with potential short-term changes in the data that could make a reading unusually volatile. Market participants wonder how the Federal Reserve will factor in a weak reading or a higher-than expected one, as it discusses monetary policy at its coming two-day meeting next week. “We firmly believe that economic reports are going to be influenced for many months or longer by these two massive hurricanes,” Wells Fargo’s senior global equity strategist Scott Wren said regarding Hurricane Harvey and Irma. “The Fed is likely going to take this into account when making monetary policy decisions and won’t be as purely data-dependent as its past rhetoric might suggest.” Hurricane Harvey buffeted the Houston area with historic floodwaters while Irma, although less catastrophic, lashed winds and a torrent of rain throughout Florida.

The data arrived a day before Thursday’s policy meeting at the Bank of England. “Before this morning’s data, there had been some speculation that the Bank of England’s Chief Economist [Andrew Haldane] would switch track tomorrow, and address above-target inflation by voting for a rate hike,” said Jake Trask, FX research director at payment platform OFX, in a note. “But [Thursday’s] reading will likely see him sit on his hands a while longer, to avoid adding pressure to consumers already facing rising prices,” said Trask. The Bank of England is widely expected to hold its key rate at 0.25%, but there has been speculation that Haldane and other policy makers may vote for a rate hike as inflation, now at 2.9%, has surpassed the bank’s target of 2%. Inflation pressures have been building largely as the pound has slid from around $1.50 after the Brexit referendum in June 2016. In theory, higher interest rates bolster the appeal of owning a country’s currency for traders, which can push up its value.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ordered a federal district judge to revisit the case, which concerned behavior predating the 2008 financial crisis and recent scandals concerning Wells Fargo’s own practices, after the Supreme Court made it easier for some whistleblowers to sue. “We look forward to stating our legal position with the district court,” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Elise Wilkinson said. Robert Kraus, a former Wachovia Corp controller, and Paul Bishop, a former World Savings Bank mortgage salesman, had accused their employers of hiding mortgage improprieties and billions of dollars of losses. They said this enabled the lenders, along with San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, to falsely certify their compliance with banking laws, and borrow or receive aid from the Federal Reserve at favorable rates. Wachovia bought World Savings’ parent Golden West Financial Corp, an adjustable-rate mortgage specialist, for $24.2 billion in 2006, and Wells Fargo took over both for $12.7 billion at the end of 2008. The plaintiffs sued under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers pursue claims that the government was defrauded and, if successful, share in recoveries. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn dismissed the case in 2015, and the appeals court upheld his decision in May 2016. But the next month, the Supreme Court ruled in another case that some courts made it too hard to pursue False Claims Act cases, and said whistleblowers could sue over misrepresentations that were “material to the government’s payment decision.” Ordered to reconsider Kraus’ and Bishop’s case, the appeals court directed Cogan to apply this new materiality standard to their claims. Tejinder Singh, a partner at Goldstein & Russell representing the whistleblowers, in an interview said the decision serves as a warning for companies. “Going forward, companies will likely feel far less safe taking undue advantage of government programs, and when they do transgress it will be easier for whistleblowers and the government itself to obtain redress,” he said. Wells Fargo is also combating fallout from practices including its creation of up to 3.5 million unauthorized accounts, charging 800,000 borrowers for unneeded auto insurance, and enrolling a potential 528,000 customers for online bill-paying without permission. The case is U.S. ex rel. Bishop et al v Wells Fargo & Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-2449. ","

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"Tim Sloan, CEO of the third-largest U.S. bank, said at an industry conference hosted by Barclays that expenses will likely account for 60 percent to 61 percent of revenues in the second half of 2017, down slightly from the previous three quarters. However, Sloan said the expense estimate does not include nonrecurring costs, including litigation costs that exceed the amount the bank has already set aside. Wells Fargo does not disclose how much it sets aside for litigation, but said in its second-quarter financial filing that such costs could exceed that amount by as much as $3.3 billion. That number was $2 billion in the bank’s first-quarter filing. Sloan, who has called Wells Fargo’s efficiency ratio unacceptable, said he expects the bank to return to its long-term target efficiency ratio of 55 percent to 59 percent some time next year. Wells Fargo shares rose 1.2 percent to $51.27 on Tuesday. The bank’s full-year net interest income will likely increase by the low- to mid-single digits from 2016, the CEO said. Third-quarter lending will be slowed by reduced activity in autos, the runoff of its junior lien mortgage portfolio, and what Sloan called a “slower and more competitive” environment for commercial real estate lending. He said the declines would be partially offset by increased nonconforming residential first mortgage lending. Wells Fargo’s business has been under pressure for the past year after the bank initially disclosed it had opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customer authorization over several years. The ensuing scandal led to a company-wide review that turned up problems with other products, including auto and life insurance. Last month, Wells Fargo said the unauthorized accounts totaled as many as 3.5 million. Sloan’s predecessor John Stumpf resigned last year and other senior executives and board members have resigned or been fired. On Tuesday, Sloan faced questions over whether new issues would emerge. “I can’t promise its exactly over,” he said. He noted management changes, internal reviews and other steps the bank has taken since the scandal emerged. “We’ve been very focused on opening every door and turning over every rock in the company,” he said.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial institutions with exposure to U.S. properties hit by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are tempering their loss estimates, as the damage to homes and businesses has been far less severe than expected. Late last week, before Irma hit Florida, reports that the vast majority of homeowners hit by Harvey had no flood insurance stoked fears about a wave of foreclosures and substantial losses for heavily exposed banks. Now that lenders have had a chance to survey the damage, they are not nearly as concerned. Irma ranked as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes until it barreled into the Florida Keys on Sunday, and was downgraded to a tropical storm early on Monday. Harvey, which hammered Louisiana and Texas in late August, was also downgraded to a tropical storm and lost steam as it moved inland. “There will be some issues but relatively few compared to what I would have thought a week ago.” Texas Capital Bancshares Chief Executive Keith Cargill said at an investor conference hosted by Barclays on Monday. Regions Financial Corporation, based in Birmingham, Alabama, with operations throughout the U.S. Southeast, estimated it could lose $10 million to $20 million out of $3.2 billion in total exposure to Hurricane Harvey, according to a financial filing early Monday. The bank has 25 branches in Houston. Regions still has no estimates for Irma, which forced it to close 460 branches, but Chief Financial Officer David Turner said at the conference that estimates for past hurricanes had a history of being excessive. Citing Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005, Turner said, “We originally thought our loss estimates were going to be around $100 million, and we lost less than $10 million.” Shortly after Harvey hit, data firm CoreLogic estimated $18  billion to $27 billion of residential uninsured flood loss for affected counties. Those losses would be borne by banks, bondholders, government agencies and people who own their homes outright, analysts said. Investors will have a better idea of whether those estimates prove too high when the largest U.S. consumer banks speak at the conference on Tuesday. Executives from Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co are all scheduled to give presentations. ","

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada’s dollar, which has soared over 12 percent against its U.S. counterpart since May, will give up some of those gains in coming months as the boost from Bank of Canada interest rate hikes begins to fade, a Reuters poll found on Monday. The loonie notched its strongest level since May 2015 on Friday at C$1.2063 after the BOC surprised some investors on Wednesday with its second rate increase in three months. The BOC’s moves have driven Canadian bond yields above their U.S. peers for the first time in about three years, adding to the loonie’s allure. However, the central bank is likely done raising interest rates this year, a Reuters poll of primary dealers showed on Thursday, though the central bank is seen charting a more aggressive tightening path for 2018 than had been anticipated earlier. “Just as the Bank of Canada turned on the rate hike cycle with very short notice, they could also turn it off very quickly if the currency strengthens too much,” said Daniel Katzive, head of FX strategy North America at BNP Paribas. The Canadian dollar was seen weakening to C$1.2300 in a month from around C$1.2160 on Monday, the median forecast in a poll of over 40 foreign exchange strategists showed. From there, the currency is expected to soften to C$1.2400 in three months before stabilizing. “While there is scope for further (BOC) tightening (over the coming months), we would expect that it would occur at a more gradual pace,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo. Gains for the loonie have come despite the uncertain prospects of the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, given that most of Canada’s exports go to the United States. Canadian, U.S. and Mexican officials began negotiations last month to update the trade pact. However, U.S. President Donald Trump recently said he would probably need to terminate NAFTA to get what he considers a fair trade deal. The Canadian currency has also shrugged off recent volatility in crude oil prices, one of the country’s major exports. U.S. crude prices tumbled more than 3 percent on Friday on worries energy demand would be hit hard by Hurricane Irma, and they extended their decline early on Monday. “In our view we are already overshooting a little bit in USD-CAD relative to what’s a long term sustainable level,” Katzive said. His estimate of fair value for the currency is around C$1.2700. While primary bond dealers’ prevailing view in a Reuters poll was of no more BOC rate hikes in the rest of 2017, the overnight index swap market reflects traders’ view of a nearly three-in-four chance of the central bank hiking again by December. “We still think the Bank of Canada is going to move again later on in the year, but this one (a rate hike by December) is priced in,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial. “What’s not priced in is a Federal Reserve hike. If we are right (and the Fed hikes in December), the U.S. dollar could make a comeback later in the year or the beginning of next year,” he added. ","

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Elizabeth Warren, who opposes efforts to dismantle a new rule allowing customers to sue financial companies in class actions, released letters on Tuesday from U.S. bank CEOs in which they declined to defend lobbying against the measure and several said they already comply with it. Warren asked the bank CEOs if they believed the rule should be reversed. “Despite the claims of their paid lobbyists, not a single one of the 16 CEOs I wrote was willing to defend efforts to gut the (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s) pro-consumer arbitration rule,” she said in a statement. The letters to liberal Warren showed Capital One , Bank of America, Ally Financial, T.D. Bank and HSBC North America rarely use mandatory arbitration clauses, where customer must give up the right to sue and agree to take possible future disputes to closed-door mediation as a condition of opening accounts. American Express, Citi, JPMorgan Chase & Co, PNC and SunTrust give new customers the opportunity to opt out of the clauses within a limited timeframe, the letters show. The rule, finalized by the CFPB in July, does not end arbitration. Instead, it says customers cannot be forced to only use arbitration in settling disputes. The practice has spread like wildfire across industries following the Supreme Court 2011’s decision that the clauses are legal. The banking industry says the rule, effective next year, will drive up costs with time-consuming class actions. It also says arbitration is more effective in delivering restitution to individuals. A CFPB study found customers receive higher awards through arbitration than lawsuits on average but noted fewer arbitration cases lead to awards. Saying the rule only benefits trial attorneys, Republicans in the House of Representatives swiftly voted to kill it. The Senate, where Democrats and some conservatives say the rule restores customers’ constitutional rights to due process, has been slower to act. Under the Congressional Review Act, both chambers must approve a repeal resolution to kill the rule. Democrats also say arbitrations are rigged against customers because they are handled out of the public eye and arbitrators are often paid by companies. Mandatory arbitration clauses have grabbed the spotlight over the last year, after they blocked customers from suing Wells Fargo & Co in the phony account scandal. Equifax Inc included arbitration clauses when it offered credit monitoring to victims of its recent hack, but then removed them under public pressure. ","

The sale of the business is the first step in the planned divestment of non-core assets and the proceeds would be used to repay term loan debt, Teva said. Saddled with about $35 billion in debt, Teva has speeded up plans to divest non-core assets, Reuters reported last month, citing sources. “Investors will like this news, as in addition to a good price for the asset, and the recent share decline has been likely due in part to investor worries that the debt burden is high,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a note. Teva’s U.S.-listed stock has halved since early August when it cut its forecasts. The company said on Monday it continued to look for divestiture opportunities, including the sale of the remaining assets of its global women’s health business, as well as its oncology and pain businesses in Europe. Teva said it expects to generate at least $2 billion in total proceeds from the sale of these businesses, as well as additional asset sales to be executed by the end of 2017.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"(Reuters) - Mike Cagney, one of the most prominent executives in the U.S. financial technology sector, will step down as chief executive of Social Finance, the online lender he co-founded, before the end of the year. In a note to employees on Monday night, Cagney said “a combination of HR-related litigation and negative press have become a distraction from the company’s core mission” focusing attention on him personally. One of the most valuable private financial technology startups in the United States, the San Francisco-based company known as SoFi launched an investigation this month into claims that current and former employees were sexually harassed at work. SoFi said Cagney would stay in his role as CEO until a successor was found. He will be immediately replaced as chairman by Tom Hutton, managing director of a venture capital firm focused on insurance and financial technology and an early investor in the company. “I want SoFi to focus on helping members, hiring the best people, and growing our company in a way consistent with our values. That can’t happen as well as it should if people are focused on me, which isn’t fair to our members, investors, or you,” Cagney wrote in the company-wide memo. A former Wells Fargo trader and hedge fund manager, Cagney co-founded SoFi in 2011 with a mission to take on the banks in the student loan market. He targeted so-called HENRYs - High Earners Not Rich Yet - from elite institutions such as Stanford and Harvard. The timing proved fortuitous – young students were skeptical of traditional banks in the wake of the financial crisis and flocked to the new platform. Since then, the company has branched out into a variety of financial services businesses, ranging from mortgages to an in-house hedge fund. But it has stayed true to its non-traditional roots, hosting cocktail parties, yoga sessions and singles meetups for its customers, which it refers to as members. Cagney told Reuters last year that those types of activities were “critical to brand,” but would make it hard for the firm to win approval from regulators for a banking license. Without a deposit base, the company has relied on investors to fund its lending business. The company has lent over $20 billion to more than 350,000 borrowers in the past six years. SoFi was valued at more than $4 billion at its most recent funding round, which happened earlier this year. It is the second-most valuable venture-backed financial technology startup in the United States, and its backers include investment heavyweights such as SoftBank and Silver Lake Partners. The company’s recent woes echo problems elsewhere in the technology sector. Ride-hailing company Uber, also based in San Francisco, is struggling to overcome allegations of sexual harassment and executive misconduct and venture capitalists have also faced criticism over their treatment of female entrepreneurs.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"(In 4th paragraph, corrects company name to Aberdeen Standard Investments, not Aberdeen Standard Life) By Noel Randewich and Sinead Carew SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Investors have flocked to U.S. defense stocks amid escalating tensions with North Korea and President Donald Trump’s promises to boost the military, but with towering valuations, their steepest gains may be behind them. The S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense index has risen 23 percent year-to-date, more than double the S&P 500’s 10 percent increase, and is set for its strongest annual gain since 2013. Partly due to North Korea, the index is now valued at about 20.5 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, its highest since 1999, according to analysts. While defense stocks may continue to spike briefly when rhetoric between the United States and North Korea is at its most aggressive, strategists question whether valuations can expand much more. “To have significant outperformance, it would take large-scale military operations, or a belief the global economy is significantly weakening,” said Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston. The defense sector’s fortunes may depend more on budgetary matters. If North Korea tensions stay high, it may be easier for a deeply divided Congress to pass the 2018 budget, Morris said. Still, investors should be realistic about spending growth. “The expectation is that you are going to have a larger increase in the defense budget, but I think some of that is a little too bullish,” said Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins, pointing to fiscal hawks in the Republican Party. Trump, a Republican, tweeted on Tuesday that he would let Japan and South Korea buy more U.S. military gear, but government approval of weapon sales to foreign countries can take years. The potential profit boost from a war with North Korea is difficult to estimate. Such a conflict could require additional U.S. spending of at least $100 billion, according to research firm Capital Alpha Partners. The military cost of invading and occupying Iraq from 2003 through 2010 was about $715 billion, it said, citing a Congressional Research Service report. Lockheed Martin Corp, the maker of F-35 fighter jets and the Pentagon’s No. 1 weapons supplier, said in August that customers were increasingly asking about missile defense systems. But while the U.S. invasion of Iraq helped Lockheed increase 2003 sales by 19 percent, according to the company’s quarterly filings, it did little for the stock price. The shares jumped 8 percent in the week before the March 20, 2003, invasion but were down 5 percent a year later. If a stock market correction occurs, the defense sector may prove more resilient because weapons are still must-have items for governments. But the sector’s financial performance does not look poised to catch up with stock gains. While analysts expect S&P 500 aerospace and defense companies to increase earnings per share by 10.3 percent in 2017, they see revenue growth of only 1.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Maybe the bottom line is that the stocks are a little ahead of fundamentals,” said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth will take a mild hit in the current quarter from Hurricane Harvey that slammed into Texas, but the outlook for the coming year remained steady in the latest Reuters poll, suggesting lost output will likely be recouped. Harvey was the most powerful storm to hit Texas in more than 50 years, killing over 60 people and displacing more than 1 million citizens. It also forced a temporary closure of refineries and the governor of Texas said the damage was around $180 billion. Asked about the impact of Hurricane Harvey on economic growth in the current quarter, the median forecast from 48 economists who answered an extra question was for a 0.3 percentage point hit to seasonally adjusted annualized growth. But the impact was expected to be short-lived according to economists, who responded to the survey Sept 7-12 before and as another powerful storm, Hurricane Irma, ripped through the Caribbean and then Florida, killing more than 60, displacing and leaving millions of households without power. Previously, major hurricanes like Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012 had cost more than half of the GDP growth rate for the respective quarters the storms hit. But data following those storms also suggest that the U.S. economy was able to add solid job numbers and bounce back from government reconstruction efforts. “A storm of this magnitude is likely to have negative near-term effects on nationwide economic data. If flooding remains disruptive for several weeks, we would expect a drag on non-farm payrolls, but the historical experience here is mixed,” said James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse. “The effect on GDP is even more ambiguous, since many costs of dealing with the storm actually boost growth, offsetting some of the lost income and output.” President Donald Trump’s administration struck a deal with Democrats that includes $15.25 billion in aid for areas affected by Hurricane Harvey and other natural disasters. Still, the range of forecasts suggests not everyone is convinced of just a mild dent in growth. “Hurricane Harvey could pose a sizeable drag, given the presence of high-value-added energy sectors in the Gulf Coast region and the timing of the storm’s landfall,” wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, in a note to clients. Barclays predicted a 1.0 to 1.5 percentage point hit, which was the most pessimistic call in the poll. Despite that, the latest Reuters poll consensus was for the U.S. economy to expand an annualized 2.6 percent in this quarter and 2.5 percent in the next. That was up a bit from the previous predictions of 2.5 and 2.4 percent for the respective quarters in the August poll as economists had already begun upgrading their growth forecasts for the current quarter before Hurricane Harvey struck. But inflation expectations have been lowered slightly from the previous month, with the core PCE price index - the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation - not expected to reach the central bank’s 2 percent target at least until 2019. The consensus is for core PCE inflation to average 1.4-1.9 percent in each quarters from the current through the end of next year. In the August poll, the predictions were for it to average 1.5-2.0 percent. Still, the Fed is widely expected to announce steps at its meeting next week to start shrinking its balance sheet, worth over $4 trillion. The survey of nearly 100 economists showed the central bank is expected to raise the federal funds rate once more in the final three months of this year, to 1.25-1.50 percent. But 44 of 73 economists who answered an extra question said their conviction for another Fed rate hike this year has decreased. The remaining 29 said it had stayed the same. “We still have a December rate hike call, but recent developments are making the path to a December rate hike more narrow,” said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo. That lack of confidence amongst poll participants is mainly driven by the divide among Fed policymakers on the outlook for inflation and future interest rate hikes.

And, if we go a lot higher from here, I think we're just stealing from tomorrow."" Despite his bearish view, he isn't avoiding stocks altogether. Harvey's goal is to play more for rotation and small, incremental gains. ""We think there are opportunities on an individual basis,"" he said. ""We like staples over consumer discretionary. We like REITs over utilities. We like hardware over semiconductors."" Yet, there is something that could push Harvey back into bullish territory— one that has nothing to do with pro-business legislation such as tax cuts potentially coming out of Washington. ""What we want to see is a healthy repricing for risk. Something in or around 5 percent seems about right. We're not arguing that the fundamentals are bad,"" Harvey said. ""What we're arguing is price isn't all that attractive for us. So, if we get a correction or we get a pullback on price, that would make us more excited.""

Jeff Cox,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"Nearly eight years to the day from when Lehman Brothers collapsed and set fire to the financial world, widely followed analyst Mike Mayo said the industry has fully rebounded. ""I don't feel as though the world understands just how strong U.S. banks are. Banks have the strongest balance sheets in a generation,"" Mayo, an analyst now with Wells Fargo Securities, told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" program. ""They have enough capital to absorb not one financial crisis but two financial crises."" That wasn't the case on March 15, 2009, when Lehman lost its ability to obtain the short-term financing critical to its operations. After a weekend of heavy wrangling to find the buyer, the government chose to let Lehman go under rather than provide a buyout. The ensuing liquidity crisis saw a prominent money market fund fail to meet its own obligations and triggered a crisis that necessitated a massive Wall Street buyout. Fast-forward to 2017, and conditions have changed dramatically, Mayo said. ""We think banks are on the cusp of creating value for the first time in a decade,"" he said. ""This is back-to-school. Take out your pencil, sharpen it, do the math. When you do the math, you see these banks are very resilient."" While Mayo spoke glowingly of the industry, he is most focused these days on Citigroup. Mayo estimates the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets could double in price over the next five years, with a long-term target of $140. There's irony in that call, seeing that Mayo is well-known for haranguing Citi in the past. In 2010, he ripped the bank for what he called ""aggressive"" accounting and said it needed a substantial write-down in assets. ""We love Citigroup,"" he told CNBC. As far as the industry is concerned, he said, ""this is the biggest structural risk reduction the bank industry has had for decades. These structural changes are what's going to continue to drive banks."" Despite the optimism, the sector has fared poorly in the market this year. The SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund is down about 3.3 percent for 2017, well off the S&P 500's gain of more than 11 percent. But analysts continue to favor the sector. Moody's Investors Service said earlier this week that it was putting Bank of America on notice for an upgrade of its credit rating. BofA currently carries a Baa1 rating, which on the Moody's scale is at the lower end of investment grade. However, the ratings service said it is encouraged by ""recent improvements to BAC's profitability and management's commitment to a conservative risk profile."" Moody's also said the bank is shaking loose of the mortgage legacy and litigation issues it had that were related to the financial crisis. Bank of America's purchase of Countrywide Financial, in particular, left it with costs related to mortgage improprieties.

Liz Moyer,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"People who are worried about whether their personal information was compromised in the Equifax data breach may be in for another unpleasant surprise: being forced to settle claims against the credit reporting company in arbitration instead of joining forces with other wronged consumers to sue in court. Equifax is allowing people to sign up on its website for free identity theft protection and credit file monitoring following the disclosure Thursday of the data breach, which Equifax said was detected July 29 and affected 143 million consumers. But the credit monitoring service, through an Equifax company called Trusted ID, has a provision that limits liability to the company, and consumers who sign up for what is billed as a free service will be charged for it after a one-year trial period if they don't call the company to cancel their subscription. The provisions, buried in the fine print of Trusted ID's terms of service, added to confusion on Friday about how much help consumers are being offered. In a broader set of terms on Equifax's website, visitors are told they must accept certain terms, including arbitration, before being permitted to register for and purchase any product from its site. ""You also agree to be bound by this agreement by using or paying for our products or taking other actions that indicate acceptance of this agreement,"" it says. TrustedID's terms also include this mandatory arbitration provision. But Equifax's general terms have an arbitration opt-out provision for consumers who know to look for it and notify Equifax in writing within 30 days to a snail mail P.O. box address in its headquarters city of Atlanta. TrustedID's terms do not include that opt-out provision, something that could trip up consumers if they sign up for the service. ""You're not going to find a lot of consumers who would read the lengthy terms of use, especially when they've been told on the previous page that they will get it for free,"" said Allison Zieve, the director of litigation for Public Citizen, a consumer protection group, who adds she believes Equifax's general opt-out clause wouldn't apply to TrustedID. Scott Nelson, who is also a lawyer at Public Citizen, says Equifax uses broad terms to cover activities that fall under arbitration, though he notes that many consumers have never intentionally entered into a formal customer relationship with Equifax. Equifax is one of three major credit reporting companies that collect data on hundreds of millions of people. That data is used by lenders to judge individuals' creditworthiness to buy a home, take out a credit card or obtain insurance. But there is no requirement that people go to the credit reporting firms to access that information, much less look at their websites, Nelson said. Companies have pushed consumers to accept arbitration for a broad range of financial services and ""it hasn't always held up. Courts look at it on a case-by-case basis,"" Nelson said. Most recently Wells Fargo has pushed back at lawsuits over its own arbitration requirements in the fake account scandal, Nelson added. Arbitration usually results in less money recovered for consumers in disputes with companies. On Friday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a relatively new consumer watchdog agency created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, issued a statement calling Equifax's required arbitration for credit monitoring ""troubling."" ""It is troubling that Equifax is forcing people to waive legal rights in order to receive fraud monitoring after the company's breach put their personal information at risk. Equifax could remove this clause so that consumers can receive this service without condition."" The agency has been battling Republicans over a new rule set to go into effect next year that would prevent companies from forcing consumers to waive their rights to class-action lawsuits. The rule will apply to new transactions beginning next March, but House Republicans have already voted to repeal it and the Senate could take up its own repeal measure as early as next week. New York's Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, likewise said in a post on Twitter Friday that the arbitration language was ""unacceptable and unenforceable,"" adding that his staff had contacted the company to get them to remove it. His office opened an investigation into the data breach. Equifax's website says the arbitration provision (again, assuming one doesn't opt out) applies to ""any claim, dispute, or controversy between You and Us relating in any way to Your relationship with Equifax, including but not limited to any Claim arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Products or this Site, or any information You receive from Us, whether based on contract, statute, common law, regulation, ordinance, tort, or any other legal or equitable theory, regardless of what remedy is sought."" But there is another out for consumers in the small print: an individual can take Equifax to small claims court, where disputes are usually for amounts of $10,000 or less, as long as the claim isn't combined with the claim of another person. At the end of one year, consumers who signed up for the TrustedID product will begin being charged an unspecified amount unless they cancel by calling the company. ""That's just not right,"" said Public Citizen's Zieve. ""They shouldn't be making money off the hack."" ",Equifax data breach victims could lose rights in court with one click
Yen Nee Lee,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"Economic disruptions caused by a back-to-back pummeling from hurricanes in the United States may just seal the deal for the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates intact for the rest of this year, experts told CNBC on Monday. Hurricane Irma is still making its way up Florida's coast, but Goldman Sachs and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch have slashed their growth projections for the third quarter by 1 percentage point and 0.4 percentage point, respectively, due to Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana. ""I think it may be an excuse for the Fed to hold back again from raising interest rates. I think that will be a logical conclusion,"" Hugh Young, Aberdeen Standard Investments' Asia head, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" on Monday. Fed officials, in their most recent projections, had indicated one more rate hike this year on top of the two they already approved in March and June. But weak inflation data have led to dovish statements from Fed speakers, leading market participants to believe the next hike won't happen until well into 2018. New York Fed President William Dudley, in an interview with CNBC on Friday when Irma was poised to begin battering Florida, acknowledged that the two hurricanes could impact the timing of rate hikes. But he said rebuilding efforts following the storms will boost economic activity in the long run. Beyond the hurricanes, there are other factors standing in the way of a rate hike this year. One factor is the uncertainty over who the next Fed chair will be, noted Frank Lavin, chief executive of business consultancy Export Now. ""Don't forget we've got several Fed vacancies now and that typically, historically, mitigates against Fed movements because everybody takes more of a wait-and-see attitude. They don't want to politicize the hearings of the next chair … so everybody tends to just quieten down a bit,"" he said on CNBC's ""The Rundown"" on Monday. As market participants continue to ponder the timing of the Fed's next move, what's certain for now is insurance and reinsurance firms will take a hit to earnings due to the back-to-back hurricanes, the experts said. ""I think by and large, for the re-insurers and the primary insurance companies as well, this is going to be an earnings event. You'll see this ease into earnings. By and large, not everyone will report profits for the full year,"" said Elyse Greenspan, equity research analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday. Greenspan projected the insurance industry to lose around $60 billion, with $40 billion from Irma and $20 billion from Harvey.

Thanks to its ongoing fake-accounts scandal, which we recently discovered was worse than initially reported, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has been among the worst performers in the banking industry. In fact, over the past year, the financial sector has been one of the hottest areas of the market, up by more than 22%, while Wells Fargo has fallen by 0.4%. Here's a rundown of Wells Fargo's problems, it's recent business results, and whether it could be a smart long-term investment now. WFC data by YCharts To make a long story short, in September 2016, Wells Fargo revealed that employees may have opened just over 2 million unauthorized accounts to meet ambitious sales targets. As a result, the bank agreed to pay $185 million in fines, made significant leadership changes, and ended its sales culture of trying to maximize cross-selling success at any cost. Many of Wells Fargo's customers have discovered accounts that they didn't authorize. Image source: Getty Images. A recently released third-party review, which covered a longer time period than the original estimate, found that the problem was even worse than originally thought. The number of improperly opened accounts rose to as many as 3.5 million. In addition to the fake-accounts drama, the bank has been the subject of a few smaller scandals as well. In July, it was revealed that Wells Fargo wrongly charged more than 800,000 car loan borrowers for auto insurance they didn't need. About a month before that, the company was accused of making unauthorized changes to many of its home loans. In August, the bank faced additional scrutiny for failing to refund guaranteed auto protection insurance money to some borrowers. Most recently, the bank has been accused of improperly raising customers' mortgage rates. Despite these setbacks, the damage done to Wells Fargo by these scandals may not be as bad as you think. The first quarter of 2017 definitely showed a slump in earnings and revenue, and a lower level of efficiency than is typical for the bank. In its second-quarter earnings report, however, the bank showed characteristically strong return on assets and return on equity metrics, as well as an improvement in efficiency. Wells Fargo typically runs a leaner and more profitable operation than the rest of the ""big four"" U.S. banks, and it doesn't look as if the fake-accounts scandal is going to change that -- although the gap has narrowed a bit. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts To be clear, Wells Fargo is certainly guilty of some bad behavior over the past decade or so. And its business could continue to suffer as a result. However, from a long-term perspective, these issues should all be temporary in nature. Wells Fargo has made appropriate changes to address the problems with its sales culture, and in the wake of the recent scandals coming to light, you can bet that the bank will be on its best behavior for the foreseeable future. Wells Fargo's largest shareholder is Warren Buffett-led conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), and Buffett has stood by the bank. Shortly after news of the fake-accounts scandal broke, Buffett called the bank an ""incredible institution"" that made a terrible mistake. Just recently, when asked about the possibility of more negative Wells Fargo headlines, Buffett didn't seem too concerned. ""What you find is that there's never just one cockroach in the kitchen,"" Buffett told CNBC. In other words, when one bad behavior is brought to light and everyone starts to take a closer look, it's common to find more issues. However, Buffett said he's still not concerned about the bank as a long-term investment: ""It's a terrific bank. ... There were some things that were very wrong done there, but they are being corrected."" I agree with Buffett. We could certainly see even more negative headlines, and it's entirely possible that Wells Fargo could continue to underperform its sector in the near term. From a long-term perspective, however, this could be an opportunity to get into a great bank at a discount. ","

John Maxfield,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For investors in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), one of the most important questions right now facing the bank is whether, in the wake of its fake-account scandal, it can continue producing the same type of returns and growth that made it a market darling in the not-so-distant past. The early indications aren't good. You can see this in the chart below, which compares the year-over-year growth rate of Wells Fargo's book value per share to the average of the six largest banks in the country. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. Prior to the third quarter of last year, Wells Fargo would almost invariably grow faster each quarter than its largest rivals. Over the three preceding years, there was only one quarter out of 12 in which this wasn't the case. Since the third quarter of 2016, however, everything has changed. That was when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed that Wells Fargo's unreasonably high sales quotas led thousands of its employees to create millions of fake accounts for customers. In the four quarters since then, including the quarter in which the scandal was disclosed, Wells Fargo's book value per share growth has lagged its megabank peers every quarter. Most recently, in the three months ended June 30, Wells Fargo's book value per share grew only 3.1% compared to the average among the six largest banks of 4.9%. The Wells Fargo Center looms over downtown Portland, Oregon. Image source: Getty Images. It's impossible to say for sure at this point whether this is a sign of things to come for Wells Fargo or, rather, just a temporary setback. On the one hand, elevated expenses associated with the scandal's legal fees will eventually dissipate. But, on the other hand, Wells Fargo's decision, which it had no choice but to make, of scrapping its former in-branch sales strategy, could indeed throttle the bank's long-term growth. Historically, one of the principal levers that Wells Fargo pulled on to fuel its growth has been cross-selling products to existing customers. If you have a checking account and walked into a branch, the bank's tellers would try to sell you a credit card or savings account. But Wells Fargo abandoned sales quotas in the wake of its scandal, causing new account openings to fall on a year-over-year basis by 30% to more than 40%, depending on the account type. The net result is that, while Wells Fargo and loyal shareholders like Warren Buffett continue to claim that the bank hasn't lost any of its long-term mojo, there's a growing amount of quantitative data to suggest otherwise.

    Wells Fargo's Growth Rate Is Slowing Down -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. This year is almost certainly one that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) would like to have a do-over, as the performance of its stock proves. Since the beginning of 2017, shares of the nation's third-biggest bank by assets have lost 10%. That in and of itself makes Wells Fargo's performance seem dismal. But making it even more so is the fact that the S&P 500 has gained 10% over the same stretch. KBWB data by YCharts. Wells Fargo's disappointing performance can be traced to two causes, the first of which is that bank stocks in general have underperformed the market this year. As you can see, the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap banks, is only marginally higher for the year compared to the 10% rally in large-cap stocks more generally. There isn't anything wrong with banks per se. The issue rather is that they seem to be taking a breather after an impressive 2016 performance, when the KBW Bank Index grew by 26% relative to the S&P 500's 10%. KBWB data by YCharts. This is the opposite of the Dogs of the Dow effect, in which the worst-performing stocks in one year have in the past tended to be among the best-performing stocks the next year. In addition to this larger industry trend, Wells Fargo has also suffered from serious self-inflicted wounds over the past 12 months. It was at this time last year, that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau revealed that the California-based bank had spent years opening up as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts for customers without customers' approval or often even their knowledge. This story was soon followed by a tsunami of negative headlines about Wells Fargo's alleged retaliation against employees within the bank who had tried to bring the practice to the attention of their superiors, the board of directors, and even the former chairman and CEO John Stumpf, who resigned in the wake of the scandal. John Stumpf, the former chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo. Image source: Wells Fargo. More recently, Wells Fargo has disclosed that similar practices led 500,000 auto-loan customers to be charged for a type of vehicle insurance that they did't want or need. An estimated 20,000 of those ended up defaulting on their loan payments as a result of the added charge and had their cars repossessed. And just this past month, the bank updated its estimate of the number of illicit accounts opened in the original scandal, which had been disclosed by the CFPB last year. Wells Fargo now believes that closer to 3.5 million accounts were wrongfully opened. Suffice it to say, none of this has been good for Wells Fargo, which has seen its fundamental performance lag while the sentiment toward its stock has soured throughout the market. It's for these reasons, in turn, that shares of Wells Fargo have trailed its industry and the broader market more generally since the beginning of the year. ","

Sean Williams,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're an investor, arguably the last thing you want or expect to see from any of the companies you own is a scandal or public relations nightmare. But let's face the facts: It happens from time to time. Usually when a company or its management team is alleged of wrongdoing, it becomes a red flag for Wall Street and investors, and as you might expect, it tends to have a decisively negative impact on the share price of a stock in question. Sometimes these PR flubs turn into genuine nightmares for investors, while others tend to blow over and create excellent buying opportunities. Put plainly, it's impossible to predict which side of the dial a PR scandal will land in (Dumpster fire or buying opportunity) with perfect accuracy. Nevertheless, I would suggest that three recent scandals present an intriguing buying opportunity for long-term investors with an open mind. Image source: Getty Images. Teva is also standing on the right side of a numbers game. As the leading manufacturer of generic drugs, it stands to benefit from an elderly population that could grow dramatically in the decades to come. Seniors require more prescription medicines than younger adults, thus volume can be a key to Teva's success. Though generic drug pricing isn't all that strong now, it should stabilize within the next year or two, which will again put the ball back into Teva's court. Having recently inked a new CEO and valued at just five times forward earnings, Teva could be worth a shot for opportunistic investors. Image source: Getty Images. Syndros is a drug that Wall Street believes could generate approximately $300 million in annual sales, which is roughly what Subsys was bringing in on an extrapolated basis at its peak. Assuming Insys receives some clarity on Subsys, takes its lumps, and stabilizes sales of the drug, it's not out of the question that it will be bringing in around $1 in full-year EPS by the end of the decade. We could be talking about a cash flow positive, single-digit P/E stock in just a few years, which is what makes Insys a potentially intriguing buy. Image source: Getty Images. Investors should also take into account that Wells Fargo has been a top-notch bank for a long time. Even though it may not be in consumers' good graces at the moment, it avoided catastrophe during the Great Recession by staying away from risky derivative plays and focusing on the bread and butter of banking: loans and deposits. The company's most recent quarterly results showed a healthy return on assets of 1.21%, low net charge-offs, deposit and loan growth, and a well-capitalized balance sheet. Though there could be a short-term period of weaker growth stemming from the company's fake-account scandal, it's unlikely there will be a multiyear follow-through that adversely impacts its results. Therefore, opportunistic value and income seekers may want to give Wells Fargo a closer look. ","
      
    3 PR Scandals Creating Intriguing Buying Opportunities  -- The Motley Fool

Keith Speights,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is one of the most underappreciated big pharma stocks on the market right now. That's the thought that occurred to me as I listened to Brent Saunders, Allergan's CEO, speak at the Wells Fargo Healthcare Conference on Thursday. One thing's for sure, though: Underappreciated stocks don't stay that way for too long. Investors eventually begin to see the value in the stock, interest increases, and the stock moves higher. I think that's going to happen with Allergan. Here are three top reasons investors should consider buying this big pharma stock right now. Image source: Getty Images. Allergan stock trades at less than 13 times expected earnings. That alone gives the stock a more attractive valuation than many big pharma stocks. But there's an even better reason Allergan is a bargain: its growth potential. The consensus among Wall Street analysts is that Allergan will grow earnings by more than 13% annually over the next five years. Is that doable? I think so -- and I'll point out why shortly. Factoring in that rate of growth, Allergan's PEG ratio is only 1.06. There are only three large-cap biopharma stocks on the market that have lower PEG ratios -- AbbVie, Celgene, and Shire. Why is Allergan positioned well for growth over the long run? Let's start with its medical-aesthetics business. Botox continues to be a rock-solid product for Allergan, with sales increasing 13.5% year over year in the second quarter. Juvederm sales jumped more than 17% higher than the prior-year period. The company also acquired Zeltiq Aesthetics earlier this year, a move that bolsters its lineup in medical aesthetics. Consumer penetration for Allergan's medical-aesthetics products is really low -- between 5% and 10%. The company sees the market for men and millennials as great growth opportunities. There is also huge potential for what Allergan calls its ""six stars."" These pipeline candidates include migraine drugs ubrogepant and atogepant, and uterine-fibroids drug Esmya. Two late-stage programs that intrigue me even more, though, are abicipar and cenicriviroc (CVC). Abicipar could be one of the most powerful treatments for age-related macular degeneration ever, while CVC holds promise in treating what some have dubbed the ""next hepatitis C"" -- non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. You've no doubt heard the old saying ""Bet on the jockey, not on the horse."" My view is that both jockey and horse are important. Allergan is the horse, while CEO Brent Saunders is the jockey. I think both are good bets. I respect Saunders for his leadership on drug pricing with Allergan's social contract announced last year. His is a voice of sanity that balances responsibilities to shareholders with acknowledging the important role drugmakers have in society. But I also think Saunders has made some very smart business moves. Selling off the Actavis generics business to Teva (NYSE:TEVA) was one of them. While it was a good deal for Teva, it was even better for Allergan. The company should be able to achieve more success focusing on specialty drugs. Another smart move, in my view, was Saunders' decision to partner with Editas Medicine (NASDAQ:EDIT) to develop CRISPR gene-editing drugs for eye diseases. Allergan became the first big pharma to collaborate with the small gene-editing pioneer earlier this year. In January, Saunders said he thought the biopharmaceutical industry was ""entering what could be a golden age"" with advances including CRISPR genomic editing. I think he's right -- and that the alliance with Editas could pay off tremendously over the next few years. The wild card that could really change the dynamics for Allergan is the prospects for acquisitions. Allergan's previous growth stemmed largely from making deals. Saunders hasn't been shy about scooping up smaller companies, including Zeltiq earlier this year. He mentioned at the Wells Fargo conference that Allergan is likely to make more bolt-on acquisitions. However, Saunders also said he thinks ""there will be another wave of consolidations"" in the industry. He added that he'd like for Allergan to ""be on the offense"" with respect to this wave. That could mean bigger deals lie ahead. ","

With approximately $6.1 trillion in assets under management, hedge funds have the ability to throw considerable weight around the market. Sometimes it can seem like a herd mentality as the smart money begins buying up the same stocks. To find out which stocks the smart money has formed a consensus on, personal finance website WalletHub examined the most recent SEC disclosures filed by more than 400 hedge funds to find their biggest holdings, newest positions, and recent exits. Below are the five most popular stocks owned by the smart money crowd. Image source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is literally just a few dollars away from becoming the first company to be valued at $1 trillion. If Apple was a country, CNBC says the tech giant would be one of the world's top 20 economies. As the world awaits the introduction of the eighth iteration of the iPhone, it seems only a matter of when, not if, Apple crosses the threshold of that landmark achievement. Although Apple still generates almost two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone, its services business is enjoying phenomenal growth and is the segment to watch. It started from a small base, but it's been piling on double-digit growth rates and has become Apple's second-largest segment behind iPhones, generating more than $24 billion in sales last year. Apple has proven it is more than a one-trick pony, it's understandable why hedge funds have made this the most popular stock. Similarly, it would be a dumb move if the smart money wasn't heavily backing the most successful investor of all time. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) has set a solid foundation for the portfolios of those who put their faith -- and money -- with the Oracle of Omaha. Historically, Berkshire has delivered performance beyond that achieved by the market indexes, which, given Buffett's typical disdain for investing in risky stocks, has made his level of outperformance all that more remarkable. BRK.B data by YCharts Still, Buffett has grown more comfortable with stocks he once shunned. For example, although once being averse to buying tech stocks, Buffett has been buying up large tranches of Apple stock since last year and today Berkshire Hathaway owns about 130 million shares, giving it a 2.5% stake in the device maker and earning Buffett billions of dollars in return. Image source: Facebook. While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the third most popular stock among the smart money crowd, they've shown a willingness to pay up for the leading social media platform. Over the first six months of 2017, the period of the WalletHub analysis, Facebook's stock rose 30% while the market itself only gained 7%. Since then, Facebook has padded its lead -- it's now up 50% year to date -- and trades at 37 times trailing earnings and 26 times next year's estimates. FB data by YCharts. Yet with the social network still expected to grow its earnings at least 26% over the next five years, its multiple is not as excessive as you might think considering the potential for expansion. Because Facebook is positioning itself to capitalize on some major trends, it's a bet that should pay off for years to come. After gaining for much of 2017, Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) suffered a bit of a summer swoon in June only to rebound in July before succumbing again and trading sideways in August. Still, its performance has justified the bet the smart money placed on it. Now, however, the tech giant is embroiled in a number of controversies that take away from the growth potential of its ad revenue monetization policies. That revenue continues to climb higher, rising 18% year over year as advertising shifts from television to digital. From the $2.7 billion fine the EU slapped on Google for its search results manipulation to being accused of pressuring a think tank to fire a scholar who applauded the move, there's a lot of sound and fury swirling around Alphabet's policies that's temporarily drowned out its potential. Image source: Wells Fargo. But if you're looking for a poster child for scandal, you really can't do any worse than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), the fifth most popular stock among hedge funds. And unlike the others on this list, the banking giant's stock has woefully underperformed and is down more than 7% year to date, whereas rivals like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (the sixth most popular stock) is up 8% in 2017. The numerous sales scandals that have plagued Wells Fargo and beaten down its shares are likely what is causing the smart money to see an opportunity to buy the stock on the cheap. Most of the negative press has been factored into the share price, and it would take another major scandal flaring up again (always a possibility) to weaken it further. If Bank of America can rise again after knowing scandal itself, Wells Fargo can bounce back too. Rich has been a Fool since 1998 and writing for the site since 2004.

    These Are the 5 Most Popular Smart Money Stocks -- The Motley Fool

"Travis Hoium, Jeremy Bowman, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos",09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Index funds and exchange-traded funds can be some of the easiest ways to invest in the market without doing the research or taking the risk investors should put into owning individual stocks. And depending on what kind of financial goals you have and where you see investing opportunities, there are dozens of funds that can meet your goals. We asked three of our investors for their favorite index funds or ETFs and Fidelity MSCI Information Tech (NYSEMKT:FTEC), Vanguard High Dividend Yield (NASDAQMUTFUND:VHDYX), and SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:SPY) were at the top of the list. Here's a look at why they're great ways to invest today. Image source: Getty Images. Jeremy Bowman (Fidelity MSCI Information Tech): It's no secret that tech stocks have surged this year as the five biggest stocks on the market (Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon.com) now all hail from the tech sector. And as technology seeps into more industries such as autos and payments, the sector will get even bigger. But picking your own basket of tech stocks can be tricky as the market is volatile and full of disruption. That's why I'd suggest going with an index fund like Fidelity MSCI Information Tech. FTEC offers exposure to the biggest tech companies -- the top four holdings are Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook -- and also holds consistent winners like Visa. Year to date, the ETF is up 25% and it's gained 30% over the last year. Since its inception in 2013, the fund has essentially doubled the S&P 500's returns, 81% to 41%. FTEC has a small expense ratio of 0.08%, meaning investors will pay just $0.80 on a $1,000 investment for management of the funds. The fund also offers a 1% dividend yield to reward investors just for holding the stock. Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Vanguard High Dividend Yield): Many income investors are looking for ways to boost their portfolios' yield. But in reaching for unusually high rates, you're usually taking on a big risk of a future dividend cut or freeze. Consider spreading out your bets instead with an index fund like Vanguard High Dividend Yield. This investment is tilted toward big U.S.-based companies that pay higher rates than the broader market. As a result, its overall yield is 3%, or a full percentage point above that of the S&P 500. The stocks that populate the fund aren't especially risky, either. In fact, investors will recognize many of the top holdings as true blue chips, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)). Vanguard's high dividend fund carries an absurdly low expense ratio, 0.15%, which will allow your investment to grow unburdened by the hefty fees that many managed funds charge. Its emphasis on slower-growing companies, meanwhile, might ensure periods of underperformance against the broader market. However, the fund's total return is likely to closely track stocks in general, especially if you choose to reinvest those hefty quarterly dividend payouts. Travis Hoium (SPDR S&P 500 ETF): Whether you're just starting investing or diversifying a large portfolio, getting exposure to the market as a whole can be a great investment decision. SPDR S&P 500 ETF is a fund that seeks to generate returns that ""correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index."" In other words, this is a way to buy every stock in the S&P 500 with very little in expenses. One of the big advantages of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF is that its $243 billion in assets under management means the sheer size allows it to charge very low fees. The expense ratio is just 0.0945% annually, likely making it more cost-effective for individual investors to buy than pay commissions to buy a highly diversified portfolio that holds even a fraction of the S&P 500's individual stocks. By definition, SPDR S&P 500 ETF isn't going to be a market-beating investment, but if you're looking to stay in the investing game without taking the risk of owning individual stocks, this is one of the best funds to accomplish that goal at very low cost.

    3 Top Index Funds to Keep You in the Investing Game -- The Motley Fool

Keith Speights,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's been a great year for Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) shareholders so far. The biotech stock is up more than 35% year to date. However, most of those gains were made in the first quarter, thanks to positive clinical results. Over the last five months, Jazz stock has retreated every time it seems to pick up momentum. Jazz Pharmaceuticals CEO Bruce Cozzad sat down at the Wells Fargo Healthcare Conference on Wednesday to field questions. Perhaps the most important question posed to Cozzad related to what investors should watch for in the rest of 2017 and into 2018. Here are the five key things Jazz's CEO listed in his response. Image source: Getty Images. Jazz won FDA approval on Aug. 3 for Vyxeos in treating two types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The company launched the drug in the U.S. roughly one week later. Jazz's third-quarter results should show some sales activity for Vyxeos, but the fourth-quarter results will be a better sign of how the launch is going. Vyxeos is expected to generate peak annual sales north of $200 million. It will be interesting to see how the drug fares in the early days of the launch, considering that Vyxeos combines two chemotherapies, daunorubicin and cytarabine, that are already on the market. However, in a phase 3 study, patients taking Vyxeos survived a median 9.6 months after treatment, compared with 5.9 months for patients taking the two chemotherapies separately. Cozzad mentioned several upcoming regulatory submissions planned by Jazz. Three should happen by the end of this year: European filing for Vyxeos in treating AML, and U.S. filings for JZP-110 in treating excessive sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and narcolepsy, and for an additional indication for Xyrem in treating pediatric narcolepsy. Another key regulatory submission should take place in the first quarter of 2018 for JZP-507, which is a low-sodium version of Xyrem. The submissions themselves won't move the needle for Jazz Pharmaceuticals stock, of course. However, Cozzad stressed that these are important for investors to monitor because they're prerequisites for winning approval and launching the drugs. Jazz picked up Vyxeos with its acquisition last year of Celator. The company recently bought option rights to ImmunoGen's (NASDAQ:IMGN) two early-stage, hematology-related antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) programs, as well as an additional program to be determined later. Cozzad said investors should watch for more deals, although he wouldn't predict when they might happen. The size of Jazz's deals could be bigger in the future than they've been in the past. Cozzad stated that Jazz is now a bigger company and should be able to invest more capital in larger deals ""that make sense."" He doesn't think the company necessarily needs to be in a hurry, though. Sales growth for Xyrem in the first half of 2017 was sluggish. Cozzad predicted a return to stronger growth for the drug in 2018. Jazz launched an educational campaign earlier this year to help narcolepsy patients better understand the disease. Cozzad thinks this campaign could potentially lead to an uptick in sales for Xyrem. He noted that there are around 13,000 patients taking the drug currently, but there are roughly 60,000 patients diagnosed with narcolepsy in the U.S. and many more on top of that who haven't yet been diagnosed. Jazz removed a key obstacle earlier this year by settling with Hikma Pharmaceuticals in a deal that allows Hikma to launch an authorized generic version of Xyrem in 2023. The company also settled with three other generic drugmakers in agreements that allow them to market generic versions of Xyrem after 2025. Cozzad said to watch for more settlements in the future. There are four other companies that have filed abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of Xyrem. Litigation between Jazz and these four companies has been combined into one case for which the trial date has not yet been set. Cozzad expects the trial to begin no earlier than the first half of 2018. He said that settlements could be more likely as the trial date approaches. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Over the past year, the financial sector has been one of the best-performing areas of the stock market. In fact, while the S&P 500 has gained 13%, the financial sector has risen by more than 20%. Despite this high level of performance, there are many excellent financial companies that still trade for surprisingly low P/E ratios. Company Recent Share Price Dividend Yield P/E Ratio (TTM) Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $49.88 3.1% 12.3 New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) $11.95 5.7% 13.1 BofI Holding (NYSE:AX) $25.35 N/A 12.6 Financial Sector Average   16.5 Data source: Share prices, dividend yields, and TTM P/E ratios from TD Ameritrade as of 9/7/2017. Sector P/E from gurufocus.com. Wells Fargo has been one of the worst performers in the financial sector over the past year, down by about 1% while the sector is up more than 20%. If you follow the financial news, you know the main reason for the poor performance. The bank has been the subject of several scandals, including the infamous fake-accounts scandal, in which bank employees improperly opened as many as 3.5 million accounts over a period of several years. Image Source: Getty Images. New York Community Bancorp has gotten absolutely crushed over the past couple of years, after a failed merger with Astoria Financial. The bank had made preparations for the merger, which included higher compliance expenses and a dividend cut, and it seems that investors have a general distrust of the bank's management as a result of the cancellation. As my colleague John Maxfield wrote, the bank made a pretty big mistake from which it has yet to fully recover. Even so, the bank's core business remains solid. New York Community Bancorp's main business focus is lending on rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartment buildings in New York City, which tend to have excellent tenant retention and minimal delinquencies. As a result, the bank's efficiency ratio is among the best in the sector, and default rates have been incredibly low, no matter what the market is doing. To be clear, I'm disappointed in the bank's execution over the past couple of years, but I do believe the stock represents a compelling long-term value. And in the meantime, shareholders get a 5.7% dividend yield while they wait for the dust to settle. With about $9 billion in assets, BofI Holding is much smaller than the other two banks on the list. It is about one-fifth the size of NYCB and just 0.5% the size of Wells Fargo. However, BofI is growing rapidly, which is the main reason I think it's a compelling investment at its current valuation. BofI, which stands for ""Bank of Internet,"" reported annual earnings growth of 13%, and impressive 16% and 14% growth in loans and deposits, respectively. In addition, the bank is venturing into new areas of the business, such as auto lending and unsecured personal loans, and it also expanded its relationship with H&R Block to exclusively provide the tax preparer's refund anticipation loans. In a nutshell, there's still a lot of untapped growth potential. Also, because of its online-only business model, BofI is one of the most profitable and efficient banks around. The bank's return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) are more than twice the industry's benchmarks, and total non-interest expense is less than half of the bank's peer group average, as a percentage of assets. BofI is a relatively young company and is likely to be the most volatile of the three stocks discussed here, but it also has the highest reward potential if its growth story continues. To be clear, a stock's P/E ratio is just one piece of the puzzle, and there are several other metrics that can be used in the valuation of stocks -- especially bank stocks. Price-to-book, price-to-tangible book, ROA, ROE, and efficiency ratio are just some examples of other useful metrics to take into consideration. Having said that, a low P/E ratio can still be a good indicator that stocks are trading cheaply, and I believe that to be the case with these three stocks. ","
      
    3 Rock Solid High-Yield Financial-Sector Dividend Stocks With a P/E Under 15 -- The Motley Fool

Eric Volkman,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's the investment vehicle of arguably the most legendary investor in the world, its portfolio never seems to stop growing, and its historical returns have been leagues better than many stock investments. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The main one is the most blatantly obvious. Berkshire Hathaway has produced shareholder returns that are nothing short of outstanding -- and through several economic recessions and scary market pull-backs, no less. Over the last 25 years, Berkshire Hathaway's total return has hit nearly 3,000%. No, I didn't accidentally add any zeroes to that figure. This trounces the growth of the S&P, which in itself is considerable at nearly 500%. That's because of the second reason I'm enamored of the company -- its laser-sharp eye for finding quality companies at bargain prices. Warren and his lieutenants achieve this through down-to-earth value investing, snapping up promising stocks when they're cheap and keeping them in the portfolio as they rise. It's the ultimate buy-and-hold strategy, and it works beautifully. Even some of the classic Berkshire stocks that have fallen out of favor with the market -- unhealthy beverage maker Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and scandal-prone bank Wells Fargo, to name two notable examples -- still boast returns that would make any portfolio manager's eyes water. If we reach back to the late 1980s, when Berkshire bought the Coca-Cola stake, we see that the soda giant has risen by over 1,700%. Tracking Wells Fargo since Berkshire's entry in the same timeframe shows that the bank's stock is up by nearly the same level, despite the company's many recent difficulties (and despite a sell-off of a tiny portion of Berkshire's big stake). Finally, although it's famous for a thoughtful, long-term investing strategy, Berkshire is admirably quick and flexible when it comes to opportunities that pop up in the market. A great recent example of this is its cashing out of 700 million Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) warrants, the culmination of a neat deal it engineered in 2011. Back then, Bank of America was one of the most wounded casualties of the previous decade's financial crisis, and the market largely shunned its stock even as other bank stocks rebounded. Betting big that it would recover, Warren and company pounced on the opportunity to eventually own a big stake in one of the four biggest U.S. lenders. That faith in Bank of America paid off. Actually, that's an understatement -- Berkshire's initial $5 billion investment is now worth more than three times that figure. At the beginning of this year, the once tech-adverse Buffett and his investment vehicle doubled down on its stake in Apple. Following that, the iPhone maker reported fiscal Q1 results that smashed records, and the stock saw a nice pop. It's generally moved higher since. There are countless examples in the sprawling Berkshire portfolio of ingeniously timed purchases like the Bank of America deal or the Apple buy. Over half a century ago, there was the massive American Express buy-in, at a time when it seemed an ugly financial scandal would encourage investors to leave the don't-leave-home-without-it company in droves. In other words, little has changed for Buffett and Berkshire. They have been making well-conceived and brilliantly timed investments for longer than some of us, myself included, have been alive. It's a remarkable, sustained performance, and the company richly deserves all of the investor love that flows from it. ","

Tonya Garcia,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 14, 2017 11:14 a.m. ET Wells Fargo finds the brand might be losing favor with core customers By L Brands Inc.’s Victoria’s Secret is losing customers on price, according to a consumer study conducted by Wells Fargo, and even the brand’s efforts to stock popular items like bralettes won’t bring them back. Wells Fargo’s study finds that 48% of customers polled had shopped at Victoria’s Secret less in the past year. And 28% said they plan to shop there less in the next 12 months. Of those who had shopped less over the past year, 58% said prices were too high, which, Wells Fargo said, makes it the top explanation for the attrition. “As L Brands has been known to take price up a bit each year with little resistance, it appears that the brand may be approaching a price ceiling, as prices may now be driving customers away,” the Wells Fargo note said, adding that Victoria’s Secret bras sell for 50% more than the competition, on average. See also:  L Brands problems extend beyond Victoria’s Secret bras to Bath & Body Works Victoria’s Secret also “may be falling out of favor,” with 68% of respondents saying they like the brand less than they used to. Of that group, 60% say they think the brand feels “forced” or “fake.” Wells Fargo analysts think a shift toward natural beauty and body acceptance may be putting Victoria’s Secret out of fashion. “We believe that new management in place at Victoria’s Secret recognizes the change in consumer attitude, and is attempting to tweak the Victoria’s Secret image to one that is more in line with current trends—brand imagery is now leaning toward more natural looks and relatable beauty,” analysts led by Ike Boruchow wrote. “However, given how fundamental the ‘sexy’ image is to the Victoria’s Secret brand, we believe a full-brand pivot to catch up with current trends may be challenging to execute.” Analysts note a decline in ratings for the televised Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.

Sales also fell 1% for the month to $842.1 million. The brand has a few problems working hand-in-hand. Victoria’s Secret has said that it wants to reinvigorate its “constructed bra” business, the lined, push-up bras the brand is known for. But those bras are usually more expensive than bralettes. There is the aforementioned trend toward a more natural look, which has led to sales growth for bralettes, undergarments that are unlined and popular with millennials and women who like sheer fashions.

These key shoppers are what analysts call “basic bra customers,” and their survey found that they are among those who say they plan to shop there less in the coming 12 months. “This could imply that as the company diversifies into auxiliary product categories, they are taking shelf space away from more productive categories that appeal across a broad range of consumers, and are thereby turning a large segment of their customer base away,” the note said. Analysts findings show that those who don’t buy Victoria’s Secret bralettes, don’t buy bralettes at all. Wells Fargo rates L Brands market perform, and cut its price target to $40 from $45.

Ryan Vlastelica,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 11, 2017 4:08 p.m. ET One-seventh of all ETF assets are in S&P 500-tracking funds By Simplicity was the name of the game for ETF investors in August, with half of all inflows going to a select number of the most plain-Jane funds on the market, extending a lengthy trend of dominance by low-fee index products. More than $31 billion flowed into exchange-traded funds over the month, according to FactSet data, bringing total global assets to almost $4.2 trillion. However, while there are nearly 1,800 U.S.-listed ETFs currently trading, nearly all the action is concentrated within a vanishingly small part of the ETF marketplace. To be exact, 51.3% of August’s inflows went to just 10 funds. “My explanation for August’s fund flows: investors reached for the easy button to buy ETFs that track household-name indexes,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research at FactSet. In terms of inflows, the top two funds for August both tracked the S&P 500

As a result, flows into the fund can be quite volatile; even with the August inflows, the SPY has seen outflows of $3.47 billion thus far this year.

ETFs tracking the benchmark S&P “are the easiest of all easy buttons,” Kashner wrote in a report, calling it “utterly unsurprising that inflows plowed more cash into it in August.” She noted that one-seventh of all ETF assets were in funds tracking the S&P 500, which rose less than 0.1% over the course of August. The SPDR fund has more than $244 billion in assets while the iShares S&P fun has $125 billion.

The rising popularity of the S&P-tracking funds reflects a multiyear shift into passive investing, where investors effectively buy an index of stocks. That’s in contrast to actively managed funds, where the holdings are individually selected by a portfolio manager. Not only do passive funds perform better than their actively managed peers over the long term, according to repeated studies, but they typically come with much lower fees. Eight of the top 10 funds in August charged an expense ratio of 20 basis points or less, which translates to $20 for every $10,000 invested. The iShares S&P fund charges a fee of 0.04%. More detail:  Active managers just lost one of their best arguments The August data is likely to rankle ETF critics, who charge that indiscriminate buying of all of an index’s components artificially inflates prices beyond what is justified by fundamentals. UBS, in a recent research report, wrote that such trends has sparked concerns about market price discovery and liquidity, adding, “we believe these worries are misguided and the concerns overblown.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Also: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Index funds dominated the list of August’s most popular funds, with an ETF tracking developed markets

Anneken Tappe,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 13, 2017 4:58 p.m. ET Sterling heads lower as U.K. wage data disappoint By The U.S. dollar rose against most of its major rivals Wednesday, as traders shook off a weaker-than-expected read of producer prices to focus on Thursday’s consumer-focused inflation figures. In Wednesday’s data, the headline producer-price index, and the core rate that strips out volatile food and energy, came in at 0.2% for August, compared with median estimates of 0.3%. The federal budget deficit for August amounted to $108 billion, meaning that the budget deficit in the year leading up to August was $674 billion—9% higher than a year ago. Those lackluster figures may put more emphasis on August consumer price inflation, due at 8.30 a.m. on Thursday, which is expected to come in at 0.3% on the month, up from 0.1% in July. The data will also provide a first read of the economic impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, with potential short-term changes in the data that could make a reading unusually volatile. Market participants wonder how the Federal Reserve will factor in a weak reading or a higher-than expected one, as it discusses monetary policy at its coming two-day meeting next week. “We firmly believe that economic reports are going to be influenced for many months or longer by these two massive hurricanes,” Wells Fargo’s senior global equity strategist Scott Wren said regarding Hurricane Harvey and Irma. “The Fed is likely going to take this into account when making monetary policy decisions and won’t be as purely data-dependent as its past rhetoric might suggest.” Hurricane Harvey buffeted the Houston area with historic floodwaters while Irma, although less catastrophic, lashed winds and a torrent of rain throughout Florida.

The data arrived a day before Thursday’s policy meeting at the Bank of England. “Before this morning’s data, there had been some speculation that the Bank of England’s Chief Economist [Andrew Haldane] would switch track tomorrow, and address above-target inflation by voting for a rate hike,” said Jake Trask, FX research director at payment platform OFX, in a note. “But [Thursday’s] reading will likely see him sit on his hands a while longer, to avoid adding pressure to consumers already facing rising prices,” said Trask. The Bank of England is widely expected to hold its key rate at 0.25%, but there has been speculation that Haldane and other policy makers may vote for a rate hike as inflation, now at 2.9%, has surpassed the bank’s target of 2%. Inflation pressures have been building largely as the pound has slid from around $1.50 after the Brexit referendum in June 2016. In theory, higher interest rates bolster the appeal of owning a country’s currency for traders, which can push up its value.

In September 2016, Wells Fargo said its employees may have created more than 2 million accounts without customer approval. Several executives were subsequently fired, but a review also turned up possible abuses with other products such as auto and life insurance. The third-largest U.S. bank has since tried to improve sales practices and restore trust with customers. Last month, Wells Fargo said the unauthorized accounts totaled as many as 3.5 million. “Since last October, we have taken numerous important steps to fix issues, make things right for our customers and build a better bank,” a bank spokesperson told Reuters via email on Thursday. Wells Fargo shares gained 0.57 percent to $54.05 in morning trading. On Aug. 1, the 11 Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee wrote to its Republican Chairman, Mike Crapo, asking that both Sloan and the board of directors be called to testify before the Committee this month. The letter lists nine new developments since Sloan's predecessor John Stumpf appeared before the Senate Banking Committee in September last year. These included ""concerns about the bank retaliating against employees and purposefully concealing evidence from regulators of systemic problems at the bank."" reut.rs/2tLsbsv During last year’s testimony, Stumpf seemed unprepared under tough questioning from Democrats and Republicans, and Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren accused him of “gutless leadership.” He resigned less than a month later. Warren has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to remove all members of the Wells Fargo board of directors who had served during the time the fake accounts were created. ","

Sloan will appear before the Senate Banking Committee, which writes rules for his industry, at a hearing titled “Wells Fargo: One Year Later,” on October 3. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn declined to comment. No one from Sidley Austin was available to comment outside of office hours. The testimony will be Sloan’s first congressional appearance since he took over as CEO in October of last year, roughly a month after Wells Fargo reached a settlement with regulators over the creation of as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts. The bank has since disclosed problems with other products, including auto and life insurance, and recently revised its estimate for the number of accounts that were potentially opened without customers’ authorization to 3.5 million. In his own congressional appearances last year, Sloan’s predecessor, John Stumpf, often lacked answers to questions posed by legislators. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren accused him of “gutless leadership.” He left the bank less than a month later and was replaced by Sloan. The law firm that prepared Stumpf for his testimony, Gibson Dunn, will still be working for Wells Fargo, but in a supporting role, said one of the sources. No one from Gibson Dunn was immediately available to comment outside of office hours. Hundreds of outside law firms work for Wells Fargo on various matters, and the bank’s new general counsel, Allen Parker, recently hired a new chief operating officer for the legal team, Tom Trujillo, who is reviewing those relationships. The hiring of Sidley Austin, however, was directed by Wells Fargo’s government affairs office, said one of the sources. ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight of the largest U.S. banks and 82 foreign banks will have an extra year to submit their so-called living wills outlining how they would be unwound in the event of bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. The extension granted by the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) forms part of a broader effort by financial regulators to ease onerous post-crisis regulations under Republican President Donald Trump’s pro-growth agenda. “The agencies continue to explore ways to improve the resolution planning process and believe it is worthwhile to consider extending the cycle for living will submissions from annual to once every two years. Today’s action is a step towards that end,” the Fed said in a statement. The eight large domestic banks will have until July 1, 2019 to file their plans, while the 82 foreign banks will have until Dec. 31, 2018. Under the Dodd-Frank reform act, the largest U.S. banks must present plans that explain how they would be unwound in the case of a financial crisis without shaking the broader global financial system. The regulators are currently reviewing plans submitted by the big eight banks on July 1. The extension will not affect the review process, the Fed said. Banks have long argued that the annual cycle for submitting living wills - which can comprise thousands of pages - is too onerous. In a June 12 report outlining Trump’s financial de-regulatory reform agenda, the U.S. Treasury recommended extending the cycle to two years, revising the threshold for banks that must submit living wills, and increasing the transparency of guidance regulators feedback on to banks on the plans.

The company also said its Chief Financial Officer Tessa Hilado, 53, would retire. The planned stock buyback follows Allergan’s completion of a separate $15 billion repurchase, and after the company reported mixed trial data for its experimental treatment of NASH liver fibrosis. Allergan on Friday also received a “refusal to file” letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an expanded approval for its Vraylar drug to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia in adults. Allergan said it had begun to search for a new finance chief, but declined to provide further comment on Hilado’s departure. Analysts at Bernstein, based on discussions with Allergan’s investor relations team, said Hilado’s departure was her personal decision and should not be viewed as suggesting “issues this year or 2018.” Hilado did not have broad support among Allergan investors and her exit would not be a “particularly strong negative,” they added. Hilado joined Allergan in 2014 and will continue in her current role until a successor is named. Allergan, which said it was committed to boosting its dividend payout annually, also backed its 2017 financial guidance and its commitment to pay down $3.75 billion of debt in 2018. The drugmaker had $30.24 billion in current and long-term debt and capital leases as of June 30. “While the CFO’s departure may create greater uncertainty, we take the company’s reaffirmation of 2017 guidance and third quarter revenue projections as offsetting positives,” Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said.

Financials .SPSY, up 0.12 percent, and the Russell 2000 index of smallcap stocks , up 0.27 percent, which are expected to be among the beneficiaries of a tax reduction, turned higher after trading lower in the early portion of the session. But gains were tempered with equities at record highs and valuations elevated. The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) on the S&P stood at 17.9 compared with its long-term average of 15.1 while the forward P/E on the Russell is 26.3 against an average of 21.3. “It looks like the market doesn’t want to sell strength here, it wants to buy weakness,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump’s proposal for a cut in the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent was “not negotiable.” The plan, which called for tax cuts for most Americans, also drew criticism for favoring business and the rich and potentially adding trillions of dollars to the deficit. A Commerce Department report showed the economy grew a bit faster than previously estimated in the second quarter, but the momentum probably slowed in the third as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily curbed activity. The storms also pushed up initial claims for state unemployment benefits for the week, the Labor Department said. “People are waiting to see if the economy actually picks up, they are going to be waiting a long time if they are anticipating it is going to pick up meaningfully,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,路透台北9月22日 - 美联储(FED)的决议一如所料，维持利率不变且宣布10月开始缩表。金融市场事前已有所预期，基本上没有太大惊奇。在联储后议后路透所做的调查显示，华尔街初级交易商认为美联储将在12月再次升息，资产负债表将降至3万亿美元。 量化宽松(QE)货币政策就此行将落幕。全球其他国家虽因各有烦恼，无法立刻复制美联储行动，但QE淡出舞台已是大势所趋，各家央行决策者不得不思考收紧政策路径，接下来，谁将接力缩减刺激举措？ 周四标普下调中国主权信用评级，称长时间的强劲信贷增长提高了中国的经济金融风险。虽然标普此次调降使得其对中国的评级与穆迪和惠誉相同，但鉴于中共十九大将在几周后召开，此次调降的时机颇令人意外。 展望下周，重磅数据将相继登场，有英国GDP、美国第二季GDP终值和美联储看重的通胀指标PCE物价指数。日本德国均将公布CPI、中国工业经济效益月度报告等。 此外，多位央行巨头，包括美联储主席叶伦、欧洲央行总裁德拉吉在内都有演说安排。新西兰央行将公布利率决议。 **美联储打响缩表第一枪** 美联储维持利率不变，并且将于10月开始缩减约4.2万亿美元的公债和抵押贷款支持证券(MBS)组合，最初将每月到期证券再投资规模减少至多100亿美元。 尽管近期通胀低迷，但美联储料仍在年底前再升息一次。联储主席叶伦在会后记者会上称，今年通胀下跌的原因仍是个谜，美联储随时准备在必要时调整利率前景。 联储决议发布后，金融市场几乎未受影响。虽然美联储的最新政策立场大部分被视为强硬，但也将其预估的长期“中性”利率从3.0%再次下调至2.75%，反映出对整体经济活力的担忧。 “美联储可能坚持2017年再升息一次以及2018年升息三次的意图。但是联储也下调了长期利率预估，这导致美债收益率曲线趋平，在一定程度上减缓了美元兑日圆的涨势，”大和证券资深外汇策略师Yukio Ishizuki表示。 市场对美联储的反应相当直接，短券收益率的升幅大于长券收益率。债市投资者认为，低通胀和低增长的情况将会持续。美债收益率曲线因而趋平，30年期与两年期美债收益率利差缩至近两个月最窄，距离近10年最窄纪录不远，连带地也牵动了市场对美元后市的看法。美元指数很快地就从两周峰值走下坡。 “不错，美联储是告诉大家，将会继续收紧政策，但欧洲央行、加拿大央行，甚至英国央行现在也告诉大家，它们将开始将政策正常化，”Wells Fargo Securities汇市策略师Erik Nelson说。“这与一两年前的情况形成显明的对照，当时美联储是唯一收紧政策的央行。” 安联分析师Charlie Ripley则指出，美联储向市场传递了些许鹰派的讯息，即货币政策正常化已经全面展开。他说：“不过美联储内部有很多空缺，委员会构成可能会发生变化，特别是考虑到叶伦主席的任期明年2月到期，所以我认为，在看待这次的声明时应该有所保留”。 **欧洲央行缩减刺激举措？** 欧元区经济连续17个季度增长，有助欧洲央行缩减刺激措施。不过，消息人士对路透表示，决策者对于是否在10月政策会议上敲定结束印钞计划的明确时间看法分歧，他们很有可能至少保留在2018年延长购债操作的选项。 消息人士称，欧元持续强势打压了通胀，导致决策者看法分歧。德国等北方富国为首的鹰派准备缩减2.3万亿欧元的购债计划，但鸽派只是希望缩减每月购债规模。这样一来，官员们可能在10月26日的会议寻求妥协，不会确定购债操作的结束日期，或将推迟至12月再做决定。 **英国央行跃跃欲试升息** 英国央行总裁卡尼在国际货币基金组织(IMF)的演说中表示，英国脱欧或将在短期内损害英国的增长前景幷且推升通胀，因英国要调整适应脱欧后的日子。 他还重申英国央行可能很快就要升息的讯息。不过由于卡尼在央行利率行动时间方面欠缺明确评论，他讲完话后英镑下跌。 路透调查显示，近三分之二的受访分析师目前预计英国央行将在11月升息，但四分之三的受访者认为那时候升息不是正确时机。 本周牵动英镑的更大因素是英相特雷莎·梅是否软化退欧身段。她周五稍晚将发表演说，部分媒体披露她将称英国愿在退欧过渡阶段支付200亿欧元换取单一市场准入等关税优惠。英镑由跌转升，逼近去年6月退欧公投后最高水平。 **标普调降中国评级* 标普将中国长期主权信用评级从“AA-”下调至“A+”，称因数年来为实现政府的经济增长目标而实施的信贷刺激，令中国面临控制由此滋生的金融风险的挑战。 虽然对中国信贷持续强劲增长的担忧近几季加剧，但中国上半年GDP增长6.9%的增速超过预期。一些分析师称，下调评级不会对金融市场产生太大影响。 “这一决定已不是新鲜事，降评后标普对中国的评级与惠誉及穆迪相同。此举对金融市场的影响将非常有限，”瑞穗银行驻香港亚洲外汇策略师Ken Cheung表示。“对于那些投资人民币计价债券的投资者而言，他们更关心的是对人民币的预期。下调评级的决定对资本流入的影响可能也有限。” 根据国际清算银行(BIS)数据，8月人民币实际有效汇率指数续升0.54%，名义有效汇率指数升0.41%。实际有效汇率上升代表本国货币相对价值上升，下降表示本币贬值。(完) ,"

Mark Kolakowski,09282017,Investopedia,09212017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are projected to add $15.7 trillion to global GDP by the year 2030, an increase of 14% over baseline projections, according to PwC, a leading international accounting and consulting firm. Based on this and similar projections made by another consulting firm, Accenture, analysts at Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) have issued outperform ratings on nine stocks that they believe are well-positioned to ride the AI wave to greater profits and also longterm outperformance in the stock market, Barron's reports. While computers now dominate government, Corporate America and Wall Street, the growing use of AI is moving technology many steps further by enabling computers to think, learn and reason like humans, enabling computers to perform more sophisticated tasks. Five of these companies are based in the U.S. While they are all technology leaders, they serve a broad array of markets that include consumers and corporations: Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL); e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN); social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB); online marketplace eBay Inc. (EBAY); and video streaming service Netflix Inc. (NFLX). The other four are Chinese: social networking, payments, and online entertainment provider Tencent Holding Ltd. (TCEHY); online merchants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) and JD.com Inc. (JD); and Internet search, e-commerce platform, online payments processor, and web application software provider Baidu Inc. (BIDU).  These companies' dominance in their markets and in key sectors of the Internet position them well to exploit artificial intelligence as its influence spreads. (For more, see also: 7 Global Stocks For The Next Internet Boom.) In an attempt to put that $15 trillion or so in perspective, that's almost the current size of U.S. GDP ($18 trillion), over six times current global spending on e-commerce ($2.4 trillion), and 30 times current worldwide spending on advertising ($500 billion), according to the report by Wells Fargo as quoted by Barron's. Wells Fargo anticipates advances in neural network science that will produce stronger engagement among mobile and Internet users, with benefits for e-commerce and subscription-based business models. More specifically, artificial neural networks (modeled on the natural neural networks in human brains) are designed to facilitate machine learning, or the ability of computers to solve problems without task-specific programming. The early adoption of AI will be mainly in North America as companies boost productivity, PwC  says. However, they expect China to pull ahead in ten years, enjoying a 26% GDP boost by 2030, versus 14.5% in North America. Of the $15.7 trillion AI-driven global GDP increase forecasted for 2030, about $10.7 trillion will be in North America and China combined, or 68% of the total, PwC projects. In China, AI is projected to have its biggest industry impact in manufacturing, which is especially significant for the global economy since China is the world leader in manufacturing, Wells Fargo says, as quoted by Barron's. For the nine companies recommended by Wells Fargo, their 52 week share price gains through Wednesday, and current forward P/E ratios, are, respectively: Alphabet, 19%, 24; Amazon, 15%, 121; Facebook, 30%, 26; eBay, 19%, 17; Netflix, 87%, 89; Tencent, 54%, NA; Alibaba, 57%, 26; JD.com, 51%, 44; and Baidu, 28%, 27.

Tae Kim,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Amazon shares are faltering this month along with many of its large-cap technology company peers. But the pullback is a buying opportunity, according to one Wall Street firm. Wells Fargo Securities began coverage of Amazon with an outperform rating on its shares and a price target of $1,400, which is 49 percent above Tuesday's closing price. It is also the highest target out of the 42 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet. Wells' analyst predicts the internet giant will be able to use artificial intelligence and data analysis to dominate new industries. ""Given a strong customer experience, scaled infrastructure investments, high user engagement, and lead within Cloud, we believe AMZN is among the best positioned to apply these neural network advances [artificial intelligence] across new verticals/industries,"" analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We see this lead in data, coupled with the company's edge in compute efficiency, as increasingly feeding insights into supply chain, for its retail, video, and other efforts, and through AWS, for its partners."" Amazon shares have rallied 25 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the market's 12 percent gain. But the stock is down 4 percent this month compared with the S&P 500's 1 percent gain.

""We see Amazon's famous flywheel as spinning with increasingly impenetrable force, where customer experience, frequency, and data will only grow,"" he wrote.

Evelyn Cheng,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The Wells Fargo Investment Institute doesn't expect the S&P 500 to rise more than 2 percent over the next 15 months, according to the firm's 2018 year-end outlook released Thursday. While some Wall Street strategists have included 2018 S&P targets in their equities notes, the Wells Fargo note marks the first major outlook report for next year. Wells Fargo gave a range of 2,450 to 2,550 for the S&P next year, a decline of 2.3 percent or a rise of nearly 1.7 percent from Wednesday's record close of 2,508.24. The S&P 500 also hit an intraday high Wednesday of 2,508.85. ""The synchronized global recovery that took hold in 2017 should gain in 2018, though restrained by ongoing global headwinds from high debt, slow labor recoveries overseas and political uncertainties around the world,"" Wells Fargo's global investment strategy team wrote in a Monday note that was distributed to the media Thursday. ""We also anticipate that earnings gains will fuel moderately higher U.S. and international equity markets,"" the report said. The strategists added that since the U.S. economy is likely in the ""final third"" of expansion, investors must be particularly aware of risks. In late August, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute raised its 2017 year-end target range by 70 points to 2,300 to 2,400. At the time, the increase still forecast, at best, a roughly 1 percent decline for the S&P. Among 15 strategists surveyed by CNBC last year, Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Scott Wren came the closest to predicting where the S&P would end the year, albeit at a range. The middle of his target range was 2,240, and the S&P ended 2016 at 2,238.83. ",Wells Fargo issues first outlook for 2018 from Wall Street and it's not bullish
Stephanie Landsman,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The stock market could come within a hair of a correction in the next three months, Wells Fargo says. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, sees problems for the S&P 500 as the record year comes to a close. ""Our midpoint of our target range for year-end 2018 is 2,500,""  Wren said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""We're basically there right now."" Wren is predicting a 4 to 8 percent dip from current levels before year's end. The official definition of a correction is a 10 percent drop. It appears his forecast may already be materializing. Just look at the Dow. The index is on its first four-day losing streak since June. But it's important to note that it has been a banner year for stocks. The Dow has soared nearly 13 percent while the S&P 500 is up 12 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has also reaped big gains, surging nearly 19 percent this year. ""Valuations are meaningfully stretched in that the trailing 12 month P/E ration on the S&P 500 is 20 and change. And, that's against about a 16½ 30-year median,"" Wren said. With stocks on the expensive side, an economy that's ""not really accelerating"" and a Federal Reserve that's firmly executing its rate-hike policy — Wren doesn't see much upside left. ""The net net move between now and the end of 2018 is probably going to be pretty small,"" he added. There's a silver lining in Wren's 2017 downward spiral forecast. His year-end S&P 500 price target for 2018 is 2,450 to 2,550, which would suggest solid gains next year. ""That would give us say a 5 to 8 percent return [in 2018],"" Wren said.

John Melloy,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The Federal Reserve's plan to methodically raise short-term interest rates over the next couple years may not boost bank shares, contrary to popular belief, and could instead hurt the group's profitability as it flattens the so-called yield curve, Deutsche Bank said. Analyst Matt O'Connor downgraded shares of JPMorgan and regional bank PNC Financial late Monday to hold from buy for this reason. The yield curve is the difference between short term and long-term rates in the Treasury market and often runs parallel to the margin banks make on their loans. ""We continue to believe the yield curve will flatten as the Fed continues to boost short term rates, the unwind of the Fed's bond book isn't likely to meaningfully impact the demand/supply of those assets, and economic growth seems unlikely to significantly accelerate (for a sustained period),"" wrote O'Connor. ""In this environment, net interest income growth is likely to slow and credit costs may begin to inch up."" JPMorgan shares rose more than 40 percent the last 12 months, more than the 33 percent gain for the Financial Select SPDR, as CEO Jamie Dimon guided the bank through a difficult trading environment on Wall Street. Bank shares have perked up again recently as the Fed indicated a December hike was likely and traders bet the move would boost both short term and long term rates, making the industry's lending portfolios more profitable. Deutsche Bank disagrees, apparently. JPMorgan fell slightly in premarket trading following the Deutsche call. ""Increased competition in investment banking/trading may erode some of JPM's recent gains,"" wrote the analyst. ""Post crisis (including in recent years), JPM has gained large market share across its investment bank (IB fees, FICC and EQ trading). However, the competitive landscape seems to have increased and even JPM mgmt (at its 2017 investor day) has acknowledged it will be difficult to maintain share."" PNC has done even better than JPMorgan, up 52 percent in one year. But that run has made the Pittsburgh-based bank too expensive. ""PNC shares now trade at 14.4 times 2018 consensus or a 10% premium to the Large Regional peer group. This compares to a 5% discount on average over both the historical 25-year and 5-year time horizon. Some premium is warranted in our view given the positives noted above, but further multiple expansion seems harder to argue for and we're less positive on Large Regional banks in general given concerns surrounding a flatter yield curve,"" stated the note. Deutsche still thinks factors such as loosening regulation and M&A activity can help the financial sector, but it favors ""turnaround"" stories such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo than the sector leaders. O'Connor also has a buy rating on Morgan Stanley. ",The run in JPMorgan is over and it's the Fed's fault: Deutsche Bank
John W. Schoen,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Call it a plan for a tax plan.American taxpayers eagerly awaiting details of President Donald Trump's ambitious tax reform plan Wednesday were left with more questions than answers. Building on a single page of campaign bullet points promising to simply the sprawling U.S. tax code, give middle-class workers a break and help businesses compete, the administration unveiled a long-awaited ""framework"" that provided only broad brush outlines of an overhaul proposal. But while the nine-page outline proposes sweeping changes, the impact of any reforms are all but impossible to estimate until congressional committees and lawmakers on Capitol Hill agree on specific provisions, let alone bring a bill to a vote. ""We have gone from one page of detail to nine pages of detail,"" said Paul Christopher, a market strategist at Wells Fargo. ""That's still not a complete tax plan."" To be sure, the White House document acknowledges the reality of the task ahead in building a consensus among multiple congressional committees with jurisdiction over budget and tax policy. The effort is further complicated by a GOP divided between fiscal ""hawks"" who want any tax cuts paid for by closing tax breaks to raise revenue and ""supply-siders"" who believe tax cuts will eventually pay for themselves by spurring economic growth.That's why the long-awaited document is being billed as a ""framework"" for tax reform, not an actual plan. One of the biggest unknowns starts with the basic tax brackets used to assess how much each American household owes the Treasury every April 15. To simplify the current system of seven separate income cutoffs, from 10 percent to the top 39.6 percent rate, the plan proposes cutting that to three – 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But the most important detail – when each bracket kicks in — has yet to be spelled out. ""The framework will have specific rates on businesses and families but the actual income parameters will be hammered out later,"" a senior White House official told reporters in a briefing Tuesday. Further confounding those trying to estimate the impact, the plan hints that an additional ""fourth bracket"" may be needed to assure that the wealthiest earners pay their fair share. Families would lose a popular tax break for dependents but get a bigger child tax credit and a $500 credit for dependents other than children. The plan clearly spells out a call to nearly double the so-called standard deduction from the current level to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. That would effectively shield that income from taxation for those at the bottom end of the income ladder. But anyone making more than that is left to wonder which of the dozens of lucrative tax breaks in the current tax code may be eliminated. The administration signaled at Tuesday's briefing that the popular deduction for taxes paid to state and local governments will be eliminated, but that repeal was not spelled out in Wednesday's nine-page framework. Nor did the plan address the prospects for repeal of popular deductions – the tax breaks for mortgage interest, charitable donations or medical expenses – that can lower a household's annual tax burden by thousands of dollars. The document also outlined various provisions for businesses, including a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. But while promising to ""modernize"" the dozens of tax breaks that favor specific companies and industries, those details remain to be spelled out. That process is certain to set off a fierce lobbying campaign by those favored by each provision. The document also called for a repeal of the alternative minimum tax, a provision originally intended to tax wealthy households that now reaches well into the middle class. And the plan also calls for eliminating the estate tax. Repealing those provisions may be politically popular. But doing so will be costly the U.S. Treasury. One way to make up the shortfall — and pay for lower tax rates on businesses and individuals —would be to close some of the many deductions, exemptions and exclusions that cost the government nearly $1.4 trillion in fiscal 2017, according to the Treasury. Targeting those tax breaks would spark a hard-fought political tug of war. That's why some lawmakers are hoping to avoid those battles by promising to make up any lost revenue with the prospect that tax cuts will spur the economy. Proponents of the argument claim that faster growth will generate enough new individual income and corporate profits to make up for lower rates.But the theory has numerous critics, including many economists who argue that the idea hasn't worked in the past. And, with the economic recovery now in its eighth year and unemployment at historic lows, it's unlikely a tax cut will have much impact. ""All the evidence shows that tax cuts, tax reform can be very effective, if there is considerable slack in the labor market if unemployment is relatively high,"" said Joachim Fels, a global economic advisor at Pimco. ""If you get a fiscal boost and tax reform this late in the cycle where most of the slack in the market is eroded, you're not going to get a lot of bang for your buck.""

Liz Moyer,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The abrupt departure of Equifax's chief executive officer on Tuesday has not dampened the criticism of the company since it disclosed a massive data breach earlier this month. As in other recent corporate scandals, the departure of Richard Smith was swift if not inevitable. The credit reporting company said he was retiring effective immediately and he wouldn't get a bonus for this year, though he is eligible to walk away with at least $18.4 million in pension benefits. Some said Tuesday his departure should have happened more quickly. Wells Fargo dispatched its former CEO last year, one month after regulators said thousands of its employees opened millions of fake deposit and credit card accounts to meet aggressive sales goals. Target's former CEO held on for four months before leaving in May 2014 in the wake of a major data breach at the retailer in late 2013. But Anthem's CEO did not leave that company after a 2015 data breach that exposed personal information for 79 million people. The second-largest U.S. insurer recently settled with victims of the hack for $115 million, the biggest data breach settlement yet. What struck people as different about Equifax's situation was the company's bungled response to its crisis. For starters, Equifax waited 40 days from the time it discovered the breach in late July to its public disclosure on Sept. 7. Waiting 40 days ""is pushing it,"" said Nathan Taylor, a cybersecurity lawyer at Morrison Foerster who has represented big companies in data breaches. Equifax's hack affected as many as 143 million people, including personal identifying information such as Social Security numbers, names and birth dates. That number amounts to more than half the U.S. adult population. ""They had to have known this was going to be an area of focus,"" added Taylor. Adding to Equifax's woes, the part of its website devoted to consumers worried about protecting their information was glitchy at first, and there was confusion over Equifax's customer dispute resolution rules. The management appeared slow to react with a cohesive message or customer outreach plan. ""Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize,"" Mark Feidler, the new chairman of Equifax's board, said Tuesday, adding it had formed a special committee to look into the data breach. Worse, says Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the company appeared to have no clear CEO succession plan. It named Paulino do Rego Barros, the president of its Asia-Pacific region, as interim chief while it conducts a search for a permanent successor. ""This is far less a frustration with the frontier of technology but rather just old fashioned missteps and terrible preventative practices,"" he said. Even Smith's fate, characterized as retirement, didn't sit well. Smith has been scheduled to testify about the breach in the House and the Senate next week, and his sudden departure made lawmakers react angrily. ""A CEO walking out the door just days before he is to appear before Congress is an abdication of his responsibility,"" Sen. Brian Schatz said in a statement Tuesday. Equifax's spokeswoman said Smith was still scheduled to make those appearances next week. The board's move is being interpreted as a way to get out ahead of what is anticipated to be a major grilling by lawmakers. ""The new standard with boards now is 'how badly will we look compared to other unnamed CEOs in front of Congress?'"" said Michael Peregrine, a corporate governance lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery. At the very least, Equifax's shares responded positively to the news on Tuesday, in the sense that they turned positive for the first time in a while. The stock has lost 26 percent of its value since the beginning of September. The shares closed Tuesday higher after spending most of the day lower on the Smith retirement news. Smith, who joined Equifax in 2005 after 22 years as an executive at General Electric, is staying on in an unpaid role to assist the company for 90 days, Equifax said in a securities filing. His total pay for 2016 was $14.9 million, according to the filing, including a $3 million bonus he might have been eligible to get this year as well. The rest of his 2017 compensation won't be decided until the conclusion of an independent review. ""This is akin to an oil tanker spill,"" Taylor said. ""It doesn't matter if the captain had 12 hours of sleep and tons of training, people are going to be watching everything you do."" ",Equifax CEO walks away with $18 million pension benefit

It has now been a year since industry regulators revealed the sales scandal at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). As the following timeline shows, a lot has happened since then at the 165-year-old bank. Image source: Getty Images. Sept. 8, 2016 -- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reveals that thousands of Wells Fargo employees opened 2 million deposit and credit card accounts that consumers may not have authorized. We have at any one time 100,000 team members in our branch and retail bank network. And we hire people, and people turn over. Of those 100,000, the vast majority do the right thing, they come to work. Their life's work and mission is to help people. And I love these people. Every year -- on average for the last five years, 1,000 did not do the right thing. Sept. 20, 2016 -- Stumpf testifies about the scandal to the Senate Banking Committee. He's panned in the media for being insufficiently contrite and unprepared for the senators' questions. Sept. 27, 2016 -- The independent members of Wells Fargo's board announce that Stumpf will forfeit $41 million in unvested equity awards and not be paid a bonus for 2016. It was also announced that the former head of the bank's retail unit, Carrie Tolstedt, had left the company and will forfeit $19 million in unvested equity awards, and similarly not receive a bonus for 2016. Sept. 29, 2016 -- Stumpf testifies before the House of Representative's Committee on Financial Services. Oct. 12, 2016 -- Stumpf resigns as chairman and CEO. President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan succeeds him at CEO, while former lead independent director Stephen Sanger becomes chairman. Stumpf says: I am grateful for the opportunity to have led Wells Fargo. I am also very optimistic about its future, because of our talented and caring team members and the goodwill the stagecoach continues to enjoy with tens of millions of customers. While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside. I know no better individual to lead this company forward than Tim Sloan. Oct. 14, 2016 -- Wells Fargo reports third-quarter earnings, the first with Sloan as CEO. According to Sloan's prepared remarks for the conference call: As the new CEO, my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo. As you know, on Sept. 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency], and the Los Angeles city attorney related to sales practices in retail banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders, and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders. Nov. 17, 2016 -- Issues first in a series of monthly updates on the performance of its retail unit in the wake of the scandal. The impact is seen in the 44% drop in the number of new consumer checking accounts opened in October compared with the year-ago period, as well as a 50% decline in new credit card applications. Nov. 29, 2016 -- Wells Fargo's board of directors amends the bank's bylaws to require the separation of the chairman and CEO roles and for the chairman and vice chairman of the board to be independent directors. According to the bank's newly elected chairman, Stephen Sanger: The board previously acted to elect an independent chairman to lead the board, and we believe formalizing this structure is the right decision at this time for the company and its investors, customers, and team members. Efforts to restore the trust of our customers and team members are well underway and will continue until we have fully addressed the issues surrounding retail banking sales practices. While the investigation of these practices and related matters by the independent directors continues in earnest, we believe this action will enhance the board's independence and its oversight of the company's management, and we appreciate the feedback that we received from our investors on this matter. Feb. 20, 2017 -- Wells Fargo elects two new independent board members: Karen B. Peetz, retired president of The Bank of New York Mellon, and Ronald L. Sargent, retired chairman and CEO of office-supply retailer Staples. Feb. 21, 2017 -- Wells Fargo fires four former leaders of its retail bank. March 1, 2017 -- Wells Fargo reports that no members of its executive committee will receive bonuses for 2016 and that equity awards they received in 2014 that vest after 2016 will be reduced by up to 50%. The result is an aggregate reduction in compensation totaling approximately $32 million, according to the bank. Sanger says: These compensation actions for the Operating Committee, though not related to any findings of improper behavior, are part of the board's ongoing efforts to promote accountability and ensure Wells Fargo puts customer interests first. As we seek to regain trust, the board is taking decisive actions. We will continue to work to make right what went wrong and remain focused on providing the accountability and oversight that our customers, employees, and investors expect and deserve. March 21, 2017 -- Sloan hosts a companywide town hall meeting to introduce six new long-term goals and preview a new national advertising campaign entitled ""Building Better Every Day."" From Sloan's prepared remarks: We're making things right for our customers and our team members. We are fixing problems, and we're building a better bank for the future. As we rebuild trust, we will reintroduce to our stakeholders what our Wells Fargo bankers have always been known for, and that's helping our customers to succeed financially. March 28, 2017 -- The OCC, the primary regulator for national banks, downgrades Wells Fargo's Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating to ""Needs to Improve"" as a result of ""previously issued regulatory consent orders."" Sloan says: We are disappointed with this rating given Wells Fargo's strong track record of lending to, investing in, and providing service to low- and moderate-income communities. However, we are committed to addressing the OCC's concerns because restoring trust in Wells Fargo and building a better bank for our customers and our communities is our top priority. Wells Fargo is deeply committed to economic growth, sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in low- and moderate-income communities and will continue to invest above and beyond what is required by CRA. March 28, 2017 -- Wells Fargo says that it reached a $110 million agreement to settle a class action lawsuit filed in May 2015 over the bank's retail sales practices. Sloan says: This agreement is another step in our journey to make things right with customers and rebuild trust. We want to ensure that each customer impacted by our sales practices issue has every opportunity for remediation, and this agreement presents an additional option. We continue to encourage customers to contact us directly so that we can act quickly to refund fees and address any concerns. April 4, 2017 -- CEO Tim Sloan publishes open letter to the bank's customers to ""thank them for their loyalty"" and share updates regarding its retail sales practices. Sloan says: As we work toward rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members, community partners, and shareholders, we are committed to keeping our stakeholders informed. This is why we are not only thanking them, but also sharing the significant progress we have made to make things right, fix problems, and build a better Wells Fargo, recognizing much work remains that we are committed to do. April 7, 2017 -- Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services issues a report urging shareholders to vote against the re-election of 12 out of the bank's 15 board members. Wells Fargo's board responds with a prepared statement laying out eight steps the bank has taken in response to the sales scandal. April 10, 2017 -- Wells Fargo releases the findings of an investigation into the company's retail sales practices overseen by a special committee of the bank's independent directors and assisted by the law firm Shearman & Sterling. Sloan says: The board's report is a necessary examination of what went wrong in our culture, operations, and governance. It's clear from the board's review that we had an incentive program and high-pressure sales culture in our Community Bank that over time drove behavior that in many cases was inappropriate and inconsistent with our values. Because of our decentralized operating model, our corporate leadership took too long to understand the seriousness and scope of the problem, and as a result, the actions we took over the years to address it weren't adequate. April 13, 2017 -- Wells Fargo reports first-quarter earnings. The bank's bottom line was flat, at $5.5 billion, but a number of other critical metrics show signs of strain, including its efficiency ratio and return on assets. April 17, 2017 -- The bank launches the previously announced marketing campaign, Building Better Every Day. April 21, 2017 -- Wells Fargo expands its class action settlement, previously announced in March, to include any customers who were affected by sales practice issues as early as May 2002, pushing the covered range back by seven years. The updated settlement will total $142 million. Sloan says: The expansion of this agreement is another important step to make things right for our customers. On our journey to rebuild trust, we want to ensure our customers feel confident that we have heard their concerns about retail sales practices, which includes offering them numerous opportunities for remediation. We encourage any customer with concerns or questions about their accounts to contact us. April 25, 2017 -- Wells Fargo holds its annual meeting. Shareholders vent their ire at the bank by, among other things, reelecting the bank's board members with such underwhelming majorities that the results are seen by corporate governance experts as a vote of no confidence in all but three members of the board. July 6, 2017 -- The bank forms a new stakeholder-relations group to ""foster a more integrated approach to engaging with its key stakeholders."" Former director of investor relations Jim Rowe is promoted to lead the group, reporting to Chief Administrative Officer Hope Hardison, who says: As Wells Fargo continues to focus on rebuilding trust and building a better bank, it's more important than ever that our key stakeholder relationships and strategies are well integrated. During a decade in investor relations, Jim has become a trusted leader at Wells Fargo. His knowledge of our businesses and proven ability to partner across the company make him ideal to advance our efforts to create an aggregated stakeholder view. July 8, 2017 -- The class action settlement for retail sales practices receives preliminary court approval. Sloan says: We are pleased that the court found the settlement to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. This preliminary approval is a major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers. It further ensures each customer impacted by an improper retail sales practice has every opportunity for remediation. This is in addition to our direct efforts to review accounts and provide remediation. These efforts are fundamental to restoring trust with all our stakeholders and building a better Wells Fargo for the future. July 27, 2017 -- Wells Fargo discloses that a separate internal investigation uncovered 570,000 customers with car loans form the bank who may have been inappropriately charged for failing to maintain qualifying insurance on their cars. ""For approximately 20,000 customers, the additional costs of the insurance could have contributed to a default that resulted in the repossession of their vehicle,"" says the bank. Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo consumer lending, states: We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the CPI [collateral protection insurance] program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers, who expect and deserve better from us. Upon our discovery, we acted swiftly to discontinue the program and immediately develop a plan to make impacted customers whole. Aug. 4, 2017 -- Sloan issues a companywide message on the bank's ""rebuilding trust efforts,"" noting among other things that ""[b]ecause there is so much interest in the work we are doing to rebuild trust, we can expect more headlines as we fulfill our commitment to identify and fix problems and make things right for our customers."" Aug. 15, 2017 -- Wells Fargo announces that three members of its board, including chairman Stephen Sanger, will retire at the end of the year. Former Federal Reserve governor Elizabeth ""Betsy"" Duke was unanimously elected by the board to replace Sanger, who says: Betsy was the unanimous choice to lead the board as it continues its focus on strengthening oversight and rebuilding the trust of shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders. Her broad understanding of the financial system and markets combined with years of main street community banking experience make her the ideal chair to work with the rest of the board and Tim Sloan as Wells Fargo continues to move forward. Aug. 22, 2017 -- Sloan issues a companywide message ""to address team member questions and provide updates on the steps the company is taking to make things right for customers and build a better Wells Fargo."" Aug. 31, 2017 -- Wells Fargo reports the results of its expanded third-party review of its retail sales practices, increasing the number of potentially fake customer accounts up from 2.1 million to 3.5 million.

Company Stock Symbol Number of Shares Market Value as of 9/25/2017 American Express AXP 151,610,700 $13.4 billion Bank of America BAC 700,000,000 $17.3 billion Bank of New York Mellon BK 50,229,588 $2.6 billion Goldman Sachs GS 10,959,519 $2.5 billion M&T Bank MTB 5,382,040 $829 million Synchrony Financial SYF 17,463,000 $517 million U.S. Bancorp USB 85,063,167 $4.5 billion Wells Fargo WFC 467,987,270 $25.2 billion Data source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC Filings. Bank of America investment as per company press release. Some of Buffett's bank stocks have their own stories behind how they ended up in the portfolio. For example, Berkshire's massive Bank of America investment is the result of a savvy financial crisis-era investment that allowed Berkshire to purchase 700 million shares of the bank for less than one-third of their current market value. In other cases, Buffett simply loves to buy well-run businesses at fair prices. With that in mind, here's some color on how so many banks ended up in Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio. Image source: The Motley Fool. Simply put, banks have a lot of characteristics that Buffett is known to love. And thanks to government regulations, Berkshire Hathaway cannot simply acquire banks outright, so the company invests through bank stocks instead. For one thing, banking is a ""forever"" industry. People will always need safe places to put their money, and other companies will always need financial institutions to be able to conduct their own business. In short, Buffett likes picking the long-term winners in industries that will be around for centuries, and few industries are more durable than banking. In addition, banks receive cash from depositors for next to nothing and lend it out to creditworthy borrowers to make a profit. This is similar to the insurance business, another Buffett favorite, which provides low-cost capital through paid-in premiums, which the company can then invest at a profit. Another reason Buffett has accumulated so many bank stocks is because there have been plenty of opportunities to do so at a bargain, which Buffett has taken advantage of. I already mentioned the Bank of America investment, and the Goldman Sachs stake was also a product of the financial crisis. Another example is that Buffett initially purchased shares of American Express during a banking panic in the 1960s. Additionally, M&T Bank was purchased in the wake of the Savings and Loan Crisis in 1991. In Buffett's most recent letter to shareholders, he said, ""widespread fear is your friend as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases."" This has been especially true in the banking industry over the years. Not all of Buffett's bank investments have been bargains. Some were just Buffett doing what he does best -- finding the best companies in a durable industry. The two biggest examples of this in Berkshire's portfolio are Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, which are consistently among the most profitable and efficient big banks in America. Although, to be fair, Wells Fargo was purchased at a time when the bank's shares were trading at an incredibly low valuation. Take a look at the return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) of these two banks (the blue and yellow lines in the chart) compared to the rest of the five largest U.S. banks in recent years. This consistent performance is the key reason Buffett hasn't gotten rid of his Wells Fargo investment, even after the scandals plaguing the bank. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. First off, I never suggest you buy any stock simply because a billionaire owns it, even if that billionaire is Warren Buffett. Additionally, it's fair to say that at the time Buffett bought most of his bank stocks, they were trading at big discounts relative to their current valuations. Having said that, there could be some bargains to be found, here. For example, I recently wrote how Wells Fargo could be a great buy for investors who have the patience to wait out the fallout from its recent scandals. Recent addition Synchrony Financial could also be a bargain for long-term investors. However, it's important to do your own research before investing in these, or any other, bank stocks in your own portfolio. ","
      
    Why Warren Buffett Loves Bank Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Eric Volkman,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Analysts at investment banks cover a great many stocks, but some big names aren't as widely tracked as you might expect. Such is the case with Warren Buffett's investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B). It's hard to say why, but it's covered by only a handful of prognosticators. Newly added to those ranks is Sarah Dewitt of JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) J.P. Morgan unit. She recently initiated coverage with an ""overweight"" recommendation, at a price target of $210 for the company's B shares (they currently trade around $183). Let's take a look at the key points of her argument and see whether they hold water. In J.P. Morgan's initial research note on Berkshire Hathaway, Dewitt describes the company as ""a collection of best-in-class businesses with unmatched balance sheet strength."" That's broadly true. Focusing our gaze on Berkshire Hathaway's top three stock holdings by market value -- Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- shows that while all have their weaknesses (and aren't necessarily ""best-in-class""), they have plenty of advantages, too. High on Dewitt's list of pluses for Berkshire Hathaway is the earnings potential of the insurance and railroad businesses, two of the company's largest segments. Lead insurance asset GEICO has managed to take significant market share through aggressive marketing and competitive pricing during a time of rising premiums in its industry. And Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF, one of America's top rail operators, is leveraging this strong position by investing in rail network improvements. It's also expanding with new routes. Both developments sound like tasty recipes for growth to me. And they're highly significant, as insurance and rail combined were responsible for nearly 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's earnings last year. Another contributor to what is bound to be robust growth is Berkshire Hathaway's bulging war chest. Dewitt points out that the company has an eye-watering $66 billion in excess cash (i.e., the amount over the $20 billion it wants to maintain at all times). Image source: The Motley Fool. That cash is in good hands. Buffett and his team have proven they're never in a rush to plow recklessly into an acquisition. They always seem to find the right assets at the right moment to goose portfolio value. Witness the company's renewed plunge into Apple around New Year's, shortly after which the tech giant delivered Q1 earnings that broke records and sent the stock skyward. Dewitt didn't wear rose-colored glasses while examining Berkshire Hathaway; she's sober-minded and realistic about the risks it faces. Chief among these is the ""key man"" problem -- in other words, what happens when the now 87-year-old Buffett exits the scene. She's also concerned that profitability and book value ""have meaningful sensitivity"" to the broader American economy. Yet Dewitt believes, as I do, that the advantages of Berkshire Hathaway far outweigh the risks. Post-Buffett, his value investing approach will almost certainly stay in place at the company given how successful it's been. And that stock portfolio is a thing of beauty. You can probably find any number of funds that hold Apple, Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz, and other wide-moat companies. However, there are precious few that mix these blue chips in with other investments to produce the sustained outperformance that Berkshire Hathaway has delivered. Yes, it still leans heavily on Buffett's preferred sectors -- he has always loved financials, and he enjoys riding the rails -- but it's spread out enough to mitigate the impact of an economic shock plus the insurance losses sure to arise from the recent natural disasters. The company has been through market dives before and has come out stronger on the other end. Ultimately, J.P. Morgan's assessment of Berkshire Hathaway is pretty much on the money. I think it's a good note that supports an accurate recommendation on the stock, which in my mind is unquestionably a buy candidate for any investor. ","
      
    A Major Bank Rates Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway a Buy. Should You Pull the Trigger? -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Did you know that Warren Buffett earns thousands of dollars in dividends per minute? Or that lunch with the Oracle of Omaha is apparently worth millions? These are just a couple of interesting facts about Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) legendary CEO that you may not be aware of. When Warren Buffett originally bought shares in a struggling textile manufacturer named Berkshire Hathaway in 1962, he was simply trying to make a quick profit, not take over the company and grow it in to a conglomerate. Image source: The Motley Fool. Buffett became so infuriated that not only did he refuse to sell, but he bought enough Berkshire stock to take control of the company (and fire the manager who refused to honor the original agreement). Berkshire's shares are worth approximately $275,000 each as I write this. Surprisingly, Buffett has referred to his takeover of Berkshire as the worst investment he's ever made. The vast majority (about 99%) of Buffett's wealth is in Berkshire Hathaway stock, and generally when you read about ""Buffett stocks,"" you're actually reading about stocks Buffett or his team have purchased for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. However, Buffett does maintain a personal stock portfolio that's worth a significant amount of money. He rarely discusses investments in his personal portfolio, but we do know a few. Major Berkshire holding Wells Fargo is also one of Buffett's personal holdings, as is real estate investment trust Seritage Growth Properties. Buffett has said that the stocks he holds are similar in nature to what he would buy for Berkshire, but he holds some that wouldn't make the cut based on size -- Seritage is a good example of this. Warren Buffett has donated more than $30 billion to charitable organizations over the years, and is planning to give away substantially all of his remaining wealth. As part of his philanthropy, Buffett auctions off a lunch with himself every year to benefit anti-poverty charity GLIDE. The auctions, which were an idea of Buffett's late wife Susie in 2000, give the winner a lunch for themselves and up to seven friends with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in New York City. The bids regularly extend into the millions. The 2017 winner paid $2.68 million for the lunch, and 2016's winner paid $3.4 million. In all, the auctions have generated over $26 million for the foundation. Much of this amount came from Berkshire's largest stock holdings, including $148 million from Coca-Cola, $182 million from Wells Fargo, and more than $195 million from Kraft Heinz. Buffett loves dividend stocks, especially those that consistently raise their payouts, as they generate a reliable stream of cash that Berkshire can put to work in any way management sees fit. You might be surprised to learn that Berkshire regularly underperforms the markets in years when the stock market is soaring. For example, when the S&P 500 jumped by 29% in 2003, Berkshire's stock rose by less than 16%. When the S&P rebounded nearly 27% from the financial crisis in 2009, Berkshire gained less than 3%. Buffett openly acknowledges that Berkshire will often fail to beat the market during its best years. However, Berkshire's long-term success is due to beating the market when times are tough. In investing, a smart defensive strategy can generate far superior gains to an aggressive one, and Berkshire's track record is proof of this. In fact, while the S&P 500 generated total returns of 12,717% from 1964 through 2016, Berkshire returned a staggering 1,972,595%, despite underperforming the market several years along the way.

If you want to understand Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK), or any bank for that matter, you should look at it from different angles, one of which is the quality of leadership. Image source: Getty Images. Leadership is hard to quantify because it's subjective, but there are nevertheless metrics that measure it. My favorite is the CEO approval score on Glassdoor.com, a website where current and former employees review companies and their management. The instinct in Bank of the Ozarks' case is to assume that its chairman and CEO, George Gleason, must have sky-high scores. How could he not given the bank's incredible performance over the past 20 years? *Includes banks on the KBW large and regional banking indexes that have generated a positive return since 1997. Data source: S&P's Capital IQ. As you can see, no other bank comes close to Bank of the Ozarks in terms of total shareholder return. Since going public in 1997, the biggest bank in Arkansas has returned a total of more than 5,000%. Compared to other banks, it's like a giraffe among Shetland ponies. Yet, Gleason's approval rating is lower than any major bank CEO that I've seen. Only 65% of employees who have submitted reviews on Glassdoor approve of the job he's doing. The most popular bank CEOs -- those like U.S. Bancorp's Richard Davis, Capital One's Richard Fairbank, and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon -- get approval scores above 90%. Even CEOs that don't do as well -- those of smaller regional banks such as BB&T's Kelly King, PNC Financial's William Demchak, and SunTrust Banks' William Rogers -- come in comfortably above 70%. Bank CEO Employee Approval Score Capital One Richard Fairbank 93% U.S. Bancorp Richard Davis* 92% JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon 91% Citigroup Michael Corbat 88% BB&T Kelly King 88% Wells Fargo Timothy Sloan 82% Bank of America Brian Moynihan 80% PNC Financial William Demchak 78% SunTrust Banks William Rogers 76% Fifth Third Bancorp Greg Carmichael 74% Bank of the Ozarks George Gleason 65% *Davis retired earlier this year as CEO, but remains chairman of U.S. Bancorp. Data source: Glassdoor.com. Another thing that caught my eye on Glassdoor's page for Bank of the Ozarks is the trend in Gleason's approval rating over time. At one point last year, Gleason's rating dipped below 20%. It stayed around there for months before heading higher this year. Indeed, the more you dig in, the worse Bank of the Ozarks looks when it comes to leadership. Only a third of reviewers would recommend the bank as an employer to a friend, while just 39% of them perceive the bank's business outlook to be positive. Of the five ratings categories that Glassdoor covers -- culture and values, work/life balance, senior management, compensation and benefits, and career opportunities -- Bank of the Ozarks gets the lowest score for senior management, a mere 2.3 out of 5.0. Image source: Glassdoor.com. How should investors and analysts square this with the bank's stock performance and the legendary stature of Gleason? I have no idea, but I think there's more to this story than meets the eye. ","

 ,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Supported by Breakingviews By Gina Chon A botched investigation into a hack at the Securities and Exchange Commission is a warning for other regulatory agencies. The agency’s chairman, Walter J. Clayton, told senators on Tuesday that he did not know the exact timing of a breach from last year and that his predecessor may not have been notified. That is troubling given the sensitive market data kept there. During a Senate hearing this week, Mr. Clayton shed little new light on the breach into the S.E.C.’s corporate-disclosure filing system, which the agency disclosed only last week. Mr. Clayton said he only learned about it in August, a few months after he joined the agency. He also said he did not have any reason to believe that his predecessor, Mary Jo White, had been notified. Agency bosses don’t have to be told about every hack, but the breach of the S.E.C.’s Edgar filing system, which is used by public companies and relied upon by investors, should have been reported promptly to the top. Senators asked whether the hack raises concerns about other data housed at the S.E.C., including the Consolidated Audit Trail scheduled to go live later this year. That will contain a record of orders for most equity and listed option trades, and nonpublic information about the customers behind them. Even before the S.E.C. hack was revealed, stock exchanges and traders were worried about the potential for cyberattacks targeting that data. At the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, investment firms have been worried about an automated trading plan that would give the agency access to trading-firm source codes without a subpoena. The agency is revising the rule after backlash from the industry, but it will probably still push for a database of trading records. Several other regulators also house market-moving information, including enforcement actions. Deal reviews are conducted by the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. And the Food and Drug Administration’s decisions on whether to approve new medications are closely watched by investors. Agencies are also hampered by insufficient resources. Their purse strings are controlled by Congress, which routinely provides less funding than the S.E.C., C.F.T.C. and other agencies request. Investor worry over their defenses is justified.

Francine McKenna,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 26, 2017 4:23 p.m. ET Clawback rules require a material financial restatement, which isn’t going to happen at Equifax By Senate Banking Committee members had a lot of questions for Jay Clayton, the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, on Tuesday, but several senators switched gears to ask about compensation clawbacks after news broke that Equifax CEO Richard Smith was retiring.

                                    disclosed on Sept.7 that criminals had exploited a flaw in its website to gain access to confidential data about 143 million consumers. An Equifax spokesperson told MarketWatch that Smith, whose retirement is effective immediately, won’t receive a “package” to retire and will not receive a 2017 bonus based on the company’s performance. Smith received bonuses of about $3 million a year in 2016 and 2015 . Smith will also will not receive severance pay, which could have been as much as $5 million. However, Smith will still receive some $18.3 million in pension benefits he is entitled to under any circumstance, according to the spokesperson. Read: After breach, Equifax CEO leaves with $18 million pension, and possibly more Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, was more focused during the hearing on Clayton’s call for more IPOs, but after the hearing she issued a statement about Equifax and Smith. “I’ve called for Equifax executives to be held accountable for their role in failing to stop this data breach and hiding it from the public for forty days,” said Warren. “It’s not real accountability if the CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay and without publicly answering questions.” Smith, who the board said would retire as of Tuesday, was expected to appear before the House Energy Committee and Senate Banking Committee next week. See also: Equifax faces its biggest litigation threat from state attorneys general Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and the ranking member on the banking committee, asked why, given the situation at Equifax, the SEC still had not finalized the 2010 Dodd-Frank law’s clawback policy. Clayton said that the Dodd-Frank clawback rule was “on his list” and that he intended to “finish the mandate,” but he welcomed the senators’ input on the agency’s remaining Dodd-Frank rulemaking priorities. The SEC’s regulatory agenda announced July 20 made no mention of another Dodd-Frank rule never finalized, Section 956, which prohibits incentive-based compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. However, despite the senators’ outrage and call for SEC action on clawbacks, neither one of the post-crisis policies — the Dodd-Frank clawback rule or the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley clawback rule — is applicable to the Equifax situation. Read: SEC’s clawback proposal leaves a big loophole That’s because the broader Dodd-Frank policy, not yet finalized by the SEC, and the Sarbanes-Oxley clawback law that focuses only on CEOs and CFOs, both require a material restatement of prior financial results to trigger enforcement. So do most company policies, such as the one at Equifax or the one at Wells Fargo

                                   . Equifax’s policy is even more forgiving than Wells Fargo’s, exempting executives from clawbacks unless the misstatement of financial results is the result of fraud. That's similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley policy that requires misconduct by someone. The Equifax policy, however, does leave open the possibility that if an executive engages “in certain other activities detrimental to the Company” he or she may be subject to financial consequences such cancellation of equity grants. But just like the Sarbanes-Oxley clawback policy, where the SEC has a lot of latitude in enforcement if companies fail to do so, Equifax’s clawback policy leaves a lot of the interpretation of these terms up to the board. “More and more companies are adopting fairly comprehensive clawback policies as contained in Dodd-Frank, but very few are actually invoking the policy to clawback compensation,” said Divesh Sharma, an accounting professor at Kennesaw State University’s Coles College of Business, whose research focuses on corporate clawback policies. “Companies are simply checking the compliance box.” See also:  Rarely enforced SEC rules may give green light to earnings manipulation “The terms ‘materiality’ and ‘misconduct’ are quite subjective,” said Sharma “In allowing these executives to retire, the board is signaling, at this point, they do not believe any of them committed any misconduct or failed as a manager,” he said. In the case of Wells Fargo’s CEO John Stumpf and senior executive Carrie Tolstedt, the reported eventual clawback numbers looked big but were still only a fraction of their overall compensation. In addition, the majority of the clawed-back amounts consisted of unvested stock-option awards, rather than cash already paid out. Wells Fargo clawed back approximately $28 million paid as incentive compensation in March 2016 under a 2013 equity grant, in addition to the $41 million in unvested equity awards that Stumpf agreed to forfeit shortly before his October 2016 resignation, according to a blog post by Kevin LaCroix, author of the blog D&O Diary. The $28 million already paid will be deducted from his retirement plan payouts, according to the bank’s statements at the time. Based on the findings of its board investigation, the bank was also able to support a change in view of Tolstedt’s retirement with honors, determining that “cause existed” for Tolstedt’s September 2016 termination. That permitted the board to request forfeiture of $47.3 million outstanding stock-option awards, in addition to $19 million of unvested equity awards the board caused to be forfeited at the time of her termination. The total value of Tolstedt’s compensation forfeitures was approximately $66.3 million, and as with Stumpf, the majority was compensation that had not yet been turned into cash. See also: Wells Fargo CEO’s $41 million ranks only third among executive-pay clawbacks, forfeitures Wells Fargo did more than most companies because it is a bank subject to under stricter regulatory requirements after the financial crisis. In Wells Fargo’s case, that stricter policy also allowed it justify a clawback based on reputational damage to the bank and poor risk management. LaCroix also cited an article in 2016 by Columbia Law Professor John Coffee on the CLS Blue Sky Blog, in which he commented, “Wells Fargo’s far broader clawback policy was the result of pressure from New York City’s pension funds in 2013, which had threatened to file a shareholder proxy resolution unless Wells Fargo adopted a policy broadly authorizing clawbacks beyond the context of restatements.” ","Senators press SEC chairman on Dodd-Frank clawbacks, but Equifax execs ineligible - MarketWatch"

But there were roadblocks in content licensing that made innovation tough, until now. “Netflix has been working solidly to come up with algorithms to match consumers with their content — also Netflix has a lot more power than they did back in 2009 to get people to allow them to search their video,” Johnson said in an email to MarketWatch. “The advances in [artificial intelligence] and neural networks means that they can now make sense of that data. “Essentially, they are looking for patterns in the data that equal the right output they are looking for.

That’s in contrast to actively managed funds, where the securities are individually selected by a portfolio manager. The shift away from active and into passive has been dramatic, driven by both the lower cost and historically better performance of passive funds. According to Morningstar, passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion over 2016, while actively managed funds saw outflows of $285.2 billion, a trend that has occurred for nearly 10 years.

According to FactSet, fully one-seventh of the nearly $4.2 trillion in global ETF assets are in funds tracking the benchmark U.S. equity index. The result of that is that passive funds now own an average of 17% of each component of the S&P 500, per Goldman’s data (the range is as little as 10%, and as much as 35%), whereas passive ownership was “a rounding error” a decade ago. Vanguard alone has at least a 5% stake in 468 components of the S&P 500, according to a June report in The Wall Street Journal, up from just three components in 2005. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Also: Vanguard calls for more diverse corporate boards, better climate-change disclosures As buying and selling index-funds essentially means buying and selling every component of the underlying index, “less trading is stemming from views on company fundamentals,” Goldman wrote. “Passive holders trade stock for different reasons than active managers, and at different frequencies. Passive’s decision to buy or sell stocks is often directed by broader fund flows and larger rebalances and not typically company specific fundamentals.” The investment bank calculated that for the average S&P 500 company, the share of its stock that might trade on fundamental views has dropped to 77% compared with 95% a decade ago. Those figures are based on a measure Goldman calls “passive-adjusted float,” or the number of shares outstanding minus both restricted holdings and passive holdings. “The impact on portfolio construction, alpha and trading are not fully appreciated by investors,” Fogertey wrote. Alpha refers to outperformance over a benchmark. Earlier this month, UBS analysts wrote that worries over the impact passive investing and ETFs would have on price discovery and liquidity were “misguided.” The firm noted that while passive funds comprise 46% of total ETF and mutual fund assets, they only accounted for 8% of the overall global equity market value. “If the investment landscape were limited to ETFs and mutual funds, it may warrant the current level of attention,” they wrote. “However, the investment landscape is far more expansive than just ETFs and mutual funds. There are hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and equities managed by other institutional investors and households that should factor into the analysis.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Related: Don’t blame ETFs or passive investors for high valuations Nonetheless, the impact of this factor depends on the specific security, as “passive ownership varies in both size and scope even within sectors.” Roughly 30% of the float of energy firm ONEOK

In September 2016, Wells Fargo said its employees may have created more than 2 million accounts without customer approval. Several executives were subsequently fired, but a review also turned up possible abuses with other products such as auto and life insurance. The third-largest U.S. bank has since tried to improve sales practices and restore trust with customers. Last month, Wells Fargo said the unauthorized accounts totaled as many as 3.5 million. “Since last October, we have taken numerous important steps to fix issues, make things right for our customers and build a better bank,” a bank spokesperson told Reuters via email on Thursday. Wells Fargo shares gained 0.57 percent to $54.05 in morning trading. On Aug. 1, the 11 Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee wrote to its Republican Chairman, Mike Crapo, asking that both Sloan and the board of directors be called to testify before the Committee this month. The letter lists nine new developments since Sloan's predecessor John Stumpf appeared before the Senate Banking Committee in September last year. These included ""concerns about the bank retaliating against employees and purposefully concealing evidence from regulators of systemic problems at the bank."" reut.rs/2tLsbsv During last year’s testimony, Stumpf seemed unprepared under tough questioning from Democrats and Republicans, and Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren accused him of “gutless leadership.” He resigned less than a month later. Warren has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to remove all members of the Wells Fargo board of directors who had served during the time the fake accounts were created. ","

Sloan will appear before the Senate Banking Committee, which writes rules for his industry, at a hearing titled “Wells Fargo: One Year Later,” on October 3. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn declined to comment. No one from Sidley Austin was available to comment outside of office hours. The testimony will be Sloan’s first congressional appearance since he took over as CEO in October of last year, roughly a month after Wells Fargo reached a settlement with regulators over the creation of as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts. The bank has since disclosed problems with other products, including auto and life insurance, and recently revised its estimate for the number of accounts that were potentially opened without customers’ authorization to 3.5 million. In his own congressional appearances last year, Sloan’s predecessor, John Stumpf, often lacked answers to questions posed by legislators. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren accused him of “gutless leadership.” He left the bank less than a month later and was replaced by Sloan. The law firm that prepared Stumpf for his testimony, Gibson Dunn, will still be working for Wells Fargo, but in a supporting role, said one of the sources. No one from Gibson Dunn was immediately available to comment outside of office hours. Hundreds of outside law firms work for Wells Fargo on various matters, and the bank’s new general counsel, Allen Parker, recently hired a new chief operating officer for the legal team, Tom Trujillo, who is reviewing those relationships. The hiring of Sidley Austin, however, was directed by Wells Fargo’s government affairs office, said one of the sources. ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight of the largest U.S. banks and 82 foreign banks will have an extra year to submit their so-called living wills outlining how they would be unwound in the event of bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. The extension granted by the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) forms part of a broader effort by financial regulators to ease onerous post-crisis regulations under Republican President Donald Trump’s pro-growth agenda. “The agencies continue to explore ways to improve the resolution planning process and believe it is worthwhile to consider extending the cycle for living will submissions from annual to once every two years. Today’s action is a step towards that end,” the Fed said in a statement. The eight large domestic banks will have until July 1, 2019 to file their plans, while the 82 foreign banks will have until Dec. 31, 2018. Under the Dodd-Frank reform act, the largest U.S. banks must present plans that explain how they would be unwound in the case of a financial crisis without shaking the broader global financial system. The regulators are currently reviewing plans submitted by the big eight banks on July 1. The extension will not affect the review process, the Fed said. Banks have long argued that the annual cycle for submitting living wills - which can comprise thousands of pages - is too onerous. In a June 12 report outlining Trump’s financial de-regulatory reform agenda, the U.S. Treasury recommended extending the cycle to two years, revising the threshold for banks that must submit living wills, and increasing the transparency of guidance regulators feedback on to banks on the plans.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"Allergan shares have fallen by around a fifth in value since late July but were up nearly 4 percent in morning trading on Monday. The company also said its Chief Financial Officer Tessa Hilado, 53, would retire. The planned stock buyback follows Allergan’s completion of a separate $15 billion repurchase, and after the company reported mixed trial data for its experimental treatment of NASH liver fibrosis. Allergan on Friday also received a “refusal to file” letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an expanded approval for its Vraylar drug to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia in adults. Allergan said it had begun to search for a new finance chief, but declined to provide further comment on Hilado’s departure. Analysts at Bernstein, based on discussions with Allergan’s investor relations team, said Hilado’s departure was her personal decision and should not be viewed as suggesting “issues this year or 2018.” Hilado did not have broad support among Allergan investors and her exit would not be a “particularly strong negative,” they added. Hilado joined Allergan in 2014 and will continue in her current role until a successor is named. Allergan, which said it was committed to boosting its dividend payout annually, also backed its 2017 financial guidance and its commitment to pay down $3.75 billion of debt in 2018. The drugmaker had $30.24 billion in current and long-term debt and capital leases as of June 30. “While the CFO’s departure may create greater uncertainty, we take the company’s reaffirmation of 2017 guidance and third quarter revenue projections as offsetting positives,” Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said.

Financials .SPSY, up 0.12 percent, and the Russell 2000 index of smallcap stocks , up 0.27 percent, which are expected to be among the beneficiaries of a tax reduction, turned higher after trading lower in the early portion of the session. But gains were tempered with equities at record highs and valuations elevated. The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) on the S&P stood at 17.9 compared with its long-term average of 15.1 while the forward P/E on the Russell is 26.3 against an average of 21.3. “It looks like the market doesn’t want to sell strength here, it wants to buy weakness,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump’s proposal for a cut in the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent was “not negotiable.” The plan, which called for tax cuts for most Americans, also drew criticism for favoring business and the rich and potentially adding trillions of dollars to the deficit. A Commerce Department report showed the economy grew a bit faster than previously estimated in the second quarter, but the momentum probably slowed in the third as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily curbed activity. The storms also pushed up initial claims for state unemployment benefits for the week, the Labor Department said. “People are waiting to see if the economy actually picks up, they are going to be waiting a long time if they are anticipating it is going to pick up meaningfully,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 40.49 points, or 0.18 percent, to 22,381.2, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 3.02 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,510.06 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.19 points, to 6,453.45. The healthcare index .SPXHC led S&P gainers, rising by a third of a percent.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,路透台北9月22日 - 美联储(FED)的决议一如所料，维持利率不变且宣布10月开始缩表。金融市场事前已有所预期，基本上没有太大惊奇。在联储后议后路透所做的调查显示，华尔街初级交易商认为美联储将在12月再次升息，资产负债表将降至3万亿美元。 量化宽松(QE)货币政策就此行将落幕。全球其他国家虽因各有烦恼，无法立刻复制美联储行动，但QE淡出舞台已是大势所趋，各家央行决策者不得不思考收紧政策路径，接下来，谁将接力缩减刺激举措？ 周四标普下调中国主权信用评级，称长时间的强劲信贷增长提高了中国的经济金融风险。虽然标普此次调降使得其对中国的评级与穆迪和惠誉相同，但鉴于中共十九大将在几周后召开，此次调降的时机颇令人意外。 展望下周，重磅数据将相继登场，有英国GDP、美国第二季GDP终值和美联储看重的通胀指标PCE物价指数。日本德国均将公布CPI、中国工业经济效益月度报告等。 此外，多位央行巨头，包括美联储主席叶伦、欧洲央行总裁德拉吉在内都有演说安排。新西兰央行将公布利率决议。 **美联储打响缩表第一枪** 美联储维持利率不变，并且将于10月开始缩减约4.2万亿美元的公债和抵押贷款支持证券(MBS)组合，最初将每月到期证券再投资规模减少至多100亿美元。 尽管近期通胀低迷，但美联储料仍在年底前再升息一次。联储主席叶伦在会后记者会上称，今年通胀下跌的原因仍是个谜，美联储随时准备在必要时调整利率前景。 联储决议发布后，金融市场几乎未受影响。虽然美联储的最新政策立场大部分被视为强硬，但也将其预估的长期“中性”利率从3.0%再次下调至2.75%，反映出对整体经济活力的担忧。 “美联储可能坚持2017年再升息一次以及2018年升息三次的意图。但是联储也下调了长期利率预估，这导致美债收益率曲线趋平，在一定程度上减缓了美元兑日圆的涨势，”大和证券资深外汇策略师Yukio Ishizuki表示。 市场对美联储的反应相当直接，短券收益率的升幅大于长券收益率。债市投资者认为，低通胀和低增长的情况将会持续。美债收益率曲线因而趋平，30年期与两年期美债收益率利差缩至近两个月最窄，距离近10年最窄纪录不远，连带地也牵动了市场对美元后市的看法。美元指数很快地就从两周峰值走下坡。 “不错，美联储是告诉大家，将会继续收紧政策，但欧洲央行、加拿大央行，甚至英国央行现在也告诉大家，它们将开始将政策正常化，”Wells Fargo Securities汇市策略师Erik Nelson说。“这与一两年前的情况形成显明的对照，当时美联储是唯一收紧政策的央行。” 安联分析师Charlie Ripley则指出，美联储向市场传递了些许鹰派的讯息，即货币政策正常化已经全面展开。他说：“不过美联储内部有很多空缺，委员会构成可能会发生变化，特别是考虑到叶伦主席的任期明年2月到期，所以我认为，在看待这次的声明时应该有所保留”。 **欧洲央行缩减刺激举措？** 欧元区经济连续17个季度增长，有助欧洲央行缩减刺激措施。不过，消息人士对路透表示，决策者对于是否在10月政策会议上敲定结束印钞计划的明确时间看法分歧，他们很有可能至少保留在2018年延长购债操作的选项。 消息人士称，欧元持续强势打压了通胀，导致决策者看法分歧。德国等北方富国为首的鹰派准备缩减2.3万亿欧元的购债计划，但鸽派只是希望缩减每月购债规模。这样一来，官员们可能在10月26日的会议寻求妥协，不会确定购债操作的结束日期，或将推迟至12月再做决定。 **英国央行跃跃欲试升息** 英国央行总裁卡尼在国际货币基金组织(IMF)的演说中表示，英国脱欧或将在短期内损害英国的增长前景幷且推升通胀，因英国要调整适应脱欧后的日子。 他还重申英国央行可能很快就要升息的讯息。不过由于卡尼在央行利率行动时间方面欠缺明确评论，他讲完话后英镑下跌。 路透调查显示，近三分之二的受访分析师目前预计英国央行将在11月升息，但四分之三的受访者认为那时候升息不是正确时机。 本周牵动英镑的更大因素是英相特雷莎·梅是否软化退欧身段。她周五稍晚将发表演说，部分媒体披露她将称英国愿在退欧过渡阶段支付200亿欧元换取单一市场准入等关税优惠。英镑由跌转升，逼近去年6月退欧公投后最高水平。 **标普调降中国评级* 标普将中国长期主权信用评级从“AA-”下调至“A+”，称因数年来为实现政府的经济增长目标而实施的信贷刺激，令中国面临控制由此滋生的金融风险的挑战。 虽然对中国信贷持续强劲增长的担忧近几季加剧，但中国上半年GDP增长6.9%的增速超过预期。一些分析师称，下调评级不会对金融市场产生太大影响。 “这一决定已不是新鲜事，降评后标普对中国的评级与惠誉及穆迪相同。此举对金融市场的影响将非常有限，”瑞穗银行驻香港亚洲外汇策略师Ken Cheung表示。“对于那些投资人民币计价债券的投资者而言，他们更关心的是对人民币的预期。下调评级的决定对资本流入的影响可能也有限。” 根据国际清算银行(BIS)数据，8月人民币实际有效汇率指数续升0.54%，名义有效汇率指数升0.41%。实际有效汇率上升代表本国货币相对价值上升，下降表示本币贬值。(完) ,"

Mark Kolakowski,09282017,Investopedia,09212017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are projected to add $15.7 trillion to global GDP by the year 2030, an increase of 14% over baseline projections, according to PwC, a leading international accounting and consulting firm. Based on this and similar projections made by another consulting firm, Accenture, analysts at Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) have issued outperform ratings on nine stocks that they believe are well-positioned to ride the AI wave to greater profits and also longterm outperformance in the stock market, Barron's reports. While computers now dominate government, Corporate America and Wall Street, the growing use of AI is moving technology many steps further by enabling computers to think, learn and reason like humans, enabling computers to perform more sophisticated tasks. Five of these companies are based in the U.S. While they are all technology leaders, they serve a broad array of markets that include consumers and corporations: Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL); e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN); social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB); online marketplace eBay Inc. (EBAY); and video streaming service Netflix Inc. (NFLX). The other four are Chinese: social networking, payments, and online entertainment provider Tencent Holding Ltd. (TCEHY); online merchants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) and JD.com Inc. (JD); and Internet search, e-commerce platform, online payments processor, and web application software provider Baidu Inc. (BIDU).  These companies' dominance in their markets and in key sectors of the Internet position them well to exploit artificial intelligence as its influence spreads. (For more, see also: 7 Global Stocks For The Next Internet Boom.) In an attempt to put that $15 trillion or so in perspective, that's almost the current size of U.S. GDP ($18 trillion), over six times current global spending on e-commerce ($2.4 trillion), and 30 times current worldwide spending on advertising ($500 billion), according to the report by Wells Fargo as quoted by Barron's. Wells Fargo anticipates advances in neural network science that will produce stronger engagement among mobile and Internet users, with benefits for e-commerce and subscription-based business models. More specifically, artificial neural networks (modeled on the natural neural networks in human brains) are designed to facilitate machine learning, or the ability of computers to solve problems without task-specific programming. The early adoption of AI will be mainly in North America as companies boost productivity, PwC  says. However, they expect China to pull ahead in ten years, enjoying a 26% GDP boost by 2030, versus 14.5% in North America. Of the $15.7 trillion AI-driven global GDP increase forecasted for 2030, about $10.7 trillion will be in North America and China combined, or 68% of the total, PwC projects. In China, AI is projected to have its biggest industry impact in manufacturing, which is especially significant for the global economy since China is the world leader in manufacturing, Wells Fargo says, as quoted by Barron's. For the nine companies recommended by Wells Fargo, their 52 week share price gains through Wednesday, and current forward P/E ratios, are, respectively: Alphabet, 19%, 24; Amazon, 15%, 121; Facebook, 30%, 26; eBay, 19%, 17; Netflix, 87%, 89; Tencent, 54%, NA; Alibaba, 57%, 26; JD.com, 51%, 44; and Baidu, 28%, 27. For Tencent, the trailing P/E is 50. The source of this data is Yahoo Finance, which obtained forward earnings estimates from Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI).

Tae Kim,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Amazon shares are faltering this month along with many of its large-cap technology company peers. But the pullback is a buying opportunity, according to one Wall Street firm. Wells Fargo Securities began coverage of Amazon with an outperform rating on its shares and a price target of $1,400, which is 49 percent above Tuesday's closing price. It is also the highest target out of the 42 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet. Wells' analyst predicts the internet giant will be able to use artificial intelligence and data analysis to dominate new industries. ""Given a strong customer experience, scaled infrastructure investments, high user engagement, and lead within Cloud, we believe AMZN is among the best positioned to apply these neural network advances [artificial intelligence] across new verticals/industries,"" analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We see this lead in data, coupled with the company's edge in compute efficiency, as increasingly feeding insights into supply chain, for its retail, video, and other efforts, and through AWS, for its partners."" Amazon shares have rallied 25 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the market's 12 percent gain. But the stock is down 4 percent this month compared with the S&P 500's 1 percent gain. Amazon Web Services has 46 percent of the ""infrastructure-as-a-service"" commercial cloud computing market. Sena noted that the research firm IDC estimates the total public cloud computing market will grow to more than $200 billion by 2020. He also predicts the company can gain market share in the apparel, over-the-counter medicine and grocery product categories, which represent another $130 billion of potential sales in the U.S. The e-commerce giant operates on a so-called flywheel model in which low prices, repeat shoppers and a positive experience for buyers and sellers create a self-perpetuating cycle of growth. ""We see Amazon's famous flywheel as spinning with increasingly impenetrable force, where customer experience, frequency, and data will only grow,"" he wrote. Amazon shares are up 0.7 percent in the Wednesday premarket session after the report. ","Amazon gets its most bullish Wall Street call yet: $1,400 price forecast"
Evelyn Cheng,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The Wells Fargo Investment Institute doesn't expect the S&P 500 to rise more than 2 percent over the next 15 months, according to the firm's 2018 year-end outlook released Thursday. While some Wall Street strategists have included 2018 S&P targets in their equities notes, the Wells Fargo note marks the first major outlook report for next year. Wells Fargo gave a range of 2,450 to 2,550 for the S&P next year, a decline of 2.3 percent or a rise of nearly 1.7 percent from Wednesday's record close of 2,508.24. The S&P 500 also hit an intraday high Wednesday of 2,508.85. ""The synchronized global recovery that took hold in 2017 should gain in 2018, though restrained by ongoing global headwinds from high debt, slow labor recoveries overseas and political uncertainties around the world,"" Wells Fargo's global investment strategy team wrote in a Monday note that was distributed to the media Thursday. ""We also anticipate that earnings gains will fuel moderately higher U.S. and international equity markets,"" the report said. The strategists added that since the U.S. economy is likely in the ""final third"" of expansion, investors must be particularly aware of risks. In late August, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute raised its 2017 year-end target range by 70 points to 2,300 to 2,400. At the time, the increase still forecast, at best, a roughly 1 percent decline for the S&P. Among 15 strategists surveyed by CNBC last year, Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Scott Wren came the closest to predicting where the S&P would end the year, albeit at a range. The middle of his target range was 2,240, and the S&P ended 2016 at 2,238.83. ",Wells Fargo issues first outlook for 2018 from Wall Street and it's not bullish
Stephanie Landsman,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The stock market could come within a hair of a correction in the next three months, Wells Fargo says. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, sees problems for the S&P 500 as the record year comes to a close. ""Our midpoint of our target range for year-end 2018 is 2,500,""  Wren said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""We're basically there right now."" Wren is predicting a 4 to 8 percent dip from current levels before year's end. The official definition of a correction is a 10 percent drop. It appears his forecast may already be materializing. Just look at the Dow. The index is on its first four-day losing streak since June. But it's important to note that it has been a banner year for stocks. The Dow has soared nearly 13 percent while the S&P 500 is up 12 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has also reaped big gains, surging nearly 19 percent this year. ""Valuations are meaningfully stretched in that the trailing 12 month P/E ration on the S&P 500 is 20 and change. And, that's against about a 16½ 30-year median,"" Wren said. With stocks on the expensive side, an economy that's ""not really accelerating"" and a Federal Reserve that's firmly executing its rate-hike policy — Wren doesn't see much upside left. ""The net net move between now and the end of 2018 is probably going to be pretty small,"" he added. There's a silver lining in Wren's 2017 downward spiral forecast. His year-end S&P 500 price target for 2018 is 2,450 to 2,550, which would suggest solid gains next year. ""That would give us say a 5 to 8 percent return [in 2018],"" Wren said.

John Melloy,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The Federal Reserve's plan to methodically raise short-term interest rates over the next couple years may not boost bank shares, contrary to popular belief, and could instead hurt the group's profitability as it flattens the so-called yield curve, Deutsche Bank said. Analyst Matt O'Connor downgraded shares of JPMorgan and regional bank PNC Financial late Monday to hold from buy for this reason. The yield curve is the difference between short term and long-term rates in the Treasury market and often runs parallel to the margin banks make on their loans. ""We continue to believe the yield curve will flatten as the Fed continues to boost short term rates, the unwind of the Fed's bond book isn't likely to meaningfully impact the demand/supply of those assets, and economic growth seems unlikely to significantly accelerate (for a sustained period),"" wrote O'Connor. ""In this environment, net interest income growth is likely to slow and credit costs may begin to inch up."" JPMorgan shares rose more than 40 percent the last 12 months, more than the 33 percent gain for the Financial Select SPDR, as CEO Jamie Dimon guided the bank through a difficult trading environment on Wall Street. Bank shares have perked up again recently as the Fed indicated a December hike was likely and traders bet the move would boost both short term and long term rates, making the industry's lending portfolios more profitable. Deutsche Bank disagrees, apparently. JPMorgan fell slightly in premarket trading following the Deutsche call. ""Increased competition in investment banking/trading may erode some of JPM's recent gains,"" wrote the analyst. ""Post crisis (including in recent years), JPM has gained large market share across its investment bank (IB fees, FICC and EQ trading). However, the competitive landscape seems to have increased and even JPM mgmt (at its 2017 investor day) has acknowledged it will be difficult to maintain share."" PNC has done even better than JPMorgan, up 52 percent in one year. But that run has made the Pittsburgh-based bank too expensive. ""PNC shares now trade at 14.4 times 2018 consensus or a 10% premium to the Large Regional peer group. This compares to a 5% discount on average over both the historical 25-year and 5-year time horizon. Some premium is warranted in our view given the positives noted above, but further multiple expansion seems harder to argue for and we're less positive on Large Regional banks in general given concerns surrounding a flatter yield curve,"" stated the note. Deutsche still thinks factors such as loosening regulation and M&A activity can help the financial sector, but it favors ""turnaround"" stories such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo than the sector leaders. O'Connor also has a buy rating on Morgan Stanley. ",The run in JPMorgan is over and it's the Fed's fault: Deutsche Bank
John W. Schoen,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Call it a plan for a tax plan.American taxpayers eagerly awaiting details of President Donald Trump's ambitious tax reform plan Wednesday were left with more questions than answers. Building on a single page of campaign bullet points promising to simply the sprawling U.S. tax code, give middle-class workers a break and help businesses compete, the administration unveiled a long-awaited ""framework"" that provided only broad brush outlines of an overhaul proposal. But while the nine-page outline proposes sweeping changes, the impact of any reforms are all but impossible to estimate until congressional committees and lawmakers on Capitol Hill agree on specific provisions, let alone bring a bill to a vote. ""We have gone from one page of detail to nine pages of detail,"" said Paul Christopher, a market strategist at Wells Fargo. ""That's still not a complete tax plan."" To be sure, the White House document acknowledges the reality of the task ahead in building a consensus among multiple congressional committees with jurisdiction over budget and tax policy. The effort is further complicated by a GOP divided between fiscal ""hawks"" who want any tax cuts paid for by closing tax breaks to raise revenue and ""supply-siders"" who believe tax cuts will eventually pay for themselves by spurring economic growth.That's why the long-awaited document is being billed as a ""framework"" for tax reform, not an actual plan. One of the biggest unknowns starts with the basic tax brackets used to assess how much each American household owes the Treasury every April 15. To simplify the current system of seven separate income cutoffs, from 10 percent to the top 39.6 percent rate, the plan proposes cutting that to three – 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But the most important detail – when each bracket kicks in — has yet to be spelled out. ""The framework will have specific rates on businesses and families but the actual income parameters will be hammered out later,"" a senior White House official told reporters in a briefing Tuesday. Further confounding those trying to estimate the impact, the plan hints that an additional ""fourth bracket"" may be needed to assure that the wealthiest earners pay their fair share. Families would lose a popular tax break for dependents but get a bigger child tax credit and a $500 credit for dependents other than children. The plan clearly spells out a call to nearly double the so-called standard deduction from the current level to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. That would effectively shield that income from taxation for those at the bottom end of the income ladder. But anyone making more than that is left to wonder which of the dozens of lucrative tax breaks in the current tax code may be eliminated. The administration signaled at Tuesday's briefing that the popular deduction for taxes paid to state and local governments will be eliminated, but that repeal was not spelled out in Wednesday's nine-page framework. Nor did the plan address the prospects for repeal of popular deductions – the tax breaks for mortgage interest, charitable donations or medical expenses – that can lower a household's annual tax burden by thousands of dollars. The document also outlined various provisions for businesses, including a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. But while promising to ""modernize"" the dozens of tax breaks that favor specific companies and industries, those details remain to be spelled out. That process is certain to set off a fierce lobbying campaign by those favored by each provision. The document also called for a repeal of the alternative minimum tax, a provision originally intended to tax wealthy households that now reaches well into the middle class. And the plan also calls for eliminating the estate tax. Repealing those provisions may be politically popular. But doing so will be costly the U.S. Treasury. One way to make up the shortfall — and pay for lower tax rates on businesses and individuals —would be to close some of the many deductions, exemptions and exclusions that cost the government nearly $1.4 trillion in fiscal 2017, according to the Treasury. Targeting those tax breaks would spark a hard-fought political tug of war. That's why some lawmakers are hoping to avoid those battles by promising to make up any lost revenue with the prospect that tax cuts will spur the economy. Proponents of the argument claim that faster growth will generate enough new individual income and corporate profits to make up for lower rates.But the theory has numerous critics, including many economists who argue that the idea hasn't worked in the past. And, with the economic recovery now in its eighth year and unemployment at historic lows, it's unlikely a tax cut will have much impact. ""All the evidence shows that tax cuts, tax reform can be very effective, if there is considerable slack in the labor market if unemployment is relatively high,"" said Joachim Fels, a global economic advisor at Pimco. ""If you get a fiscal boost and tax reform this late in the cycle where most of the slack in the market is eroded, you're not going to get a lot of bang for your buck.""

Liz Moyer,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The abrupt departure of Equifax's chief executive officer on Tuesday has not dampened the criticism of the company since it disclosed a massive data breach earlier this month. As in other recent corporate scandals, the departure of Richard Smith was swift if not inevitable. The credit reporting company said he was retiring effective immediately and he wouldn't get a bonus for this year, though he is eligible to walk away with at least $18.4 million in pension benefits. Some said Tuesday his departure should have happened more quickly. Wells Fargo dispatched its former CEO last year, one month after regulators said thousands of its employees opened millions of fake deposit and credit card accounts to meet aggressive sales goals. Target's former CEO held on for four months before leaving in May 2014 in the wake of a major data breach at the retailer in late 2013. But Anthem's CEO did not leave that company after a 2015 data breach that exposed personal information for 79 million people. The second-largest U.S. insurer recently settled with victims of the hack for $115 million, the biggest data breach settlement yet. What struck people as different about Equifax's situation was the company's bungled response to its crisis. For starters, Equifax waited 40 days from the time it discovered the breach in late July to its public disclosure on Sept. 7. Waiting 40 days ""is pushing it,"" said Nathan Taylor, a cybersecurity lawyer at Morrison Foerster who has represented big companies in data breaches. Equifax's hack affected as many as 143 million people, including personal identifying information such as Social Security numbers, names and birth dates. That number amounts to more than half the U.S. adult population. ""They had to have known this was going to be an area of focus,"" added Taylor. Adding to Equifax's woes, the part of its website devoted to consumers worried about protecting their information was glitchy at first, and there was confusion over Equifax's customer dispute resolution rules. The management appeared slow to react with a cohesive message or customer outreach plan. ""Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize,"" Mark Feidler, the new chairman of Equifax's board, said Tuesday, adding it had formed a special committee to look into the data breach. Worse, says Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the company appeared to have no clear CEO succession plan. It named Paulino do Rego Barros, the president of its Asia-Pacific region, as interim chief while it conducts a search for a permanent successor. ""This is far less a frustration with the frontier of technology but rather just old fashioned missteps and terrible preventative practices,"" he said. Even Smith's fate, characterized as retirement, didn't sit well. Smith has been scheduled to testify about the breach in the House and the Senate next week, and his sudden departure made lawmakers react angrily. ""A CEO walking out the door just days before he is to appear before Congress is an abdication of his responsibility,"" Sen. Brian Schatz said in a statement Tuesday. Equifax's spokeswoman said Smith was still scheduled to make those appearances next week. The board's move is being interpreted as a way to get out ahead of what is anticipated to be a major grilling by lawmakers. ""The new standard with boards now is 'how badly will we look compared to other unnamed CEOs in front of Congress?'"" said Michael Peregrine, a corporate governance lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery. At the very least, Equifax's shares responded positively to the news on Tuesday, in the sense that they turned positive for the first time in a while. The stock has lost 26 percent of its value since the beginning of September. The shares closed Tuesday higher after spending most of the day lower on the Smith retirement news. Smith, who joined Equifax in 2005 after 22 years as an executive at General Electric, is staying on in an unpaid role to assist the company for 90 days, Equifax said in a securities filing. His total pay for 2016 was $14.9 million, according to the filing, including a $3 million bonus he might have been eligible to get this year as well. The rest of his 2017 compensation won't be decided until the conclusion of an independent review. ""This is akin to an oil tanker spill,"" Taylor said. ""It doesn't matter if the captain had 12 hours of sleep and tons of training, people are going to be watching everything you do."" ",Equifax CEO walks away with $18 million pension benefit

It has now been a year since industry regulators revealed the sales scandal at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). As the following timeline shows, a lot has happened since then at the 165-year-old bank. Image source: Getty Images. Sept. 8, 2016 -- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reveals that thousands of Wells Fargo employees opened 2 million deposit and credit card accounts that consumers may not have authorized. We have at any one time 100,000 team members in our branch and retail bank network. And we hire people, and people turn over. Of those 100,000, the vast majority do the right thing, they come to work. Their life's work and mission is to help people. And I love these people. Every year -- on average for the last five years, 1,000 did not do the right thing. Sept. 20, 2016 -- Stumpf testifies about the scandal to the Senate Banking Committee. He's panned in the media for being insufficiently contrite and unprepared for the senators' questions. Sept. 27, 2016 -- The independent members of Wells Fargo's board announce that Stumpf will forfeit $41 million in unvested equity awards and not be paid a bonus for 2016. It was also announced that the former head of the bank's retail unit, Carrie Tolstedt, had left the company and will forfeit $19 million in unvested equity awards, and similarly not receive a bonus for 2016. Sept. 29, 2016 -- Stumpf testifies before the House of Representative's Committee on Financial Services. Oct. 12, 2016 -- Stumpf resigns as chairman and CEO. President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan succeeds him at CEO, while former lead independent director Stephen Sanger becomes chairman. Stumpf says: I am grateful for the opportunity to have led Wells Fargo. I am also very optimistic about its future, because of our talented and caring team members and the goodwill the stagecoach continues to enjoy with tens of millions of customers. While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside. I know no better individual to lead this company forward than Tim Sloan. Oct. 14, 2016 -- Wells Fargo reports third-quarter earnings, the first with Sloan as CEO. According to Sloan's prepared remarks for the conference call: As the new CEO, my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo. As you know, on Sept. 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency], and the Los Angeles city attorney related to sales practices in retail banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders, and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders. Nov. 17, 2016 -- Issues first in a series of monthly updates on the performance of its retail unit in the wake of the scandal. The impact is seen in the 44% drop in the number of new consumer checking accounts opened in October compared with the year-ago period, as well as a 50% decline in new credit card applications. Nov. 29, 2016 -- Wells Fargo's board of directors amends the bank's bylaws to require the separation of the chairman and CEO roles and for the chairman and vice chairman of the board to be independent directors. According to the bank's newly elected chairman, Stephen Sanger: The board previously acted to elect an independent chairman to lead the board, and we believe formalizing this structure is the right decision at this time for the company and its investors, customers, and team members. Efforts to restore the trust of our customers and team members are well underway and will continue until we have fully addressed the issues surrounding retail banking sales practices. While the investigation of these practices and related matters by the independent directors continues in earnest, we believe this action will enhance the board's independence and its oversight of the company's management, and we appreciate the feedback that we received from our investors on this matter. Feb. 20, 2017 -- Wells Fargo elects two new independent board members: Karen B. Peetz, retired president of The Bank of New York Mellon, and Ronald L. Sargent, retired chairman and CEO of office-supply retailer Staples. Feb. 21, 2017 -- Wells Fargo fires four former leaders of its retail bank. March 1, 2017 -- Wells Fargo reports that no members of its executive committee will receive bonuses for 2016 and that equity awards they received in 2014 that vest after 2016 will be reduced by up to 50%. The result is an aggregate reduction in compensation totaling approximately $32 million, according to the bank. Sanger says: These compensation actions for the Operating Committee, though not related to any findings of improper behavior, are part of the board's ongoing efforts to promote accountability and ensure Wells Fargo puts customer interests first. As we seek to regain trust, the board is taking decisive actions. We will continue to work to make right what went wrong and remain focused on providing the accountability and oversight that our customers, employees, and investors expect and deserve. March 21, 2017 -- Sloan hosts a companywide town hall meeting to introduce six new long-term goals and preview a new national advertising campaign entitled ""Building Better Every Day."" From Sloan's prepared remarks: We're making things right for our customers and our team members. We are fixing problems, and we're building a better bank for the future. As we rebuild trust, we will reintroduce to our stakeholders what our Wells Fargo bankers have always been known for, and that's helping our customers to succeed financially. March 28, 2017 -- The OCC, the primary regulator for national banks, downgrades Wells Fargo's Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating to ""Needs to Improve"" as a result of ""previously issued regulatory consent orders."" Sloan says: We are disappointed with this rating given Wells Fargo's strong track record of lending to, investing in, and providing service to low- and moderate-income communities. However, we are committed to addressing the OCC's concerns because restoring trust in Wells Fargo and building a better bank for our customers and our communities is our top priority. Wells Fargo is deeply committed to economic growth, sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in low- and moderate-income communities and will continue to invest above and beyond what is required by CRA. March 28, 2017 -- Wells Fargo says that it reached a $110 million agreement to settle a class action lawsuit filed in May 2015 over the bank's retail sales practices. Sloan says: This agreement is another step in our journey to make things right with customers and rebuild trust. We want to ensure that each customer impacted by our sales practices issue has every opportunity for remediation, and this agreement presents an additional option. We continue to encourage customers to contact us directly so that we can act quickly to refund fees and address any concerns. April 4, 2017 -- CEO Tim Sloan publishes open letter to the bank's customers to ""thank them for their loyalty"" and share updates regarding its retail sales practices. Sloan says: As we work toward rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members, community partners, and shareholders, we are committed to keeping our stakeholders informed. This is why we are not only thanking them, but also sharing the significant progress we have made to make things right, fix problems, and build a better Wells Fargo, recognizing much work remains that we are committed to do. April 7, 2017 -- Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services issues a report urging shareholders to vote against the re-election of 12 out of the bank's 15 board members. Wells Fargo's board responds with a prepared statement laying out eight steps the bank has taken in response to the sales scandal. April 10, 2017 -- Wells Fargo releases the findings of an investigation into the company's retail sales practices overseen by a special committee of the bank's independent directors and assisted by the law firm Shearman & Sterling. Sloan says: The board's report is a necessary examination of what went wrong in our culture, operations, and governance. It's clear from the board's review that we had an incentive program and high-pressure sales culture in our Community Bank that over time drove behavior that in many cases was inappropriate and inconsistent with our values. Because of our decentralized operating model, our corporate leadership took too long to understand the seriousness and scope of the problem, and as a result, the actions we took over the years to address it weren't adequate. April 13, 2017 -- Wells Fargo reports first-quarter earnings. The bank's bottom line was flat, at $5.5 billion, but a number of other critical metrics show signs of strain, including its efficiency ratio and return on assets. April 17, 2017 -- The bank launches the previously announced marketing campaign, Building Better Every Day. April 21, 2017 -- Wells Fargo expands its class action settlement, previously announced in March, to include any customers who were affected by sales practice issues as early as May 2002, pushing the covered range back by seven years. The updated settlement will total $142 million. Sloan says: The expansion of this agreement is another important step to make things right for our customers. On our journey to rebuild trust, we want to ensure our customers feel confident that we have heard their concerns about retail sales practices, which includes offering them numerous opportunities for remediation. We encourage any customer with concerns or questions about their accounts to contact us. April 25, 2017 -- Wells Fargo holds its annual meeting. Shareholders vent their ire at the bank by, among other things, reelecting the bank's board members with such underwhelming majorities that the results are seen by corporate governance experts as a vote of no confidence in all but three members of the board. July 6, 2017 -- The bank forms a new stakeholder-relations group to ""foster a more integrated approach to engaging with its key stakeholders."" Former director of investor relations Jim Rowe is promoted to lead the group, reporting to Chief Administrative Officer Hope Hardison, who says: As Wells Fargo continues to focus on rebuilding trust and building a better bank, it's more important than ever that our key stakeholder relationships and strategies are well integrated. During a decade in investor relations, Jim has become a trusted leader at Wells Fargo. His knowledge of our businesses and proven ability to partner across the company make him ideal to advance our efforts to create an aggregated stakeholder view. July 8, 2017 -- The class action settlement for retail sales practices receives preliminary court approval. Sloan says: We are pleased that the court found the settlement to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. This preliminary approval is a major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers. It further ensures each customer impacted by an improper retail sales practice has every opportunity for remediation. This is in addition to our direct efforts to review accounts and provide remediation. These efforts are fundamental to restoring trust with all our stakeholders and building a better Wells Fargo for the future. July 27, 2017 -- Wells Fargo discloses that a separate internal investigation uncovered 570,000 customers with car loans form the bank who may have been inappropriately charged for failing to maintain qualifying insurance on their cars. ""For approximately 20,000 customers, the additional costs of the insurance could have contributed to a default that resulted in the repossession of their vehicle,"" says the bank. Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo consumer lending, states: We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the CPI [collateral protection insurance] program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers, who expect and deserve better from us. Upon our discovery, we acted swiftly to discontinue the program and immediately develop a plan to make impacted customers whole. Aug. 4, 2017 -- Sloan issues a companywide message on the bank's ""rebuilding trust efforts,"" noting among other things that ""[b]ecause there is so much interest in the work we are doing to rebuild trust, we can expect more headlines as we fulfill our commitment to identify and fix problems and make things right for our customers."" Aug. 15, 2017 -- Wells Fargo announces that three members of its board, including chairman Stephen Sanger, will retire at the end of the year. Former Federal Reserve governor Elizabeth ""Betsy"" Duke was unanimously elected by the board to replace Sanger, who says: Betsy was the unanimous choice to lead the board as it continues its focus on strengthening oversight and rebuilding the trust of shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders. Her broad understanding of the financial system and markets combined with years of main street community banking experience make her the ideal chair to work with the rest of the board and Tim Sloan as Wells Fargo continues to move forward. Aug. 22, 2017 -- Sloan issues a companywide message ""to address team member questions and provide updates on the steps the company is taking to make things right for customers and build a better Wells Fargo."" Aug. 31, 2017 -- Wells Fargo reports the results of its expanded third-party review of its retail sales practices, increasing the number of potentially fake customer accounts up from 2.1 million to 3.5 million.

As of the latest available information, Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio contains 44 companies' common stocks and has a market value of roughly $178 billion. Of this, about $66.9 billion, or more than 37% of the portfolio, is made up of banking stocks, many of which we know were selected by CEO Warren Buffett himself. This begs the question -- why does Warren Buffett seem to love the banking business so much? As of the latest available information, there are eight different bank stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, with positions that range in size from $517 million to more than $25 billion. Company Stock Symbol Number of Shares Market Value as of 9/25/2017 American Express AXP 151,610,700 $13.4 billion Bank of America BAC 700,000,000 $17.3 billion Bank of New York Mellon BK 50,229,588 $2.6 billion Goldman Sachs GS 10,959,519 $2.5 billion M&T Bank MTB 5,382,040 $829 million Synchrony Financial SYF 17,463,000 $517 million U.S. Bancorp USB 85,063,167 $4.5 billion Wells Fargo WFC 467,987,270 $25.2 billion Data source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC Filings. Bank of America investment as per company press release. Some of Buffett's bank stocks have their own stories behind how they ended up in the portfolio. For example, Berkshire's massive Bank of America investment is the result of a savvy financial crisis-era investment that allowed Berkshire to purchase 700 million shares of the bank for less than one-third of their current market value. In other cases, Buffett simply loves to buy well-run businesses at fair prices. With that in mind, here's some color on how so many banks ended up in Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio. Image source: The Motley Fool. Simply put, banks have a lot of characteristics that Buffett is known to love. And thanks to government regulations, Berkshire Hathaway cannot simply acquire banks outright, so the company invests through bank stocks instead. For one thing, banking is a ""forever"" industry. People will always need safe places to put their money, and other companies will always need financial institutions to be able to conduct their own business. In short, Buffett likes picking the long-term winners in industries that will be around for centuries, and few industries are more durable than banking. In addition, banks receive cash from depositors for next to nothing and lend it out to creditworthy borrowers to make a profit. This is similar to the insurance business, another Buffett favorite, which provides low-cost capital through paid-in premiums, which the company can then invest at a profit. Another reason Buffett has accumulated so many bank stocks is because there have been plenty of opportunities to do so at a bargain, which Buffett has taken advantage of. I already mentioned the Bank of America investment, and the Goldman Sachs stake was also a product of the financial crisis. Another example is that Buffett initially purchased shares of American Express during a banking panic in the 1960s. Additionally, M&T Bank was purchased in the wake of the Savings and Loan Crisis in 1991. In Buffett's most recent letter to shareholders, he said, ""widespread fear is your friend as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases."" This has been especially true in the banking industry over the years. Not all of Buffett's bank investments have been bargains. Some were just Buffett doing what he does best -- finding the best companies in a durable industry. The two biggest examples of this in Berkshire's portfolio are Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, which are consistently among the most profitable and efficient big banks in America. Although, to be fair, Wells Fargo was purchased at a time when the bank's shares were trading at an incredibly low valuation. Take a look at the return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) of these two banks (the blue and yellow lines in the chart) compared to the rest of the five largest U.S. banks in recent years. This consistent performance is the key reason Buffett hasn't gotten rid of his Wells Fargo investment, even after the scandals plaguing the bank. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. First off, I never suggest you buy any stock simply because a billionaire owns it, even if that billionaire is Warren Buffett. Additionally, it's fair to say that at the time Buffett bought most of his bank stocks, they were trading at big discounts relative to their current valuations. Having said that, there could be some bargains to be found, here. For example, I recently wrote how Wells Fargo could be a great buy for investors who have the patience to wait out the fallout from its recent scandals. Recent addition Synchrony Financial could also be a bargain for long-term investors. However, it's important to do your own research before investing in these, or any other, bank stocks in your own portfolio. ","
      
    Why Warren Buffett Loves Bank Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Eric Volkman,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Analysts at investment banks cover a great many stocks, but some big names aren't as widely tracked as you might expect. Such is the case with Warren Buffett's investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B). It's hard to say why, but it's covered by only a handful of prognosticators. Newly added to those ranks is Sarah Dewitt of JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) J.P. Morgan unit. She recently initiated coverage with an ""overweight"" recommendation, at a price target of $210 for the company's B shares (they currently trade around $183). Let's take a look at the key points of her argument and see whether they hold water. In J.P. Morgan's initial research note on Berkshire Hathaway, Dewitt describes the company as ""a collection of best-in-class businesses with unmatched balance sheet strength."" That's broadly true. Focusing our gaze on Berkshire Hathaway's top three stock holdings by market value -- Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- shows that while all have their weaknesses (and aren't necessarily ""best-in-class""), they have plenty of advantages, too. High on Dewitt's list of pluses for Berkshire Hathaway is the earnings potential of the insurance and railroad businesses, two of the company's largest segments. Lead insurance asset GEICO has managed to take significant market share through aggressive marketing and competitive pricing during a time of rising premiums in its industry. And Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF, one of America's top rail operators, is leveraging this strong position by investing in rail network improvements. It's also expanding with new routes. Both developments sound like tasty recipes for growth to me. And they're highly significant, as insurance and rail combined were responsible for nearly 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's earnings last year. Another contributor to what is bound to be robust growth is Berkshire Hathaway's bulging war chest. Dewitt points out that the company has an eye-watering $66 billion in excess cash (i.e., the amount over the $20 billion it wants to maintain at all times). Image source: The Motley Fool. That cash is in good hands. Buffett and his team have proven they're never in a rush to plow recklessly into an acquisition. They always seem to find the right assets at the right moment to goose portfolio value. Witness the company's renewed plunge into Apple around New Year's, shortly after which the tech giant delivered Q1 earnings that broke records and sent the stock skyward. Dewitt didn't wear rose-colored glasses while examining Berkshire Hathaway; she's sober-minded and realistic about the risks it faces. Chief among these is the ""key man"" problem -- in other words, what happens when the now 87-year-old Buffett exits the scene. She's also concerned that profitability and book value ""have meaningful sensitivity"" to the broader American economy. Yet Dewitt believes, as I do, that the advantages of Berkshire Hathaway far outweigh the risks. Post-Buffett, his value investing approach will almost certainly stay in place at the company given how successful it's been. And that stock portfolio is a thing of beauty. You can probably find any number of funds that hold Apple, Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz, and other wide-moat companies. However, there are precious few that mix these blue chips in with other investments to produce the sustained outperformance that Berkshire Hathaway has delivered. Yes, it still leans heavily on Buffett's preferred sectors -- he has always loved financials, and he enjoys riding the rails -- but it's spread out enough to mitigate the impact of an economic shock plus the insurance losses sure to arise from the recent natural disasters. The company has been through market dives before and has come out stronger on the other end. Ultimately, J.P. Morgan's assessment of Berkshire Hathaway is pretty much on the money. I think it's a good note that supports an accurate recommendation on the stock, which in my mind is unquestionably a buy candidate for any investor. ","
      
    A Major Bank Rates Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway a Buy. Should You Pull the Trigger? -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Did you know that Warren Buffett earns thousands of dollars in dividends per minute? Or that lunch with the Oracle of Omaha is apparently worth millions? These are just a couple of interesting facts about Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) legendary CEO that you may not be aware of. When Warren Buffett originally bought shares in a struggling textile manufacturer named Berkshire Hathaway in 1962, he was simply trying to make a quick profit, not take over the company and grow it in to a conglomerate. Image source: The Motley Fool. Buffett became so infuriated that not only did he refuse to sell, but he bought enough Berkshire stock to take control of the company (and fire the manager who refused to honor the original agreement). Berkshire's shares are worth approximately $275,000 each as I write this. Surprisingly, Buffett has referred to his takeover of Berkshire as the worst investment he's ever made. The vast majority (about 99%) of Buffett's wealth is in Berkshire Hathaway stock, and generally when you read about ""Buffett stocks,"" you're actually reading about stocks Buffett or his team have purchased for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. However, Buffett does maintain a personal stock portfolio that's worth a significant amount of money. He rarely discusses investments in his personal portfolio, but we do know a few. Major Berkshire holding Wells Fargo is also one of Buffett's personal holdings, as is real estate investment trust Seritage Growth Properties. Buffett has said that the stocks he holds are similar in nature to what he would buy for Berkshire, but he holds some that wouldn't make the cut based on size -- Seritage is a good example of this. Warren Buffett has donated more than $30 billion to charitable organizations over the years, and is planning to give away substantially all of his remaining wealth. As part of his philanthropy, Buffett auctions off a lunch with himself every year to benefit anti-poverty charity GLIDE. The auctions, which were an idea of Buffett's late wife Susie in 2000, give the winner a lunch for themselves and up to seven friends with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in New York City. The bids regularly extend into the millions. The 2017 winner paid $2.68 million for the lunch, and 2016's winner paid $3.4 million. In all, the auctions have generated over $26 million for the foundation. Much of this amount came from Berkshire's largest stock holdings, including $148 million from Coca-Cola, $182 million from Wells Fargo, and more than $195 million from Kraft Heinz. Buffett loves dividend stocks, especially those that consistently raise their payouts, as they generate a reliable stream of cash that Berkshire can put to work in any way management sees fit. You might be surprised to learn that Berkshire regularly underperforms the markets in years when the stock market is soaring. For example, when the S&P 500 jumped by 29% in 2003, Berkshire's stock rose by less than 16%. When the S&P rebounded nearly 27% from the financial crisis in 2009, Berkshire gained less than 3%. Buffett openly acknowledges that Berkshire will often fail to beat the market during its best years. However, Berkshire's long-term success is due to beating the market when times are tough. In investing, a smart defensive strategy can generate far superior gains to an aggressive one, and Berkshire's track record is proof of this. In fact, while the S&P 500 generated total returns of 12,717% from 1964 through 2016, Berkshire returned a staggering 1,972,595%, despite underperforming the market several years along the way.

If you want to understand Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK), or any bank for that matter, you should look at it from different angles, one of which is the quality of leadership. Image source: Getty Images. Leadership is hard to quantify because it's subjective, but there are nevertheless metrics that measure it. My favorite is the CEO approval score on Glassdoor.com, a website where current and former employees review companies and their management. The instinct in Bank of the Ozarks' case is to assume that its chairman and CEO, George Gleason, must have sky-high scores. How could he not given the bank's incredible performance over the past 20 years? *Includes banks on the KBW large and regional banking indexes that have generated a positive return since 1997. Data source: S&P's Capital IQ. As you can see, no other bank comes close to Bank of the Ozarks in terms of total shareholder return. Since going public in 1997, the biggest bank in Arkansas has returned a total of more than 5,000%. Compared to other banks, it's like a giraffe among Shetland ponies. Yet, Gleason's approval rating is lower than any major bank CEO that I've seen. Only 65% of employees who have submitted reviews on Glassdoor approve of the job he's doing. The most popular bank CEOs -- those like U.S. Bancorp's Richard Davis, Capital One's Richard Fairbank, and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon -- get approval scores above 90%. Even CEOs that don't do as well -- those of smaller regional banks such as BB&T's Kelly King, PNC Financial's William Demchak, and SunTrust Banks' William Rogers -- come in comfortably above 70%. Bank CEO Employee Approval Score Capital One Richard Fairbank 93% U.S. Bancorp Richard Davis* 92% JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon 91% Citigroup Michael Corbat 88% BB&T Kelly King 88% Wells Fargo Timothy Sloan 82% Bank of America Brian Moynihan 80% PNC Financial William Demchak 78% SunTrust Banks William Rogers 76% Fifth Third Bancorp Greg Carmichael 74% Bank of the Ozarks George Gleason 65% *Davis retired earlier this year as CEO, but remains chairman of U.S. Bancorp. Data source: Glassdoor.com. Another thing that caught my eye on Glassdoor's page for Bank of the Ozarks is the trend in Gleason's approval rating over time. At one point last year, Gleason's rating dipped below 20%. It stayed around there for months before heading higher this year. Indeed, the more you dig in, the worse Bank of the Ozarks looks when it comes to leadership. Only a third of reviewers would recommend the bank as an employer to a friend, while just 39% of them perceive the bank's business outlook to be positive. Of the five ratings categories that Glassdoor covers -- culture and values, work/life balance, senior management, compensation and benefits, and career opportunities -- Bank of the Ozarks gets the lowest score for senior management, a mere 2.3 out of 5.0. Image source: Glassdoor.com. How should investors and analysts square this with the bank's stock performance and the legendary stature of Gleason? I have no idea, but I think there's more to this story than meets the eye. ","

 ,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Supported by Breakingviews By Gina Chon A botched investigation into a hack at the Securities and Exchange Commission is a warning for other regulatory agencies. The agency’s chairman, Walter J. Clayton, told senators on Tuesday that he did not know the exact timing of a breach from last year and that his predecessor may not have been notified. That is troubling given the sensitive market data kept there. During a Senate hearing this week, Mr. Clayton shed little new light on the breach into the S.E.C.’s corporate-disclosure filing system, which the agency disclosed only last week. Mr. Clayton said he only learned about it in August, a few months after he joined the agency. He also said he did not have any reason to believe that his predecessor, Mary Jo White, had been notified. Agency bosses don’t have to be told about every hack, but the breach of the S.E.C.’s Edgar filing system, which is used by public companies and relied upon by investors, should have been reported promptly to the top. Senators asked whether the hack raises concerns about other data housed at the S.E.C., including the Consolidated Audit Trail scheduled to go live later this year. That will contain a record of orders for most equity and listed option trades, and nonpublic information about the customers behind them. Even before the S.E.C. hack was revealed, stock exchanges and traders were worried about the potential for cyberattacks targeting that data. At the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, investment firms have been worried about an automated trading plan that would give the agency access to trading-firm source codes without a subpoena. The agency is revising the rule after backlash from the industry, but it will probably still push for a database of trading records. Several other regulators also house market-moving information, including enforcement actions. Deal reviews are conducted by the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. And the Food and Drug Administration’s decisions on whether to approve new medications are closely watched by investors. Agencies are also hampered by insufficient resources. Their purse strings are controlled by Congress, which routinely provides less funding than the S.E.C., C.F.T.C. and other agencies request. Investor worry over their defenses is justified.

Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, was more focused during the hearing on Clayton’s call for more IPOs, but after the hearing she issued a statement about Equifax and Smith. “I’ve called for Equifax executives to be held accountable for their role in failing to stop this data breach and hiding it from the public for forty days,” said Warren. “It’s not real accountability if the CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay and without publicly answering questions.” Smith, who the board said would retire as of Tuesday, was expected to appear before the House Energy Committee and Senate Banking Committee next week.

Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and the ranking member on the banking committee, asked why, given the situation at Equifax, the SEC still had not finalized the 2010 Dodd-Frank law’s clawback policy. Clayton said that the Dodd-Frank clawback rule was “on his list” and that he intended to “finish the mandate,” but he welcomed the senators’ input on the agency’s remaining Dodd-Frank rulemaking priorities. The SEC’s regulatory agenda announced July 20 made no mention of another Dodd-Frank rule never finalized, Section 956, which prohibits incentive-based compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. However, despite the senators’ outrage and call for SEC action on clawbacks, neither one of the post-crisis policies — the Dodd-Frank clawback rule or the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley clawback rule — is applicable to the Equifax situation. Read: SEC’s clawback proposal leaves a big loophole That’s because the broader Dodd-Frank policy, not yet finalized by the SEC, and the Sarbanes-Oxley clawback law that focuses only on CEOs and CFOs, both require a material restatement of prior financial results to trigger enforcement. So do most company policies, such as the one at Equifax or the one at Wells Fargo

                                   . Equifax’s policy is even more forgiving than Wells Fargo’s, exempting executives from clawbacks unless the misstatement of financial results is the result of fraud. That's similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley policy that requires misconduct by someone. The Equifax policy, however, does leave open the possibility that if an executive engages “in certain other activities detrimental to the Company” he or she may be subject to financial consequences such cancellation of equity grants. But just like the Sarbanes-Oxley clawback policy, where the SEC has a lot of latitude in enforcement if companies fail to do so, Equifax’s clawback policy leaves a lot of the interpretation of these terms up to the board. “More and more companies are adopting fairly comprehensive clawback policies as contained in Dodd-Frank, but very few are actually invoking the policy to clawback compensation,” said Divesh Sharma, an accounting professor at Kennesaw State University’s Coles College of Business, whose research focuses on corporate clawback policies. “Companies are simply checking the compliance box.” See also:  Rarely enforced SEC rules may give green light to earnings manipulation “The terms ‘materiality’ and ‘misconduct’ are quite subjective,” said Sharma “In allowing these executives to retire, the board is signaling, at this point, they do not believe any of them committed any misconduct or failed as a manager,” he said. In the case of Wells Fargo’s CEO John Stumpf and senior executive Carrie Tolstedt, the reported eventual clawback numbers looked big but were still only a fraction of their overall compensation. In addition, the majority of the clawed-back amounts consisted of unvested stock-option awards, rather than cash already paid out. Wells Fargo clawed back approximately $28 million paid as incentive compensation in March 2016 under a 2013 equity grant, in addition to the $41 million in unvested equity awards that Stumpf agreed to forfeit shortly before his October 2016 resignation, according to a blog post by Kevin LaCroix, author of the blog D&O Diary. The $28 million already paid will be deducted from his retirement plan payouts, according to the bank’s statements at the time. Based on the findings of its board investigation, the bank was also able to support a change in view of Tolstedt’s retirement with honors, determining that “cause existed” for Tolstedt’s September 2016 termination. That permitted the board to request forfeiture of $47.3 million outstanding stock-option awards, in addition to $19 million of unvested equity awards the board caused to be forfeited at the time of her termination. The total value of Tolstedt’s compensation forfeitures was approximately $66.3 million, and as with Stumpf, the majority was compensation that had not yet been turned into cash. See also: Wells Fargo CEO’s $41 million ranks only third among executive-pay clawbacks, forfeitures Wells Fargo did more than most companies because it is a bank subject to under stricter regulatory requirements after the financial crisis. In Wells Fargo’s case, that stricter policy also allowed it justify a clawback based on reputational damage to the bank and poor risk management. LaCroix also cited an article in 2016 by Columbia Law Professor John Coffee on the CLS Blue Sky Blog, in which he commented, “Wells Fargo’s far broader clawback policy was the result of pressure from New York City’s pension funds in 2013, which had threatened to file a shareholder proxy resolution unless Wells Fargo adopted a policy broadly authorizing clawbacks beyond the context of restatements.” ","Senators press SEC chairman on Dodd-Frank clawbacks, but Equifax execs ineligible - MarketWatch"

The company wants to be able to “combine great story telling and the great technological aspects,” Chief Executive Reed Hastings told MarketWatch in 2015. “That’s where we want to be.” Netflix’s use of convolutional neural network and proprietary algorithms, which is essentially deep machine learning used to analyze visual imagery, is a prime example of its approach.

Don’t miss: More TV viewers are cutting the cord, but the savings aren’t what they were Brian David Johnson, futurist in residence at Arizona State University, said people have been able to analyze video on a frame-by-frame and pixel-by-pixel basis for years — he even wrote a book about it in 2009. But there were roadblocks in content licensing that made innovation tough, until now. “Netflix has been working solidly to come up with algorithms to match consumers with their content — also Netflix has a lot more power than they did back in 2009 to get people to allow them to search their video,” Johnson said in an email to MarketWatch. “The advances in [artificial intelligence] and neural networks means that they can now make sense of that data. “Essentially, they are looking for patterns in the data that equal the right output they are looking for. The scope and scale of AI allows them to do this in an unprecedented fashion.” Check out: Netflix wants exclusive rights to films, TV series and the talent creating them Also see: Roku IPO: 5 things to know about the streaming device company In addition to using the collected data for platform improvements such as adding auto play, a “skip intro” button, customized trailers and changing its stars rating system to thumbs up or down, Ryvicker and Sena said Netflix could use the capability for decision-making concerning content supply. Ryvicker and Sena wrote that through advancements in convolutional neural networks, Netflix can detect and analyze underlying scene elements that drive viewer engagement. That data-driven approach, they wrote, can inform what content Netflix licenses and provide insight into production.

According to FactSet, fully one-seventh of the nearly $4.2 trillion in global ETF assets are in funds tracking the benchmark U.S. equity index. The result of that is that passive funds now own an average of 17% of each component of the S&P 500, per Goldman’s data (the range is as little as 10%, and as much as 35%), whereas passive ownership was “a rounding error” a decade ago. Vanguard alone has at least a 5% stake in 468 components of the S&P 500, according to a June report in The Wall Street Journal, up from just three components in 2005. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Also: Vanguard calls for more diverse corporate boards, better climate-change disclosures As buying and selling index-funds essentially means buying and selling every component of the underlying index, “less trading is stemming from views on company fundamentals,” Goldman wrote. “Passive holders trade stock for different reasons than active managers, and at different frequencies. Passive’s decision to buy or sell stocks is often directed by broader fund flows and larger rebalances and not typically company specific fundamentals.” The investment bank calculated that for the average S&P 500 company, the share of its stock that might trade on fundamental views has dropped to 77% compared with 95% a decade ago. Those figures are based on a measure Goldman calls “passive-adjusted float,” or the number of shares outstanding minus both restricted holdings and passive holdings. “The impact on portfolio construction, alpha and trading are not fully appreciated by investors,” Fogertey wrote. Alpha refers to outperformance over a benchmark. Earlier this month, UBS analysts wrote that worries over the impact passive investing and ETFs would have on price discovery and liquidity were “misguided.” The firm noted that while passive funds comprise 46% of total ETF and mutual fund assets, they only accounted for 8% of the overall global equity market value. “If the investment landscape were limited to ETFs and mutual funds, it may warrant the current level of attention,” they wrote. “However, the investment landscape is far more expansive than just ETFs and mutual funds. There are hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and equities managed by other institutional investors and households that should factor into the analysis.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Related: Don’t blame ETFs or passive investors for high valuations Nonetheless, the impact of this factor depends on the specific security, as “passive ownership varies in both size and scope even within sectors.” Roughly 30% of the float of energy firm ONEOK
