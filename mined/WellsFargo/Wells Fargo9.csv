,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is paying a price in the U.S. municipal bond market for the bogus customer accounts scandal that hit the bank last year and led to bans by some cities and states, an analysis of Thomson Reuters data shows. So far in 2017, Wells Fargo is in sixth place among senior underwriters of municipal bonds with 85 deals totaling nearly $8.13 billion, according to the data. During the same period in 2016, the bank ranked fourth with 134 issues totaling $12.74 billion. In September, Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $190 million settlement over its staff opening as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge. California, along with Massachusetts, Chicago, and Ohio,  suspended Wells Fargo last fall from pricing their negotiated bond sales due to the scandal. Municipal issuers typically sell their debt either by hiring underwriters to price their bonds or by setting a date and time for underwriters to bid on the debt, and then choose the lowest bid. Wells Fargo’s ranking for negotiated deals slid to eighth place between Jan. 1 and May 17 from fourth place during the same period in 2016. The bank was the bookrunning underwriter on 45 deals totaling $5.2 billion so far this year, compared to 79 deals totaling $9.25 billion in 2016. The bank’s ranking drop for winning competitively bid issues was not as steep, falling to fifth place with 40 deals totaling $2.92 billion so far this year from third place with 55 deals totaling $3.48 billion last year. “Public Finance is an important business for Wells Fargo with many opportunities for growth,” Philip Smith, head of government and institutional banking at Wells Fargo, said in a statement to Reuters. “We are continuing to invest in the business. Despite current political challenges affecting league tables, our strong relationships and diversified municipal business model have us growing (revenue) 15 percent year over year,” Smith said. California sanctioned Wells Fargo over the accounts scandal last year. In April, however, it beat out eight other banks to win a $635 million competitive deal in the state with a 2.811 percent interest rate, according to the California Treasurer’s Office. “We had no choice,” said California State Treasurer spokesman Marc Lifsher. California law requires the state to award competitive sales of general obligation bonds to the bidder with the lowest interest cost, Lifsher said. He added that the state plans to review the sanctions this fall, but as of Monday, the bank was “still in our dog house.” “We’re continuing to pressure them to show us that they’ve cleaned up their act,” Lifsher said.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo Advisors will launch a new share class of mutual funds next month as part of its plan to comply with the new U.S. Labor Department regulation that seeks to put the interests of retirement clients first, the bank confirmed Wednesday. Starting June 9, the same day the DOL’s fiduciary rule takes effect, advisers who want to buy mutual fund class shares for retired clients will be required to buy T shares, which pay advisers a 2.5 percent commission upfront and a 0.25 percent going forward. These shares differ from other mutual fund shares, such as A or C shares, because the flat commission and ongoing fee they charge eliminates any possible conflict of interest that could encourage an adviser to recommend one type of mutual fund over another for clients. The DOL’s fiduciary rule requires brokers to put client’s interests first by avoiding investment products that could present a conflict of interest. Wells Fargo Advisors spokeswoman Emily Acquisto said the firm is prepared for the June 9 start date of the new rule, and they continue to asses evolve the firm’s financial planning strategy and tools “to ensure our clients have the best outcomes under the rule.” ","

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial and technology companies led by Bank of America Corp, SBI Holdings Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Intel Corp and Temasek Holdings have invested $107 million in R3 CEV, a startup which runs a big bank consortium seeking to develop blockchain technology, it said on Tuesday. Over 40 institutions from more than 15 countries participated in the first two tranches of the New York company’s fundraising round, making it one of the largest investments in a blockchain company to date, R3 said in a statement. The third and final tranche will open later this year. Other major investors and companies leading the deal include ING Groep NV, Banco Bradesco SA, Itaú Unibanco SA, Natixis SA, Barclays Plc, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co, R3 said. R3 launched in September 2015 with the backing of nine of the world’s largest investment banks seeking to make their operations more efficient with new technology, and its membership has rapidly grown to about 80 financial institutions. It aims to raise $150 million from members and strategic investors, and give them a 60 percent stake. An R3 spokesman declined to disclose the company’s valuation. Blockchain, best known as the system underpinning digital currency bitcoin, is a public online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet. Financial firms hope that the nascent technology can reduce the cost and complexity of burdensome processes such as international payments and securities settlement. The completion of the first two tranches follows the departure of several large banks from R3 over the past few months, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc Banco Santander SA and Morgan Stanley The banks have internal blockchain projects or investments in other similar startups. State Street Corp has also left the group, the R3 spokesman added. “This year we will have pilot projects and early production phase products in the market,” R3 Chief Executive David Rutter said in an interview. But “we are a couple of years away until we see massively impactful products,” he added. Skeptics have warned that it might take many years for the financial industry to reap significant benefits from blockchain. “Distributed ledger technology is well suited for some uses case but it will not be the answer for everything,” Kaushalya Somasundaram, head of fintech partnerships and strategy at HSBC, said in an interview.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a more than six-month low against a basket of currencies on Monday, extending its losses from last week, as an uncertain U.S. political climate and a buoyant euro weighed on the greenback. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.14 percent to 97.005. It fell to a low of 96.797, its lowest since Nov. 9, earlier in the session. “I think it is a continuation of the move we have seen since mid-April,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. “The dollar’s broad declines are driven by the increasingly mixed tone to U.S. economic data, which has led to investors questioning the extent to which the Fed will be raising rates this year. The political climate is also acting as a key headwind for the dollar.” The dollar fell more than 2 percent last week, logging its worst performance in more than a year, amid growing concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing an investigation into possible links between the president’s team and Russia. Political turmoil in Washington has also raised worries that there could be delays in Trump’s efforts to implement his economic stimulus plans. “Generally speaking, we still have a constructive view on the dollar but in light of some of the recent weakness we certainly have to contemplate how lasting could this impact from fiscal policy, or lack thereof, be for the currency markets,” said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. The greenback was also pressured by a rallying euro, which hit a more than six-month high against the dollar on Monday after Germany’s Angela Merkel prefaced a summit of G7 leaders later this week by saying a “too weak” currency was behind her country’s massive trade surplus. Speaking to students at a secondary school in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany’s huge export earnings were propelled by two factors over which the government had no influence, namely the euro’s exchange rate and oil prices. The euro was up 0.25 percent against the dollar at $1.1232 after hitting a high of $1.1263, earlier in the session. Meanwhile, sterling slipped broadly after polls showed a narrowing lead for Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May over her opposition ahead of elections next month. ","

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"BlackRock, which oversees $5.4 trillion in assets and is the world’s largest asset manager, is moving into 847,000 square feet (78,690 sq meters) of a development that will be part of a neighborhood rising over rail yards and tracks in a once-forlorn corner of New York City. The company said in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will pay $50.8 million per year in the first five years, and an increasing amount after that, for a total $1.25 billion over 20 years. That works out to about $60 per square foot to start, and nearly $74 over the full term of the lease for the offices at 50 Hudson Yards. The company also will be responsible for its operating expenses at the building and a share of property taxes, which will add about $30 a square foot to the lease, a source with knowledge of the transaction said. The lease is one of the largest ever in Manhattan in terms of size and value of the overall contract. The average asking rent in April for midtown Manhattan office space was $84.09 a square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Along Park Avenue, near where BlackRock is currently located, asking rents averaged $91.13 a square foot. High-end “trophy” properties, such as 50 Hudson Yards, often rent at higher rates than average. The developing district has also attracted Coach Inc COH.N, Wells Fargo Securities and the National Hockey League. The success of the Hudson Yards district has already moved the center of Manhattan’s office complex from BlackRock’s current location, in the coveted Plaza District in midtown, south and westward to the new development. The BlackRock lease was agreed on Wednesday and starts May 1, 2023. For the time being, BlackRock has offices in two buildings on 52nd Street off Park Avenue, along with other locations. Its new building, which is expected to be finished in 2022 and be the city’s fourth-largest office tower, will include 15 floors of a 58-story tower developed by Related Cos LP and Oxford Properties Group Inc. It also includes a 400-seat auditorium. BlackRock received a $25 million tax credit from New York state as part of the move on the condition the company creates 700 new jobs and retains staffing in the city of about 2,700 for a decade.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elizabeth Warren’s latest book reads like a marker for a 2020 White House campaign. In “This Fight is Our Fight,” the U.S. senator from Massachusetts blasts familiar targets like lobbyists and Wall Street, plus a new foe: President Donald Trump. Tales of struggling Americans are engagingly woven into the outrage. Still, her rote views limit her appeal. In just four years in the Senate, Warren’s national profile has risen quickly. Her impassioned speeches criticizing bankers made her a darling among liberals. That vitriol is on stark display in the book. She also lists the mistakes the Democratic Party made in 2016. However, her solutions are more like empty campaign slogans: demand democracy, build opportunity and fight. Towards the end of the book, Warren reveals she contemplated running for the presidency in 2016 and discussed it with her husband - a Harvard professor, as she used to be. He warned that a presidential campaign would be “a lot worse” than her 2012 Senate race, when she was ridiculed for claiming Native American heritage. “Talking with Bruce and asking the question out loud had settled it,” Warren writes. “I wanted to stay buckled down and keep doing my job.” Trump’s improbable victory and chaotic first months have added urgency to the search for a candidate capable of challenging him in 2020. The TV tycoon mused in April that Warren might be his next rival. She has what Hillary Clinton lacked: the ability to rally the Democratic base. As she writes, “I now start every day by reminding myself that Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by nearly three million votes.” But Warren’s strengths may prove a drawback when it comes to appealing to voters across America. It’s doubtful that she would have Clinton’s ability to win over moderate Republicans. She would also risk turning off so-called “Goldman Sachs Democrats” – traditional party supporters skeptical of her anti-finance and pro-regulation stance. In a February poll conducted by Morning Consult for Politico, voters favored a generic Democratic candidate over Trump by 8 percentage points, but Warren trailed the president by 6 points. The main lesson Warren appears to have learned from the 2016 campaign is to double down on her anger. She doesn’t present any new or unexpected ideas. Indeed, the most surprising disclosure comes on the book’s first page, where Warren reveals that she and her husband spent election night watching “Ballers,” an HBO comedy starring Dwayne Johnson, the actor and former wrestler known as The Rock. The rest of “This Fight is Our Fight” is classic Warren, attacking corporations and the rich who fight for tax loopholes and less regulation at the expense of average Americans. She illustrates those struggles with tales of everyday hardship. There is Gina, a North Carolina resident who got a business degree and worked as a sales representative while her husband was a roofer. Later on, Gina is working at Wal-Mart while her husband’s assignments are spotty. Their income is cut in half. “What happened?...Nothing. No crisis. No accident. No tale of woe,” Warren writes. “Just the grinding wear and tear of an economy that doesn’t work any more for families like Gina’s.”    Warren rightly points out that growing GDP and rising stocks don’t necessarily mean prosperity for ordinary citizens. But to blame Gina’s woes on a bubbly equity market seems disingenuous. It’s the kind of zero-sum rationale that Trump has embraced. If China and other countries are doing better, it must be at the expense of the United States. Warren criticizes wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers, but not Democrat-supporting hedge fund billionaires such as Tom Steyer and George Soros. She also reiterates her ill-advised scorn for former Lazard banker Antonio Weiss, who withdrew from a Senate-confirmed job in President Barack Obama’s administration after Warren opposed him. Though the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington has its drawbacks, financial experience is helpful in some government positions. Democrats have a chance to recapture the White House in 2020. The popular backlash to the planned repeal of Obama’s healthcare reforms could cost Trump votes in many states that backed him last November. Probes into his campaign’s links with Russia could delay a promised tax overhaul and infrastructure spending. The president’s erratic and questionable actions, like his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, seem certain to further undermine his approval ratings. During the 2016 campaign, Warren proved she could get under Trump’s skin with tweet storms that matched the president’s own. Her fans love her persistence and tough talk. But to take the White House as a Democrat she will have to win over a broader base of supporters. The broken-record rhetoric in this book will do little to entice them.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s multiple sclerosis drug met the main goal of reducing annualized relapse rate, compared with Biogen Inc’s Avonex, in a second late-stage trial, but failed to outperform Avonex in slowing disability progression rate. Celgene’s shares fell as much as 2.8 percent to $113.63 in morning trading on Monday as investors focused on the disability data. The drug, ozanimod, was shown to be superior to Avonex in reducing annualized relapse rate in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) in another late-stage study in February. However, Celgene said on Monday a combined analysis of the two trials did not show ozanimod had a statistically significant benefit over Avonex in slowing disability progression. The company highlighted that overall the rate of disability progression was very low in the trials. Analysts did not read much into the data on disability progression, with Barclays calling it “only wrinkle” in the otherwise successful trials. With prior results suggesting a best-in-class profile, with Gilenya-like efficacy and absent heart rate effects, ozanimod has the advantage of a shorter half-life, a favorable feature highlighted by experts in terms of safety, Wells Fargo’s Jim Birchenough said. Gilenya is a rival MS drug from Novartis AG. Ozanimod’s adoption will depend on whether Gilenya goes generic in 2019, which may coincide with ozanimod’s launch, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said. Ozanimod is expected to generate about $2 billion by 2022, according to Clarivate Analytics. Celgene, which gained access to ozanimod through its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos Inc in 2015, said it would file a U.S. marketing application for the drug by the end of the year. RMS is characterized by clearly defined attacks of worsening neurologic function. These attacks — often called relapses, flare-ups or exacerbations — are followed by partial or complete recovery periods during which symptoms improve partially or completely. Multiple sclerosis affects about 400,000 people in the United States and about 2.5 million people worldwide. About 85 percent are diagnosed with RMS, according to the company. The most popular MS treatment in the United States currently is Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd’s Copaxone, which generated sales of about $4.22 billion in 2016. Celgene is also testing Ozanimod in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Up to Friday’s close, Celgene had gained 17 percent in the past 12 months, outperforming the 9.6 percent rise in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index during the same period. ","

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"(Reuters) - Private equity firm TPG Global LLC said on Monday it would buy Wave Broadband for $2.37 billion in a deal that creates the sixth largest U.S. cable operator at a time when demand for high-speed internet service is growing rapidly. The deal combines privately-held Wave with RCN Telecom Services LLC and Grande Communications Networks, the broadband providers TPG bought earlier this year. TPG Capital Partner David Trujillo said in an interview that the deal fits in with his firm’s “picks and shovel” strategy of focusing on rising internet use. TPG has investments in music provider Spotify, car sharing services Uber Technologies and others. “Whether it’s the number of devices, or increasing content consumption or the connected home, what it all comes back to is fast reliable broadband,” Trujillo said. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of the year. Headquartered in Kirkland, Washington, Wave has residential and commercial customers in the Sacramento and San Francisco markets as well as in Seattle and Portland, Oregon. Oak Hill Capital, GI Partners and Wave’s management, including Chief Executive Steve Weed, acquired the company in 2012 from Sandler Capital Management. The value of that deal was $950 million, according to Moody’s. Weed will become a director of RCN when the deal closes. TPG was advised by Credit Suisse and PJT Partners while its legal adviser was Cleary Gottlieb. Wave was advised by UBS and Wells Fargo. Reuters was first to report that TPG was nearing a deal to buy Wave for more than $2 billion. ","

Home sales figures in the first quarter were the best since the same quarter of 2007, per the National Association of Realtors, as reported by the Journal. Census Bureau data shows the percentage of first-time home buyers increasing towards its long-term average, and online real estate listings company Trulia finds that new households are more often seeking to buy homes than rent them, per the Journal.  These trends are also positives for building supply and home improvement retailers such as The Home Depot Inc. (HD) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW).

These companies have P/E ratios of 23 and 24, respectively. Both Home Depot and Lowe's have been called Amazon-proof, Barron's says, since they offer bulky products that are hard to ship, and professional contractors prefer to shop in store. Nevertheless, Home Depot's online sales were up 23% in the first quarter, Barron's notes. (For more, see also: Top U.S. Housing Market Indicators.)

Economists had been forecasting a rate of 1.26 million units, Reuters notes. Other concerns going forward are the impact of rising interest rates on the affordability of mortgages, the possibility of tax cuts being threatened if President Trump is beset by new crises, and worries that GDP growth (and thus growth in disposable personal income) will remain in the doldrums.

Stephanie Landsman,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A major Wall Street firm is predicting there will be fewer runs into record-breaking territory for stocks this year. In fact, investors may want to brace themselves for an S&P 500 which actually ends the year in the red. ""We're going to see a bit of a fade here,"" Scott Wren, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global equity strategist, said on Tuesday's ""Trading Nation."" He attributes mounting fears over wage pressures and valuations as risks to the rally. The firm's year-end price target hasn't nudged on the S&P since the 2017 kickoff. Wells Fargo has been sticking by its year-end price target of 2,230 to 2,330  — about 3 to 7 percent lower than where the index is trading now. ""We thought we'd spend some time above that, and we thought we'd see the highs around the middle of the year,"" he said. ""We've been above that level."" It comes as the major indices begin the week up about one percent. For the first time since February, the Dow and S&P posted their fourth positive sessions in a row on Tuesday. The Nasdaq is now up seven out of the last eight sessions. But the latest strength isn't affecting Wren's forecast. ""I feel pretty comfortable that we're going to end in that range,"" he said. ""The [economic] expansion is long in the tooth."" Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. Wren said his latest forecast is based on fundamentals and doesn't factor in any of President Donald Trump's plans to pass pro-business legislation. ""Certainly, infrastructure spending, tax cuts and less regulation — that's all pro-growth. But are we going to get some of that implemented in enough magnitude to move the needle on the economy anytime soon? We didn't think it was going to happen quick,"" he said. But there are a few spots that could get you through a sideways market and deliver some profits, according to Wren. Right now, he's overweight consumer discretionary, industrials, financials and health care. ""We want our clients to be in this market,"" said Wren, who also notes that Europe could bring some positive 'surprises' for investors. He may appear to be more negative than his peers, but his 2017 call on the market is more encouraging than his longer-term forecast. Wren argues there's a better than 50-50 chance that the United States will see a recession in the next four years, and it has nothing to do with who won the November presidential election. ""Certainly, if Donald Trump would be re-elected, to not have a recession over the next eight years would be almost impossible,"" Wren said. ""You've got to play for lower returns.""

Rebecca Ungarino,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"The Nasdaq composite is on pace for a record-setting month. The technology-dominated index has closed positive in 15 of the 18 trading days so far this month; if that pace continues, May would mark the Nasdaq's winningest month since September 1996, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The index, which hit a new all-time high in early Thursday trading, has advanced more than 2 percent so far this month and more than 15 percent so far this year. By contrast, in September 1996, the Nasdaq rose by 7.5 percent. More from CNBC: The top is in for stocks, but here's how you can still make money: Wells Fargo strategist Hot Stock that's tripled in the past year has analysts throwing up their hands These signals will tell you that stocks are heading higher The recent collection of positive days is flashing a sort of contrarian signal, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. While he would not bet against the index, he suggested trimming one's holdings at these levels. ""Typically, when you have that kind of concentration of positive days, mean reversion is about to kick in. So I think it could be a situation where 'sell in May' could be the best prescription for the Nasdaq,"" he said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""Come out at of top and come back in September, November, when things re-rally,"" Schlosberg said. Of course, 1996 was the year then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan wondered about ""irrational exuberance"" and whether stocks were reaching unsustainable heights. That was before the tech bubble got blown to a staggering level, which was of course followed by a massive crash. This period looks significantly different, according to the strategist. ""There's no doubt that, fundamentally, all the tech companies have certainly come to the forefront. They are now the dominant companies in American industry — but that story has been really well told. I think profit-taking is due here, and I would be very cautious at trying to get long here at these levels,"" Schlossberg said. Indeed, the S&P 500 information technology sector is the index's best-performing; tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have contributed most of the market's gains this year. On a technical basis, the index appears quite strong, said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray. ""The trend, by all definition, is our friend at this point in time. And we don't have any indication of a trend change happening here,"" he said Wednesday on ""Trading Nation."" ""I'm not going to fight the earnings trend of the market. We are finally seeing a lot of these names inside of the tech sector doing well."" Some of the tech stocks also remain supported from a fundamental perspective, Johnson added.

Jeff Daniels,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"Wynn Resorts stock jumped 3 percent on Monday as a report showed it is gaining market share against rivals in Macau as gaming revenue trends improve in the gambling mecca. Brokerage Sanford C. Bernstein said its channel checks show Macau's casino gross gaming revenue (GGR) last week was ahead of its estimates and also that Wynn and MGM Resorts have gained share on a month-over-month basis from other big casino operators, including Las Vegas Sands. Earlier this month, China's powerful chairman of the National People's Congress, Zhang Dejiang, visited Macau, and his visit was seen as more supportive of the region's economy. He also urged local leaders to diversify the economy behind gambling. ""Revenue has increased post Zhang's visit,"" Bernstein said. ""With dragon boat festival holidays coming, GGR may continue to show strength into the month end."" In trading, Wynn shares are up just over 3 percent and MGM is up more than 1.6 percent. Also, Las Vegas Sands is up nearly 2 percent. Previously, the central government in Beijing caused headaches for Macau's casino operators by launching a crackdown on the so-called junket business. The junkets or specialists bring in the high-value Chinese rollers to the Macau casinos. Despite the crackdown, organized crime remains a problem. Earlier this month, it was reported by the local Macau paper that police arrested 11 people from the mainland for ties to a loan-sharking gang, which had offered casino customers loans. Morgan Stanley said in a note Monday that large institutional investors have increased their allocation of U.S. gaming stocks in the first quarter compared with the final quarter of 2016, pointing out that Wynn and Las Vegas Sands were favorites due in part to ""greater optimism on Macau."" Even so, Morgan Stanley said, ""Wynn's institutional ownership remains relatively low vs. historical levels."" Wynn's stock is already up more than 44 percent this year, making it the top performer among the U.S.-based casino giants. May is expected to mark the fourth month in a row of double-digit percentage growth in Macau's gaming revenue. According to Consensus Metrix, analysts' estimates for Macau GGR growth in May are trending around 15 percent. Bernstein now forecasts Macau's May monthly GGR will increase between 14 and 16 percent compared with a year ago, or ""slightly higher than our expectation of 12-14 percent."" Wells Fargo is even more bullish on the Macau GGR growth for May, predicting around 14 to 18 percent growth, according to a note published Friday. In April, Macau's gaming revenue rose 16.3 percent, ahead of analysts' consensus for 15 percent growth. The big U.S. casino companies have been spending billions of dollars in the past year expanding operations in Macau, a former Portuguese enclave and the only area in China where casinos are legal. In August, Wynn opened its $4.1 billion Wynn Palace casino resort on the Cotai Strip of Macau. Las Vegas Sands opened its $3 billion Parisian Macau resort in September, and MGM plans to open its $3.3 billion MGM Cotai complex in the fourth quarter of 2017.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"The Fed signaled it could raise rates soon and dismissed concerns about consumer softness and inflation, but some market pros focused on the fact the Fed also looks to be giving itself a way out if the economy does not improve before its June meeting. After the Fed released minutes of its last meeting,  Fed funds futures for June were largely unchanged, reflecting about a 78 percent chance for a June hike. However, odds for a second hike in September fell to 37 percent from 40 percent, according to BMO. The market has been doubting the Fed's forecast for two rate hikes by year-end, and it continues to have doubts based on the action in futures. Traders have pointed to a weak stream of economic data and concerns about political uncertainty, including delays to pro-growth policies in Washington. ""I think June is still on the table unless the consumer or inflation blows up. They gave themselves an out. That's just prudent,"" said Aaron Kohli, director, fixed income strategy at BMO. Kohli said traders expected the Fed's minutes to be more hawkish than they were. Stocks initially moved slightly lower after the 2 p.m. minutes, but then reversed and moved to session highs. Treasury yields moved slightly lower after the minutes but retraced some of the move. The 2-year yield, which most reflects Fed action, slipped to 1.29 percent, and the 10-year yield was at 1.25 percent from 1.28 percent before the release of Fed minutes. John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said some in the markets were focused on language in the minutes about awaiting additional evidence for economic improvement. ""Members generally judged that it would be prudent to await additional evidence indicating that the recent slowing in the pace of economic activity had been transitory before taking another step in removing accommodation,"" the minutes said. ""I think they're overreacting to that,"" Briggs said, adding he expects the Fed to hike in June. The Fed said both softer consumer spending and lower-than-expected inflation appeared to be transitory factors, and officials said they see near-term risks to the outlook as roughly balanced. Mike Schumacher, director of rates strategy at Wells Fargo, said the Fed appears to be ready to hike in June, but it also left itself wiggle room. ""The door is wide open but there is a lot of fudge factor there,"" he said. The Fed also provided some details on how it could taper back its balance sheet, an expected move that would include a steady increase in the level of securities it would roll off each month. Economists believe the Fed would pause in its rate hiking, before setting up the program at the end of the year, to slow reinvesting in Treasury and mortgages as securities on its balance sheet mature. ""I think there's still two rate hikes. What they want to do is set up a trajectory so there's a path to rate hikes and unwind the balance sheet in a measured and slow way before Chair Yellen leaves office,"" said Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's term expires in the new year. Ed Keon, managing director and portfolio manager at QMA, said the release was as expected, but he also said the Fed gave itself an out for June. ""I don't think the minutes tell us for sure they're going to move in June, but that's still my best guess. They left the door open for additional data as they usually do,"" he said. ""In my view, June is more than a 50/50 shot, but I think they were careful to include some words that would allow them to pass on June if they thought it was necessary."" Keon pointed to the weak first quarter, with growth of less than 1 percent, and continued negative surprises in second-quarter economic reports, including this week's housing data. ""There's nothing in here to suggest they are not"" going to hike rates in June, said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. ""They're not going to explicitly say we think we're going to raise in June. They were somewhat dismissive of the inflation picture which would be the primary impediment to a June rate hike.""

Arjun Kharpal,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"Lenovo, the world's largest maker of personal computers, is expecting profitability in its smartphone and server business where it has made large acquisitions, in the ""near future"", the company's finance chief told CNBC on Thursday. The Chinese technology giant reported $9.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending March 31, a 5 percent year-on-year rise. For the full-year, however, revenue fell 4 percent to $43 billion. Meanwhile, profit for the full year was $535 million, a rise from the $128 million loss recorded in the previous fiscal year. Lenovo's PC business, which represents around 70 percent of its total revenue, saw unit shipments decline 1 percent, a smaller fall than the overall global PC market which fell 2.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2017, according to Gartner. ""We are always doing our business at a premium to the market,"" Wong Wai Ming, chief financial officer of Lenovo, told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. But in the past few years, the company has tried to expand its presence in two areas: smartphones and data centers. In 2014, Lenovo bought Motorola's phone business from Google, and that same year purchased IBM's x86 server business. Lenovo's mobile and data center businesses have been struggling as the company looks to integrate the acquisitions to create synergies. But in the mobile business it saw an operational loss of $566 million, widening from the $469 million loss in the year before. And the data center group recorded a loss of $343 million. Still, Wong said that the company is seeing improvements in both businesses. ""(The) smartphone business is different from PC likewise server business is different from PC, so it will take time for us to really understand the business, build a team, build the infrastructure and grow from there,"" Wong told CNBC. ""I think we are very very confident that this will come in the near future."" The CFO cited improvements in its smartphone business with the Motorola brand globally. ""Nothing will happen overnight, but we are very very confident that the two businesses … will become a profit engine in the near future.""

For years after the financial crisis, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) found itself in a coveted position. By avoiding the worst excesses of the subprime mortgage bubble, the California-based bank was able to grow and gain market share while most other banks were busy licking their wounds. But things have changed at Wells Fargo. Its fake-account scandal, divulged last year by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, tarnished its once-sterling reputation. And even before that came to light, Wells Fargo's earnings had already started to decline. After six consecutive years of rising earnings, Wells Fargo's net income fell in 2015 by $163 million compared to the prior year. Fortunately, thanks to share buybacks, its earnings per share still grew in 2015, albeit by only a penny per share. Data source: Wells Fargo. Chart by author. In 2016, however, both measures fell. Wells Fargo's bottom line declined by $956 million, while its earnings per share went from $4.18 in 2015 down to $4.03 last year. It's tempting to blame Wells Fargo's fake-account scandal for the drop. After all, the bank is absorbing elevated legal costs stemming from the scandal, and it's growth has already started to be impacted by Wells Fargo's decision to eliminate sales goals in its branches, which caused new checking account openings and credit card applications to plummet. But even though Wells Fargo's recent troubles haven't been good for its earnings, they're not the primary source of the decline. That distinction goes to the relationship between Wells Fargo's provision for loan losses relative to its charge-offs. Image source: The Motley Fool. From 2008 through 2012, Wells Fargo set aside $53.4 billion in loan loss provisions, or about $18 billion a year on average. These are meant to cover future loan losses, which are then charged off when they actually go into default. But here's the thing: In 2008, Wells Fargo set aside $8.1 billion more than it charged off. And in 2009, its provisions exceeded its charge-offs by $3.5 billion. By doing so, Wells Fargo was adding to its loan loss allowance, which it could then draw from to cover charge-offs in future periods. Data source: Wells Fargo. Chart by author. And that's exactly what Wells Fargo did between 2010 and 2015. In each of those years, the nation's third biggest bank by assets charged off more than it recorded as a provision expense, relying on releases from its existing loan loss reserves to cover the difference. In 2013, for instance, Wells Fargo charged off $4.5 billion worth of soured loans, but only recorded a $2.3 billion provision expense. But this gap closed considerably in 2015, when the bank's charge-offs exceeded its provisions by $450 million. And by 2016, it had reversed, as Wells Fargo set aside more than it charged off the previous year. These are the forces, in turn, that have caused Wells Fargo's earnings to fall for two consecutive years, as the year-over-year increase in its provision expense exceeded $1 billion in both 2015 and 2016, while its net income in those periods fell by $163 million and $956 million, respectively.

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There are some stocks in my portfolio (you can find a full list of all the stocks I own here) that I bought because I think they'll do well during the Trump administration, or over the next few years. On the other hand, there are several stocks I own because I think they'll do well for decades to come. Here are four of my ""forever stocks"" and why I don't plan on ever selling them. Company Symbol Recent Share Price Apple AAPL $153.26 Realty Income O $55.58 Berkshire Hathaway BRK-B $163.72 Welltower HCN $70.01 Share prices are as of 5/10/2017. Image source: Getty Images. This is an easy one to start with -- after all, what's not to like about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)? For starters, the company has a fiercely loyal customer base, and one of the most valuable brand names in the world that gives it pricing power to operate more profitably than competitors. In addition, Apple has done a great job of growing its service-based revenue sources such as Apple Music, AppleCare, and Apple Pay, which provide a steady, predictable stream of income to complement the boost the company sees when it releases a new product. Oh, and Apple's $256.8 billion cash hoard is a nice bonus, and could allow Apple to pursue some interesting value-adding opportunities if a tax repatriation holiday happens. Retail REIT Realty Income (NYSE:O) is one of my forever stocks for two simple reasons. It has delivered fantastic performance over the years, and has done so without putting investors at a high level of risk. Specifically, Realty Income primarily invests in high-quality freestanding retail properties, most of whose tenants are in recession-resistant or competition-resistant business models. To name just a couple of examples of Realty Income's major property types, drug stores sell products people need, no matter what the economy is doing. And fitness centers and movie theaters are immune to online competitors. Furthermore, tenants are on long-term ""net"" leases, which requires them to pay the variable costs of property ownership, such as property taxes, building insurance, and maintenance. All Realty Income needs to do is find a tenant and enjoy years of steadily growing, predictable income. I've written before that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate led by legendary investor Warren Buffett, is such a well-rounded company that it could potentially stand alone in a stock portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway's primary business is insurance, which it operates through wholly owned subsidiaries such as GEICO. Over the years, however, Berkshire has also built up an impressive portfolio of businesses, many of which are household names. Fruit of the Loom, Pampered Chef, BNSF Railways, and Clayton Homes are some of the more well-known Berkshire brands, just to name a few. In addition, Berkshire invests substantial sums of money in common stocks which are hand-picked by Buffett or his stock pickers. The company has a pretty impressive portfolio that includes substantial stakes in Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, and American Express, among dozens of others. Welltower (NYSE:WELL) is a real estate investment trust that focuses on healthcare properties, with a main focus on senior housing. The company is the largest healthcare-focused REIT in the market, with about 1,400 properties in the U.S., U.K., and Canada. The main reason I own Welltower as a ""forever stock"" is that the market for healthcare properties, and senior housing in particular, should perform quite well over the coming decades. The population in the U.S. and Welltower's other two markets is aging rapidly. In fact, the senior citizen population is expected to roughly double by 2050, and the oldest age groups, such as 85-and-up, are growing even faster. As the largest player in its industry, Welltower has the financial flexibility to pursue opportunities as they present themselves, and the operational efficiency advantages to capitalize on the growing industry more than peers. When I say that I'll hold these stocks forever, I mean that I plan to do so as long as the companies' current business models remain intact. For example, if Realty Income decided to boost its leverage ratio from less than 30% to more than 60%, I might have to reconsider my investment. ","

Maurie Backman,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When you think about the aspects of your job that are most important, it's natural for money to be, well, up there. After all, without a decent wage, you'll have trouble paying your bills and socking away money for savings. Unfortunately, a large number of Americans aren't happy in this regard. According to a 2014 Monster.com survey, over 65% of U.S. employees are dissatisfied with their wages. If your salary isn't up to snuff, you may be persuaded to start looking for a new job. Similarly, if you're offered a job with a salary that's lower than expected, you may be inclined to reject it. But before you do, remember that your salary is only one part of your overall compensation package. In fact, here are some key workplace benefits that can more than make up for a salary that isn't stellar. Image source: Getty Images. A comprehensive health insurance plan can save you thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket medical costs year after year, and the more your employer contributes toward your premiums, the less you'll have to pay. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2016, annual premiums for employer-sponsored health plans reached $18,142, with workers paying $5,277, on average, toward the cost of their coverage. If your company offers a generous health plan and makes you pay only a small portion of your costs, you should factor the financial savings into your total compensation. Employer-sponsored 401(k) plans make it easy to save for retirement, yet according to a Wells Fargo study, 41% of workers don't have the option to participate in one. If you're among the 59% of employees with access to a 401(k), you should consider yourself lucky -- especially since 92% of companies that sponsor these plans also offer some type of matching incentive. Whatever match your employer gives you is essentially free money; all you need to do to collect it is contribute to your 401(k) yourself. But if, say, your employer is willing to match contributions up to 3% of your salary, and you earn $50,000 a year, you could potentially snag an extra $1,500 -- no strings attached. The ability to work from home, whether consistently or on occasion, can not only save you money on commuting, but make life more manageable on a whole. If your company extends this privilege, no longer will you have to take time off to accept deliveries or let contractors in for quick home repairs. Similarly, if your company is willing to let you condense your workweek or alter your hours to, say, accommodate your limited child care options, that's a benefit that can directly enhance your quality of life. Some companies offer seasoned employees more paid time off than newbies. Others have uniform employee time off policies, regardless of tenure. But if your company offers a considerable amount of time off, that's a perk you'll enjoy in more ways than one. First, you won't have to worry about losing pay if you fall ill several times during the year, or have to travel frequently for personal reasons. Additionally, having more time off to get away, relax, and recharge can be good for your physical and mental health. Finally, the more paid time off you get, the more opportunities you'll have to moonlight on the side and bring in extra income -- provided your company doesn't have a policy against it. These days, a growing number of companies are recognizing the importance of helping employees stay healthy. To this end, many are instituting wellness programs where employees get access to free or discounted gym memberships, money toward personal exercise equipment, and in-office yoga classes or massages. Taking better care of your health can save you money in the long run, so don't discount the value of these little extras. Before your seemingly meager salary drives you to start looking for a better-paying job, take some time to consider the value of the various benefits your company offers. It may very well be the case that you'll make $3,000 more at another company, but if that employer contributes that much less toward your health plan, you won't actually wind up better off. Crucial as your salary might be, it's just as important to keep your eyes on the big picture when contemplating your employment options. ","
      
    5 Workplace Benefits You Shouldn't Overlook -- The Motley Fool

Todd Campbell,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett's ability to pick long-term winners for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) portfolios has made his buying decisions must-know news. Fortunately, big investors like him have to file a 13F report with the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter that shows what he's been buying. According to Warren Buffett's latest 13F, his top stocks for new money include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK). Should you be buying these stocks, too? Warren Buffett once told Steve Jobs to use Apple's cash to buy back stock, but it took Buffett until 2016 to follow his own advice. Image source: The Motley Fool. Now, Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's third largest position. In the first quarter, Buffett bought nearly 72 million shares of Apple, bringing the total number of shares owned by Berkshire Hathaway to over 129 million. At current prices, that position is worth over $19 billion. Why is Buffett betting so big on Apple? At the time of his first purchase, Apple shares had sunk to lows on fear that slowing sales in China was a signal of weakness to come. Since then, China has shown signs of recovery, and with rumors suggesting Apple's next iPhone will include new features like 3D sensing, Apple could be about to see demand surge as device owners upgrade. While Apple was a cheap stock when Buffett first began buying, it's gotten more expensive since then. In the past year, Apple's shares have rallied over 60%. There could be more room to run higher, but Buffett did recently hint that he's having trouble buying more shares now that prices have run up so much. Nevertheless, the potential for this technology behemoth to enjoy a rush of sales remains a key catalyst heading into 2018, and for that reason, investors might want to join Buffett in buying Apple if shares dip. In the past, Warren Buffett has said a surefire way to become a millionaire is to start out a billionaire and buy an airline. Yet, shares in Southwest Air were among his biggest buys in the first quarter. Southwest is a discount airline that's known for folksy, fun service, and Warren Buffett lists co-founder Herb Kelleher as a friend. In Q1, Buffett added over 4.4 million shares in Southwest Airlines to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, bringing its total stake north of 47 million shares. Coming out of the first quarter, Berkshire Hathaway is Southwest Airlines' second biggest shareholder. By his own admission, one of Buffett's worst stock picks in his career was USAir, an operator he bought back in the late 1980s that declared bankruptcy twice. He ultimately made money on USAir, but he still refers to it as a ""dumb"" buy because, historically, the industry has suffered from too much capacity, too much price competition, and too high costs. Today, Buffett appears to believe that those headwinds have eased. Bankruptcies and mergers have rightsized capacity and airlines are far less willing to sell seats at bargain-basement prices. A strong economy is also helping increase load factors, and rising oil production in the U.S. due to shale drilling has helped keep jet fuel prices in check. As a result, operators including Southwest have been delivering solid growth. LUV Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett's also been buying Southwest's competitors, including American Airlines, so he seems to like the industry as a whole. However, I'm not convinced that airlines will remain a staple holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The industry has made significant changes to its business model that have paid off, but it's still a cyclical industry with high capital expenses. Because of these reasons, Buffett could view these bets on airlines as opportunistic rather than long-term investments. If I'm correct, then he could sell at any point; especially since shares have rallied considerably higher. In spite of a high-profile scandal at his biggest holding, Wells Fargo, Warren Buffett hasn't soured on banks. In Q1, he added 11.3 million more shares to his existing position in Bank of New York Mellon, and as a result, he now owns 33 million shares in it. Banking's appeal is understandable. Following the Great Recession, bank earnings have been weighed down by the government's low-interest policies, but now that those policies are ending, banks are poised to see their net interest margins climb. Bank of NY Mellon, however, isn't an ordinary bank. The company is a leader in asset management, and while it makes money lending to businesses and high-net-worth clients, it's benefiting significantly from rising equity markets' positive impact on fees. Last quarter, a record $30.6 trillion in assets under management or administration helped revenue grow 2.7% year over year to $3.84 billion. In the quarter, investment services revenue accounted for $3 billion of total sales. Meanwhile, the bank's cost controls helped non-interest expense grow more slowly than sales, providing leverage that allowed the company to report earnings per share of $0.83, which was $0.03 better than Street forecasts, and 14% higher than last year. Its improving financials suggest there's plenty of financial firepower to continue returning a lot of money to investors. Last quarter alone, buybacks and dividend payments totaled $1.1 billion. As long as global markets are strong and high-net-worth clients finances are holding up, Bank of NY Mellon should perform well, and since there's little evidence of a pending recession, it's not surprising that Buffett continues to warm up to this one.

Howard Gold,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: May 25, 2017 9:23 a.m. ET Soft data say buy, buy, buy, yet the hard data say not so fast By The election of Donald J. Trump as president in November unleashed a wave of confidence among businesses, consumers, and investors that prosperity was just around the corner. This so-called “soft” data, based mostly on sentiment surveys, point to a surging economy in which 3% GDP growth—which we haven’t seen consistently since the 1990s—was within reach. Consider: •The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index stood at 97 in April, just off its 13-year high of 98.5 set in January. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index at 120.3 in April also remains strong, though it slid from recent highs in February and March. •The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index, which polls CEOs of the nation’s largest corporations on their expectations for sales and hiring over the next six months, showed its biggest increase in the first quarter since the fourth quarter of 2009. •The NFIB Index of Small Business Optimism also slipped a bit last month, but April was the sixth consecutive month for high optimism, “a hot streak not seen since 1983,” the NFIB reported. •The Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index hit a 16-year high in the first quarter at +126. That’s the most optimistic investors have been since November 2000, when the index stood at +130 (although Gallup points out that the surge has been driven largely by Republicans, whose confidence is now 209 points higher than it was in the third quarter of 2016, something this column noted in March). •The Dow Jones Industrial Average

                                   indexes are all on five-day winning streaks. The S&P set a record close on Wednesday, and the other two are within a whisker of their all-time highs. If you look only at “soft” data and sentiment, the economy and markets are in Nirvana, Valhalla, and Paradise combined. Back in the real world of “hard” data, however, things aren’t quite so great. •Retail sales, where consumers translate all that positive sentiment into cash purchases, rose 0.4% in April, less than expected, after a couple of soft months. “Consumer confidence may be through the roof but retail sales, and consumer spending in general, have been stuck on the ground,” Econoday observed. •Sales of new cars and trucks fell in April for the fourth consecutive month, and inventories are piling up at dealers. That inevitably leads to “incentives,” i.e., deep discounts, which cut into auto makers’ profits. So, GM is planning to lay off 4,000 employees and Ford is cutting 10% of its workforce, including former CEO Mark Fields. “There are growing signs that America’s car market is running out of gas,” The Economist wrote. Read: Existing-home sales stall in April as tight supply pushes properties to record low time on the market •Banks are scaling back lending. Commercial & industrial loans outstanding fell to around $2.1 trillion earlier this month, below November’s peak and marking the seventh consecutive month of no growth in these key loans. Every time that has happened since the 1960s, “a recession was either in progress or would start soon,” wrote Wolf Richter on the Wolf Street blog. He called it “a big red flag…Something is seriously wrong.” •And guess which trend from the 2000s is making a big comeback? No, it’s not Crocs, Segways, Paris Hilton or low-rise jeans. It’s household debt. Last week the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that total U.S. household debt had hit $12.7 trillion, a record. True, mortgage debt comprises 68% of the total, vs. 73% in the 2000s, but student loan debt is soaring, at $1.3 trillion. And unlike with a mortgage, you can’t just send your diploma back to the lender. That means “more Americans are shouldering a type of debt that could weigh them down for the rest of their lives,” the New York Times wrote. So, what are we to make of all this? Stocks have moved up based on two things—a big earnings recovery and hopes the Trump administration would cut taxes, slash regulations and build big infrastructure projects. The earnings recovery is still intact, but the Trump agenda is floundering amid Congressional gridlock and the investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, which is sucking the oxygen from the room. Also, we’ve seen several economic indicators topping out: Housing sales are at decade highs, auto sales peaked a few months ago, and unemployment, at 4.4%, is near a cyclical low, with full employment on the horizon or already here. In an economic recovery and bull market that are eight years old, there’s not much room for improvement. I think we’re in the final innings of both. And the S&P 500’s valuation, at 17.5 times projected 2017 earnings, is pretty high. So when the soft data say buy, buy, buy, and the hard data say not so fast, I’ll trust the hard data. I’m not yet ready to bail on this market, but it’s surely time for caution. Now read: What 10 million simulations tell us about President Trump’s chances of achieving 3% economic growth Howard R.

With the growth of the bralette business, the unlined undergarments that have become popular with millennials and fans of sheer fashions, focus has fallen away from “constructed” bras, which usually come with underwires, push-up padding, and clasps.

Constructed bras, which are key to many of Victoria’s Secret’s signature bra lines, could be both a differentiator and a way to drive revenue numbers later in 2017. “While attracting a younger consumer is a huge win, the downside is this customer’s focus on price,” wrote MKM Partners in a Thursday note. “[W]e still believe the key catalyst will be improvement in constructed bras, expected for fall.” Still, MKM analysts say they will “wait and see.” MKM rates L Brands shares neutral with a $51 price target.

Wells Fargo rates L Brands shares market perform with a $53 price target. L Brands reported total first-quarter sales of $2.44 billion, down from $2.61 billion last year, and in line with the FactSet consensus. Victoria’s Secret sales were $1.53 billion, down from $1.74 billion last year. Total same-store sales for the quarter were down 9%, with same-store sales at Victoria’s Secret down 14%.

However, UBS analysts wrote in a Wednesday note that same-store sales for Pink “decelerated to an increase in the low-single-digits in the first quarter (from positive double digits in the first half of 2016 and positive high-single digits in the second half of 2016), potentially creating another same-store sales headwind in the near-term.” UBS rates L Brands shares neutral with a $52 price target.

,06012017,Reuters,05252017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City voted on Wednesday to suspend Wells Fargo from its municipal debt issuance operations, citing a rating tied to doing business in low and moderate-income communities as having fallen below a “satisfactory” level. The commission also cited last year’s scandal, in which the bank was caught creating bogus customer accounts to boost performance measures. The New York City Banking Commission, in a unanimous 3-0 vote, decided it will give no new bond underwriting mandates or renew existing contracts with Wells Fargo. The decision follows a Federal Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating of “needs improvement” for the San Francisco-based bank. The decision adds New York City to other states and municipalities that have banned the bank from handling their funding operations. The commission was composed of Mayor Bill de Blasio, Comptroller Scott Stringer and Commissioner of Finance Jacques Jiha. “What happened at Wells Fargo was fraud - and there must be consequences for wrongful behavior,” Stringer said in a statement. Wells Fargo, however, was given a conditional designation as a New York City bank. That means it can still hold funds under current contract because it would be too disruptive to immediately disentangle the city from the bank. “The ban will be revisited only when the bank’s rating is raised,” de Blasio and Stringer said in a joint statement prior to the vote. The Wells Fargo scandal and the repercussions on its  municipal banking operations contributed to a slump in its underwriting business, Reuters reported earlier this month. Prior to the vote, the bank told Reuters it appreciated the continuing dialogue with the city. “More than four years have passed since the end of our last CRA evaluation period and we are seeking an expedited review of the 2012-2015 exam,” Wells Fargo spokesman Gabriel Boehmer said in an email. Wells Fargo holds $227 million of collected city taxes and fees and acts as a trustee to the New York City Retiree Health Benefits Trust, currently holding its roughly $2.6 billion in assets. The ban will suspend the bank’s role as a senior book-running manager for the city’s General Obligation as well as Transactional Finance Authority bond sales. “The only allowable exemption will be for affordable housing financing, which has a direct benefit to New York City residents,” the joint statement said.

,06012017,Reuters,05252017,"Mary Mack, head of the retail business, announced new roles for four executives who will report directly to her, according to a memo sent last week that was viewed by Reuters on Tuesday. The San Francisco-based bank also cut the number of sub-regions in its Western U.S. operation to five from eight, a move that left two executives looking for new jobs, according to the memo, whose contents were confirmed by spokeswoman Mary Eshet. “These leadership changes are responsive to our priorities of rebuilding trust with team members and customers... so that we can learn from the past,” Mack said in the May 24 memo, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The latest changes come nearly a year after Mack took over her position from Carrie Tolstedt, a central figure in the scandal. Under her watch, thousands of retail bank employees created as many as 2.1 million phony accounts in customers’ names to hit aggressive sales targets. Many of the problems occurred in Western states and came to light after Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement with a Los Angeles prosecutor and federal regulators last September. Earlier this year, Wells demoted and dismissed other retail banking executives over their roles in the scandal. (reut.rs/2l4FU6U) Mack’s direct reports with new roles include Bob Chlebowski, who was named branch distribution executive; Laurey Cosentino, who will lead the customer and branch experience team; Celeste Finley, who will lead the regional services group; and Jonathan Velline, who was named head of business strategy and administration. Those with new responsibilities in the Western division include Don Pearson, who was named head of the Desert Mountain region; David Galasso, the new head of Greater California; Dave Kvamme, the new head of Midwest East; John Sotoodeh, the new head of Midwest West; and Jim Foley, named head of Northwest. Those executives now report to Western Regional Banking Executive Lisa Stevens. Ben Alvarado, who previously headed Southern California, and Frank Newman, former head of the Rocky Mountain area, will be seeking new opportunities, according to the memo. Eshet said that they will be looking inside the bank. David DiCristofaro, who previously headed greater Los Angeles, will take on a new senior leadership role inside community banking, reporting to Cosentino. ","

 ,06012017,Reuters,05252017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stretched thin by the needs of your children and your elderly parents? Try this “sandwich generation” solution: Move your young adults in with their grandparents and let them take care of each other. This is working for Eileen Helmer, who turns 30 this summer, and her grandmother, also named Eileen, who is almost 90. They are best friends and roommates in Miami. “I do all the grocery shopping, heavy lifting and changing the lightbulbs. She takes care of all of my plants,” says Helmer, who moved in with her grandmother more than six years ago to save money during law school. She liked it so much that she stayed after she graduated and went to work for EY as a tax lawyer. The middle generation - made up of her mom and her three aunts and uncles - could not be happier to have a caring family member on site. “Everyone says it’s a great relief,” says Helmer. Many members of the so-called “sandwich generation” feel squeezed by competing demands. In fact, more than half of those who provide financial support to an adult family member say it is hindering their ability to save for their own retirement, according to a new Wells Fargo/Gallup poll. “It catches the middle generation a lot of times by surprise,” said Sandra McPeak, managing director of investments at Wells Fargo Advisors. There is a huge range of solutions to deal with the caretaking dilemmas that arise. Liza Baker, a health coach (simply-healthcoaching.com/) based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has clients living with aging parents to provide full-time care. She also had a client who turned away a neglectful father. Here is how some families are meeting the demands from both sides, without letting their own retirement get off track: * Make decisions as a family Family communication is key, says McPeak. She has one set of clients in their early 80s who both need full-time care and are worried about how long their funds will hold out. Their daughters call often, wanting to know the financial picture, but the parents are not ready to talk in more than broad brush strokes. “The daughters are just able to take care of themselves, and they are terrified,” says McPeak. But the financial picture is complicated, because the family might not benefit most by selling the parent’s home now while they are both alive, because they would have to pay tax on a gain over $500,000, and the house has greatly appreciated in value in 35 years. “It’s a touchy subject,” says McPeak, and one best discussed with all the parties at once, talking in specific numbers so everyone knows what is going on. * Make lemonade When caregiving sucks away all your energy and puts a halt on your career, there are ways to make it work for you. After a long stretch putting her own career as a product designer on hold to care for her kids and her parents, Colleen Kavanaugh, 45, put her skills to use. “When my dad died, I realized that I had what was the equivalent of a masters degree,” says Kavanaugh, who lives near Morristown, New Jersey, and now makes $125 an hour as a certified caregiving consultant (thelongestdance.com/). Her best advice to clients: Get a power of attorney before something happens, especially if there is any cognitive decline. * Put grandma and the kids to work Sometime the two bread ends of the sandwich are able to work together to help the middle. For Daniel Grote, a financial planner at Latitude Financial Group in Denver, moving his mother-in-law into his home for six years meant she was taken care of and there was a built-in babysitter for his three young kids. While her stay turned out to be temporary and not too expensive, Grote is now preparing for costs down the road. Taking the advice he gives others, that means looking into long-term care insurance and buying a house big enough for her to have a room if she needs to move back. Eileen Helmer is also preparing for more intense caregiving duties. She is engaged to be married to a 33-year-old who also lives with his grandparents and helps take care of them. They plan to split their time between the two homes, although they have not yet worked out all the details. “Maybe my grandmother will take care of my kids,” Helmer says. ","

 ,06012017,Reuters,05252017,"BlackRock, which oversees $5.4 trillion in assets and is the world’s largest asset manager, is moving into 847,000 square feet (78,690 sq meters) of a development that will be part of a neighborhood rising over rail yards and tracks in a once-forlorn corner of New York City. The company said in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will pay $50.8 million per year in the first five years, and an increasing amount after that, for a total $1.25 billion over 20 years. That works out to about $60 per square foot to start, and nearly $74 over the full term of the lease for the offices at 50 Hudson Yards. The company also will be responsible for its operating expenses at the building and a share of property taxes, which will add about $30 a square foot to the lease, a source with knowledge of the transaction said. The lease is one of the largest ever in Manhattan in terms of size and value of the overall contract. The average asking rent in April for midtown Manhattan office space was $84.09 a square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Along Park Avenue, near where BlackRock is currently located, asking rents averaged $91.13 a square foot. High-end “trophy” properties, such as 50 Hudson Yards, often rent at higher rates than average. The developing district has also attracted Coach Inc COH.N, Wells Fargo Securities and the National Hockey League. The success of the Hudson Yards district has already moved the center of Manhattan’s office complex from BlackRock’s current location, in the coveted Plaza District in midtown, south and westward to the new development. The BlackRock lease was agreed on Wednesday and starts May 1, 2023. For the time being, BlackRock has offices in two buildings on 52nd Street off Park Avenue, along with other locations. Its new building, which is expected to be finished in 2022 and be the city’s fourth-largest office tower, will include 15 floors of a 58-story tower developed by Related Cos LP and Oxford Properties Group Inc. It also includes a 400-seat auditorium.

 ,06012017,Reuters,05252017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell for a second straight month in April amid a supply squeeze, but the housing market recovery remains supported by a strong labor market. The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, dropped 1.3 percent to 109.8. Contracts fell in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but surged 5.8 percent in the West. Coming on the heels of recent data showing a drop in home building and sales of both new and previously owned homes, the decrease in contracts suggests a moderation in housing activity. Still, housing is expected to contribute to gross domestic product this year. “We think that the housing recovery will continue over time based on favorable fundamentals in the market, but we have seen some weakening in a number of home sale measures lately,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “For now, we think the recent softening in sales is a pause in a broader upward trend.” Economists had forecast pending home sales, which become sales after a month or two, rising 0.5 percent last month. They fell 3.3 percent from a year ago. That is the first year-on-year drop since last December and the largest since June 2014. The PHLX housing index .HGX was little changed amid a broadly weaker stock market. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were trading higher. Demand for housing is being driven by a tight labor market, marked by a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, which is generating wage increases and boosting employment opportunities for young Americans. The housing market remains supported by historically low mortgage rates, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaging 3.95 percent, the lowest level since last November. Sales activity, however, remains constrained by tight inventories, which are driving up home prices. Housing inventory has dropped for 23 straight months on a year-on-year basis. Home resales declined 2.3 percent in April and could decrease in May as another report on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home fell for a third straight week last week. “The large declines in the Northeast and Midwest suggest seasonal factors exaggerated the recent slide in pending home sales,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Mortgage applications add a note of caution, however.” A third report showed manufacturing activity in the Midwest region accelerated to a 2-1/2-year high in May. The Chicago Purchasing Management Index rose to a reading of 59.4 this month, the highest level since November 2014, from 58.3 in April. ","

 ,06012017,Reuters,05252017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The vast majority of bank customers in Europe would not let a computer program make and act upon financial decisions on their behalf, a survey showed on Wednesday, in a sign of caution over the rising so-called robo-advice industry. The survey of 15,000 people across 15 countries said that 91 percent of respondents would not let robo-advisers act unilaterally. A quarter of those surveyed would be willing to use the machines’ advice so long as the human customer got final approval. The fact that people are reluctant to cede control over a decision - even when the outcome from outsourcing the choice could be more beneficial - explains why so few would hand money choices to a robo-adviser, ING said in its report. The robo-advice market was originally developed by startups such as Wealthfront and Betterment with ambitions of upending the traditional financial advice sector by offering automated investment advice to clients through web-based platforms. Robo-advisers currently account for a small piece of the wealth management industry, overseeing roughly $200 billion of client assets in 2016, according to consulting firm A.T. Kearney. That figure will however balloon to $2.2 trillion by 2020, the consultancy firm said, amid changing regulations that favor the new industry and cost pressures on traditional advice. The ING study, which was conducted in 13 European countries, the United States and Australia, showed differing levels of willingness to use robo-advisers. Forty percent of people in Turkey and 38 percent in Romania are willing to allow robo-advisers to invest for them, the survey said, the highest levels of receptiveness among countries surveyed. More than half of respondents in Luxembourg, Austria and France said they did not want any automated financial activities at all. ","

Mark Kolakowski,06012017,Investopedia,05252017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs In a rare show of bipartisan consensus, Republicans and Democrats in Washington seem ready to raise the current $50 billion asset benchmark for banks facing the tightest regulatory scrutiny under the Dodd-Frank Financial Regulatory Reform Act of 2010, the Wall Street Journal reports. The question is how high. Democrats suggest $100 billion to $150 billion, while Republicans favor $250 billion to $500 billion, per the Journal. This means the average size of U.S. banks presumed to be ""too big to fail"" would rise sharply as the number of smaller banks in the group plunges. Based on the asset sizes under discussion, the number of banks subject to the most stringent regulations, currently 37, would be reduced to as many as 30 or as few as six institutions, the Journal says. Meanwhile, President Trump has promised to dismantle Dodd-Frank entirely, but the odds of that happening seem to be diminishing. So piecemeal adjustments to the landmark law, such as to the $50 billion asset benchmark, are much more likely. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has told the Senate Banking Committee that a $50 billion bank is not as systemically risky as one with $750 billion or $2 trillion in assets, the Journal says. Even Barney Frank, the former Democratic representative from Massachusetts whose name is on the law, admits that $50 billion in assets was an arbitrary number that should be raised, the Journal adds. (For more, see also: Trump's Bank Deregulation May Send Investors $120B and Trump's Vow to End Dodd-Frank Faces Big Hurdles.) The one sure bet is that the six biggest national banking institutions will continue to face the stiffest regulation. These include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), Citigroup Inc. (C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC). In addition to commercial banking, all six also are involved in investment banking, asset management and broker-dealer activities. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are primarily securities firms, but were given TARP funds and made subject to banking regulations during the 2008 financial crisis. BofA acquired Merrill Lynch, which was facing possible insolvency, during that period. (For more, see also: Banks Say ""Too Big"" Is Best Amid Calls for Breakup (BAC, JPM).) If Congress settles on a new $250 billion asset cutoff for the highest level of regulation, the other six banks qualifying would be, according to bank asset data from the Federal Reserve: U.S. Bancorp (USB), PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC), Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) and State Street Corp. (STT). Banks that fall below a new, higher asset threshold could become more profitable, as the result of relaxed capital requirements and more freedom to engage in mergers. They also would have more flexibility to raise dividends or repurchase stock, as MarketWatch notes, and would be spared costly annual stress tests. However, these newly-liberated banks also might take bigger risks, with the potential for bigger losses. The Journal observes that banking crises sometimes are set off by problems at smaller institutions. Finally, removing a bank from the list of those subject to the most stringent regulation does not guarantee that it would never be bailed out at taxpayer expense. Republicans in Congress also are considering basing the strictest regulation on measures of a bank's risk, rather than its assets, per the Journal. Based on that risk criteria, Bob Wilmers, CEO of M&T Bank Corp. (MTB), told the Journal that regulators would be in a position to effectively liquidate many smaller banks. M&T has $123 billion in assets and Wilmers favors raising the regulatory bar to $250 billion or more, the Journal says.

Elizabeth Gurdus,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"When it comes to the time it takes for the market to forgive a company like Wells Fargo for its past transgressions, Jim Cramer says the big bank is not unlike one food chain that also paid its dues. ""My suggestion if you own Wells Fargo, as my charitable trust does? Sorry, but it does take 18 months – kind of Chipotle-like – for the American public to truly forgive. Remember, Wells Fargo's the Chipotle of banking, so don't get too excited because the company's got about a year left in purgatory,"" the ""Mad Money"" host explained. Still, after seeing the stock of Wells Fargo, and a slew of other lesser-known names, rise on Thursday, Cramer was comforted that the rally was broader than many investors seemed to think. ""The rap against this market was that it was all FANG all the time, with a smattering of cloud and some Tesla,"" Cramer said. Today, the rally got broader, much broader, and that has to make you feel a little more confident that stocks can keep going higher, even after this year's first five months of positive returns."" Turning to tech, Cramer spoke with Veeva Systems founder and CEO Peter Gassner, who told the ""Mad Money"" host that his cloud computing company, which serves the life sciences space, has plans to grow its $7 billion addressable market. ""We're always expanding our market, and I also think when you have a really good-quality system, a really good-quality technology that really fits the need, you expand the market,"" Gassner said. The CEO touted the company's latest quarter, which he dubbed a ""30-30 quarter"" because the company grew both revenues and profits by over 30 percent. And although the cloud seems hot now, Gassner said that the breakthrough industry is just getting started. ""We're in the early days of cloud overall. This is a macro-level trend of computing that's going to play out over the next 20, 30 years,"" the CEO said. Then, after cloud application provider Workday reported a strong quarter, CEO Aneel Bhusri gave Cramer a simple reason why companies are choosing his software platform over larger rivals like SAP and Oracle. ""It all comes back to having a great product and taking care of customers,"" Bhusri told Cramer on Thursday. ""Where I think we've really carved out our success has been at the high end of the enterprise, these very large companies where we're really the only proven solution in the marketplace."" A recent Goldman Sachs survey of CIOs showed that IT professionals are turning to Workday at the expense of Oracle and SAP. Bhusri said that with a customer satisfaction rate of roughly 97 percent, it is not hard to see how that factors in to the financial and human capital management company's gain in market share. People may be up in arms about President Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris climate agreement, but Jim Cramer sees one glaring problem. ""There's only so much any president can do unilaterally,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""While Trump supporters may cheer that he made good on a promise to pull out of the agreement, something he campaigned on, there's another part of his agenda that seems to have gone fallow that we care about here. Tax reform. It's fallen by the wayside because it requires the cooperation of Congress. And, at least right now, it almost feels like the White House has given up on Congress."" In fact, what Cramer called Washington's ""legislative logjam"" has thrown a wrench into a number of pro-business policies the Trump administration vowed to enact, including corporate tax reform, repatriation of cash from overseas, and health care reform. Finally, Cramer sat down with Robert Workman, the president and CEO of Now Inc., also known as DistributionNOW, an international oil and gas distribution company. Looking ahead at the oil industry's future, Workman predicted that relations between shale producers and OPEC would stay frigid for some time. ""My theory of this is pretty simple: I think it's going to be shaky waters between shale producers and OPEC for a while. Maybe in three, four, five quarters more, you'll find people who think it's not going to last that long,"" the CEO told Cramer on Thursday. That said, after a major downturn in the oil patch, Workman's company has turned around, deploying some $750 million in capital, acquiring 12 companies, and chasing profitability, something the CEO said could happen this quarter if Canadian business serves. ""We originally felt like we could get to profitability, from EBITDA perspective, by Q3,"" Workman told Cramer. ""Depending on how this breakup is in Canada … if it's not as strong of a breakup as past years, there's a chance we get to positive EBITDA this quarter."" In Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Radian Group: ""OK, there are two Philadelphia home stocks, there's Radian and there's Toll Brothers. I prefer Toll Brothers."" U.S. Silica Holdings: ""Yeah, that's a commodity play. We're not sand guys. It's just not ours. Not for us."" Questions for Cramer?

"Neil Ainger, Writer at CNBC.com",06012017,CNBC,05252017,"First Data is to buy fellow payment processor CardConnect for $750 million in cash. The $15 a share deal announced yesterday is due to close in the third quarter of this year and includes the repayment of debt. First Data is one of the world's biggest card payment and e-commerce processors. It handles $2.2 trillion worth of transactions a year on behalf of businesses such as retailers, banks and others that need to process a payment. The Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. headquartered company has revenue sharing alliances with Citi and SunTrust Merchant Services and stakes in Bank of America and Wells Fargo's Merchant Services. The greater volume that a platform can attract the cheaper it is to process card and other payments, as economies-of-scale savings apply to aggregated flows. The deal with CardConnect will give it an extra $26 billion worth of payments a year from 67,000 merchant customers and improve its financial technology (fintech) capabilities. The Pennsylvania-based business is known for its integrated payment solutions that link to corporate's internal enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This could open up a new market for First Data and improve its cash management and other services to clients. CardConnect recorded sales of $589 million last year, but lost nearly $16 million. Commenting on the deal in a statement First Data's chairman and CEO, Frank Bisignano, said the merged entity would be able to better serve partners and customers. He added that: ""This transaction is consistent with our strategy of integrating and scaling innovative technologies across our distribution footprint."" CardConnect was already a distribution partner for First Data, so the takeover formalizes its status. It went public last year after it was acquired by the FinTech Acquisition Corporation.

Hain said just three weeks ago in a filing ""it will be a position to file"" outstanding results ""by the end of May 2017."" However, in a release Tuesday, Hain said it received a waiver and extension under its unsecured credit facility from a bank group led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo until June 15. ""Latest delay is concerning but in the whole scheme of things, not the end of the world,"" Jefferies analyst Akshay Jagdale said in a research note Wednesday. ""It's hard to fathom why a seemingly simple revenue recognition issue takes one year to resolve.""

""We appreciate their continued support and confidence,"" Hain founder and CEO Irwin Simon said of the lenders' granting a waiver and extension. ""We remain well positioned to support our strategic operational growth objectives with our solid financial position."" As of March 31, Hain said there was $780 million in borrowings under the credit facility, and the company had $163 million in cash. In August 2016, Hain stunned investors with the announcement it had potential accounting concerns. The company also disclosed at that time it had delayed the release of its fiscal 2016 financial results and missed guidance. The last time Hain reported financial results was May 4, 2016, when it announced results for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2016. The company earlier missed several deadlines on reporting its financials and also received delisting notices from the Nasdaq Stock Market. According to Hain, the extension will allow the company time ""to be compliant with its credit facility reporting obligations while it works to complete"" filing financial results for fiscal 2016 and other outstanding reports, including its Q1, Q2 and Q3 results for fiscal 2017. ""This waiver and extension of the credit facility is consistent with the extension granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to the company to file its periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission and regain Nasdaq listing compliance by June 15, 2017,"" Hain said. ""The company intends to be in a position to file all the outstanding reports during this period."" CNBC reached out to Hain for further comment. Nasdaq declined comment.

While he would not bet against the index, he suggested trimming one's holdings at these levels.

Of course, 1996 was the year then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan wondered about ""irrational exuberance"" and whether stocks were reaching unsustainable heights.

""There's no doubt that, fundamentally, all the tech companies have certainly come to the forefront.

Patti Domm,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"Stocks are near record highs, driven by surging tech shares, a sharp contrast with the bond market, where interest rates have been sinking on worries the economy just isn't getting enough juice for growth to pick up. The S&P 500 also is just a short hop to record territory, and it too tells a very different story from the Treasury market, where the belief is that the Federal Reserve may have to stop raising interest rates after its next hike in mid-June because of weak inflation or growth or both. As of Wednesday, traders were pricing in just 1.4 rate hikes this year, instead of the two forecast by the Fed. The ups and downs in expectations for fiscal stimulus from Washington have been a factor in the diverging market behavior. ""I think it's more like what the growth outlook looks like beyond this year. The market is showing a lot of skepticism about the belief that anything will get done on the fiscal policy side,"" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The bond market has also benefited from low yields in other parts of the globe, which have sent investors into U.S. Treasurys with relatively higher U.S. yields. Yields move opposite to prices. ""Everybody looks at stocks and says: When is the equity market going to have a Trump unwind?"" said Michael Schumacher, head of rates strategy at Wells Fargo. Schumacher said the bond market has been factoring out the Trump reflation trade, which sent rates higher right after the election on optimism that tax reform and other Trump policies would lift the economy. ""The market got a little hyped up initially. My sense is it's gone too far the other way,"" Schumacher said. Stock analysts say the equity market could see a pullback at some point, but few expect a sharp selloff this summer. Certainly, the stock market does not appear to fear a recession. ""At some point, the bond market is going to be right because you have narrow leadership. At some point, those five or six stocks are going to run out of steam,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. Amazon.com, Netflix, and Alphabet, among others, have been powering ahead, helping to pull the stock indexes along with them. ""It's hard to pass the leadership from tech to the broader market until we get some answers on health care, and then it's going to be tax reform."" Hogan sees a very shallow sell-off of less than five percent. Analysts have said the 'Trump trades' related to tax reform and infrastructure have been priced out of specific stocks and sectors, but it's harder to determine how much the broader idea of a reflation trade is still boosting the overall market. The markets began factoring out a big pop from Trump policy in March when the first version of the health-care bill failed to reach a vote on Capitol Hill. As investigations heated up around the Trump campaign and Russia in recent weeks, optimism for any of Trump's growth policies seeing adoption this year faded even more. The 10-year Treasury yield Wednesday slid to 2.19 percent, near the low end of a tight range it has traded in since the start of the year. The yield was at a low of 1.85 percent just before Trump won the election. The 10-year yield has gotten ever closer to the 2-year note yield, at 1.27 percent Wednesday. The convergence of the two — or flattening of the yield curve — is also a negative warning, and can be viewed as predicting concern about a weaker economy or that the Fed is raising rates too quickly. The 2-year yield directly reflects expectations for Fed rate-hiking activity. ""If you're constructive on bonds, at least in the near term, that likely implies a pretty high chance of a recession starting in the middle of next year, and we're not of that view. But that's really what the market is telling you,"" said Cabana. The market is signaling a period of subdued growth with risks skewed to the downside, he said. ""I've not gotten that sense that the bond market, the individuals, have a recession starting next year as a main point in their central scenario, but again that's what the levels would tell you, and in order for bond yields to go much lower from here, you've got to think the Fed is going to stop hiking,"" said Cabana, adding the market expects to see a very slow pace of rate hikes going forward. ""You're either in a recession or a prolonged period of slow increases in the fed funds target rate. … That's not clearly what the Fed has indicated, and I think a lot of this has to do with different perception of fiscal policy and the underlying outlook for the U.S."" Cabana said he expects the Fed to raise rates in June and September before pausing to begin unwinding its balance sheet at the end of the year. Fed policy is also affecting both markets differently, according to Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Lindsey Group. ""It's the belief the Fed is going to raise rates, and it's a clear difference of opinion,"" said  Boockvar. He said the bond market is questioning whether the economy can handle rate hikes while the stock market is not. ""The bond market knows more often than not the Fed tightening cycle leads to recession. That's what history shows. I'm not saying it's going there but people in the bond market know that's where it could lead."" Boockvar noted that there are some telltale signs that the economy is cooling. For instance, car sales have peaked, commercial real estate is topping out, and lending is down, he said. The disparity between the two markets can also be explained by the fact that low bond yields have driven investors to equities and other assets that yield more. ""Nasdaq going higher is led by a handful of stocks that are growing agnostic of the economy. The bond market looks more like the Russell 2000 and the Dow Transports than it looks like the S&P.  If you look at the Transports they're sending the same message as the bond market: 'We're concerned about a slowdown,'"" said Hogan. The Russell 2000 is up just under 1 percent year-to-date, and the Dow Transports are up 1.3 percent. The Nasdaq is up 15.1 percent so far this year, and the S&P 500 is up 7.7 percent. ""You've got a confusing message,"" said Hogan. He said the 10-year yield going lower often also means the market is reacting to geopolitical concerns, like the North Korean missile program, Brexit or the Italian election. Schumacher said the markets will be focused on a couple of events in the near future, and that could help resolve some market divergence. ""You have the employment report (Friday), the U.K. election on the 8th, and the Fed coming upon the 14th. Those are three things to focus on in the near term,"" he said. ""I think the bond market always thinks the stock market got it wrong, and vice versa,"" Schumacher said. ""The bond market people are a little more in the weeds of the budget than the stock market."" ",Bond market’s recession warning is at odds with stock market near record highs

If we don't get a significant amount of upside in earnings or the second quarter ends up being a little less strong than the first quarter, or if there are people distracted by politics, or there is a little bit of market fatigue, it's possible we are range bound,"" said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock. ""But I have a hard time, from valuation or sentiment perspectives, seeing reasons for a big swoon."" Stocks have moved higher without regard for the type of events that might normally trip up the market. The controversies swirling around President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia; Federal Reserve rate hikes; and a potentially stalled out congressional effort on tax reform are not seen as impediments to the stock market, which could grind slowly higher. ""The magnitude and duration of sell-offs more recently has been very disappointing to the bears,"" said Moore. She said the economic and earnings fundamentals are the bigger catalysts behind the stock market's move. ""Earning are very strong in the first quarter. Companies did a good job of reaffirming or improving on the outlook for 2017,"" Moore said. ""This is really not contingent on significant policy stimulus coming out of D.C. ... People were trying to explain away the pickup in business sentiment after the election with great expectations for tax reform and stimulus. But at this point, management teams are just as aware of the extended delays in this policy reform."" Wednesday is the final trading day of May, and the S&P 500 was on pace for its sixth positive month out of seven and its best-performing month since February. Nasdaq, up 2.6 percent for May so far, was on pace for a seventh month of gains, its best winning streak since May 2013. Seasonally, June stock markets have traded lower just under half the time, but the losses have been minuscule — averaging a 0.005 percent decline in the S&P 500 all the way back to World War II, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""Despite the rhyme, stocks generally just mark time,"" Stovall said of the June swoon. ""June has the second-worst frequency of advances. However, the average price change is basically nonexistent."" June also follows the month of May, which has has often heralded in weakness, and is known for the old adage, ""sell in May."" However, the S&P 500 has gained more than 1.2 percent in May so far and was very near it's all-time high in Tuesday trading. Despite the market's quiet climb higher, some strategists do see risks. China's debt bubble is noted as one, but it's not a new risk. Some strategists say the market could react if Congress looks unlikely to pass tax reform this year, but how much the market is still counting on a plan in 2017 is up for debate. ""Trump came in with high expectations and has done nothing but be a disappointment,"" said investment strategist James Paulsen, formerly with Wells Capital Management. ""The market has no expectation for anything to be done this year. It may be a positive surprise if they actually get something done."" Strategists also say the Federal Reserve could eventually pose a problem for the market if the economic data do not pick up, and the Fed is seen as moving ahead with interest rate hikes in a soft economy. The central bank has forecast two rate increases and expects to begin the process of shrinking its balance sheet this year. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan reiterated that forecast Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" and the market expects the next interest rate hike June 14. ""The thing is there are not a lot of risks out there that are identifiable. If the Fed raises rates, they're boosting them to around 1 percent, and normally in this kind of inflationary environment, we should be at 3.5 percent. So the Fed is being extraordinarily accommodative,"" said Stovall. Strategists say the market has also been lifted by strong U.S. earnings growth and a synchronized global economic recovery, but it is at a high valuation level and that could keep the market from rising much more. ""As retail flows continue to move out of U.S. equities and into international equities, led byEurope and EM, SPX [S&P 500] upside following a stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings seasonappears capped heading into the historically quieter summer months,"" wrote Julian Emanuel, UBS equities and derivatives strategist, in a note. One concern for the market has been the concentrated gains in a handful of tech names. The S&P 500 is up more than 7.5 percent for the year so far,  but the ""FANG"" stocks are up much more than that. One of those, Amazon. com broke the psychological $1,000 mile marker Tuesday, and is up 33 percent for the year so far. The other stocks in ""FANG"" are Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet, parent of Google. ""FANG is leading the market, but in general the proportion of the market being led by technology is not greater than the normal proportion of the lead sector in other up years. You generally get a third of the performance in the equity market from the strongest sector in a year when the market advances,"" said Moore. Trump could also become a risk if his threats about trade become hard stances, said Paul Christopher, chief international investment strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Christopher is of the view there could be a summer sell-off. He said he expects the market to peak soon, and a catalyst could be disappointment with Washington on the policy front, the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, or a political unknown. ""We think the market is ignoring the valuations. The fact we expect more Fed rate hikes, and into 2018. At some point they have to be dealt with,"" he said. ""Maybe we just readjust back to more average P/Es."" The price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 was 17.6 for 12-month forward earnings. There are several potential catalysts on the horizon for markets Wednesday, as investors wait for Friday's jobs report. Chicago PMI is scheduled to be reported at 9:45 a.m. ET; pending home sales are at 10 a.m.; and the Fed's Beige Book on the economy is at 2 p.m. Watch: Stock pickers paradise?

Arjun Kharpal,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"Lenovo, the world's largest maker of personal computers, is expecting profitability in its smartphone and server business where it has made large acquisitions, in the ""near future"", the company's finance chief told CNBC on Thursday. The Chinese technology giant reported $9.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending March 31, a 5 percent year-on-year rise. For the full-year, however, revenue fell 4 percent to $43 billion. Meanwhile, profit for the full year was $535 million, a rise from the $128 million loss recorded in the previous fiscal year. Lenovo's PC business, which represents around 70 percent of its total revenue, saw unit shipments decline 1 percent, a smaller fall than the overall global PC market which fell 2.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2017, according to Gartner. ""We are always doing our business at a premium to the market,"" Wong Wai Ming, chief financial officer of Lenovo, told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. But in the past few years, the company has tried to expand its presence in two areas: smartphones and data centers. In 2014, Lenovo bought Motorola's phone business from Google, and that same year purchased IBM's x86 server business. Lenovo's mobile and data center businesses have been struggling as the company looks to integrate the acquisitions to create synergies. But in the mobile business it saw an operational loss of $566 million, widening from the $469 million loss in the year before. And the data center group recorded a loss of $343 million. Still, Wong said that the company is seeing improvements in both businesses. ""(The) smartphone business is different from PC likewise server business is different from PC, so it will take time for us to really understand the business, build a team, build the infrastructure and grow from there,"" Wong told CNBC. ""I think we are very very confident that this will come in the near future."" The CFO cited improvements in its smartphone business with the Motorola brand globally. ""Nothing will happen overnight, but we are very very confident that the two businesses … will become a profit engine in the near future."" The CNBC Global CFO Council is an elite group of chief financial officers from public and private companies. Before Ken Moelis founded his own investment bank, he was Donald Trump's banker. The Moelis & Co. founder recently spoke about how the art of the deal has changed — and the big debt problem he thinks will soon hit the market. Tesla tapped Telstra CFO Robyn Denholm, already a Tesla independent board member, as its new chairman. Critics say she will be a rubber stamp for Musk; others that she may be able to counterbalance his impulsive ways. Denholm, who has served on Tesla's board since 2014, will be leaving her role as CFO of Telstra to focus on Tesla full time.

Annie Pei,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"Bill Stone believes that while investors are focused on what awaits President Donald Trump now that he's returned to Washington, the market rally will still continue, thanks to strong fundamentals that he expects will carry through the year. In another week in which the S&P 500 Index hit new all-time highs, PNC Asset Management's global chief investment strategist laid out the factors that he expects can send the market even higher. On Friday, markets slipped slightly after seeing one straight week of gains. ""We'll still likely see good [earnings] growth rates for the rest of the year,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" In addition, the U.S. economy ""is probably going to be picking up here."" First quarter economic growth ""was very weak, but we think you're going to end up with 2.4 percent growth rate GDP in the U.S.,"" he added. And thanks to the positive economic outlook coming out of the U.S., Stone also thinks that part of the reason why stocks will keep rallying is the Federal Reserve. As a result of expected rate hikes, the market has already priced in tighter monetary policy for this year, which should mean higher returns for investors. Last week's Fed policy setting minutes essentially cemented the probability of a rate hike in Jun. Stone told CNBC it's not out of the question that the Fed could raise again in December. But until then, Stone says that it's safe for investors to keep getting into stocks. He mentioned that he sees the tech sector ""broadening out"" for even more upside in the future, implying that more record highs could be ahead, thanks to big-cap tech.

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The banking industry has come a long way over the past several years. As a whole, banks are well capitalized and have asset portfolios without unreasonable levels of risk. In addition, banks are well positioned to capitalize if President Donald Trump successfully creates economic growth and slashes banking regulations. If you want to invest in the retail side of banking, while limiting your exposure to revenue streams such as trading and investment banking, here are some stocks that could be great additions to your portfolio in 2017, all of which pay nice dividends. Company Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $53.26 2.9% U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) $51.88 2.2% Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) $24.62 2.3% Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG) $34.88 1.6% Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) $46.76 3.8% Stock prices and dividend yields are current as of May 15, 2017. All dividends are rounded to the nearest 10th of a percent. Wells Fargo left a bad taste in investors' mouths following the infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal, and rightfully so. However, since news of the scandal broke, the bank has underperformed the rest of the banking sector by a wide margin, and I think investors may be overlooking the good things about Wells Fargo. There has certainly been some fallout from the scandal, but I don't think any of it will be permanent. What should be permanent, however, is Wells Fargo's disciplined risk management, efficiency, and profitability, which have been consistently better than the rest of the ""big four"" U.S. banks. However, you get what you pay for. The bank runs one of the most profitable and efficient banking operations in the U.S., even better than Wells Fargo in most respects. Plus, the bank's market share has grown nicely over the past decade or so – after all, it's common for the strongest companies in a given industry to emerge from a crisis even stronger than they went in, and U.S. Bancorp is an excellent example of this. In fact, as my colleague John Maxfield pointed out, the bank's book value has soared by 136% over the past decade or so, with the bulk of the gain coming after the crisis. Image source: Getty Images. Fifth Third Bancorp is a highly profitable bank that could perform exceptionally well in a rising-rate environment, and it expects net interest income to rise by 4%-5% in 2017 as a result of interest rates climbing, with floating-rate loans making up 57% of the bank's total. Additionally, the company has done an excellent job of repurchasing stock in recent years to help boost shareholder value, and has done a good job of controlling expenses and building up its capital ratios. Since its 2014 IPO, Citizens Financial Group has done an excellent job of improving efficiency and profitability, and its investors have done quite well as a result. The bank's efficiency ratio and return on tangible equity have both improved to the point where they are about to surpass key industry benchmarks, and the stock has jumped by nearly 60% in less than three years as a public company. As far as retail banking goes, Citizens has built up a strong market share in niche markets like education refinance loans and debt-consolidation loans. It has also heavily invested in technology, has dramatically increased its mortgage staff, and has recently partnered with financial technology company SigFig to provide a robo-advisory service to Citizens' wealth management clients. You can read a more thorough discussion of Citizens here, but so far, it looks like the bank is growing strong and could continue to do so. I own Toronto-Dominion Bank, better known as TD Bank, in my own portfolio, and it's perhaps my single favorite bank stock in the market. Canadian banks have historically done a much better job of avoiding excessive risk and the periodic sector crashes that have happened in the U.S. In fact, over the past decade (which includes the financial crisis), TD Bank has generated average total returns of 10.4% -- more than four times the North American big-bank average of 2.5%.

    5 Top Dividend Stocks in Retail Banking -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With the stock market hovering near all-time highs, it can be a smart idea to think a little defensively in your portfolio. However, that doesn't mean you need to give up your growth potential if the market keeps rising. Blue chip dividend stocks have historically performed better than their non-dividend counterparts during tough times, and many have outperformed the overall market over long time periods. With that in mind, here are five of the largest dividend payers in the market, all of which pay out more than $5 billion per year to shareholders and could make excellent additions to your portfolio now. Company Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Annual Dividends Paid ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) $81.55 3.8% $12.9 billion AT&T (NYSE:T) $38.12 5.1% $12.0 billion Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $52.41 2.9% $7.6 billion Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) $87.25 3.2% $7.2 billion International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) $152.49 3.9% $5.6 billion Data source: CNBC and author's calculations. Stock prices, dividend yields, and annualized dividend rates are current as of May 29, 2017. Annual dividends paid are calculated by multiplying the current quarterly dividend rate by four, and then multiplying by the number of outstanding shares. Integrated oil giant ExxonMobil is one of the largest companies in the world, so it should be no surprise that it's also one of the biggest dividend payers. One major reason to like Exxon is for the diversification of its business. The company has operations in offshore and onshore oil drilling, chemicals, refining, and more. And while much of Exxon's revenue suffers when oil prices fall, some areas of the business actually tend to do better. For example, as my Foolish colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out, 2015 was a terrible year for Exxon's drilling operations, but the company's refining business more than doubled its profits. As far as the dividend goes, Exxon is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats index, having raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years, and pays 3.8% as of this writing. Considering the company's financial strength and profitability, the streak shouldn't be in jeopardy anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. Telecom giant AT&T is a favorite stock among dividend-seeking investors, and for good reason -- its 5.1% yield is among the best you'll find from such a stable company. And like Exxon, AT&T has a streak of consecutive dividend increases that exceeds three decades. There are a few good reasons to like AT&T over the long term. For one thing, AT&T has a pending acquisition of Time Warner. That will add all of the latter's content, helping AT&T to keep building a moat around its business, and allowing it to continue to bundle more and more services together -- potentially capturing market share from rivals such as Verizon and Sprint. Wells Fargo has significantly underperformed the rest of the banking sector over the past nine months or so, as a result of the now-infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal. This was certainly a major misstep by the bank, and the fallout from the scandal is obvious. The bank's non-interest income has fallen significantly, expenses are up, and the bank's normally strong efficiency ratio has suffered. Having said that, I believe that the effects of the scandal will be temporary. Wells Fargo remains one of the most well-run banks in the world, in terms of risk management, efficiency of operations, and profitability. The bank has consistently delivered better returns on equity and assets than its rivals, while maintaining a relatively low-risk asset portfolio. Consumer product giant Procter & Gamble's strength lies in its vast portfolio of well-known brand names, including Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Downy, just to name a few. To be clear, there certainly are some challenges facing Procter & Gamble going forward. For example, discounted and subscription-based razor competitors such as Dollar Shave Club have cost the Gillette brand market share in recent years. However, the long-term outlook is still strong for P&G shareholders. The company has proactively shed non-core brands to focus on its biggest winners, and has done an excellent job of controlling costs and boosting margins. Finally, Procter & Gamble has one of the longest streaks of consecutive dividend increases in the market at 60 years and counting. It was recently disclosed that Warren Buffett had unloaded about 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in International Business Machines, better known as IBM. Buffett said that the company was facing strong competition, and therefore he had valued its stock ""somewhat downward."" However, don't be too quick to abandon IBM -- Buffett still owns more than 50 million shares of the tech giant, and the central reasons Buffett bought IBM in the first place still apply. For one thing, IBM still has great relationships with large organizations, which not only provide stability to its revenue, but also give the company a strong base on which to grow with new product developments. The business also has ""stickiness,"" meaning that it would cost its customers a lot of money to choose a new provider for the integrated solutions (hardware, software, and services) that IBM provides.

    5 Dividend Stocks That Pay Out Over $5 Billion a Year -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett is known as one of the best stock pickers of all time, and many of the stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio have performed extremely well for the company. In fact, over the past year alone, nine of Berkshire's stocks have generated nearly $20 billion in returns. As of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly four dozen stocks, but there's a massive variety when it comes to the size of these investments, ranging from just a few million dollars to more than $30 billion for Kraft Heinz, Berkshire's largest stock investment. Image source: The Motley Fool. Because of this, some of Berkshire's stocks have the potential to contribute more to Berkshire's bottom line than others. With that in mind, here are the stocks that generated the most gains for Berkshire over the past year. Company Shares One-Year Performance Stock Price Gain Dividends Received Total Return Bank of America 700 million 59.1% $6.08 billion N/A $6.08 billion Kraft Heinz 325.6 million 9.9% $2.73 billion $781.4 million $3.51 billion Wells Fargo 479.7 million 7.9% $1.87 billion $729.1 million $2.60 billion American Express 151.6 million 18.9% $1.86 billion $189.5 million $2.05 billion Charter Communications 9.44 million 44.1% $950.6 million N/A $950.6 million U.S. Bancorp 85.1 million 22.5% $809.5 million $93.6 million $903.1 million Coca-Cola 400 million 1.5% $264.4 million $568 million $832.4 million Goldman Sachs 10.96 million 42% $725.6 million $28.5 million $754.1 million Data source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC filings. Performance is as of 5/24/17. To be clear, all the gains listed in the ""stock price gain"" column are just on paper at this point. Berkshire doesn't actually get the cash until it sells. It's also worth mentioning that these aren't necessarily Berkshire's best performing stocks -- in fact, with a gain of just 1.5% over the past year, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) underperformed the S&P 500 by a significant margin. However, the stock is a dividend machine, and Berkshire owns a lot of shares, so it still had one of the best returns in the portfolio. It shouldn't come as much of a surprise that more than half of the chart is made up of financial-sector companies, as the sector was the best performer after November's election. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a relatively small investment in Berkshire's portfolio, but a massive 42% gain catapulted it into being one of the best performers. It's also important to note that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the stock that added the most value to Berkshire's portfolio, isn't actually owned by Berkshire -- not yet, anyway. Instead, Berkshire owns warrants, which give it the right to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America for $5 billion, or about $7.14 each. Buffett has said that he fully intends to exercise the warrants at some point before they expire, but for the time being, the intrinsic value of the warrant rises along with Bank of America's stock price. You may have noticed that there are only eight stocks in the chart, not nine as the headline would suggest. I've deliberately left out Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as it's a relatively new investment for Berkshire, and it hasn't owned the bulk of its Apple position for a year just yet. Berkshire's Apple stake was initiated in the first quarter of 2016, and was relatively small at that time, at 10 million shares. Since then, Buffett has increased Berkshire's stake to 133 million shares, and the position is definitely profitable by more than a billion dollars, so it's worth mentioning here. And for the record, the stocks in the chart collectively returned about $17.7 billion, so the $20 billion figure in the introduction came from combining these returns with Apple's gains. ","
      
    9 Stocks That Made Warren Buffett Billions Over the Past Year -- The Motley Fool

Ryan Vlastelica,06012017,MarketWatch,05252017,"Published: June 1, 2017 11:19 a.m. ET A portfolio diversified with alternative investments performs better, Wells Fargo writes By Looking for an alternative to stocks and bonds in your investment portfolio? Have you considered the investment category of alternatives? Concerns have been growing about the valuation of both U.S. equities and fixed income, with famed investor Marc Faber recently warning that “there is a bubble in everything.” Meanwhile, Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners, recently told MarketWatch that market participants should consider cash. Read more: With stocks and bonds looking pricey, investors see little that’s appetizing Don’t miss: Why one hedge-fund titan is bracing for ‘all hell to break loose’ in the stock market A problem with cash, however, is that it basically yields nothing. That makes it a safe choice, but not one that can appreciably grow in the event markets turn lower. Alternative investments—which can be accessed through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds—are seen as having little correlation with the broader market, and because of this, such investments “may reduce a portfolio’s volatility by improving its diversification,” according to Wells Fargo. Alternative funds, according to Wells Fargo’s definition, “include asset classes, strategies, and structures that are often different than traditional investments.” They also “employ hedging and arbitrage techniques using long and short positions, leverage, derivatives, private investments, and investments in a variety of global markets.” Read about merger arbitrage ETFs here “Short” positions in an investment are essentially a bet that it will fall, while leverage uses borrowed funds in an attempt to magnify market gains (or losses). Derivatives investments can include the purchasing of options and futures. In a note to clients, Wells suggested a “moderate growth and income” portfolio that is 26% allocated to alternative investments and real assets. Another 40% of the portfolio is in stocks, while 31% are in fixed income. (The remaining 3% is in cash alternatives.) “Adding alternative investments to a traditional portfolio of long-only stocks and bonds has historically increased returns and decreased risk,” the investment bank wrote. Alternative funds tend to be more expensive than the more plain vanilla stocks and bond funds that most experts agree should comprise the primary building blocks of an investor’s portfolio. Many of them are also seen as riskier. Hedge funds, for example, have long underperformed the broader market, while also charging higher fees. However, that period of underperformance occurred during a multiyear bull market in equity prices, an environment that analysts say is particularly difficult to outperform in, particularly when fees are taken into account. If markets do turn lower, analysts say that actively managed portfolios—where the components are selected by an individual, in contrast to index funds, which passively track an benchmark like the S&P 500 —have a higher-than-average chance of outperforming. On this thesis, Deutsche Bank recently upgraded a pair of hedge-fund strategies, saying that “the environment has clearly improved for stock picking.” The bank raised its view on equity-market-neutral investing strategies to positive, while the category of long/short equity strategies was upgraded to neutral. The category of alternative ETFs is small but growing. It currently has about $5.7 billion in assets, according to FactSet data, but $1.2 billion of that has gone into the category in 2017. Many of the most popular alternative ETFs give investors an opportunity to invest in volatility-based products.

                                   , Morgan Stanley won’t pay brokers to recommend Vanguard’s funds. What goes around, comes around. Coincidentally, this development arrives on the heels of Morgan Stanley’s settlement with Massachusetts securities regulators over allegations that the company ran an improper sales contest to boost their securities-based (margin) loan book. It is common knowledge that margin loans are one of the most profitable brokerage products, so at least there is some form of perverse logic at work here. Not so with the Vanguard decision. Does this sound familiar? It should. In 1995, one of Morgan Stanley’s acquisitions, Dean Witter, folded under intense media pressure and ended the practice of “differentiated commissions” (paying brokers higher commissions to steer clients into proprietary mutual funds). The details of these two breaches of client trust differ, but the core behavior is identical — distorting investor advice through ethically questionable compensation schemes. Morgan Stanley is hardly alone. Just two examples: Wells Fargo

The list of instances where banks and brokers have placed their interests before their clients is both impressive and depressing. But I shouldn’t really be surprised, as I witnessed with increasing dismay these practices occurring with accelerating frequency during a 30-year career in the investment business. (And I am not surprised that these same firms oppose adopting a fiduciary standard for brokers.) I eventually felt compelled to abandon the traditional broker-dealer world to join an independent registered investment adviser, The Caprock Group. Brokerage firms have a long history of pushing product, as investment banking, capital markets, sales and trading businesses each function as competing, stand-alone profit centers within larger organizations. In concert, they manufacture products which are then distributed to customers of the firms. The primary source of revenue for each of these profit centers? Those same customers. No amount of disclosure can entirely mitigate such misaligned incentives. Read: Still wondering what the fiduciary rule is? You’re not alone Perhaps the best example of this dysfunction is what is known as “open architecture” — terminology used by many firms to imply impartiality. But in reality their platforms are open only to investment managers willing to pay annual pay-to-play fees ranging from $250,000 to more than $1 million. Bank ownership adds yet another layer of potential conflict as firms squeeze ever more revenue from existing clients by cross selling them everything from checking accounts to credit cards, regardless of whether doing so is in the client’s best interest. As a result, brokers and bankers are accountable to their firm’s revenue goals and may be forbidden to advise on assets not held at the firm — even if those might be the best solutions for clients. It is critical to understand how much you are paying, to whom, and for what. The problem is that fees are often intentionally opaque. For example, UBS’s 2017 fee disclosure document is 33 pages long; Morgan Stanley’s runs 26 pages. Complicating matters is that many advisers simply dodge the question (or, worse, don’t know the answers). So how does an investor pierce the fog? Essentially, there are two types of fees. One is for advice. The other is for products. Both are rational. But both must be fully disclosed and understood. Brokers and bankers must outline every cost and expense borne by each investment they recommend. And if they recommend credit cards, margin loans, insurance products, or structured notes, they must both explain the investment rationale and justify the additional expense. Why? Because the impact of fees on performance is significant. A 1.5% fee difference over 20 years on a $1 million investment earning 6% is more than $700,000, consuming almost three-quarters of the value of the initial investment. This is the age of transparency. Every investor has a right to clearly understand the fees and conflicts of interest that are present in the management of their investments. Every investor should insist that they be advised by a fiduciary. Every investor needs an advocate who can source, vet, and recommend the most efficient and cost-effective solutions available to help them achieve their goals. Investors don’t need to be sold. They need to be advised. And they need to know that their adviser’s interests are aligned with their own. In fact, aligned interests are now table stakes in the financial services world. From there, investment acumen, sophistication, capacity for independent thought and action, and a relentless fiduciary ethic are what divides great advisers from the rest. And every investor has the right to a great adviser. Greg Mech is a managing director at The Caprock Group. ",Financial advice is more about trust than money - MarketWatch
Ryan Vlastelica,06012017,MarketWatch,05252017,"Published: May 30, 2017 8:12 a.m. ET One investor sees cash as the answer in this environment By For years, a key driver for U.S. stocks has been the idea that, no matter what potential headwinds there may be, they were more attractive than bonds. But now, with major equity indexes at records and valuations stretched by many metrics, that argument has become less compelling. Adding to the uncertain environment for market participants, bond yields remain low by historical standards, meaning that the primary alternative to equities doesn’t look very alluring either, offering investors few appealing options. “There’s been an expression for stocks in markets: TINA. It stands for, ‘There Is No Alternative.’ I think the most appropriate expression for this market is CITA. Cash Is The Alternative,” said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners. “I’m the polar opposite of Mae West,” he added. “West said she liked two types of men: domestic and foreign. I don’t like stocks or bonds.” West was an outspoken Depression-era actress and comedian. Don’t miss: Fear of a 40% selloff pushed this portfolio manager to record low stockholdings Such views are becoming increasingly common. At the end of the first quarter, Vanguard said that its outlook “for global stocks and bonds remains the most guarded it has been in ten years, given that interest rates are unlikely to rise substantially and that current valuations are stretched.” For fixed income, the asset-management giant forecast returns in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%, which it said was “positive but muted.” For equities, it forecast a range of 5% to 8%, which it described as “still guarded, but not bearish.” Historically, global bonds have returned 5.4% a year, based on Vanguard data looking at the period between 1926 and 2016, while global stocks have returned 10% a year over the same period. The current economic environment does have some elements in its favor, including a strong labor market, investors are increasingly seeing warning signs. Economic growth has been tepid, while expectations for corporate earnings have been coming down. Stocks have done well regardless, with the S&P 500

By one measure, prices are at their highest level since 2004. In another potential warning sign, the nearly uninterrupted rise of stocks has been matched by a steady increase in investors using borrowed money to make investments on Wall Street. Indeed, total margin debt hit a record $549.2 billion in April, according to the most recent data from the New York Stock Exchange, up 2.3% from March, and up more than 20% year-over-year. A similar leverage trend has played out among the smart-money set. Hedge-fund leverage reached its highest level since the financial crisis, according to a recent Goldman Sachs research note to clients. “Net leverage is now at 73%, roughly matching the post-crisis highs set in 2013, while gross exposures have leapt to 230%, well above any levels in recent years,” the investment bank wrote. “Short interest as a percent of S&P 500 market cap remained at 1.9%, the lowest level in five years.” Experts disagree on whether high levels of leverage are inherently bearish, but some view it as a sign of complacency, particularly given the low short interest—which indicates people betting on a market decline—and low volatility.

Read:  Stop! This is NOT like the dot-com bubble... it’s much worse, according to this chart Wells Fargo recently downgraded its view on large-cap stocks, in part due to concerns about equity valuations. “When compared with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the S&P 500 Index’s earnings yield now is more in line with historical averages than has been the case in recent years,” Wells Fargo wrote in a note to clients. “With U.S. interest rates expected to rise, the relative attractiveness of U.S. large-cap stocks versus Treasury bonds may deteriorate as we move through the balance of 2017.” According to the following Wells Fargo chart, stocks remain slightly more attractive than bonds by this measure. However, the degree to which this is true has dropped by about half over the past year. “It also is important to keep in mind that we are most likely moving into a period during which Treasury yields will rise slowly,” wrote the team of Wells Fargo analysts, led by Stuart Freeman, the bank’s co-head of global equity strategy, who forecasts that stubbornly low Treasury yield will rise in 2018. “Thus, the markets are moving toward environments within which they will slowly face greater competition from other financial-vehicle returns.” The U.S. 10 Year Treasury Note

Seabreeze’s Kass estimated that stocks were “more than 10% overvalued,” though “I prefer to think of it as there being a three to four times multiple of risk versus reward.” Bonds, he added, were “materially overvalued.” “The 10-year yield is typically in line with the nominal GDP, which is real GDP plus inflation,” he explained. “If you assume 2% inflation and 2.5% growth, nominal GDP would be 4.5%. Instead, the 10-year is at 2.26%. That gives you a sense of how overvalued bonds are, relative to historical averages.” ","With stocks and bonds looking pricey, investors see little that’s appetizing - MarketWatch"
Howard Gold,06012017,MarketWatch,05252017,"Published: May 25, 2017 9:23 a.m. ET Soft data say buy, buy, buy, yet the hard data say not so fast By The election of Donald J. Trump as president in November unleashed a wave of confidence among businesses, consumers, and investors that prosperity was just around the corner. This so-called “soft” data, based mostly on sentiment surveys, point to a surging economy in which 3% GDP growth—which we haven’t seen consistently since the 1990s—was within reach. Consider: •The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index stood at 97 in April, just off its 13-year high of 98.5 set in January. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index at 120.3 in April also remains strong, though it slid from recent highs in February and March. •The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index, which polls CEOs of the nation’s largest corporations on their expectations for sales and hiring over the next six months, showed its biggest increase in the first quarter since the fourth quarter of 2009. •The NFIB Index of Small Business Optimism also slipped a bit last month, but April was the sixth consecutive month for high optimism, “a hot streak not seen since 1983,” the NFIB reported. •The Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index hit a 16-year high in the first quarter at +126. That’s the most optimistic investors have been since November 2000, when the index stood at +130 (although Gallup points out that the surge has been driven largely by Republicans, whose confidence is now 209 points higher than it was in the third quarter of 2016, something this column noted in March). •The Dow Jones Industrial Average

If you look only at “soft” data and sentiment, the economy and markets are in Nirvana, Valhalla, and Paradise combined. Back in the real world of “hard” data, however, things aren’t quite so great. •Retail sales, where consumers translate all that positive sentiment into cash purchases, rose 0.4% in April, less than expected, after a couple of soft months. “Consumer confidence may be through the roof but retail sales, and consumer spending in general, have been stuck on the ground,” Econoday observed. •Sales of new cars and trucks fell in April for the fourth consecutive month, and inventories are piling up at dealers. That inevitably leads to “incentives,” i.e., deep discounts, which cut into auto makers’ profits. So, GM is planning to lay off 4,000 employees and Ford is cutting 10% of its workforce, including former CEO Mark Fields. “There are growing signs that America’s car market is running out of gas,” The Economist wrote. Read: Existing-home sales stall in April as tight supply pushes properties to record low time on the market •Banks are scaling back lending. Commercial & industrial loans outstanding fell to around $2.1 trillion earlier this month, below November’s peak and marking the seventh consecutive month of no growth in these key loans. Every time that has happened since the 1960s, “a recession was either in progress or would start soon,” wrote Wolf Richter on the Wolf Street blog. He called it “a big red flag…Something is seriously wrong.” •And guess which trend from the 2000s is making a big comeback? No, it’s not Crocs, Segways, Paris Hilton or low-rise jeans. It’s household debt. Last week the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that total U.S. household debt had hit $12.7 trillion, a record. True, mortgage debt comprises 68% of the total, vs. 73% in the 2000s, but student loan debt is soaring, at $1.3 trillion. And unlike with a mortgage, you can’t just send your diploma back to the lender. That means “more Americans are shouldering a type of debt that could weigh them down for the rest of their lives,” the New York Times wrote. So, what are we to make of all this? Stocks have moved up based on two things—a big earnings recovery and hopes the Trump administration would cut taxes, slash regulations and build big infrastructure projects. The earnings recovery is still intact, but the Trump agenda is floundering amid Congressional gridlock and the investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, which is sucking the oxygen from the room. Also, we’ve seen several economic indicators topping out: Housing sales are at decade highs, auto sales peaked a few months ago, and unemployment, at 4.4%, is near a cyclical low, with full employment on the horizon or already here. In an economic recovery and bull market that are eight years old, there’s not much room for improvement. I think we’re in the final innings of both. And the S&P 500’s valuation, at 17.5 times projected 2017 earnings, is pretty high. So when the soft data say buy, buy, buy, and the hard data say not so fast, I’ll trust the hard data.

He is also the chairman of the management team for the Haverford Quality Growth Stock Fund

In that scenario, the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a glacial pace.” “The stock market has already shown it can perform in this environment,” he said. “That said, we also have to recognize that this has been a very strong bull market. It is unlikely over the next three years that we will have the kind of returns we have had,” he added.

Smith said Haverford Trust’s “quality growth” strategy for clients, as well as that of the Haverford Quality Growth Stock Fund, is to “focus on large, financially strong, dividend-paying companies, with an emphasis on dividend growth.” The fund’s strategy is meant to limit its downside during weak markets, while capturing “typically 85%” of the broad market’s upside during periods of strength, Smith said. So it’s no surprise that the fund has underperformed during the eight-year bull market. Here are the fund’s returns compared to those of the S&P 500, through May 25: Smith is very enthusiastic about E.I.

                                   latest quarterly sales were below the FactSet consensus. Still, analysts are bullish about the off-price sector in the face of broader retail struggles. Cowen analysts base their $10-billion projection on the company’s free cash flow. “Using Burlington’s current free cash flow multiple of 19X on our 2021 free cash flow estimate equates to a $10 billion market cap and a 40% upside from current levels,” analysts wrote in a Tuesday note. Cowen rates Burlington shares outperform. Cowen’s bullish forecast and price target increase to $110 from $103 comes after a first-quarter earnings report in which Burlington reported sales of $1.35 billion, up from $1.29 billion last year but below the $1.36 billion FactSet consensus. Adjusted earnings per share were 79 cents, exceeding the 70-cent FactSet consensus. Cowen sees reason to be optimistic after management said on last Thursday’s earnings call that it will enhance assortments where the business is underpenetrated. For example, the company ended 2016 with the home category at 12.4% of sales, according to Chief Executive Thomas Kingsbury, but the company is aiming for 20%. “In addition to building our penetration of highly recognizable national brands across many areas of the home, we’ll look to grow housewares by increasing our investment in key entertaining categories, reshaping our cookware and bakeware assortments, and maximizing opportunities in kitchen storage and organization,” said Kingsbury, according to a FactSet transcript. Womens’ clothing ended last year at 24.4% penetration, which Kingsbury said is below the 30% penetration of peers. The company plans to invest in plus-size apparel and sportswear, an area where the company is seeing growth.

Wells Fargo maintained its outperform rating, but raised its price target to $109 from $103.

Even with that sales result, Håkon Helgesen, GlobalData Retail analyst, said it shows just how much apparel is struggling. “As with TJX, our data show that Ross suffered from more customer sharing during the first quarter as excessive discounting in the market persuaded some shoppers to spend more elsewhere,” Helgesen wrote after Ross reported earlier this month. “Fortunately, there was little erosion in customer numbers which suggests that Ross has not fallen out of favor with consumers – it just has to work a bit harder in getting the shoppers it does have to spend more.” Off-price stores’ ability to overcome the competition applies even to Amazon.com Inc.

Still, “Amazon has significant overlap with every retailer we surveyed,” the note said. Cowen said that while department-store shoppers are most often visiting other department stores, the off-price sector has accelerated, “indicating share loss for department stores.” Off-price stores are grabbing younger and wealthier shoppers, which makes their demographics more favorable than department stores.

 ,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday said it is barring legal settlements in federal investigations that include donating funds to community organizations or other third-party groups, rather than paying those directly harmed by the wrongdoing or involved in the cases. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that settlement payments must be directed to victims impacted by the defendants’ actions and then to the federal government. The change could impact banks and other corporations, and marks the latest action by the Republican Trump administration to end policies from the previous Democratic Obama administration. Such agreements were a feature of several U.S. settlements with banks following the 2008 financial crisis. Under former President Barack Obama, the Justice Department aimed to hold banks accountable for shoddy securities that contributed to the U.S. housing market collapse. From 2013 to 2016, the department reached $46 billion in settlements with U.S. banks that in part directed funds to approved housing aid and other related groups. “In recent years the Department of Justice has sometimes required or encouraged defendants to make these payments to third parties as a condition of settlement,” Sessions said a statement. “We are ending this practice and ensuring that settlement funds are only used to compensate victims, redress harm, and punish and deter unlawful conduct.” Representatives for the banks could not be immediately reached. Sessions, in a one-page memo dated Monday, told the nation’s 94 U.S. attorneys they could not make any agreements in civil or criminal cases “that directs or provides for a payment or loan to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute.” Sessions’ new policy “is ill-advised and ignores the tens of thousands of families who were helped by housing service providers across the country in the wake of the financial crisis,” said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman was co-chair of a working group that investigated misconduct in the pooling and sale of mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Sessions cited three exceptions to the new policy: payments or loans that directly aim to address harm such as to the environment or official corruption; legal or other professional services from the case; and restitution, forfeiture and other payments required by law. The memo could ensure “violators won’t be required to support development of low emission vehicles to compensate for illegal pollution from the dirty engines they designed,” he said. ","

 ,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI chief, corporate lawyer Christopher Wray, would likely face conflicts of interest at the agency due to his defense work for many big companies and be forced to step aside from some investigations, legal ethics experts said on Wednesday. While he spent many years as a government attorney earlier in his career, Wray for the past 12 years has been a white- collar defense lawyer with the Atlanta-based firm of King & Spalding and is currently head of its government investigations practice. “If there are investigations of a client he’d need to recuse himself,” Steven Lubet, a legal ethics professor at Northwestern University, said. At the firm, Wray, a graduate of Yale University and its  law school, defended Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceutical unit in a Justice Department probe over off-label use of anti-psychotic drug Risperdal. He also represented Credit Suisse [CSAG.UL] in a major tax prosecution by the Justice Department, which alleged the Swiss financial group helped clients hide offshore accounts from the Internal Revenue Service. According to King & Spalding’s website, clients of the practice led by Wray include AT&T, Deutsche Bank, CVS Caremark, General Motors, Wells Fargo and others. It was not clear if Wray personally represented all of the companies listed. Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University School of law, said professional ethics rules would specifically bar Wray as Federal Bureau of Investigation director from participating in investigations of former clients who shared confidential information with him. In addition, she said, federal regulations would prohibit him from participating in matters opposite King & Spalding for up to two years, though the government can waive those restrictions. Wray would not be the first FBI director to come from the private sector. But he served longer in private practice and has a more extensive corporate client base than other FBI chiefs. James Comey, the man whom Wray would replace, worked as an in-house lawyer for Lockheed Martin and hedge fund group Bridgewater Associates before he became FBI head in 2013. Robert Mueller briefly worked at two law firms between longer stints in government service before becoming FBI director in 2001.Mueller’s conflicts from his post-FBI law career emerged as an issue last month after he was named special counsel to investigate ties between Trump’s campaign team and Russia. Although the FBI is better known for its role fighting violent crime and espionage, the agency is charged with investigating corporate and securities fraud. In recent years, the bureau has launched probes against corporations including GlaxoSmithKline and Takata Corp, which resulted in billions of dollars in criminal penalties. Neither Wray nor King & Spalding responded to requests for comment on potential conflicts. The FBI referred a call on the matter to the Justice Department, which did not respond. Wray served as a federal prosecutor in Atlanta from 1997 to 2001. He then moved to the U.S. Department of Justice, where he eventually became assistant attorney general and head of the criminal division, where he oversaw the fraud investigation of Enron. He joined King & Spalding in 2005. Wray represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who at one time led Trump’s presidential transition, in the Bridgegate scandal. In addition, King & Spalding partner Bobby Burchfield is serving as the ethics adviser for the trust set up in January to isolate the president from the day-to-day operations of Trump businesses. Burchfield praised his partner as having the “highest integrity” and said he saw no conflict between his own work and Wray serving as FBI director. Lubet said he did not think Wray’s conflicts would present an “unsolvable” problem if he becomes FBI director. He noted that investigations could proceed at the field level without the issue arising. “Most decisions are not made at the director level,” he said. In the event the director has to recuse himself, “that’s what deputy directors are for,” said Lubet. ","

 ,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sharp gains in U.S. utilities stocks have driven the safe-haven group to expensive levels, leaving doubts about how far the rally can go as equity investors look elsewhere for returns. Utility stocks, with hefty dividends, are among the sectors considered “bond proxies” and have benefited from declines in longer-dated Treasury yields this year. “We think the utilities are overvalued,” said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments. “They are getting a last tailwind from this drop in yields, but I don’t think that it will persist.” Goldman Sachs, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse have recommended since last year that investors be “underweight” in utilities. Major investment banks generally are preferring sectors that should thrive during economic expansions. “Being in a growth cycle, we would like to take the money out of utilities,” said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. About $800 million flowed out of U.S.-listed mutual and exchange traded funds this year after $4.7 billion in such outflows in the second half of 2016, according to Lipper data.    Still, the S&P 500 utilities sector has climbed 10.5 percent this year, topping an 8.6 percent rise for the overall S&P 500 index. The sector includes power and energy companies such as NextEra Energy, Duke Energy and Dominion Energy and offers an overall dividend yield of 3.4 percent. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which analysts compare to utilities, on Tuesday fell to 2.13 percent. That was the lowest since just after President Donald Trump’s Nov. 8 election stirred expectations of inflation and increased growth that lifted 10-year bond yields. “The basic fundamental reason for the decline in the 10-year yield is that investors are looking for safety,” said Ali Agha, analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. “That is the same dynamic that would lead to them to utilities.” Utilities are trading at a 2 percent premium to the broader market, based on price-to-earnings ratios. Historically, the group has traded at a 7.5 percent discount. Analysts expect virtually no profit growth for the sector this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Results may be hurt as milder weather crimps power demand this year and margins are pressured for companies operating in deregulated power markets, Evercore ISI analyst Greg Gordon said. But the highly regulated nature of most utilities means investors should be able to count on mid-single-digit profit and dividend growth over the next three to five years, Gordon said. (To view a graphic on 'Utilities stocks vs. other ""bond proxy"" sectors' click reut.rs/2swa4nO) Bond-proxy sectors historically have been relied on for a “smoother ride” than the broader market because they rise less in a market rally and fall less in a sell-off, said Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. But that link has weakened recently. “The market is getting increasingly concerned about interest rates and therefore the groups that are normally the most sensitive to rates are becoming hypersensitive,” Golub said. “If we were to see rates go up toward, let’s say 3 percent, on a 10-year bond, I think that these guys have the risk of getting clobbered.” ","

Shoshanna Delventhal,06082017,Investopedia,06012017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Global cigarette and tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) plans to hedge against declining smoking rates and heightened regulatory pressure by moving away from traditional cigarettes and toward a “smokeless” future. At the center of the New York City-based firm’s ambitious growth plan is its branded heat-not-burn tobacco product called iQOS, which is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be marketed as a “reduced risk” product. Analysts led by Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo are bullish on the second wave of the Marlboro maker’s new smoke-free iQOS product, seeing room for more upside in PM shares after already gaining nearly 35% year-to-date (YTD). (See also: Philip Morris Doubles Down on Greece for iQOS.) Herzog highlights the “highly successful rollout of iQOS Platform 1 (“HEETS”), suggesting that investor focus will increasingly shift to Platform 2 (“TEEPS”), scheduled for city testing this year. Wells Fargo expects even greater success from Platform 2 compared to the initial launch due to its “broader appeal to smokers,” since the product looks and feels more like a traditional cigarette, as it is lit with a regular match or lighter. The analysts foresee faster consumption uptake and conversion potential from the new rollout, given established consumer awareness of the brand caused by “the halo effect from Platform 1.” “Once commercialized, we believe Platform 2 has the potential to accelerate PM’s transformational growth as it continues to implement a total portfolio approach toward premiumizing its overall offerings—something we believe the market continues to underappreciate,” wrote Herzog Analysts say preliminary analysis suggests Platform 2 could “increase PM’s fundamental value by an incremental $22/sh (on top of the $35/sh for Platform 1) of which only 30% is reflected in PM’s current valuation.” (See also: Tobacco Industry Earnings Reverse Winning Streak.)

Elizabeth Gurdus,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"When it comes to the time it takes for the market to forgive a company like Wells Fargo for its past transgressions, Jim Cramer says the big bank is not unlike one food chain that also paid its dues. ""My suggestion if you own Wells Fargo, as my charitable trust does? Sorry, but it does take 18 months – kind of Chipotle-like – for the American public to truly forgive. Remember, Wells Fargo's the Chipotle of banking, so don't get too excited because the company's got about a year left in purgatory,"" the ""Mad Money"" host explained. Still, after seeing the stock of Wells Fargo, and a slew of other lesser-known names, rise on Thursday, Cramer was comforted that the rally was broader than many investors seemed to think. ""The rap against this market was that it was all FANG all the time, with a smattering of cloud and some Tesla,"" Cramer said. Today, the rally got broader, much broader, and that has to make you feel a little more confident that stocks can keep going higher, even after this year's first five months of positive returns."" Turning to tech, Cramer spoke with Veeva Systems founder and CEO Peter Gassner, who told the ""Mad Money"" host that his cloud computing company, which serves the life sciences space, has plans to grow its $7 billion addressable market. ""We're always expanding our market, and I also think when you have a really good-quality system, a really good-quality technology that really fits the need, you expand the market,"" Gassner said. The CEO touted the company's latest quarter, which he dubbed a ""30-30 quarter"" because the company grew both revenues and profits by over 30 percent. And although the cloud seems hot now, Gassner said that the breakthrough industry is just getting started. ""We're in the early days of cloud overall. This is a macro-level trend of computing that's going to play out over the next 20, 30 years,"" the CEO said. Then, after cloud application provider Workday reported a strong quarter, CEO Aneel Bhusri gave Cramer a simple reason why companies are choosing his software platform over larger rivals like SAP and Oracle. ""It all comes back to having a great product and taking care of customers,"" Bhusri told Cramer on Thursday. ""Where I think we've really carved out our success has been at the high end of the enterprise, these very large companies where we're really the only proven solution in the marketplace."" A recent Goldman Sachs survey of CIOs showed that IT professionals are turning to Workday at the expense of Oracle and SAP. Bhusri said that with a customer satisfaction rate of roughly 97 percent, it is not hard to see how that factors in to the financial and human capital management company's gain in market share. People may be up in arms about President Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris climate agreement, but Jim Cramer sees one glaring problem. ""There's only so much any president can do unilaterally,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""While Trump supporters may cheer that he made good on a promise to pull out of the agreement, something he campaigned on, there's another part of his agenda that seems to have gone fallow that we care about here. Tax reform. It's fallen by the wayside because it requires the cooperation of Congress. And, at least right now, it almost feels like the White House has given up on Congress."" In fact, what Cramer called Washington's ""legislative logjam"" has thrown a wrench into a number of pro-business policies the Trump administration vowed to enact, including corporate tax reform, repatriation of cash from overseas, and health care reform. Finally, Cramer sat down with Robert Workman, the president and CEO of Now Inc., also known as DistributionNOW, an international oil and gas distribution company. Looking ahead at the oil industry's future, Workman predicted that relations between shale producers and OPEC would stay frigid for some time. ""My theory of this is pretty simple: I think it's going to be shaky waters between shale producers and OPEC for a while. Maybe in three, four, five quarters more, you'll find people who think it's not going to last that long,"" the CEO told Cramer on Thursday. That said, after a major downturn in the oil patch, Workman's company has turned around, deploying some $750 million in capital, acquiring 12 companies, and chasing profitability, something the CEO said could happen this quarter if Canadian business serves. ""We originally felt like we could get to profitability, from EBITDA perspective, by Q3,"" Workman told Cramer. ""Depending on how this breakup is in Canada … if it's not as strong of a breakup as past years, there's a chance we get to positive EBITDA this quarter."" In Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Radian Group: ""OK, there are two Philadelphia home stocks, there's Radian and there's Toll Brothers. I prefer Toll Brothers."" U.S. Silica Holdings: ""Yeah, that's a commodity play. We're not sand guys. It's just not ours. Not for us."" Questions for Cramer?

Jeff Cox,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"May's disappointing job growth delivered another blow to hopes that the U.S. economy is on the cusp of breaking out. Job creation fell well short of economist expectations, with just 138,000 new positions created against estimates for 185,000. The unemployment rate declined to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, but that was because of a drop in the labor force participation rate. More broadly, though, the numbers serve as a reminder that hopes for breakout growth this year are likely to be dashed, and in fairly short order. As Washington lawmakers struggle to push through any aspects of President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda, the reality is sinking in that any gains now are likely to be felt in 2018 at least or perhaps even longer. Talk of ""animal spirits"" in January and February — with their respective payroll gains of 216,000 and 232,000 — is now replaced with expectations for more of the same as 2017 plays out. ""It just seems as if lower employment gains in part are consistent with the demographics and labor force participation rates in the U.S.,"" said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. ""I would suspect the days of 200,000 jobs per month are gone. We're now dealing with 160,000 or 180,000 for the rest of the year, if we're lucky."" That's not the way it was supposed to be, but it now appears the chatter earlier this year was misplaced. ""It was a head fake in the sense that some people believed that we were going to have a lot of economic policy actions early,"" Silvia added. ""It's still legitimate to say that we're going to have those policy actions that may affect 2018. But a lot of people built up too much optimism about how quickly economic policy gets through Washington."" For its part, the Trump administration tried to put a happy face on the numbers Friday. Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, told CNBC that he remains confident in the progress of the economy and said, ""We have to create a better and better job market in the United States."" However, his bragging that the administration is ""clearly bringing people back into the job force"" is a little misleading. In fact, the labor force has increased by just 68,000 through the first five months, well below the 148,000 for the same period in 2016 and the 425,000 in 2015. Though the unemployment rate that includes discouraged and underemployed workers has dropped a full percentage point this year to 8.4 percent, the labor force and its composition remain a problem for broader economic growth. ""We expected the jobs market to take a slight breather, with 185,000 for May, but including the downward revisions the month before, this report feels more like an early summer vacation instead of a pause,"" Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings, said in a note. ""Given reports that job openings are near all-time highs, it suggests that businesses are struggling to fill these positions in an increasingly tighter market."" Economists and Federal Reserve policymakers also remain baffled at the lack of positive inflation signs, in particular wage increases. Average hourly earnings are rising at just a 2.5 percent pace — Deutsche Bank called it ""the new 3 percent"" — even though jobs seem harder to come by. Tightness in the labor market should be pushing harder on wages, but that does not appear to be the case. The tepid wage pressures along with ""further evidence of a still-modest consumer,  restrained business investment, and tepid domestic manufacturing, undermines the notion of better conditions or a more robust economic picture lurking around the corner,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income. To be sure, the financial markets don't seem to mind. Despite yet another weak economic signal, the stock market went on its merry way Friday, with major averages posting slight gains heading into midday. The bond market, however, has been telling another story, consistently forecasting much more lukewarm growth than its equity counterpart. As is often the case, at least in terms of the economic picture, it's an ongoing argument that fixed income seems to be winning. That's critical as the Fed prepares for a likely rate hike later this month. Fed Governor Lael Brainard earlier this week spoke about the inflation issue, saying that it ""is a source of concern,"" and pointed out that inflation has remained below the Fed's 2 percent target for 58 straight months, or nearly five years. ""Fundamentally, growth is slower than people have penciled in for the year,"" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. ""The bond market is not concerned that the Fed is behind the curve — it may be concerned that the Fed s a little ahead of the curve. The bond market is currently not seeing the world the same way as the stock market."" The world itself seems more complicated than one where a little pro-growth rhetoric about lower taxes, less regulation and more infrastructure spending would cast a spell over the economy and push growth higher. Wells Fargo's Silvia believes the labor market problems specifically require more complicated solutions. ""There are some tax policy changes, some regulatory policies that could be done. More fundamentally, it's microeconomics,"" he said. ""It's trying to get people talking about skills mismatch. ... We need to focus a lot more on education, the opioid epidemic, we need to think about the labor force participation rate for women."" ""These are the micro policies, not the macro policies you see on TV,"" he added. ""They're very hard to implement.""

Michelle Fox,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"Barry James, president of James Advantage Fund, has a warning for investors. For the last month or so, his firm's indicators have been saying the risks are rising — and James is bracing for a possible correction. ""We don't know when there will be a peak in the market and a tumble but it does look like a tire with a bulge,"" he said in an interview with ""Power Lunch"" on Tuesday. It's just a matter of whether the air leaks out slowly or quickly, he added. On Tuesday, U.S. equities were lower, but still not far from their record highs. For James, there are a number of things that are concerning, including the fact that valuations are very high and fewer names are responsible for leading the market higher. In the last three months, the typical S&P 500 stock rose about 0.5 percent, while the index overall is up about 2.5 percent, he noted. ""We see this building towards perhaps some type of a correction in the stock market and we believe it's time to sell,"" James said. Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, agrees there will be some type of consolidation in the market. He's anticipating 5 to 8 percent downside in the S&P by year-end. However, he's also expecting further earnings gains in 2017, 2018 and probably 2019 as well. ""Along with that, we think the market will make new highs. We simply have to get over a few uncertainties regarding the Fed, regarding the administration and Congress, and tax reform and those sorts of issues,"" Christopher said in an interview with ""Power Lunch."" Because he's expecting a modest acceleration in economic growth next year, he likes cyclical stocks going forward. ","With a possible correction looming, 'it's time to sell,' expert warns"
Patti Domm,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"European stocks have made solid gains, but even so, the gusher of money into Europe should continue as investors who shunned it since the financial crisis return.

According to Lipper Research, European focused, U.S.-based domiciled funds alone saw net inflows of $4.2 billion in May, bringing total net flows year-to-date to $9.2 billion. According to research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, so far this year investors moved $13.7 billion to European funds. Analysts say investors have been underinvested in Europe for a variety of reasons, from the Greek debt crisis to the French election. They have been catching up, but it's going to take time. ""We think the economic fundamental drivers are very solid. We think there's an earnings upturn. ...

Political risks in Europe still exist, but analysts point to recent figures that suggest the euro zone economy is growing at its fastest rate in years, much faster than the U.S. economy. In many countries, wages are rising, unemployment is falling, and credit conditions are easing as well, the European Commission reported. The German DAX is up 12 percent year-to-date, at a record high Friday. The French CAC is up 10 percent, and the U.K. FTSE, up 5.5 percent for the year, was also at a record high.

""From a short-term perspective, what we're advising clients to do is to use dollar-cost averaging when buying European stocks. We think the earnings recovery will be long-lived enough to sustain averaging over a couple of quarters,"" he said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch European equity strategist Ronan Carr said there's a noticeable pickup in interest from U.S. investors. Some of them have had large ""underweights against European benchmarks for five to 10 years. That served them well,"" he said.

""I think there are better opportunities in Europe, and I think investors continue to position themselves in the post-credit crisis world,"" said Sanchez. ""We're seeing a regime change, and we are seeing a resynchronization, and the global economy is getting much better, while the U.S. continues to muddle through from an investment standpoint."" But Europe is not without its risks. The European Central Bank meets Thursday, and there are expectations it could tweak the language in its statement to show it is coming close to a time when it would remove accommodation. BlackRock's Kate Moore said she's not worried about the central bank at this point, because there will still be so much easy policy in place.

Arguably, taking rates to positive from negative or zero would be a nice supportive move for the banks, which make up a quarter of the market,"" said Moore, chief equity strategist. The euro and European equities became more attractive after Emmanuel Macron emerged the victor in France's presidential election last month. He beat Marine Le Pen, who wanted to take the country off the euro. Europe is still not without its political risks. The U.K. has a parliamentary vote Thursday, and while Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to see her Conservatives win a majority, some polls in the past week threw that in doubt. May sought the election as a way to gain a strong mandate for Brexit, and any upset of that could impact U.K. stocks. ""If you buy the FTSE 100 because May's going to win, then everything is going to be okay.

Leslie Shaffer,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"White House plans nominations to key posts, including comptroller of the currency The Trump administration announced plans for long-delayed nominations to key posts, including tapping former One West CEO Joseph Otting for comptroller of the currency. Otting, whose name first began being floated for the role back in March, worked closely with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at One West, which Mnuchin purchased in 2009. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is an independent agency within the Treasury and is responsible for overseeing the nation's biggest banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. The position is expected to play a significant role in carrying out U.S. President Donald Trump's promise to roll back regulations — including doing a ""number"" on the sweeping law known as Dodd-Frank that was implemented following the 2008 financial crisis. Senate confirmation is required for the role. Trump has received criticism for moving slowly on a series of senior political appointments, a delay he used a tweet on Monday to blame on Democrats in Congress, despite Republicans controlling both the House and Senate. Donald J. Trump‏: .@foxandfriends Dems are taking forever to approve my people, including Ambassadors. They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals. Trump has formally nominated 63 of the 559 positions which require Senate confirmation, with 39 confirmed, 16 awaiting nominations and 441 lacking any nominee, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Those totals didn't appear to include the nine planned nominations announced late Monday. Other planned nominations announced on Tuesday included Owen West, a former marine and a Goldman Sachs alum, to be the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict.

Patti Domm,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"Stocks are near record highs, driven by surging tech shares, a sharp contrast with the bond market, where interest rates have been sinking on worries the economy just isn't getting enough juice for growth to pick up. The S&P 500 also is just a short hop to record territory, and it too tells a very different story from the Treasury market, where the belief is that the Federal Reserve may have to stop raising interest rates after its next hike in mid-June because of weak inflation or growth or both. As of Wednesday, traders were pricing in just 1.4 rate hikes this year, instead of the two forecast by the Fed. The ups and downs in expectations for fiscal stimulus from Washington have been a factor in the diverging market behavior. ""I think it's more like what the growth outlook looks like beyond this year. The market is showing a lot of skepticism about the belief that anything will get done on the fiscal policy side,"" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The bond market has also benefited from low yields in other parts of the globe, which have sent investors into U.S. Treasurys with relatively higher U.S. yields. Yields move opposite to prices. ""Everybody looks at stocks and says: When is the equity market going to have a Trump unwind?"" said Michael Schumacher, head of rates strategy at Wells Fargo. Schumacher said the bond market has been factoring out the Trump reflation trade, which sent rates higher right after the election on optimism that tax reform and other Trump policies would lift the economy. ""The market got a little hyped up initially. My sense is it's gone too far the other way,"" Schumacher said. Stock analysts say the equity market could see a pullback at some point, but few expect a sharp selloff this summer. Certainly, the stock market does not appear to fear a recession. ""At some point, the bond market is going to be right because you have narrow leadership. At some point, those five or six stocks are going to run out of steam,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. Amazon.com, Netflix, and Alphabet, among others, have been powering ahead, helping to pull the stock indexes along with them. ""It's hard to pass the leadership from tech to the broader market until we get some answers on health care, and then it's going to be tax reform."" Hogan sees a very shallow sell-off of less than five percent. Analysts have said the 'Trump trades' related to tax reform and infrastructure have been priced out of specific stocks and sectors, but it's harder to determine how much the broader idea of a reflation trade is still boosting the overall market. The markets began factoring out a big pop from Trump policy in March when the first version of the health-care bill failed to reach a vote on Capitol Hill. As investigations heated up around the Trump campaign and Russia in recent weeks, optimism for any of Trump's growth policies seeing adoption this year faded even more. The 10-year Treasury yield Wednesday slid to 2.19 percent, near the low end of a tight range it has traded in since the start of the year. The yield was at a low of 1.85 percent just before Trump won the election. The 10-year yield has gotten ever closer to the 2-year note yield, at 1.27 percent Wednesday. The convergence of the two — or flattening of the yield curve — is also a negative warning, and can be viewed as predicting concern about a weaker economy or that the Fed is raising rates too quickly. The 2-year yield directly reflects expectations for Fed rate-hiking activity. ""If you're constructive on bonds, at least in the near term, that likely implies a pretty high chance of a recession starting in the middle of next year, and we're not of that view. But that's really what the market is telling you,"" said Cabana. The market is signaling a period of subdued growth with risks skewed to the downside, he said. ""I've not gotten that sense that the bond market, the individuals, have a recession starting next year as a main point in their central scenario, but again that's what the levels would tell you, and in order for bond yields to go much lower from here, you've got to think the Fed is going to stop hiking,"" said Cabana, adding the market expects to see a very slow pace of rate hikes going forward. ""You're either in a recession or a prolonged period of slow increases in the fed funds target rate. … That's not clearly what the Fed has indicated, and I think a lot of this has to do with different perception of fiscal policy and the underlying outlook for the U.S."" Cabana said he expects the Fed to raise rates in June and September before pausing to begin unwinding its balance sheet at the end of the year. Fed policy is also affecting both markets differently, according to Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Lindsey Group. ""It's the belief the Fed is going to raise rates, and it's a clear difference of opinion,"" said  Boockvar. He said the bond market is questioning whether the economy can handle rate hikes while the stock market is not. ""The bond market knows more often than not the Fed tightening cycle leads to recession. That's what history shows. I'm not saying it's going there but people in the bond market know that's where it could lead."" Boockvar noted that there are some telltale signs that the economy is cooling. For instance, car sales have peaked, commercial real estate is topping out, and lending is down, he said. The disparity between the two markets can also be explained by the fact that low bond yields have driven investors to equities and other assets that yield more. ""Nasdaq going higher is led by a handful of stocks that are growing agnostic of the economy. The bond market looks more like the Russell 2000 and the Dow Transports than it looks like the S&P.  If you look at the Transports they're sending the same message as the bond market: 'We're concerned about a slowdown,'"" said Hogan. The Russell 2000 is up just under 1 percent year-to-date, and the Dow Transports are up 1.3 percent. The Nasdaq is up 15.1 percent so far this year, and the S&P 500 is up 7.7 percent. ""You've got a confusing message,"" said Hogan. He said the 10-year yield going lower often also means the market is reacting to geopolitical concerns, like the North Korean missile program, Brexit or the Italian election. Schumacher said the markets will be focused on a couple of events in the near future, and that could help resolve some market divergence. ""You have the employment report (Friday), the U.K. election on the 8th, and the Fed coming upon the 14th. Those are three things to focus on in the near term,"" he said. ""I think the bond market always thinks the stock market got it wrong, and vice versa,"" Schumacher said. ""The bond market people are a little more in the weeds of the budget than the stock market."" ",Bond market’s recession warning is at odds with stock market near record highs
Annie Pei,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"The seemingly never-ending record run for stocks doesn't mean the Trump rally is on solid footing, according to perma bear Peter Schiff. ""I think the trade has unraveled a bit,"" the Euro Pacific Capital CEO said last week on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" Last week, stocks set new all-time highs, as investors shrugged off a weaker-than-expected May jobs report and remained at least partly motivated by elements of President Donald Trump's policy agenda. However, one of Wall Street's most relentlessly bearish voices was unimpressed. ""Remember that early in the Trump trade, you had a strong dollar. The dollar has surrendered 100 percent of its gains post-Trump's election,"" Schiff told CNBC. Additionally, ""year to date the S&P is up, [but when] priced in gold the S&P is actually down."" So instead of staying in the U.S. stock market, Schiff is urging investors to buy bullion, which ""is up more than the Dow and more than the S&P,"" with the yellow metal having rallied 11 percent this year. Gold rose to its highest price since the end of April on Friday, thanks largely to the continued drop in the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, Schiff said it's also time to look overseas, as foreign markets are actually outperforming the U.S. ""The U.S. markets have been pretty steady while foreign markets have been much stronger, [with emerging markets also being very strong,"" he said. ""I expect this trend to continue and I think it will accelerate in the second half of the year."" In fact, while the S&P 500 Index is up almost 9 percent this year, Wall Street analysts have started urging investors to look at Europe, also up 9 percent year to date. Emerging markets, however, have soared over 19 percent so far in 2017. But Schiff says more trouble could be ahead for the markets, especially given the Federal Reserve's next actions. While the CME Fedwatch Tool is predicting an over 90 percent chance that the Fed will hike rates during its meeting next week, Schiff doesn't expect any more hikes after June, which could damage the market. ""Even though the Fed claims to be data-dependent and they hike interest rates [in spite of weaker than anticipated data], I think the markets are starting to look beyond the hikes to the cuts,"" said Schiff. ""I think we're getting ready to start a new easing cycle."" Schiff had previously cast doubt on the number of rate hikes. In February, the ardent Trump critic had pointed out that economic data was weaker than anticipated, blaming the Fed for Trump's election. The bond market's year in decline could round out with some relief, according to Bank of America's chartist. Why the idea of Washington gridlock may be the best thing that can happen to the market.

Over the past year, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has been one of the few big bank stocks to underperform the market. But does this make shares of the nation's third-biggest bank by assets a buy? Not necessarily. Wells Fargo's shares have climbed 3% since this time last year. The S&P 500, by contrast, is up 16% in the same stretch. This makes Wells Fargo an outlier among big bank stocks. The KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, has risen 29% since June 2016. And some banks, like Bank of America, are up even more. Shares of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank have surged 55%. WFC data by YCharts. Wells Fargo's underperformance traces back to its fake-account scandal, in which thousands of branch employees created millions of fake customer accounts in an effort to meet their sales targets and therefore keep their jobs. The scandal erupted into public view last September, but had been going on at the bank for a decade, if not longer. It seemed at first as if the Wells Fargo scandal would just blow over. Sure, it was fined $185 million from a combination of federal and state agencies, but that equates to only around 3% of its quarterly earnings. The expected impact was so small, in fact, that the bank's now-former CEO John Stumpf didn't even believe it was material, which would have triggered the bank's duty to have previously disclosed the festering scandal to shareholders. In the time since then, however, it's become clear that the damage will be much more meaningful and longer lasting than Wells Fargo initially believed. This follows from the fact that the bank has now abandoned its former cross-selling strategy by eliminating sales goals in its branches, which has triggered a drop in new account openings at Wells Fargo, with new checking accounts down 35% in March on a year-over-year basis. Image source: The Motley Fool. This shouldn't hurt Wells Fargo too much in the short run, as new checking accounts tend to be loss leaders for banks. The objective, and especially at Wells Fargo, which has long referred to its branches as stores, is to cross-sell more profitable financial products to these customers once their proverbial feet are in the door. Fewer new accounts being opened today, then, holding all else equal, will be felt much more in the future, when there will be fewer new customers to cross-sell products to, thereby weighing on growth. On top of this, Wells Fargo is facing a considerable amount of collateral damage from the scandal. It paid $142 million to settle a class action brought by customers, and it's still making its way through other private lawsuits as well as government investigations related to the opening of fake accounts. The net result is that Wells Fargo will be facing elevated legal expenses for the foreseeable future. And while Wells Fargo's stock certainly isn't expensive, trading at a 45% premium to its book value per share, which is right in line with its peer group, it also isn't as cheap as the likes of Bank of America and others, which trade for discounts to book value. The net result is that Wells Fargo, of all the big bank stocks right now, is swimming against the current. It will one day (hopefully) reclaim its sterling reputation, but until then, there are better bank stocks to add to one's portfolio. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06082017,Fool,06012017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With the stock market hovering near all-time highs, it can be a smart idea to think a little defensively in your portfolio. However, that doesn't mean you need to give up your growth potential if the market keeps rising. Blue chip dividend stocks have historically performed better than their non-dividend counterparts during tough times, and many have outperformed the overall market over long time periods. With that in mind, here are five of the largest dividend payers in the market, all of which pay out more than $5 billion per year to shareholders and could make excellent additions to your portfolio now. Company Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Annual Dividends Paid ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) $81.55 3.8% $12.9 billion AT&T (NYSE:T) $38.12 5.1% $12.0 billion Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $52.41 2.9% $7.6 billion Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) $87.25 3.2% $7.2 billion International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) $152.49 3.9% $5.6 billion Data source: CNBC and author's calculations. Stock prices, dividend yields, and annualized dividend rates are current as of May 29, 2017. Annual dividends paid are calculated by multiplying the current quarterly dividend rate by four, and then multiplying by the number of outstanding shares. Integrated oil giant ExxonMobil is one of the largest companies in the world, so it should be no surprise that it's also one of the biggest dividend payers. One major reason to like Exxon is for the diversification of its business. The company has operations in offshore and onshore oil drilling, chemicals, refining, and more. And while much of Exxon's revenue suffers when oil prices fall, some areas of the business actually tend to do better. For example, as my Foolish colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out, 2015 was a terrible year for Exxon's drilling operations, but the company's refining business more than doubled its profits. As far as the dividend goes, Exxon is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats index, having raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years, and pays 3.8% as of this writing. Considering the company's financial strength and profitability, the streak shouldn't be in jeopardy anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. Telecom giant AT&T is a favorite stock among dividend-seeking investors, and for good reason -- its 5.1% yield is among the best you'll find from such a stable company. And like Exxon, AT&T has a streak of consecutive dividend increases that exceeds three decades. There are a few good reasons to like AT&T over the long term. For one thing, AT&T has a pending acquisition of Time Warner. That will add all of the latter's content, helping AT&T to keep building a moat around its business, and allowing it to continue to bundle more and more services together -- potentially capturing market share from rivals such as Verizon and Sprint. Wells Fargo has significantly underperformed the rest of the banking sector over the past nine months or so, as a result of the now-infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal. This was certainly a major misstep by the bank, and the fallout from the scandal is obvious. The bank's non-interest income has fallen significantly, expenses are up, and the bank's normally strong efficiency ratio has suffered. Having said that, I believe that the effects of the scandal will be temporary. Wells Fargo remains one of the most well-run banks in the world, in terms of risk management, efficiency of operations, and profitability. The bank has consistently delivered better returns on equity and assets than its rivals, while maintaining a relatively low-risk asset portfolio. Consumer product giant Procter & Gamble's strength lies in its vast portfolio of well-known brand names, including Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Downy, just to name a few. To be clear, there certainly are some challenges facing Procter & Gamble going forward. For example, discounted and subscription-based razor competitors such as Dollar Shave Club have cost the Gillette brand market share in recent years. However, the long-term outlook is still strong for P&G shareholders. The company has proactively shed non-core brands to focus on its biggest winners, and has done an excellent job of controlling costs and boosting margins. Finally, Procter & Gamble has one of the longest streaks of consecutive dividend increases in the market at 60 years and counting. It was recently disclosed that Warren Buffett had unloaded about 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in International Business Machines, better known as IBM. Buffett said that the company was facing strong competition, and therefore he had valued its stock ""somewhat downward."" However, don't be too quick to abandon IBM -- Buffett still owns more than 50 million shares of the tech giant, and the central reasons Buffett bought IBM in the first place still apply. For one thing, IBM still has great relationships with large organizations, which not only provide stability to its revenue, but also give the company a strong base on which to grow with new product developments. The business also has ""stickiness,"" meaning that it would cost its customers a lot of money to choose a new provider for the integrated solutions (hardware, software, and services) that IBM provides.

    5 Dividend Stocks That Pay Out Over $5 Billion a Year -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06082017,Fool,06012017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) first bought Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock in early 2016. At the time, Apple represented a relatively small investment for Berkshire, at less than $1 billion. Fast-forward not even a year and a half later, and Berkshire's stake has ballooned to more than $20 billion, thanks to both aggressive purchasing by Buffett and company, as well as strong performance in Apple stock. Here's a look at Buffett's Apple investment, why he likes the company so much, and if Berkshire's stake could get even bigger. Berkshire Hathaway owns 129,357,106 shares of Apple, as of its latest SEC filings, which translates to a market value of $20.1 billion. These shares will generate nearly $326 million in dividend income for Berkshire in 2017 alone. Berkshire's only larger stock investments are Kraft Heinz and Wells Fargo, which are currently worth approximately $30.5 billion and $24.9 billion, respectively. Image source: The Motley Fool. Despite the fact that Apple is now one of Berkshire's top three stock investments, it still represents a relatively small stake in the tech giant -- approximately 2.4%. In fact, there are 23 publicly traded companies in which Berkshire owns a larger stake, percentage-wise. This certainly makes sense, as Apple is the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of over $810 billion. In addition, it's important to make the distinction between what Berkshire Hathaway owns and what Warren Buffett owns. Berkshire Hathaway owns 2.4% of Apple. As of the end of 2016, Warren Buffett owned about 18.7% of Berkshire Hathaway. That means that Buffett owns about 0.46% of Apple himself. To be clear, Buffett didn't initiate Berkshire's Apple investment -- rather, it came from one of his two trusted stock-pickers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. However, since each of them manages approximately $10 billion individually, and since Buffett controls the bulk of Berkshire's portfolio, the decision to make Apple one of the company's biggest investments came from Buffett himself. In a February 2017 CNBC interview in which Buffett revealed his massive increase in the Apple position, Buffett said, ""Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and enormously useful product that people would use."" In other words, Apple has an incredibly loyal customer base and has created a strong ecosystem. Apple's customers don't often abandon the brand for its rivals, and the fact that many own several Apple products (iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, etc.) makes switching even more unlikely. Buffett also praised Tim Cook's job performance, especially when it comes to capital deployment. I can't stress enough the value Buffett places on good management, specifically those who he feels do a good job of keeping shareholders' best interests in mind when making decisions. Finally, Buffett said that his decision to boost the Apple stake to its current level comes down to the ""future earning power of Apple."" Berkshire has added to its Apple stake several times in 2016 and 2017, but I believe the company could invest even more in Apple. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it's likely -- for two reasons. First, Berkshire is sitting on a massive stockpile of $86 billion in cash that it would love to put to work. Buffett likes having a reserve of at least $20 billion at all times, but this still leaves a lot of cash to put to work. Second, even though Apple's stock price has risen significantly since Berkshire first bought shares, I feel that it still represents an excellent value. If you don't include its quarter-trillion-dollar overseas mountain of cash, Apple's business trades for just 11.9 times this year's expected earnings, well below the S&P 500 average. Apple's valuation could be an especially motivating factor for Berkshire if the market corrects, or if Apple's stock price dips. Only time will tell if Berkshire will add to its Apple stake (and I've been right about Berkshire buying more Apple stock before), but in the meantime, Berkshire has a 2.4% stake in the tech giant, making it the third-largest investment in the company's closely watched stock portfolio. However, to put it mildly, I wouldn't be surprised in the least if Apple ends up becoming Berkshire's largest stock position in the not-too-distant future. ","

Warren Buffett, George Soros, and Carl Icahn are famous investors worth billions of dollars, but these three gurus embrace wildly different investment approaches. Buffett buys great stocks at fair prices for the long haul; Soros invests opportunistically to benefit from both bull and bear markets; and Icahn is an activist investor who buys big and then advocates from within for shareholder-friendly change. These money managers have proven that all three approaches can be savvy ways to invest, so let's take a look at their recent buys. Warren Buffett's biggest buy recently has been Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the consumer-electronics giant. IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL. Apple first showed up in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A) portfolio in the first quarter of 2016, when shares were in the doldrums because of worry over slowing demand for iPhones, due to consumers holding off on upgrades. While iPhone sales growth was declining, Apple's business overall was still humming along (and kicking off tremendous cash flow in the process). Apple's strong brand still allowed it to charge profit-friendly premium prices, and revenue from services, such as iTunes, was still climbing; that was enough to convince Buffett it was worth picking up this company's shares from the bargain bin. Today, Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's third-largest position behind Kraft Heinz and Wells Fargo, and with shares up 60% in the past year, Buffett's got to be smiling about his profit so far. . AAPL 1 Year Price Returns (Daily) data by YCharts. Recently, Buffett suggested he's finding it harder to justify buying more shares in Apple now that it's run so much higher, but he doesn't seem to be in a hurry to book his gain, either. Instead, he appears willing to roll the dice a bit longer to see whether or not the fast-approaching iPhone 8 will be feature-rich enough to compel people to finally upgrade their old iPhones. Only time will tell what happens this fall, but rumors of OLED displays and 3D sensing could be enough of an improvement to create a tidal wave of unit volume. If so, Apple's shares could still head higher. Drugmakers are defensive stocks because demand for medicine is less prone to the whims and whispers of the economic cycle. Perhaps that's why George Soros started a position in pharmaceutical Goliath Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) last quarter. Or maybe Soros simply likes Pfizer's potential to be a leader in the emerging multibillion-dollar biosimilars market. Biologic drugs are made in living organisms and thus are nearly impossible to copy exactly. However, despite being inexact copies, biosimilars provide similar efficacy and safety. Over the past decade, complex biologics have become some of the world's best-selling medicines. However, many of these biologics, including Johnson & Johnson's Remicade and Amgen's Neupogen, have lost or will soon lose their patent protection. To capitalize on that opportunity, in 2015, Pfizer forked out $17 billion to acquire biosimilar-drug developer Hospira. Late last year, Pfizer won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Hospira's Remicade biosimilar, Inflectra; recently, a key FDA committee recommended approval of its biosimilar to the blockbuster anemia drug Epogen. In Q1, Inflectra sales helped Pfizer's biosimilar revenue grow 62% year over year. And while it will be a while before we realize biosimilars' peak sales potential, tens of billions of dollars in biologic sales are up for grabs in coming years as drugs like the $14-billion-per-year Humira lose patent exclusivity. Granted, George Soros is typically in and out of stocks relatively quickly, so he probably won't stick around in Pfizer long enough to realize biosimilars' potential. Nevertheless, his interest in the company may suggest to investors that it's a good time to give Pfizer a close look. It's almost impossible to discuss Carl Icahn without mentioning his ongoing feud with Bill Ackman, manager of hedge fund Pershing Square, over Herbalife (NYSE:HLF). Ackman has long maintained that the company's business model is a pyramid scheme, and as a result, Herbalife has been one of his biggest short positions for years. Icahn, however, has taken the other side of the trade, accumulating a massive stake in the vitamin maker that's still growing. Icahn added 372,000 shares of Herbalife in the first quarter; his position now stands at 22.8 million shares worth nearly $1.7 billion, making him Herbalife's largest shareholder. Rumors circulated earlier this year that Icahn might be looking to unwind some of his position, but instead, he's betting bigger than ever that his long position and Herbalife's stock repurchases will force Ackman to cover, resulting in a short squeeze. That could, undeniably, be happening. Herbalife's shares have rallied in the past year, and share float (shares short as a percentage of shares available for trading) has been declining. Nevertheless, about 40% of Herbalife's shares remain held short, and that could indicate more upside is ahead. However, before investors rush out to buy Herbalife, they should know the company isn't entirely out of the woods yet. Today, management cut its sales forecast for the second quarter by 1.5%, citing changes made to its business model following an investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. According to the company's settlement with the regulator, it can't get more than 20% of its sales from its distributors, and that's creating some challenges. Offsetting its lowered top-line guidance, however, is an improving profit outlook. At the same time management cut its sales forecast, it boosted its second-quarter estimate for earnings per share to between $0.95 and $1.15, from prior forecasts of between $0.88 and $1.08. Given the big short position and the question marks associated with this company's future growth, it's probably the riskiest of these three stocks to buy. ","

Ryan Vlastelica,06082017,MarketWatch,06012017,"Published: June 1, 2017 11:19 a.m. ET A portfolio diversified with alternative investments performs better, Wells Fargo writes By Looking for an alternative to stocks and bonds in your investment portfolio? Have you considered the investment category of alternatives? Concerns have been growing about the valuation of both U.S. equities and fixed income, with famed investor Marc Faber recently warning that “there is a bubble in everything.” Meanwhile, Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners, recently told MarketWatch that market participants should consider cash. Read more: With stocks and bonds looking pricey, investors see little that’s appetizing Don’t miss: Why one hedge-fund titan is bracing for ‘all hell to break loose’ in the stock market A problem with cash, however, is that it basically yields nothing. That makes it a safe choice, but not one that can appreciably grow in the event markets turn lower. Alternative investments—which can be accessed through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds—are seen as having little correlation with the broader market, and because of this, such investments “may reduce a portfolio’s volatility by improving its diversification,” according to Wells Fargo. Alternative funds, according to Wells Fargo’s definition, “include asset classes, strategies, and structures that are often different than traditional investments.” They also “employ hedging and arbitrage techniques using long and short positions, leverage, derivatives, private investments, and investments in a variety of global markets.” Read about merger arbitrage ETFs here “Short” positions in an investment are essentially a bet that it will fall, while leverage uses borrowed funds in an attempt to magnify market gains (or losses). Derivatives investments can include the purchasing of options and futures. In a note to clients, Wells suggested a “moderate growth and income” portfolio that is 26% allocated to alternative investments and real assets. Another 40% of the portfolio is in stocks, while 31% are in fixed income. (The remaining 3% is in cash alternatives.) “Adding alternative investments to a traditional portfolio of long-only stocks and bonds has historically increased returns and decreased risk,” the investment bank wrote. Alternative funds tend to be more expensive than the more plain vanilla stocks and bond funds that most experts agree should comprise the primary building blocks of an investor’s portfolio. Many of them are also seen as riskier. Hedge funds, for example, have long underperformed the broader market, while also charging higher fees. However, that period of underperformance occurred during a multiyear bull market in equity prices, an environment that analysts say is particularly difficult to outperform in, particularly when fees are taken into account. If markets do turn lower, analysts say that actively managed portfolios—where the components are selected by an individual, in contrast to index funds, which passively track an benchmark like the S&P 500 —have a higher-than-average chance of outperforming. On this thesis, Deutsche Bank recently upgraded a pair of hedge-fund strategies, saying that “the environment has clearly improved for stock picking.” The bank raised its view on equity-market-neutral investing strategies to positive, while the category of long/short equity strategies was upgraded to neutral. The category of alternative ETFs is small but growing. It currently has about $5.7 billion in assets, according to FactSet data, but $1.2 billion of that has gone into the category in 2017. Many of the most popular alternative ETFs give investors an opportunity to invest in volatility-based products.

Lindsey Rupp,06082017,MarketWatch,06012017,"The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures. The logo for Lululemon Athletica is seen outside a retail store in New York. BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS Lululemon Athletica Inc. kicked off its biggest rally in almost six months after pulling out a slump and announcing plans to revamp its line of girls' apparel. After slow sales spooked investors earlier this year – a problem that Chief Executive Officer Laurent Potdevin blamed on poor web traffic and a dull product assortment – the company posted first-quarter earnings that topped analysts' estimates. The improving results suggest that Lululemon is coping with a more crowded market for yoga pants and other forms of athleisure – the increasingly popular category that combines workout attire with casual wear. Story continues below advertisement ""I'm excited to see the positive trends that materialized late in Q1 continuing into Q2,"" Potdevin said in a statement. The shares rose as much as 17 per cent to $56.85, the biggest intraday gain since Dec. 8. They had fallen 25 per cent this year before Thursday's close. Comparable-store sales, a closely watched metric, fell 2 per cent in the quarter ending April 30 – less than the 3.4 per cent decline forecast by Consensus Metrix. E-commerce revenue was flat, the company said. First-quarter earnings amounted to 32 cents a share, excluding costs related to the restructure of its Ivivva children's brand. That beat the 28 cents projected by analysts. The company also raised its fiscal 2017 forecast for profit while trimming its forecast for revenue. Closing Stores The retailer plans to close 40 of its 55 Ivivva stores while converting half of those that remain to Lululemon-branded stores. Ivivva will become ""a primarily e-commerce focused business."" Lululemon sees fiscal 2017 profit of $2.28 to $2.38 a share when excluding the cost of Ivivva's restructuring, up 2 cents from their previous forecast. Including Ivivva-related costs, net income is seen at $1.97 to $2.07. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement First-quarter sales rose 5 per cent to $520.3-million, compared with the $513.7-million analysts predicted. The retailer trimmed the full fiscal year forecast to $2.53-billion to $2.58-billion from $2.55-billion to $2.6-billion. Lululemon is trying to attract more male customers and expand its presence overseas while competitors increase their reliance on discounts. The company's website suffered a lengthy outage last month, a setback for a brand that's been working on its online performance. The Vancouver-based company counts on direct-to-consumer sales for about 17 per cent of revenue, Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu estimates. Lululemon is also in advanced talks to lease 8,000 square feet (743 square meters) of space on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The store was vacated in March by Sephora, which has moved to another location on the east side of Fifth Avenue. Welcome to The Globe and Mail’s comment community.

                                   first-quarter selling, general and administrative expenses were $199.1 million, or 38.3% of revenue, an increase from $181.5 million, or 36.6% of revenue, last year, Chief Financial Officer Stuart Haselden said on the late-Thursday earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. Revenue for the quarter was $520.3 million, up from $495.5 million the year prior, and ahead of the $514.0 million FactSet consensus. E-commerce same-store sales were flat, with overall same-store sales, a key metric for the industry, decreasing 1%. Haselden said expenses were in line with company expectations and based on increases in store operating costs, digital marketing, brand investment and other costs. See also:  Lululemon shares rally 10% after company earnings, Ivivva restructuring plans For the second quarter, the company sees quarter-to-date same-store sales in the positive low-double digits. Haselden says the company is reorganizing its digital teams and is using external resources “not previously contemplated in our financial plans.” “As a result, we will have certain one-time investments related to this recovery effort,” he said, estimating a 350-basis-point year-over-year deleverage in SG&A in the second quarter. Wells Fargo was critical of these expenses. “Investors have been awaiting a moderation of expense growth for some time now, but that does not appear to be occurring,” Wells Fargo analysts said. “Bigger picture, even if spending slows, top-line growth appears to be slower as well, and concerns persist about the underinvested e-commerce business…and the need to increase demand creation in a negative mall-traffic environment.” “The key concern that remains in focus is the amount of spending that is needed to drive top line in this business,” the analysts added. “So while the accelerated top-line performance is noteworthy, the flow-through margins are worsening due to SG&A.” The longer-term margin picture is fuzzy, with spending on efforts spanning digital to international store locations in the works.

UBS analysts share the spending concern and question if the extra spend will be a one-and-done effort. “Importantly, it’s not clear that the increased investments to reaccelerate e-commerce will be one-time (which Lululemon expects),” said UBS in its own commentary. “Lululemon described the costs as investments in development design costs (we consider e-commerce upkeep costs to be ongoing) and creative content support (product photos change every season, so it’s unclear why these costs won’t recur with fashion updates).” Read also: Retail carnage continues as jobs growth falls for fourth straight month See: Stressed retailers like J. Crew and Neiman Marcus are doing something unusual to manage debt Analysts are “encouraged” by the same-store sales acceleration into the second quarter, but say it’s not clear that earnings-per-share estimates reflect the needed costs. UBS rates Lululemon shares neutral with a $54 price target. Lululemon expects second-quarter EPS in the range of 13 cents to 15 cents, and adjusted EPS in the range of 33 cents to 35 cents. The FactSet consensus is for 36 cents. The adjusted EPS takes into account Lululemon’s plan to turn its ivivva business into a primarily e-commerce endeavor. Ivivva focuses on activewear for girls. Items on the website Friday morning include pants priced up to $72 and many tops priced north of $40. Lululemon is closing 40 of ivivva’s 55 stores and converting half of the remaining stores into Lululemon outposts. Ivivva showrooms and other temporary locations will also shut. Don’t miss: Burlington Stores could reach a $10 billion market cap despite recent sales stumble Read: This is how Best Buy gets so many of its customers to come into its stores Macquarie Research takes a more bearish look at Lululemon’s first-quarter same-store sales results. “We chuckle when we hear analysts say ‘great quarter.’ C’mon people! It’s a negative comp,” Macquarie wrote. Analysts call this a “real problem” in light of the fact that about 165 of the company’s 352 stores opened less than four years ago. In a previous note, analysts suggested that either new stores are ramping up and older stores are experiencing same-store sales declines due to cannibalization, or new stores aren’t ramping up and the whole fleet of stores is generating same-store sales in the low-single-digit range. “Neither situation is good in our view,” the note said.

Ryan Vlastelica,06082017,MarketWatch,06012017,"Published: June 5, 2017 3:19 p.m. ET Deutsche Bank expects passive equity strategies to overtake active in size in five years By There is good news for active managers. Or to be more precise, the bad news isn’t as bad: Investors are abandoning active strategies at a slower rate than before. Actively managed funds, which as a category have seen sharp outflows for years as investors move instead to passive funds, have started to staunch the bleeding a bit alongside a recent improvement in aggregate performance. According to Deutsche Bank, “the pace of passive share gains are slowing this year,” compared with late 2016, thanks to “modestly improving active performance” as well as “more optimism for a rebound in active alpha.” Alpha refers to the degree to which an actively managed fund—where the components are selected by an individual or team—delivers a better return than its comparable benchmark index. Passive funds, in contrast, track an index like the S&P 500

                                   by holding what it does, and in the same proportions. Data have repeatedly shown that basically no active funds can consistently beat the market over long periods, particularly when fees are taken into account. However, there has been a higher rate of outperforming funds thus far in 2017, a fact that is almost completely attributable to whether or not the funds are holding technology stocks. As a result of the improved performance, as well as a greater investor tilt toward riskier assets like stocks, “we reduced our active outflow assumptions for 2017 and also modestly reduced longer-term passive market share gain assumptions,” Deutsche Bank wrote. Related: Will tech rally continue? Hedge funds say yes, but mutual funds say no The German investment bank isn’t the first to find optimism in the deceleration of investors leaving the category. In February, Morgan Stanley called “improved outflows” for active funds “a turning point” for the industry. See also:  Wells Fargo joins the chorus of active management optimists According to Morningstar, active funds saw outflows of $285.2 billion in 2016; passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion. That trend has continued in 2017, albeit to a smaller degree, the shift that Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley see as tapering. So far this year, per Morningstar data, active funds have seen outflows of $15.5 billion, a comparably small rate of redemptions compared with 2016; one month even had positive flows for active strategies, due largely to actively managed bond funds, a market sector where experts say active management can add value. (Morningstar’s data goes through April, the most recent complete month for which it has data.) Passive continues to dominate on flows. In the first four months of the year, passive funds had inflows of $278.6 billion, and in February—the month where flows into active strategies were positive—the $8.15 billion move into active was dwarfed by the $74.3 billion that went into passive. A reversal from this trend—for active funds to have positive flows while passive flows turn negative—seems exceedingly unlikely. In addition to their typically better performance, passive funds have been widely favored by investors because they charge lower fees. Passive adoption is also expected to accelerate because of the Labor Department’s “fiduciary rule,” which requires that the financial advisers and brokers who handle individual retirement and 401(k) accounts must act in the best interest of their clients. These guidelines are expected to favor passive strategies because of their lower fees and because they, by definition, can’t underperform. However, most experts say the rules won’t prohibit advisers from recommending active products, or leave them vulnerable in the event they recommend an active fund that ends up underperforming. Deutsche Bank cited “less anxiety about litigation risk” pertaining to the fiduciary rule as another reason the retreat from active was slowing. Despite that, Deutsche Bank expects passive equity strategies will overtake active in size within a few years. The firm expects that more than 50% of the money in equity strategies will be in passive funds in five years, compared with 43% today. If the current period of improved active performance ends, the market share of passive could top 60%, the firm wrote. At the end of 2016, there was $9.3 trillion in all active strategies versus $5.3 trillion in passive, according to Morningstar, meaning passive strategies have about 36% of the market share. Overall, Deutsche Bank expects total passive share—including bond and hybrid strategies—to account for 40% of the market in five years, or 50% if active performance doesn’t improve.

                                   Bears continue to fret about stretched valuations and the risk of rising interest rates driving money away from utilities and into traditional fixed-income assets, but that clearly hasn’t happened yet this year. Tthe sector is a mere 3.3% of the broader S&P 500 and has no stock over $70 billion in market capitalization.

Of course, it’s hard to get bigger when interest-rate sensitive REITs are under pressure as the Federal Reserve continues to move toward tighter monetary policy. As rates rise, increasing the cost of borrowing for this capital-intensive sector, investors continue to tread lightly, as seen by the performance of the Vanguard REIT Index Fund

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - Mike Mayo, a prominent bank analyst who became unemployed in February when his brokerage shut down, has a new job at Wells Fargo & Co. The San Francisco-based lender hired Mayo to make calls on large-cap bank stocks in its securities business, according to a statement released on Monday. “Mike’s stature in the industry is well-recognized,” Diane Schumaker-Krieg, global head of research, economics and strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, said in a statement. “We are thrilled to have such an influential voice in this critical sector join our growing platform.” Big banks had been covered at Wells Fargo by longtime analyst Matthew Burnell. It was not immediately clear whether he had left the firm. Mayo has garnered a reputation as a blunt critic of bad behavior in the industry who spots trouble early. Since the early 1990s, he has made several savvy calls on stocks before banks - individually or as a sector - faced huge losses. His more famous downgrades happened ahead of the dot-com bubble bursting near the turn of the century, as well as the more recent subprime mortgage crisis. Mayo has a tendency to ask pointed questions during conference calls and investor events, making himself a thorn in the side of top executives at Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, among others. He turned up at JPMorgan’s most recent investor day less than 24 hours after losing his job at brokerage CLSA, identifying himself as a “free agent.” He then asked Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon what Mayo called a “trick question” about the bank’s brand. Dimon responded by telling an anecdote about Mayo having been banned from participating in analyst calls at another bank because management found him to be “insulting.” But, Dimon said, the problems Mayo highlighted were correct, and his criticism ultimately helped the bank improve. “You are a brand, too, Mike Mayo,” said Dimon. “You didn’t need CLSA.” Wells Fargo itself is in the midst of an overhaul after revelations emerged last year that thousands of employees had opened as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers’ names without their permission to hit aggressive sales targets. The sales abuses led to a $185 million fine, a CEO departure and weakness in its share price. As an analyst working at Wells Fargo, Mayo will no longer be covering the bank.

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"The third-largest U.S. bank overhauled compensation practices in its branches in January following a scandal tied to a pay scheme that rewarded employees who sold multiple products to the same customer and punished those who did not. As a result of that system, low level employees created as many as 2.1 million accounts without customer authorization. The new compensation system rewards teams rather than individuals in many cases, and is based on whether customers actually use the products they are sold. Wells Fargo’s shares have rebounded from the sharp drop suffered in the wake of the sales scandal boosted by growth expectations after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. However, they are still down 1.85 percent so far this year, underperforming a 4.26 percent increase in the S&P financial index .SPSY over the same period. Wells Fargo has lately accelerated branch closures, shuttering 80 in the fourth quarter of last year, Mack said. This year it is on track to close 200, she said, adding that the strategy varies greatly according to the region in which the closures are occurring. “In Manhattan you probably don’t want to go further than across the street to consolidate,” she said.

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. banking industry is about to launch its answer to the popular mobile payments app Venmo, in what is likely to be the biggest change in years in how individuals exchange funds digitally. Over the next week, five of the largest U.S. banks will light up their segments of a new payments network called Zelle, executives said in interviews. They plan to announce details of the launch on Monday, and expect another two dozen banks and credit unions to join over the next year. The long-awaited network will allow tens of millions of bank customers to send money to each other instantly - known as person-to-person payments - with a few taps on their smartphones. That is an improvement over Venmo, which immediately alerts users that a money transfer is in progress, but takes time to shift funds between bank accounts. Customers who use existing bank payment apps may not notice much of a change beyond marketing. Transfers will simply happen faster because the banks are finally linking to each other, executives said. Zelle took years to establish because fierce rivals had to come together to make it work. In the interim, Silicon Valley has made inroads into digital payments, particularly with the young customers coveted by banks. “Fragmentation has been frustrating for consumers,” said Paul Finch, chief executive of Early Warning. “Inconsistent experiences have made it difficult to send and receive money between banks.” Despite losing some ground to technology companies, banks still have a big advantage: No matter what network is used to transfer money, banks hold the vast majority of funds. And despite the popularity of apps like Venmo, they transfer far less money than banks. The value of digital payments processed through non-financial firms was one-fifth of what banks and credit unions processed last year, research firm Aite Group estimates. “We are excited to bring the service to everybody and anybody, regardless of which brand of phone you have in your hand or which generation you belong to,” said Gareth Gaston, head of omnichannel banking at U.S. Bank. Along with building customer loyalty, banks hope that Zelle will reduce their costs from handling checks and cash. Eventually, they would like to sell access to businesses that want to eliminate their own paper-related costs. In launching Zelle, banks are being careful not to confuse customers by offering yet another payments app. For instance, Chase will initially twin the brand with the QuickPay app its customers already use by showing “QuickPay with Zelle” on its mobile app and website. Eventually, the QuickPay name could fade away. ","

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thousands of revelers, some waving rainbow flags symbolizing gay rights, crowded Washington streets on Saturday for the city’s gay pride parade in an annual party that saw anti-corporate protesters briefly block its route. Cheering spectators packed sidewalks as floats with rainbow balloons and papier mache rainbows snaked 1.5 miles (2.4 km) through residential neighborhoods several blocks north of the White House. In almost 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) heat, some men went shirtless or donned feather boas. The protest group, No Justice No Pride, said in a statement that Capital Pride also needed to add a transgender minority woman to its board and bar police from marching in the parade. The Capital Pride parade was among a bevy of gay pride events this weekend scheduled for cities across the United States, including Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. “We need to be out here to tell people that God loves them for who they are and who they love,” said the Rev. Alex Dyer, 38, an Episcopal priest from Washington who marched in the parade with his husband and 2-year-old daughter. The parade in the heavily Democratic U.S. capital featured T-shirts that said “Love Trumps Hate,” an apparent reference to   President Donald Trump. The Republican has voiced support for gay rights but his administration has revoked federal guidelines that let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice. Damian Jessup, 30, who traveled from Norfolk, Virginia, to march with gay Republicans, defended Trump and his support for gays. “I lost a lot of friends when I came out as Republican,” said Jessup, who was wearing a Trump T-shirt. “It’s harder to come out as Republican than to come out as gay.” The Washington parade came a day ahead of a so-called Resist March in Los Angeles against Trump, which is taking the place of the annual pride parade. In San Francisco, the SF Weekly newspaper reported the parade in that city would include a “resistance contingent” and an immigrant rights speaker. Early on Monday, the owner of the shuttered Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, is set to open its doors in remembrance of victims of a mass shooting there on June 12, 2016, that killed 49 people.

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple shares added to last week’s drop on Monday to lead a market downturn as tech, still the best performing S&P 500 sector this year, succumbed under its own weight. Mizuho Securities cut its rating on Apple to “neutral” from “buy” on Monday, saying the stock had outperformed this year and that the “upcoming product cycle is fully captured at current levels.” Apple shares, down 2.4 percent on Monday, are up about 26 percent so far in 2017. The S&P technology sector fell 0.8 percent after dropping 2.7 percent Friday for its largest two-day decline in nearly a year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed the S&P 500 as the ongoing rout in the sector sparked a search for value elsewhere. Energy stocks .SPNY, the worst performing sector year-to-date, were among the ones trying to stop the bleeding on the S&P 500. Despite the flailing leadership in tech stocks, Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, said he is not too worried about it becoming a broader market selloff. “We’re not even in correction territory for the Nasdaq or large tech shares. If economic data was worse than what it is, then I’d be worried,” he said. “The risk of recession is still pretty low, so I think this (tech) selloff is not a harbinger.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 36.3 points, or 0.17 percent, to 21,235.67, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.38 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,429.39 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 32.45 points, or 0.52 percent, to 6,175.47. Jacobsen said he would not yet buy into the market’s dip ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting that ends Wednesday, as the Fed is “the biggest risk to the market” in the near-term. “If the Fed dismisses the recent bout of soft data and continues hiking (rates) for the sake of hiking, then we could see a correction” in the stock market, he said. Advancing issues barely outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners. About 7.89 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, far above the 6.81 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. ","

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is developing a new digital mortgage application tool in a bid to get more of its existing clients to turn to it for home loans, its wealth management technology head said on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley has invested heavily into growing its residential mortgage and customized lending business in recent years. But only 2 percent of current clients have home loans with the bank, Naureen Hassan, chief digital officer for wealth management, said at the bank’s U.S. Financial Services conference in New York. Hassan said the new tool will allow clients to get rate estimates, upload documents and apply entirely online. She did not say when the bank planned to launch the platform. It is part of a broad technology investment plan, which also includes the launch of the mobile payments network Zelle and a partnership with Twillio, a communications tool the bank will use to so advisers can securely text clients’ cell phones. Hassan said Morgan Stanley will roll out a pilot version of Zelle later this month, with plans to expand the service more broadly this fall. Zelle was developed by an industry consortium and will be used by a number of big U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which plan to launch it to customers this month.

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Treasury Department plan for reworking financial rules would reduce regulatory overlap and help the economy, the official tasked with drawing up the proposal said, rebutting criticism from Democratic lawmakers that the effort was aimed at boosting bank profits. Craig Phillips, counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, said on Tuesday that while banks had given a warm welcome to the many policy recommendations in a 148-page report released on Monday, the proposed changes were not issued with the goal of aiding Wall Street. “This is not a plan to help banks,” he said at a financial industry conference in Washington. “Our goal is to guide a regulatory path that helps banks better serve their customers without putting taxpayers at risk or lowering the standards that are appropriate.” U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, is pushing for deregulation across the federal government. Banking lobbyists and executives in Washington praised the Treasury Department report for its roughly 100 recommendations to streamline, relax or remove a range of the government’s regulatory powers to police Wall Street. “The report is basically our entire wish list,” said one banking lobbyist who asked not to be named. Financial trade organizations called the report a much-needed reconsideration of rules put in place following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The report earned scorn, however, from advocates for tougher rules, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said on Monday it catered too much to Wall Street demands at the expense of consumers. “There’s overlap, there’s duplication, there’s confusion,” he said of the current regulatory load. The Treasury Department did not go into detail in terms of implementing key aspects of the report, such as how to change the $50 billion asset threshold for when banks face tougher regulation. Banks above that $50 billion level are subject to heightened regulations including the requirement they submit “living wills” to regulators and pass stress tests on their portfolios. But Phillips indicated the Treasury is open to major changes, suggesting an asset threshold as high as $500 billion, or one that emphasizes risk and complexity over size. He also said the Treasury would release three more reports in the coming months recommending regulatory changes, aimed at capital markets, asset managers, insurance and fintech. The reports will likely come sometime in September, he added. ","

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"(This June 12 story removes “that” from second paragraph, adds “sought” to seventh paragraph) By Pete Schroeder and Lisa Lambert (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled a sweeping plan on Monday to upend the country’s financial regulatory framework, which, if successful, would grant many items on Wall Street’s wishlist. The nearly 150-page report suggested more than 100 changes, most of which would be made through regulators rather than Congress, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview. (bit.ly/2sVxOlt) “We were very focused on, what we can do by executive order and through regulators,” he said. “We think about 80 percent of the substance in the report can be accomplished by regulatory changes, and about 20 percent by legislation.” Republican President Donald Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies to carry out his agenda, but only Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress. Other agencies are operating under “acting” chiefs or have leaders appointed by Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Changes proposed by the Treasury Department include easing up on restrictions big banks now face in their trading operations, lightening the annual stress tests they must undergo, and reducing the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been aggressively pursuing bad behavior by financial institutions. The plan would also expand the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is chaired by Mnuchin, and change the way global capital standards are implemented to give U.S. banks a leg up against foreign rivals. Smaller banks would get some relief as well: Lenders with $50 billion or less in assets would have to jump through fewer regulatory hoops than rivals with multitrillion-dollar balance sheets. Industry trade groups applauded the proposal on Monday evening, though some said they wished there were more specifics on tricky questions, such as what level regulators should set for banks’ assets before subjecting them to stricter rules. “This is the first time in a while where there’s been an official undertaking where our concerns resonated with the folks in the driver’s seat,” said Rich Foster, senior counsel for regulatory and legal affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade group. Representatives for the six largest U.S. banks declined to comment, did not immediately respond or said they were reviewing the document. Reform advocates and Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the plan as a handout to Wall Street and a dangerous one for U.S. consumers who lost homes and jobs during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a critic of Wall Street, said it would “make it easier for big banks to cheat their customers and spark another financial meltdown.” Her Democratic colleague Senator Sherrod Brown noted that Treasury consulted with industry groups more than consumer groups, by a ratio of 17-to-1, while developing its report. “The Treasury proposal advances ideas that have been pushed by industry lobbyists since Dodd-Frank was passed,” said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. “We need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders.” Mnuchin said the regulatory overhaul is needed to grow the economy, give consumers more choices and ensure U.S. taxpayers would not have to bail out big banks again. While the Trump administration has said it wants to protect consumers, existing rules limit their access to loans and investment products they want. By trying to make many of the changes through regulatory agencies, the Trump administration may avoid a lengthy and perhaps futile battle with Democratic lawmakers. Although the White House and Congress are led by Republicans, Democrats in the Senate can block legislation and are unlikely to support any overhaul that eases rules on big banks. Some of the Treasury’s proposals, like defanging the CFPB, would require new laws to be written and therefore face an uphill political battle. The report, which focused on banks, is the first of four examinations being carried out by the Treasury Department after Trump pledged to do a “big number” on the Dodd-Frank reform law. Proposals on capital markets, clearing houses and derivatives as well as the insurance and asset management industries and financial innovation and banking technology will come later. ","

However, buying shares of a company isn't the same thing is supporting their business practices, and it's our job to seek out superior returns wherever we can find them. Strong Asian growth now drives industry profits, along with a resurgence in U.S. consumption triggered by modern vaporizer technology. In addition, the current administration has plans to strip away regulations across a broad swath of industries, making it unlikely that producers will get singled out for criticism in coming years. Given these tailwinds, tobacco stocks are likely to perform well into the next decade. (For more, check out: Back From the Dead: Why Tobacco Stocks Are Soaring.) Philip Morris International Inc.

The subsequent recovery wave reached the upper $90s in 2013, giving way to a multi-year correction that found support in the mid-$70s. The stock rallied above the prior high in 2016 and stalled out, building a base on new support and then spiraling lower in November. That marked the washout low, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reinstated the breakout in January 2017, followed by a powerful trend advance to an all-time high at $122.90 on June 6. Philip Morris stock has been pulling back in a bull flag pattern since that time, while daily stochastics have dropped into the oversold zone.

Michael J. Kramer,06152017,Investopedia,06082017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs What exactly is Visa Inc. (V)? Is it a financial firm or a credit services provider? What about a technology company? That sounds crazy, right? Or does it? Don't believe me; look at the makeup of the Financial Select Sectors SPDR ETF (XLF) and see the top 25 holdings: There's no Visa. Yeah, it is a company with a market cap of almost $220 billion, bigger than that of Citigroup (C), but it's not in the top 25 of the financials. So if it's not a financial, then what is it? Well, of course, Visa is a tech company! Just look at the Technology Select Sector XLK SPDR (XLK), and there it is: Visa with 3.38 percent weighting in the ETF. By the way, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is also there, with a 2.21 percent weighting. Incredible, right? How come Visa and Mastercard are technology companies while American Express is a financial company? There's a simple answer: The three companies are fundamentally different in a significant way. Visa is an electronic payment network, while American Express issues cards and takes on the debt of its cardholders. Fundamentally, banks and financials depend for the most part on interest rates because when banks lend money, they charge a rate of interest. When rates are low they make less money, and when rates rise they make more money. Currently, interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve all go to a bank's ability to make money. Visa is dependent on how many transactions are occurring on its network charging a fee for the use of the network. Financials also have default risks associated with them that a company like Visa does not. Because banks and financials hold the debts of their cardholders, there is a risk the cardholder will not pay those debts and default on them, resulting in a loss for the card issuer. Again, for a company such as Visa, those risks are not present. Visa's biggest risk would be declining usage of its network. V PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts  All of this matters because of the way investors value the company. Visa is priced as a growth stock with a 2018 forward P/E ratio of almost 28. We can see why. Analysts are looking for Visa's revenue to grow to $21.81 billion by 2019 from $17.88 billion in 2017, a growth rate of almost 22 percent. V Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Compare that to the growth of American Express, where revenue is expected to grow to $35.99 billion from $32.74 billion, a top-line growth rate of only 10 percent. AXP Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The difference is reflected in the performance of the stocks over the past decade or so. V data by YCharts Visa's stock performance resembles that much more of a technology company than a financial company. The market certainly values Visa like a tech company, with a valuation closer to that of Facebook Inc. (FB) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) than JP Morgan Chase & Co.(JPM), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), or American Express.

Mayo was among the many analysts to lose their jobs when CLSA Americas closed its U.S. research offices in February. In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Mayo called his hiring by Wells Fargo ""a great fit."" The often-outspoken analyst also said, ""Wells Fargo is going to allow Mike Mayo to continue to be Mike Mayo."" Diane Schumaker-Krieg, global head of research, economics and strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, said in a release that ""Mike's stature in the industry is well-recognized. We are thrilled to have such an influential voice in this critical sector join our growing platform."" Mayo was very critical of Wells Fargo's former CEO, John Stumpf, after the bank was found to have opened accounts for clients without their permission. Stumpf resigned and more than 5,000 employees were fired. After Mayo lost his job at CLSA earlier this year he bought one share of many bank stocks so that he could continue his work and gain access to information as a shareholder. In a CNBC interview in April, Mayo, who was acting as an independent analyst, said, ""Banks' balance sheets are the strongest in a generation."" His top pick in the sector was Goldman Sachs. Mayo also recently called the bank sector ""the Lebron James of the stock market,"" saying ""they have incredible defense, the most resilient balance sheets in a generation, but now with this pro-growth agenda, they might also have a little bit of offense, too.""

 ,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"The U.S. banking industry is about to launch its answer to the popular mobile payments app Venmo, in what is likely to be the biggest change in years in how individuals exchange funds digitally. Over the next week, five of the largest U.S. banks will light up their segments of a new payments network called Zelle, executives said in interviews. They plan to announce details of the launch on Monday, and expect another two dozen banks and credit unions to join over the next year. The long-awaited network will allow tens of millions of bank customers to send money to each other instantly — known as person-to-person payments — with a few taps on their smartphones. That is an improvement over Venmo, which immediately alerts users that a money transfer is in progress, but takes time to shift funds between bank accounts. Customers who use existing bank payment apps may not notice much of a change beyond marketing. Transfers will simply happen faster because the banks are finally linking to each other, executives said. ""By coming together to offer Zelle, we are providing a large majority of Americans with a safe, fast and easy way to move money,"" said Bill Wallace, head of digital at JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank by assets. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and Capital One will be the first to plug into Zelle. The network is the product of an industry consortium called Early Warning Services LLC, whose seven owners have more than 86 million U.S. mobile banking customers. Zelle took years to establish because fierce rivals had to come together to make it work. In the interim, Silicon Valley has made inroads into digital payments, particularly with the young customers coveted by banks. In addition to Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google and Apple all offer payment platforms that allow individuals to send money to each other. The banks want to leap over those sleek but scattered offerings by connecting their critical mass of account holders through a single network. ""Fragmentation has been frustrating for consumers,"" said Paul Finch, chief executive of Early Warning. ""Inconsistent experiences have made it difficult to send and receive money between banks."" Despite losing some ground to technology companies, banks still have a big advantage: No matter what network is used to transfer money, banks hold the vast majority of funds. And despite the popularity of apps like Venmo, they transfer far less money than banks. The value of digital payments processed through non-financial firms was one-fifth of what banks and credit unions processed last year, research firm Aite Group estimates. ""We are excited to bring the service to everybody and anybody, regardless of which brand of phone you have in your hand or which generation you belong to,"" said Gareth Gaston, head of omnichannel banking at U.S. Bank. Along with building customer loyalty, banks hope that Zelle will reduce their costs from handling checks and cash. Eventually, they would like to sell access to businesses that want to eliminate their own paper-related costs. As more banks connect and more customers use the service, sending cash to another individual will simply involve knowing the person's mobile phone number or email address. Later this year, individuals with accounts at banks not connected with Zelle will be able to use its real-time features by downloading an app and pairing it with a Visa or Mastercard debit account. In launching Zelle, banks are being careful not to confuse customers by offering yet another payments app. For instance, Chase will initially twin the brand with the QuickPay app its customers already use by showing ""QuickPay with Zelle"" on its mobile app and website. Eventually, the QuickPay name could fade away. ",US banks are launching an answer to peer-to-peer payment app Venmo
Antony Currie,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"Wells Fargo is driving its stagecoach further into the mud. The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers' mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right. The actions at issue might seem to help struggling borrowers: Wells Fargo lowered some customers' monthly mortgage payments, potentially making them manageable. But there are two huge potential problems. First, the bank did this while also extending the duration of the loans – in one case by some 30 years. That greatly increased the total interest borrowers were on the hook to pay over the life of their loans. Second, Wells Fargo made these changes, according to the lawsuits, without getting the consent of either the customers or the relevant bankruptcy courts. Wells Fargo denies this, saying it notified customers and does ""not finalize a loan modification without receiving signed documents"" from the required parties. The trouble is, Wells Fargo has mucked up mortgage lending and modification in the past. It was one of the five lenders that in 2012 agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government and 49 states to rectify poor loan servicing and foreclosure practices. Last year it forked over $1.2 billion to settle claims of reckless lending under a Federal Housing Administration program. Home loans should have been squeaky-clean after all that. Add to that its recent $185 million fine after retail bankers chasing aggressive account-opening targets created 2 million fake bank and credit-card accounts – events that cost former Chief Executive John Stumpf his job – and there's a sense of a bank still not ensuring it has fundamental checks and balances in place. Wells Fargo isn't alone. The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 exposed the many failings of the financial-services industry. For now, though, most of its big rivals appear to have put the worst of their transgressions behind them. Sloan's shop keeps swerving into new ones.

Tae Kim,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"Wall Street is increasingly worried over the future growth opportunities for the two best-performing stocks in the market during the past year.Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD shares are both down significantly in recent days. Nvidia declined more than 5 percent over the past week through midday Thursday, while AMD fell 12 percent in that time period.The Nvidia decline was in part sparked by a negative Citron Research report on Nvidia Friday.""Take your profits and move on to Google (Alphabet). Exposure to the identical array of 'sexy businesses' with less risk on the downside,"" Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a post entitled ""NVIDIA: The Moment that Separates the Gamblers from the Investors. NVDA to Trade back to $130."" Left cited competition coming from Intel, Google and Xilinx in the data center markets and the likelihood of slowing growth in its gaming graphics card business as reasons for his skeptical view on Nvidia's market value.Wells Fargo is also concerned over rising competition in Nvidia's data center business. The firm reiterated its underperform rating on the company Wednesday.""We think that Nvidia has done very well in establishing itself as the dominant provider of standalone accelerator solutions for data center, but believe that this is already reflected in Nvidia's stock value,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Wong wrote in a note to clients. ""Over time we think additional providers of standalone accelerators might emerge, helping to drive growth in the standalone processor market but reducing Nvidia's market share in this market.""Even with the move lower, Nvidia shares have rallied 218 percent through midday Thursday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 17 percent return. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. AMD is right behind at No. 2 with a 156 percent return in the same time period. In similar fashion to the negative Nvidia notes, Goldman Sachs told investors to sell AMD shares Monday, questioning whether the recent cryptocurrency-driven demand for the company's graphics cards will last. ""According to our checks, the RX 570 and RX 580 graphics cards are sold out at numerous retail websites including NewEgg and Microcenter. While this dynamic may provide near-term upside to fundamentals, we believe [cryptocurrency mining] is unlikely to become a sustainable driver of EPS,"" Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in the note to clients.Nvidia declined to comment on the Citron and Wells Fargo reports.

Jessica Dickler,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"June's quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve likely will change some of the terms by which you borrow money or access credit. ""Fed rate hikes, while still slow, are starting to accelerate,"" said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""The pace at which interest rates have been rising has been so slow that investors may not feel the heat until it's boiling."" If you're concerned about what turning up the temperature will mean for your own bank account, mortgage loan or credit card, here's a breakdown of what could happen. Most credit cards these days have a variable rate, which means there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark rate. The quarter-percentage-point rate hike means you'll pay an extra $2.50 a year for every $1,000 of debt, according to NerdWallet. That will cost credit card users roughly $1.5 billion in extra finance charges during 2017, according to a WalletHub analysis. Factoring in the three previous rate hikes, credit card users will pay about $6 billion more in 2017 than they would have otherwise, WalletHub said. ""Each change adds up and increases your debt burden,"" said Sean McQuay, Nerdwallet's credit card associate. However, there's still time to consider a zero-interest balance transfer offer and make aggressive steps toward paying down your high-interest debt once and for all. The economy, the Fed and inflation all have some influence over long-term fixed mortgage rates, which generally are pegged to yields on U.S. Treasury notes, so there's already been a creep up from record-low levels well before the Fed made any official move. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now about 4.04 percent — up slightly from the record low of 3.50 percent in December 2012. With interest rates rising, adjustable-rate mortgages will certainly be heading higher too and those with an ARM ""could see their monthly payment go up this year,"" said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com's chief financial analyst. One option to consider is refinancing. ""There is no sense in bearing the risk of an adjustable rate when you can lock in a fixed rate at 4 percent and be done with it,"" he said. Many homeowners with adjustable rate home equity lines of credit, which are pegged to the prime rate, also will be affected. But unlike an adjustable-rate mortgage, these loans reset immediately rather than once a year. For example, a rate increase of 25 basis points would cause borrowers with a $50,000 HELOC to see a $10 to $11 increase in their next monthly payment, according to Mike Kinane, senior vice president of consumer lending at TD Bank. While that's not a big change, those worried about the escalation of rates can often convert the balance into a fixed-rate option at any time, Kinane said. For those planning on purchasing a new car in the next few months, this rate change likely will not have any material effect on what rate you get. A quarter-percentage-point difference on a $25,000 loan is $3 a month, according to Bankrate's McBride. ""Nobody is going to have to downsize from the SUV to the compact because of rates going up,"" he said. What will affect what kind of car you can afford is checking that your credit is in good shape, negotiating the price of your vehicle and shopping around to secure the best rate on your financing. ""Don't lose sleep over interest rates,"" he said. Currently, the average five-year new car loan rate is 4.42 percent and the average four-year used car loan rate is 5.07 percent. Stashing some cash in a savings account has yielded not very much, aside from peace of mind, and that's not likely to change. The average interest rate on a savings account is about 0.08 percent right now, according to Bankrate, and even with the Fed rate hike, banks may not pass on any of that increase to their customers, which means interest on deposits will remain near rock bottom. Banks' terms allow them to be slower to raise rates on savings products than they are on loans and credit cards, according to Nick Clements, co-founder of MagnifyMoney.com. Rather, ""check online savings accounts, community banks or credit unions; often you can pick up over a full percentage point that way,"" McBride said. ""That's more than tenfold the interest you are earning now."" That will add up. An account paying 1.10 percent in interest earns about $275 more per year than an account with a rate of 0.01 percent on savings of $25,000, according to NerdWallet. Federal student loan rates are fixed, so most borrowers won't be affected immediately by a rate hike. But if you have a private loan, those loans may be fixed or have a variable rate tied to the Libor, the prime rate or T-bill rates — which means that as the Fed raises rates, borrowers will likely pay more in interest, although how much more will vary by the benchmark. ""If the federal funds rate rises by 25 basis points, one can expect the interest rates on variable loans would increase by the same amount,"" said Stephen Dash, CEO of Credible.com, an online marketplace for lenders that offer student loan refinancing. While most borrowers have federal student loans, many others have a mix of federal and private loans, and nearly a quarter, or 24 percent, of student-loan borrowers don't know the difference between fixed- and variable-rate loans, according to Credible. That makes this a particularly good time to identify the loans you've got and see if refinancing into a fixed rate makes sense, Dash said. ""There still exists a very meaningful savings opportunity."" ",How the Fed rate hike will affect your finances
Bob Pisani,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"For the second day in a row, value stocks (banks, energy) are outperforming growth stocks (technology). Has the time finally arrived for value stocks? Growth versus value is one of the oldest investment styles known. Value-buying stocks that are underpriced, according to some fundamental metric, such as price-to-book ratio, gained fame under Ben Graham and David Dodd, whose 1934 text ""Security Analysis"" is generally viewed as the bible of value investing, even though they never explicitly used the phrase ""value investing."" One thing is clear: buying growth stocks—those that are growing earnings at an above-average rate — has been a sound strategy this year. The iShares S&P Growth ETF (IVW) is up 12.5 percent year to date, while the iShares S&P Value (IVE) is up only 4.1 percent. Why is there such outperformance this year for growth? As a rule, growth stocks this year are technology, consumer discretionary, and health care. As a rule, value stocks this year are financials, energy, and consumer staples. It shouldn't surprise you that the reason growth has outperformed value is because of the huge outperformance of big-cap tech stocks. Here are the top holdings in the S&P Growth Index, by their weight in the index. S&P Growth: top holdingsApple: 7 percentMicrosoft: 4.8 percentAmazon: 3.4 percentFacebook: 3.1 percentGoogle: 2.6 percent These are the so-called ""FANG"" stocks (with Microsoft added) that everyone has been talking about this year. By contrast, the Value index's biggest names are energy and financials, which have all underperformed this year: For the past two days, we have seen a rotation out of tech outperformers and into energy and bank underperformers. This is a healthy sign: rather than just selling off, investors are using these over-owned technology names as a source of funds to buy underperforming energy and bank names. Will that continue? Opinions are divided. Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services, splits the difference by telling clients, ""We are not advising a style tilt at this point"" but notes the obvious: ""On a short-term basis, value's underperformance is moving to an extreme and due for a reprieve."" The good news is that the action in the past couple days is a good reminder that nothing goes in a straight line and the momentum guys can just as quickly abandon growth names, and have done so many times in the past. And growth does not have a monopoly on price appreciation: there are long periods when value does outperform. Lerner notes that while growth has outperformed value this year, growth underperformed value by 9 percent in 2016. ""Thus, over the entire period from 2016 until now, growth's outperformance is less extreme at less than 4%,"" Lerner notes. One final note: a common complaint about growth vs. value investing is that you get a lot of ""bleed,"" that is, because the parameters of what constitutes value and growth are a bit fuzzy, you can (and do) get stocks that have characteristics of both, so they are usually included in both indices. For example, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson are in both the Growth and Value indices. If this bothers you—that you can get the same stocks in two different investment styles that seem, well, opposite—you're not alone. There have been numerous attempts to create ""pure"" investment styles. Sticking with ETFs, one example is Guggenheim's S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) and S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV) ETFs. Guggenheim splits the S&P into three groups: a growth basket that weights stocks on traditional growth fundamentals (sales and earnings growth, price momentum), a value basket that weights value stocks on traditional value fundamentals (price/book ratio, sales/price ratio, and earnings/price ratio), and a ""blend basket"" of stocks that have both growth & value attributes. It throws out the ""blend basket"" and creates funds that they believe how ""purer"" growth and value characteristics. The results? It sounds like a good idea, but at least this year there's not a huge difference between the performances of the S&P 500 Growth and Value and the ""Pure"" S&P 500 Growth and Value Indices: iShares S&P Growth (IVW) up 12.5 percentGuggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) up 12.8 percent iShares S&P Value (IVE) up 4.1 percent Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV) up 3.8 percent The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies.

Stephanie Landsman,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"If David Stockman is right, Wall Street should hunker down. ""This is one of the most dangerous market environments we've ever been in. It's the calm before a gigantic, horrendous storm that I don't think is too far down the road,"" he recently said on ""Futures Now."" Stockman, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, made his latest prediction after lawmakers grilled former FBI Director James Comey over whether President Donald Trump tried to influence the Russia investigation. ""This is a huge nothing-burger, but you don't take comfort from that. You get worried about that because the system is determined to unseat Donald Trump,"" said Stockman. Stockman argues the latest drama on Capitol Hill is a distraction from the real problems facing the economy. ""If the Senate can involve itself in something this groundless, it's just more hysteria about Russia-gate for which there is no evidence. If they can bog themselves down in this, then we have a dysfunctional, ungovernable situation in Washington,"" he said, noting there are just seven weeks until lawmakers go home for the August recess. Stockman contends it's unlikely tax reform and an infrastructure package will become reality in this environment — two business-friendly policies seen as a huge benefit to Wall Street. In fact, he warns, the country could see a government shutdown in a matter of months. A scenario like that could wipe out all of the stock market gains since the election and more, according to Stockman. ""I don't know what Wall Street is smoking. They ought to be getting out of the casino while it's still safe. Yet there's this idea that since he [Trump] wasn't incriminated, that proves that we can move on,"" he said. ""I think it's crazy."" Stockman believes the S&P 500 could easily fall to 1,600, about a 34 percent drop from current levels. He's made similar calls like this in the past, but they haven't materialized.

""A lot of people are banking on it to make up for the first-quarter number, it needs to deliver ... I really think that that number might be the trigger point on does this market have the legs to go higher."" First-quarter GDP came in at 1.2 percent, the weakest since the first quarter of 2016. Rather than pile into the U.S., Eibel suggested investors ""take chips off the table and place them around the world globally."" Specifically, he pointed to Europe and emerging markets. ""Our biggest overweight in our international funds is in Europe, we know they're not as cheap as they were, but they're still cheaper than the U.S.,"" he said. Eibel added that European equities will remain more attractive than the U.S. as its economy continues to grow at the same rate as the U.S. and ECB President Mario Draghi maintains interest rates at zero. ""Europe is our biggest overweight in our international funds and a slight overweight to emerging markets in general. Just as oil is certainly not in the mid-20s anymore and developing markets are growing around 4½ percent, the dollar's not quite as strong. So, an overweight to emerging in general and Europe specifically,"" Eibel added.

Brian Price,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"With bullion recently hitting a three-week low of $1,257, one commodities trader is adamant that the charts are signaling sunshine on the horizon for gold bugs. Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services, is undeterred by what's been a volatile June for gold as he believes the commodity will enter into a long-term uptrend swing. ""I'm a longer-term bull in gold and if you look at the long-term chart the trend is still higher,"" Iuorio said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""What the Fed said yesterday is disconcerting to the market, and that's why the dollar rallied so hard."" The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for only the fourth time since the financial crisis, which was expected. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen took a decisively more hawkish tone despite the fact that inflation has fallen behind estimates. Iuorio feels deteriorating data will soon pull dollar prices down and, if gold stays above $1,235, then the longer trend is ultimately positive for the yellow metal. Historically, the dollar and gold are inversely correlated as a fall in dollar prices increases the value of other currencies. Such a move drives demand for commodities, like gold, as investors seek alternative assets to invest in. However, Iuorio warned that more hawkish rhetoric could indeed deter his thesis. ""I'm going to be wrong if they keep that talk up,"" the trader said. ""Gold's going to go lower. If it settles below $1,230, that's going to change me into a bear."" That said, Iuorio doesn't believe the Fed can continue with its hawkish tone and therefore feels confident in where gold prices are heading. Lastly, another factor for gold prices in the near term could be India. Bob Iaccino, of Path Trading Partners, noted on ""Futures Now"" that a tax on the precious metal is slated to go into effect at the end of the month in that country. This could cause local jewelers and private citizens to rush into the market and purchase gold in bulk before the tax comes into play, which would also help drive prices higher.

Keith Speights,06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're looking for some great investing ideas this summer, sometimes the best place to look is to the best investors. Few would dispute that Warren Buffett ranks as one of the all-time greatest investors. And the stocks that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns provide plenty of solid picks for investors who aren't billionaires. General Electric (NYSE:GE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) look especially promising over the long run. Here's why these are three great Warren Buffett stocks to buy in June. Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. General Electric shareholders haven't enjoyed the stock's performance so far in 2017. GE shares are down year to date in part because of first-quarter results that showed lower-than-expected industrial cash flow from operations (CFOA) and mixed results for the company's power segment. But I think this pullback presents a buying opportunity for long-term investors. GE stock now trades at less than 15 times expected earnings. While the company certainly faces some near-term challenges, GE has successfully navigated much more treacherous waters in the past. And things aren't really that terribly bad for the industrial giant now. GE's industrial segment revenue increased slightly in the first quarter, but profits for the segment grew by a respectable 9% compared to the prior-year period. The company continues to be in good shape overall financially. Wall Street analysts project that GE will grow its earnings by an average annual rate of nearly 12% over the next five years -- a big improvement from the company's recent history. While investors wait on GE to return to stronger growth, they should be able to depend on a nice dividend. The company's dividend currently yields 3.44%. It's been a completely different story for Johnson & Johnson this year. Shares of the big healthcare company are up solidly so far in 2017. J&J beat first-quarter earnings estimates, although revenue growth proved sluggish. What's behind the good performance for J&J stock? Probably investors' excitement about the potential for accelerated growth. The company's medical-device business was its top segment in the first quarter. However, with J&J's pharmaceutical segment generating nearly half of total revenue, that's where shareholders really hope for growth. Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky says that his company will grow earnings faster than the overall brand-drug market in the coming years. J&J intends to continue to reap rewards from its current lineup of potential megablockbusters: Stelara, Xarelto, Invega Trinza, Imbruvica, and Darzalex. The company's pipeline could deliver 10 new promising drugs by 2021.  J&J also has great expectations from its acquisition of Actelion. Of course, we couldn't talk about reasons to like Johnson & Johnson stock without mentioning the dividend. J&J is a Dividend Aristocrat, increasing its dividend for the last 54 consecutive years. Its dividend yield currently stands at 2.58%. Wells Fargo stock has been on a bit of a roller-coaster ride in 2017. Shares were up in the first quarter, but down in the second quarter. The fake-account scandal revealed last year continues to haunt the big bank. I think investors would be wise to pay heed to what Buffett said about Wells Fargo, though. Buffett acknowledged that the bank had made a ""huge, huge, huge error."" However, he also said that ""the fundamental earnings power of the bank over a period of years has not been hurt in any material way."" As is often the case, Buffett is probably right. Granted, the issues stemming from the fake-account scandal won't disappear overnight. Wells Fargo must deal with lawsuits over the matter. And it has to recover credibility with customers. I think the company will be able to move past the scandal over time. Wall Street analysts project that Wells Fargo could grow annual earnings at nearly twice the rate over the next five years than it did over the previous five years. While investors wait for Wells Fargo to clean up the mess it made, they can be happy about one thing with the company: its dividend. The bank's dividend currently yields 2.93%. Wells Fargo is using only 38% of its earnings to fund the dividend program, which bodes well for future dividend hikes. ","
      
    3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in June -- The Motley Fool

"John Rosevear, Cory Renauer, and Chuck Saletta",06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. One great stock, to own right now and well into the future. Which one? That's the question we recently put to a group of Foolish specialists. Here's why they singled out Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Cory Renauer (Alphabet Inc.): My pick for the best stock to own right now is benefiting from a huge shift in the way companies advertise, and the best is yet to come. According to PwC, global revenue from internet advertising exceeded that of traditional television for the first time last year. The shift was largely due to surging mobile ad sales, an area Google's parent company is poised to dominate for the foreseeable future. The company recently announced that its Android operating system powers more than two billion devices. Going forward, Alphabet's ""AI-first approach"" will have more data to inform the ads it serves than any of its peers, perhaps more than its only serious competitor in the space, Facebook. Alphabet's Android operating system now powers more than 2 billion devices. Image source: Alphabet Inc. When I picked up my shares of Google in 2012, the stock was depressed because the market assumed the company wouldn't be able to effectively monetize mobile traffic as well as that from desktops. Since then, the company's trailing total revenue has more than doubled, and the stock has more than tripled. Although recent success has pushed Alphabet's stock price up to an eye-watering multiple of 29 times this year's earnings estimates, I still think there's fuel in the tank to push it even higher. The same study from PwC found that mobile ad spending jumped from 35% of the total internet ad revenue pie to 51% last year. By 2021, mobile ads are expected to surge to 75% of total internet ad revenue, a market expected to be worth $116 billion. Chuck Saletta (Wells Fargo): Banking titan Wells Fargo was a darling of Wall Street as we emerged from last decade's financial crisis. One of the stronger megabanks going into the meltdown, it was among the first to emerge and begin restoring its dividends. Yet its recent scandal from opening phony accounts for customers and firing whistleblowers who called out that bad behavior knocked the bank off of its growth trajectory. Its business has suffered in the aftermath, and its shares currently are trading near their lows thus far this year. If you believe Wells Fargo will survive the fallout from this crisis, the market's recent price for the company at around 13 times trailing and 11.6 times expected earnings looks reasonable. If you believe it will not only survive but resume thriving, then its shares look downright cheap. Indeed, Wells Fargo's current price relative to a reasonable return to growth makes it a candidate to be considered the best stock to own today. There are risks involved, of course. As Wells Fargo shareholder Warren Buffett famously said, ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it."" If customers don't return after the scandal, that growth may not really return. As a potential warning, its dividend has held static for five consecutive quarters. That's the first time since the end of financial crisis the company hasn't increased its dividend at least once every four quarters. The market's memory is short, though. If consumers believe Wells Fargo has truly turned around its bad behavior and can again be trusted, then they will return, and those buying shares while the bank was struggling could be richly rewarded. Disclosure: Chuck Saletta owns shares of Wells Fargo. John Rosevear (Facebook): Here's a company with a $450 billion market cap that grew its revenue 54% in 2016, after growing 44% the year before. It seems preposterous that a company that big is still growing that quickly, but that's the reality of Facebook -- and the growth could continue for a long time to come. Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has the company on a highly profitable long-term growth trajectory. Image source: Facebook. Whether you love or hate Facebook, you probably use it. So did nearly 2 billion users a month in the first quarter. (That was up 17% from a year ago, by the way). Facebook has become a key part of how people all over the world communicate and keep up with far-flung friends and family. What's more, it's still growing rapidly and seems set to keep growing for years to come. With that growth have come fat profits, just over $3 billion last quarter, and a fast-growing cash hoard that totaled $32.3 billion as of quarter end. Did I mention that Facebook has no debt? That cash can be put to work via acquisitions or ""moonshot"" technology initiatives to boost profits, returned to shareholders, or both: Either way, shareholders stand to win big over time. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has plenty of skin in the game and is very well-regarded by Facebook employees (he's consistently among the highest-rated CEOs on Glassdoor.) His vision, paired with COO Sheryl Sandberg's execution, have put Facebook on a fast-growth path that looks likely to reward its shareholders for years to come. I'm happy to be among them. ","
      
    Roundtable: The Single Best Stock to Own Today -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you follow bank stocks and big bank stocks, in particular, you should get acquainted with the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks. I refer to it frequently when I write, and therefore want to give readers a brief overview of exactly what it is, and why investors should care about it. The best way to think about the KBW Bank Index is to analogize it to the S&P 500, which tracks shares of 500 publicly traded companies with the largest market capitalizations in the United States. But instead of being industry agnostic, as the S&P 500 is, the KBW Bank Index focuses on only large-cap banks -- 24 of them, to be precise. These are banks that you've no doubt heard of, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). These are the four biggest banks in the country. They're also -- with the exception of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), the best-run big bank in the country -- the four that are weighted most heavily on the KBW Bank Index. The index weights its components according to a measure of market capitalization, adjusted for a bank's share price. This helps to explain why, as you can see in the table below, Citigroup carries the greatest weight on the Index, even though it has a smaller market capitalization than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, respectively. Name Weight on KBW Bank Index Citigroup 8.82% Bank of America 7.85% JPMorgan Chase 7.83% US Bancorp 7.83% Wells Fargo 7.68% State Street 4.54% Bank of New York Mellon 4.30% Northern Trust 4.03% PNC Financial 3.97% M&T Bank 3.97% SunTrust Banks 3.87% KeyCorp 3.81% BB&T 3.76% Fifth Third 3.63% Citizens Financial 3.52% Capital One 3.48% Regions Financial 3.30% First Republic Bank 2.86% Huntington Bancshares 2.75% Comerica 2.47% SVB Financial 1.80% Zions Bancorporation 1.65% New York Community Bancorp 1.25% People's United Financial 1.06% Source: Invesco. There's one side note that's worth pointing out when it comes to the KBW Bank Index. That is, not all of these banks have the same business model. Some are universal banks, which operate both investment and commercial-banking operations. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup fall most comfortably into this category. A second group consists of so-called custodial or trust banks. The three banks on the list that most naturally fall into this category are State Street, Northern Trust, and Bank of New York Mellon -- and I consider the latter to be a particularly interesting bank. These banks focus less on making loans and taking deposits and more on the administration of fixed-income securities for institutional investors like hedge funds, university endowments, and insurance companies. The final group are pure-play commercial banks, specializing in taking deposits and making loans. When most people think about a bank's business model, this is what they have in mind. The largest among these is Wells Fargo, followed by U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial, and Capital One Financial, respectively. Image source: Getty Images. An index like this is important for investors because it allows you to see whether a particular stock is in line with its peer group. Viewed in isolation, it's impossible to say whether a particular bank stock is cheap or expensive -- or efficient or inefficient -- or whatever metric it is that you're trying to tease out. But if you have a control group against which to compare a bank's valuation, profitability, or efficiency, then you can get a much better idea of its relative value or performance, which explains why I can confidently say that U.S. Bancorp is the best-run big bank in the country. This is what the KBW Bank Index enables one to do. And it's why I recommend that investors have a general understanding of what it is and how to use it. ","

Christy Bieber,06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chase announced recently that its Sapphire, Sapphire Preferred, and Sapphire Reserve cardholders would be eligible for 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points if they obtained a mortgage with Chase bank by Aug. 6, 2017.  The offer was available only for current cardholders and only for a new purchase, not a refinance. It was not the first offer of its kind -- Capital One also made an offer of free mileage last year, and Wells Fargo has offered rebates for mortgage loans in the past -- but it was a generous offer, with rewards points worth around 2.1 cents per point. While getting points or other rewards for taking out a mortgage loan seems attractive if you're thinking about buying a home anyway, there are three big reasons why it's unwise to go with a particular mortgage lender just to earn miles or other credit card rewards. Image Source: Getty Images. Chase made its announcement in May and stipulated that cardholders who want the points would have to apply by the deadline on Aug. 6. This is a very limited amount of time to do your research into the mortgage terms offered by different lenders. Most incentive deals that mortgage lenders offer have deadlines, which puts artificial time pressure on you. Your mortgage will likely be the biggest debt you carry during your lifetime. You need time to carefully compare the different fees, interest rates, mortgage points, and other terms various lenders will offer you. The process shouldn't be rushed, and you shouldn't try to move faster than you're comfortable with just so you don't miss out on credit card points, airline miles, or other incentives. Your credit card points will be spent within a matter of months, while airlines miles earned for taking out a loan last only a trip or two. A mortgage is an obligation lasting 15 to 30 years. If you buy a house before you're ready because you don't want to miss out on a mortgage incentive, you'll be stuck with a real estate commission, transfer tax, and a host of other expensive costs if you need to sell the home. Unless you have all of your ducks on a row -- like a 20% down payment at the ready, as well as an emergency fund to cover maintenance and repairs -- you could also end up having to pay for private mortgage insurance or fall into debt if something unexpected happens. If you jump into a loan too fast, you may also feel the need to refinance a few years down the road in order to get better terms. Refinancing is a costly process, as you have to pay for a new appraisal and the closing costs of the new loan. Getting out of one mortgage loan and into another is also a time-consuming process that requires you to produce lots of paperwork. Banks may make up the cost by charging a slightly higher mortgage loan rate -- Chase's rates as of late May were 3.875% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan, while Bankrate had some lenders offering rates as low as 3.750% -- or they may charge more than other lenders for various costs like the credit check, home appraisal, loan origination fee, or underwriting fee. Even a small difference in interest can make a big difference in payments. A $200,000 loan at 3.750% would cost you $926 per month, and the total loan cost would be $333,443. By comparison, the same $200,000 mortgage at a 3.875% interest rate would come with payments of $940 per month, and the total cost of the loan would be $338,571. That tiny difference in the interest rate would cost you an extra $5,000 over the life of the loan -- and odds are the rewards you earned wouldn't come close to that value. Don't cheat yourself out of thousands of dollars by falling for a gimmick. Wait until you're ready to buy a home, carefully research different lenders with good reputations, and choose the best overall deal. If you just happen to get a reward from that lender, that bonus will be icing on the cake. ","

Todd Campbell,06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. At the start of June, fellow Fool Eric Volkman noted that Mallinckrodt PLC (NYSE:MNK) was considering the sale of its generic drug business for as much as $2 billion. Today, Wall Street research firm Wells Fargo is out with a note saying that the company is considering all of its options, including going private. Are Mallinckrodt's days as a public company numbered? Mallinckrodt is the generic drug business that was spun off by Covidien in 2013. Since then, the company's been transforming itself away from generic drugs to specialty drugs that face less competition and command higher profit margins. Image source: Getty Images. In 2014, it paid $5.6 billion to buy Questcor Pharmaceuticals to get its hands on H.P. Acthar Gel, one of the planet's priciest drugs. Acthar Gel is used to treat rare immune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, and rheumatology. Questcor had acquired Acthar Gel in 2001 for $100,000. At the time, it was a decades-old toss-away drug with limited commercial value. Over the following decade, however, its sales ballooned to over $1 billion per year as prices soared and marketing of it grew across more indications. In 2014, I noted how the average revenue per vial sold of Acthar Gel had increased to $28,000 from $18,000 in 2011, and as a result, Acthar Gel's 2,500 prescriptions per quarter were producing sales at a nearly billion-dollar pace. Since then, sales have gone even higher. In Q1 2016, Acthar Gel's sales totaled $271.8 million, up 9.4% year over year. Acthar Gel isn't Mallinckrodt's only specialty drug, either. It also sells Inomax, Ofirmev, and its Therakos immunology platform. In Q1, those products produced sales of $128.4 million, $73.4 million, and $51.2 million, respectively. A lot of Mallinckrodt's generics business comes from selling opioid pain killers, and demand for those drugs has been falling as doctors rein in their use because of rising awareness of the opioid epidemic. Mallinckrodt has also come under fire because of Acthar Gel's pricing. Since it has been available for decades, and its price has climbed significantly over the years, it's little wonder that Mallinckrodt's under the microscope amid a widespread pushback on drug prices. Unfortunately for investors, sliding opioid sales and scrutiny over pricing have taken a toll on Mallinckrodt's growth rate. Total revenue of $810.9 million in the first quarter fell 0.6% from the same quarter in 2016, and operating income in the quarter was $90.2 million, down from $132.4 million a year ago. Fear of greater declines in opioid demand and the risk of pricing pressure on specialty drugs has been a big weight on Mallinckrodt's share price. MNK Total Return Price data by YCharts. Fears have been fueled by short-sellers that have targeted the company after concluding it could struggle to pay its debt if sales head materially lower. Mallinckrodt responded to short-sellers with assurances it has the operating cash and money in the bank necessary to fulfill its obligations. Operating income was $90 million in Q1, and as of March 31, the company has $279 million in cash and $5.7 billion in long-term debt. Its interest expense was $94 million last quarter. So far, assurances haven't kick-started the company's ailing share price, and as a result, an argument could be made that investors are too pessimistic about the company's opportunities, including drugs that are advancing in its pipeline. That view could add credibility to the idea that the company's board of directors is more than willing to explore strategic alternatives, including an outright sale. If the company can find a suitor, or line up financing from private equity to go private, it could focus on its business without suffering the distractions associated with the scrutiny of being a public company. Importantly, such a deal could provide it with additional financing for debt reduction, acquisitions, and R&D, too. Of course, anything's possible, but given that this company's got lots of challenges to overcome, and we're only speculating about a potential sale, I think most investors might be better off focusing on buying growing businesses without the same levels of risk as Mallinckrodt.

"Motley Fool Staff, John Maxfield, and Gaby Lapera",06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Since Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG) went public in 2014, investors have seen a meaningful improvement in its performance. In the first quarter of this year, for instance, both its profitability and efficiency metrics made substantial year-over-year gains. A full transcript follows the video. Gaby Lapera: Citizens Financial was actually spun off from the Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS). The Royal Bank of Scotland is not the most guilt-free financial institution, I guess you could say it that way, going into the financial crisis. Mistakes were made. So, Citizens Financial got spun off. John Maxfield: That's right. Citizens Financial was a relatively small bank when a few decades ago the Royal Bank of Scotland purchased it. They invested in it, boosted it up, it grew and grew. It's now one of the largest banks in New England. That's its stronghold. It's based in Providence, Rhode Island, it has $150 billion in assets now. But Royal Bank of Scotland's, like so many other banks during the financial crisis, got into a whole bunch of trouble, making bad loans, making bad decisions strategically. So they had to, in the immediate wake of the crisis, at the direction of regulators, they basically had to shut down growth and just focus on retreating and retrenching, which is not uncommon for banks in the financial crisis. But the position that put Citizens in is that it put it at a really competitive disadvantage against the company like, well, Wells Fargo is in kind of a different place now than it was back then, because they have the whole fake account scandal last year, but Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, these guys were able to continue growing and growing and growing. But Citizens, when it was still a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, it was watching everybody grow, but because of the restrictions on the Royal Bank of Scotland in terms of having to de-risk its balance sheet and shrink as opposed to grow, Citizens Financial was directly impacted by that. Then in 2014, it spun off in an initial public offering, so, it went public, and it was the biggest IPO of a bank in United States history. I can't remember exactly, don't quote me on this exactly, but I think it had something like $120 [billion]-$130 billion in assets when it went public. So, it was already a large bank when it went on to the market. Lapera: Yeah. Being a large bank has advantages and disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that you're subject to a lot of regulatory stuff. So, they're getting spun out from their parent company and dumped into the world in not a great time for them, because 2014 was when things were starting to turn around and look good for banks. I think a lot of banks were doing OK by then, but Citizens came out in a really tough spot for a bank. Maxfield: Yeah, it absolutely did. I think you can look at that as a glass-half-full, glass-half-empty perspective. When I was talking to Bruce Van Saun, I got the impression that he looks at it as a glass half full, coming from that perspective, and here's why. In the immediate wake of the financial crisis, one of the main things that really hit the banks, you had the subprime mortgage crisis, that hurt banks. But the banks who that really hurt were the ones who securitized those mortgages, and then sold them in securities to other institutional investors, and then in the process of securitizing those and selling those, there were incorrect things said in those documents, or misrepresentations. And that's what caused the losses at these big banks, like Bank of America and Citigroup. But if you look at a lot of the other banks across the country, the thing that really hit them was commercial real estate loans. These are like development loans, so it's just a piece of land that's priced up when the market is doing really well, and then the bank will loan on that, and if the market falls out, there's nothing on that property to act as effective collateral. So, one of the things that the Royal Bank of Scotland forced throughout this entire organization was, I'm not sure they completely stopped making commercial real estate loans, or if they just throttled it significantly, but when Citizens spun out of the Royal Bank of Scotland, it was way behind in commercial real estate loans, way behind in mortgage loans, way behind in all of these other things, which meant that, to a certain extent, there was only one direction to go, and that was up. And we're starting to see that come through right now in Citizens' performance. ","

Of all the months of the year, June may be the most important for Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) stock in 2017. There are two catalysts in particular that could cause shares of the nation's second biggest bank by assets to either advance or retreat. The first catalyst will arrive this week. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is meeting to decide whether to raise interest rates. It will announce the decision on Wednesday, and if it does in fact increase rates, as most people expect it to do, it will mark the second time this year that it's done so. The Fed's decision will boil down to two variables, the first being unemployment. Based on this alone, there's every reason to believe that the central bank will in fact hike the Fed funds rate, the primary short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States. The current unemployment rate of 4.3% is comfortably below the Fed's 5% target. This accordingly weighs in favor of a rate hike. US Unemployment Rate data by YCharts. The second variable is inflation. This too seems to suggest that the Fed will raise rates, as the latest inflation data showed that consumer prices rose by 2.2% over the same month last year. This is above the Fed's 2% target, which suggests that higher interest rates may be appropriate to slow the advance of consumer prices. Bank of America would welcome such a move. In its latest quarterly regulatory filing, the bank noted that a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates will translate into $3.3 billion in additional net interest income over the following 12 months. The Fed isn't likely to raise rates that much this month -- a 25-basis-point boost is more likely -- but that's nevertheless a step in the right direction. To put it in perspective, when the Fed raised rates by 25 basis points in March, Bank of America said it would earn $150 million in added net interest income a quarter. The second catalyst that could impact Bank of America's stock is its performance on this year's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR. This is the second step in the annual stress tests that the Fed uses to assess whether the nation's largest banks will be able to survive an economic downturn akin to the financial crisis. The CCAR is critical because it dictates whether a bank can increase its dividend and/or buy back more stock. Bank of America's performance on past stress tests, combined with its cautious approach to capital-return requests, has stymied that Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's desire to raise its dividend in prior years. While competitors like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase have increased their quarterly payouts every year since 2010, Bank of America has done so only twice. Bank of America's headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: Getty Images. Anything is possible, but when the Fed releases CCAR results on June 30, there's every reason to believe it will allow Bank of America to raise both its dividend and allowance for stock buybacks. Not only is Bank of America more than adequately capitalized, it has also seen its earnings grow and become more consistent over the past few years, both of which weigh on the Fed's decision to approve or deny requests by banks to increase the amount of capital they return to shareholders. All of this is good news for Bank of America, but it doesn't necessarily mean you should buy its stock right now. Because these two catalysts are widely expected to occur, they're already likely baked into Bank of America's stock price. Additionally, the turmoil in the nation's capital, combined with the unfolding legislative paralysis in Congress, as well as the market's already lofty valuation, lead me to believe that investors have more to gain than to lose by waiting for a potential pullback before diving headlong into the market.

                                    for Simple and haven’t looked back. Until this past weekend. I love the digital bank, with its clean design and great user experience, and have even convinced a few of my friends to join it. Using its envelope-based budgeting system and “goals” feature that does automatically puts savings away by a certain date, I have saved thousands of dollars in the few months since switching and I feel more financially healthy than ever. But since Friday, I was unable to access my account’s accurate balance or any of my recent activity. For me, the issue underscored some of the risks of going completely digital with finances. As of Tuesday afternoon, the system is up and running again. Over the last four days, the issue was affecting up to 5% of the company’s customers, a spokeswoman from Simple, which was founded in 2009, told MarketWatch. “It’s taking longer than usual for new transactions to appear in the ‘activity feed’ list for some customers,” the spokeswoman said. “Purchases will go through just fine but they might not show up in your activity or balance right away. Card purchases and other transactions are not affected — they are working as normal.” Simple would not comment on the number of active users it has, but estimates vary dramatically. It reportedly had 33,387 customers, according to FastCompany. (Simple declined to comment on that figure.) Since then, it has expanded its user base. Simple’s chief executive officer Josh Reich told Forbes last year that if it was a traditional bank it would need 850 branches to support its current customer base. That would put Simple’s customers at closer to 2.9 million customers, according to one calculation, by The Financial Brand, a publication that focuses on banks and credit unions. Some customers have tweeted about the same problems since Friday and three of those confirmed to MarketWatch that they too still don’t have access to their transactions and haven’t since June 10. Outages at financial institutions aren’t unheard of: in 2011, Bank of America’s website experienced nearly a week of disruptions and Vanguard Group reimbursed some customers who lost money in March after they were unable to log into the company’s website during a trading session one day. The “goals” section of Simple is not very useful when you don’t know how much you can afford to contribute. Simple’s customer service has been extremely responsive through the in-app support chat feature and status page. “Our team is working to resolve this as quickly as possible so you can expect to see your activity feed list updating at normal speed soon,” the Simple spokeswoman added.

Peter Morici,06152017,MarketWatch,06082017,"Published: June 14, 2017 10:10 a.m. ET The outlook for mortgage rates, wages, stocks won’t change very much By The Fed’s policy making committee is expected to increase the target for the federal funds rate to 1% to 1.25% on Wednesday. Before Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that Congress would have to raise the debt ceiling before its summer recess, the Fed was expected to push the policy rate another 25 basis points in September and to start gradually winding down its holdings of mortgage-backed-securities and Treasuries in December. Now the September rate increase may be delayed until Congress and the administration sort out the debt-ceiling issue and agree on funding for the government past the end of the fiscal year. However, the pause will be temporary, and the process of tightening will likely continue until the fed funds rate is in the range of 3%. Those moves are not likely to have a profound effect on the economy, as the scars of the financial crisis continue to heal. Here’s what to expect from gradual tightening from historic lows. 1. Mortgage rates are not likely to increase much The effects of Fed tightening importantly depend on whether a higher federal funds rate pushes up the 10-year Treasury rate, because mortgages, corporate and municipal bonds rates generally follow the 10-year rate up and down. When Ben Bernanke raised the federal funds rate in 2004-2006, the yield curve flattened, because the Chinese government was purchasing U.S. bonds at a maddening pace to keep the yuan cheap against the dollar. The Chinese, Japanese and European economies face continuing challenges and their monetary policies are likely to remain more accommodating than ours. Now private investors are seeking safer and better returns, and they will continue purchasing U.S. securities, limiting any increase in U.S. longer-term interest rates. Wells Fargo’s economists assume the Fed will increase the federal funds rates by 125 basis points by the end of 2018, and estimate the 10-year Treasury and conventional mortgage rates will rise only 50 and 38 basis points respectively. Also read: Fed should consider raising 2% inflation target, prominent economists say 2. Bank fees and car loans will get more expensive Dodd-Frank regulations have pushed up banks’ costs for providing ordinary retail services. Higher short-term borrowing costs for banks will make things even tougher, and they can be expected to try to raise fees on checking accounts and other services, and to charge higher rates for short-term credit — credit cards, car loans and home improvements. The good news is banks may start competing more for your money and pay somewhat higher rates on CDs. 3. Economic growth won’t be much affected Households are more confident these days — jobs are a bit easier to get, credit scores are at historic highs, and wages may finally start to rise. Those factors should overwhelm the consequences for consumers of somewhat higher short-term interest rates. The recovery in oil prices last year has inspired more investment in the petroleum industry but the dollar

For manufacturers and service producers that compete globally, the former increases demand but the latter accentuates competition from imports and makes U.S. sales abroad more difficult. On balance though, economic growth should be close to 2.3%. A bit better than the 2.1% for the Bush and Obama recoveries but well below the 3.4% pace accomplished during the Reagan-Clinton era. 4. Impact of the Trump presidency on jobs and wages will be limited President Donald Trump won the election promising to create more good-paying jobs by replacing Obamacare with something less expensive, reducing taxes on businesses and individuals, rolling back regulations, and reducing trade deficits with China and other trading partners. He faces tough resistance from Democrats and with the possible exception of deregulation, difficult divisions within his own party. Jobs creation will stay roughly in line with the 187,000 a month averaged in 2016. However, with unemployment remaining well below 5%, getting a raise should be a bit easier for those already employed or looking to change jobs. 5. Stock prices will continue strong Whenever the Fed changes course investors react and some turbulence in stock prices cannot be ruled out. The Trump rally makes some temporary adjustment even more likely. However, the outlook for profits growth remains robust, and judged against historical standards the market is not overvalued. Consider how efficiently an economy built more and more on technology uses capital returns on investment, and stocks are likely to rise.

Greg Robb,06152017,MarketWatch,06082017,"Published: June 14, 2017 1:25 p.m. ET Soft prices, less vigorous recovery raise doubts about September rate hike By The tame inflation and weak retail-sales data released Wednesday won’t deter the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest rates later in the day but do raise doubts about another rate hike in September. Economists said the Fed will not want to back away from a rate hike Wednesday that has already been signaled. “The action the Fed is likely to take later today has already been well justified and well previewed,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. Vince Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon Asset Management, said Fed officials repeated the same message over and over: the weak first-quarter spending was transitory, the economy is at full employment and inflation is headed toward the goal of 2%. “At this point, such a repetition is like entering into a contract,” he said.

While a June hike remains pretty much a certainty, the rest of the year has been thrown in doubt. The Fed has penciled in three hikes this year. Traders who bet on future rate hikes now see less than a 15% chance of a September rate hike and about a 40% chance of a move in December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. “Unless they get these inflation numbers up, I can’t believe they go ahead in September. I think they are going to skip it,” said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. Treasury yields tumbled after the weak data.

See:  What Yellen is expected to say at her press conference Complicating the outlook a bit is that the central bank is edging closer to launching a plan to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Tannenbaum thinks the Fed will take the first steps to shrink the balance sheet in September. He said the central bank in tightening in the face of softer economic outlook because the Fed wants to “normalize financial conditions.” “Most indicators of financial conditions are quite easy, the Fed is interested in bringing them back to something more neutral,” Tannenbaum said.

Rex Nutting,06152017,MarketWatch,06082017,"Published: June 13, 2017 12:58 p.m. ET By President Donald Trump hasn’t yet made his mark on the U.S. economy, despite the euphoria on one side and the dread of the other that greeted his election, said Brian Wesbury, chief economist for First Trust Advisors. Wesbury and his deputy, Bob Stein, are winners of the MarketWatch Forecaster of the Month contest for May. “We try not to let political emotions affect our macro outlook,” Wesbury said in an interview. “We wait for real policy changes” before changing the forecast. Read Wesbury’s blog. “We haven’t had anything yet,” he said. Sure, Trump enacted a freeze on federal hiring, and he rolled back a few regulations, but the major changes he championed during his campaign have yet to be fulfilled. There’s been no tax cut enacted, federal spending hasn’t changed in any fundamental way, and the major regulatory changes are still a work in progress. Even Obamacare remains in place. Without major changes, “this is still a ‘plow-horse’ economy” only able to grow about 2%, he said. But Wesbury said, if Trump gets his way on tax cuts, health care, and deregulation, the economy could grow at a 3% rate. The risks are mostly to the upside, Wesbury said. Any fears that Trump would provoke a trade war have dissipated. Wesbury thinks the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this week, but he doesn’t think it will slow the economy. “A 1% rate is not holding anybody back,” he said. He’s much more focused on the Fed’s “bloated balance sheet,” which the Fed will start to unwind later in the year. “As long as there’s any excess reserves, I argue that the Fed isn’t actually tight.” And because a monetary policy mistake is practically the only way to knock the economy off its perch, he doesn’t think a recession is in the cards for at least three more years. Competing against 46 other forecasting teams, Wesbury and Stein had the most accurate forecasts on two of the 10 indicators we tracked in the May contest: The trade deficit and the CPI. Their forecasts on three others — payrolls, durable goods orders, and new home sales — were among the 10 most accurate. It’s the fifth time Wesbury has won the monthly award that we instituted in 2003 to honor those forecasters who are the most accurate at predicting the economic data that move markets. The runners-up in the May contest were Sam Coffin of UBS, Ted Wieseman of Morgan Stanley and Michael Feroli of J.P. Morgan Chase. Finally, Spencer Staples of EconAlpha and Michelle Girard’s team at NatWest tied for fifth place.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday as an influential U.S. Federal Reserve official expressed confidence that rising wages would help revive domestic inflation, which has shown signs of softening recently. The yen fell to two-week lows against the greenback and the euro after officials of the Bank of Japan at a meeting on Friday downplayed the likelihood that the bank would begin to roll back emergency stimulus to support the economy. Remarks by New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday that tightening in the labor market should help drive up inflation helped offset concerns by some investors that stubbornly low inflation would not allow policy-makers to raise rates further the rest of this year. “The Fed doesn’t seem to be too concerned about the recent pullback in the inflation data. They are committed to policy normalization,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Last week, the Fed, as expected, raised key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point and left the door open for another rate increase later this year. It also provided details on its plan to reduce its bond purchases in a bid to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent,” Dudley told a local business group in Plattsburg, New York. Traders raised their outlook on a rate hike by the Fed’s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting to 47 percent from 41 percent late on Friday FFZ7 FFF8, CME Group’s FedWatch tool showed. The dollar index .DXY, which gauges the dollar against six other currencies, was up 0.4 percent at 97.537. The euro was down 0.4 percent versus the greenback, to $1.1147 EUR=, while against the yen the dollar increased 0.5 percent, at 111.43 yen JPY=. The euro was up 0.1 percent against the yen, at 124.25 yen EURJPY=. Positioning data showed net bullish bets on the euro reached their highest level in more than six years last week. There was no discernible boost for the single currency from the landslide victory of French President Emmanuel Macron’s government in parliamentary elections on Sunday. Sterling declined 0.4 percent to $1.2732 GBP=D3 as Britain began formal negotiations on its planned exit from the European Union. The UK ruling Conservative Party’s loss of its parliament majority earlier this month raised speculation of a drift toward a “soft Brexit,” which had supported the pound. Many analysts, however, expect developments from the talks would hurt sterling. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s apparent “indifference” toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency’s power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the “cramming” of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a “conspicuous silence” on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short, “gossamer” memo “modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.” Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury’s hands for six months. The CFPB’s role as a public watchdog “extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,” Pauley wrote. “Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,” he added. “It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.” The CFPB declined to comment.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"June 15 (Reuters) - Metlife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, announced added responsibilities for some of its senior executives, adding to the pool of potential successors to its chief executive. The largest U.S. life insurer named Michel Khalaf president of its U.S. business, effective July 1, to replace Maria Morris who retires from the company this fall. Marty Lippert, the company’s head of global technology and operations will take on added responsibility of MetLife Holdings, the company said. The appointments of Khalaf and Lippert set up a “horse race” for MetLife’s CEO position, held by Steven Kandarian, 65, who currently has no plans to retire from his role, an analyst with Wells Fargo said in a note. Other potential candidates for the top job include Chief Financial Officer John Hele, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart, and Asia head Christopher Townsend, the note said. In June last year, Metlife’s board agreed to waive off its 65-year retirement policy for Kandarian, who has been the company’s president and CEO since May 2011. Ramy Tadros will also join MetLife in September as the new chief risk officer, the company said. Tadros comes from Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, where he served as the global head of insurance. He will replace Stan Talbi, who will retire at the end of August after 43 years with MetLife. (Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp said on Thursday it received U.S. approval for its emergency epinephrine syringes to treat severe allergic reactions that it intends to be a lower cost rival to Mylan NV’s widely used EpiPen, sending its shares up more than 50 percent. The company said it was looking for a marketing partner and would set a price for the product before its launch sometime in the second half of this year. Adamis said its pre-filled epinephrine syringes would be sold under the brand name Symjepi. Mylan has faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations after it doubled the cost for a pair of EpiPens to around $600, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing debate over the high cost of prescription medicines in the United States. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor. “We plan to position the product as a lower cost alternative,” Mark Flather, senior director for investor relations and corporate communications for Adamis, told Reuters. “We want to be part of the solution.” Epinephrine is the life-saving recommended treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications. Mylan has for years owned more than 90 percent of the market for emergency epinephrine injectors and its own authorized generic has recently surpassed sales of the branded version. “With an anticipated lower cost and attractive design, we believe Symjepi will be a meaningful competitor to EpiPen,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a research note. Other rival products are available. Impax Laboratories Inc’s Adrenaclick device is being sold through CVS Health Corp’s drugstore chain for about $110 a pair. Privately held Kaleo earlier this year began selling its Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector that it reacquired from Sanofi SA under an unusual pricing strategy but with little  success so far. The company said it would make the product available at no cost to many consumers but charge insurers $4,500. Sanofi in April sued Mylan, accusing it of engaging in illegal practices to squash EpiPen competition when the French drugmaker held the Auvi-Q rights. Adamis shares soared 53.3 percent to close at $5.75 on the Nasdaq and further rose to $6.00 in extended trading. Mylan shares closed down 2.4 percent at $36.98. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - London-based startup Blockchain has raised $40 million (31.5 million pounds) in a fresh round of funding as the software company rides a wave of enthusiasm for digital currency technology. Nokota Management and Digital Currency Group also participated in the financing round, which boosted Blockchain’s total funding to more than $70 million Tom Hulme, general partner at Alphabet’s venture firm GV, said the firm invested because “the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched.” Founded in 2011, Blockchain makes software that allows consumers and businesses to make transactions using digital currencies such as bitcoin. The firm is named after the internet platform that records and validates transactions between two parties without relying on an intermediary such as a bank. Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product. “Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,” Smith said. “My grandmother uses our product today.” The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology. While far from mainstream, digital currency has enjoyed growing popularity that Smith attributes to the instability of traditional currencies in places such as Brazil, and political uncertainty in Britain and the United States. The day after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Smith said, Blockchain had the second-highest number of new users sign up in a single day. “In you’re in an environment of rapidly deteriorating geopolitical stability,” Smith said, “you are open to new ideas and new products.” (1 British pound = $1.2686) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage of an annual stress test, showing they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession to meet regulatory requirements, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed’s most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year’s level. “This year’s results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,” said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank. “This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.” The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations. Wall Street analysts and trade groups quickly cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis. “We see today’s...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,” said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent. “From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,” he said. Thursday’s results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed’s methodology, using materials they submitted. The second portion of the test, to be released on Wednesday, will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks’ capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed’s. Under the Fed’s worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. However, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks’ aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more of its stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed’s approval. Under the Fed’s examination, Citi’s minimum CET1 ratio in the most stressful scenario was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Citi’s own analysis showed that metric at 10 percent. The Fed’s assessment showed the other five largest banks - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley - having minimum CET1 ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent. Of those, Goldman Sachs had the biggest optimism gap compared with the Fed when it came to the worst-case scenario. Its model produced a 9.8 percent minimum CET1 ratio, 1.4 points better than the Fed’s. Wells Fargo’s metric also fared better in its own test than under the Fed’s, by 0.8 of a point. Conversely, JPMorgan’s analysis appeared to be more dour, with its CET1 ratio coming in 1.3 percentage points below the Fed’s. Bank of America’s was 0.7 of a point worse. Banks that decide to resubmit their plans can only make downward revisions to the amount of capital they plan to use, meaning management teams that were too conservative may regret their submissions even if they pass. “If there is disappointment next week,” said Seiberg, “it is likely because the banks failed to ask for big enough distributions more than it is because the Federal Reserve was too tough.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - It took less than 24 hours for Warren Buffett, one of the world’s savviest dealmakers, to make a C$360 million (US$272 million) paper profit by propping up a major Canadian lender on life support. “It’s a typical Buffett bailout trade,” said Jared Dillian, an independent investment strategist and former trader betting the value of the Canadian dollar and several Canadian banks will fall. “He’s set it up where he’s risking a small amount to make a lot.” Its share price soared 27.2 percent on Thursday to C$19.00, leaving Buffett with a potential 90 percent paper profit on shares he is buying for just C$10 each. Home Capital’s share price nonetheless remains nearly two-thirds below its 2014 peak. “The deal is really low risk,” said John Huber, a portfolio manager at Saber Capital Management LLC in Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns Berkshire stock. “It’s an opportunistic deal that gives him very attractive risk-return terms.” Berkshire’s infusion was much needed by Home Capital, which has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run after being accused of, and then admitting to, concealing mortgage fraud. “The assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving,” said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst. “It implies a seal of approval.” Berkshire’s investment lets Buffett deploy some of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills. “Today’s announcement is a modest positive,” wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst. “But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.” Berkshire’s Columbia Insurance unit is acquiring the Home Capital equity, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, the credit line, if fully tapped, could generate C$180 million for Berkshire. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. His $5 billion Bank of America bet looks particularly savvy: it throws off $300 million in annual dividends, and Berkshire is sitting on an $11 billion gain on accompanying warrants. But with most of those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to requests for further comment. Home Capital’s problems accelerated in mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. “Reputational risk is why he’s getting 9 percent interest” at Home Capital, Seifert said. Berkshire has other investments tied to real estate, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. It also has several investments in Canada, including the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, for which it paid about $C3.1 billion in 2014. Many of Berkshire’s more than 90 business units also offer goods and services in the country, including the Ben Bridge jeweler, Benjamin Moore paints and the BNSF railroad. Despite his paper profit on Home Capital, Buffett believes investment gains and losses in a given period are usually meaningless. Buffett’s foray into Canadian real estate comes amid uncertainty about that country’s housing sector. The Ontario government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is “not going to stop the credit cycle up there,” said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital. “But it’s a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Youth tobacco use in the United States fell to historic lows in 2016, leading public health experts to speculate that a smoke-free generation may be within reach. The number of middle and high school students who used any tobacco product fell to 3.9 million in 2016 from 4.7 million in 2015, figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show, the first such decline since the CDC began reporting the measure in 2011. The number of high school students who smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior to being surveyed fell to 8 percent from 9.3 percent in 2015, the data shows. In 2011 the number was 15.8 percent. “This represents a historic public health victory,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, adding that the dramatic decline was the result of public messaging campaigns directed at youth. The decline in e-cigarette use was even greater, falling to 11.3 percent of high schoolers in 2016 from 16 percent in 2015. “These numbers are astounding,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the department of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health. “It really means that we may be within reach of a smoke-free generation.” The decline in cigarette use follows a broad array of public health campaigns and coincides with the rise of vaping. “This should put to bed any remaining concerns that e-cigarettes are a gateway to cigarettes or will lead to a re-normalization of smoking,” Siegel said. Between 2011 and 2016 overall tobacco use remained unchanged, the CDC’s figures show, though the balance between products changed. As e-cigarette use increased, traditional cigarette use declined. Cigarette use among high school students fell during that period to 8 percent from 15.8 percent while use of cigars fell to 7.7 percent from 11.6 percent. At the same time use of e-cigarettes rose to 11.3 percent from 1.5 percent and use of hookahs rose to 4.8 percent from 4.1 percent. President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes a nearly 20 percent drop in the CDC’s disease prevention and health promotion programs, including eliminating dedicated funding for its Office on Smoking and Health. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement that while the latest figures were encouraging “it is critical that we work to ensure this downward trend continues over the long term across all tobacco products.” He said the agency had issued more than 4,000 warning letters to retailers for selling e-cigarettes, cigars or hookah tobacco to minors since youth access restrictions went into effect last August. Gottlieb, who previously held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, has said publicly that certain e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. The latest data showed no decline in cigarette use among middle school students, where the rate was 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2015. Among middle school students, 4.3 percent used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 5.3 percent in 2015. Analysts with Wells Fargo Securities expect sales of vaping products to reach $4.4 billion in 2017.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters Health) - Tobacco companies have been selling electronic cigarettes as a way to wean smokers off paper cigarettes, but a new study suggests the strategy could backfire. The report in Preventive Medicine found that young adults who occasionally smoked conventional cigarettes smoked more of them if they also used e-cigarettes – battery-powered gadgets that heat liquid nicotine into vapor. “The participants who were vaping ended up using more cigarettes. It’s actually a risk factor for increasing their cigarette use,” lead author Neal Doran said in a phone interview. “They’re not using e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking,” said Doran, a psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Though smokers have been turning to e-cigarettes since they came on the market in 2007 as a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco, little is known about the long-term effects of the practice known as “vaping.” E-cigarette use grew 900 percent among high school students from 2011 through 2015, according to a report from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The 2016 report declares e-cigarettes “unsafe” for youth and young adults (bit.ly/2sKHv9P). The new study’s findings are “consistent with the worry that, regardless of whether vaping is itself unsafe, vaping causes worse outcomes because it leads to more consumption of cigarettes,” Doran said. Stanton Glantz, who directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the study “has tremendous policy implications.” “What this study shows very convincingly is that if they’re using e-cigarettes it’s actually leading them to smoke more conventional cigarettes, not less,” he said. Glantz was not involved with the new study, but the findings are consistent with those of previous research he conducted on adolescents. “The e-cigarettes are having the effect of stimulating conventional cigarette smoking,” he said in a phone interview. “They’re propping up and reinforcing the conventional cigarette market.” Doran and his team studied 319 Californians, ages 18 to 24. At the start, participants did not smoke daily but had smoked at least one cigarette in the prior six months. During the study, they reported their frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use five times at three-month intervals. Those who vaped more also reported smoking 18 percent more cigarettes, the study found. “In the larger scheme of things, e-cigarettes could be good, bad or neutral,” Doran said. “I don’t think we know the answers yet. This is one of the ways in which they could be bad – by people increasing their cigarette use if they’re using both.” Dual users may be exposed to more nicotine and wind up at risk for chronic tobacco use and dependence, the authors write. Previous studies have shown that e-cigarette use increases the risk of smoking tobacco-filled cigarettes. Some prior studies suggest that e-cigarette vapor may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke. But electronic alternatives nonetheless release potentially hazardous chemicals. Sales of vaping products are expected to reach $4.4 billion this year, according to Wells Fargo Securities analysts. With flavors like bubble gum and chocolate peanut butter cup, e-cigarettes or vape pens are often packaged to appeal to youth, who experts believe are more vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering banning flavored tobacco products. Residents opposed to the legislation recently argued that e-cigarettes help them smoke less. But, Glantz said, “This paper shows exactly the opposite is true.” Numbers released this month from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing declines in youth use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes have led some to claim that as proof of the benefits of vaping. But Doran and Glantz don’t see it that way. Instead, Glantz said he views the smoking decreases as evidence of efforts to educate youth about the potential harms of e-cigarettes as well as the results of efforts to regulate e-cigarettes with clean-indoor air laws and minimum-age requirements. States and local jurisdictions have imposed a patchwork of laws pertaining to the use of electronic cigarettes, and some states, including California, now tax vape products. “There’s this Wild West atmosphere with e-cigarettes, and there’s a lot of controversy and disagreement about whether they’re good or bad,” Doran said. “If they’re harmless, and they help people quit, then they’re great. If they make it harder to quit and also encourage people to smoke cigarettes who would not have smoked otherwise, then they’re terrible,” he said. “The truth probably lies in the middle, but where exactly is the key question.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tscS56 and bit.ly/2rBKmg8 Preventive Medicine, online June 3, 2017.

The stock rallied above the prior high in 2016 and stalled out, building a base on new support and then spiraling lower in November. That marked the washout low, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reinstated the breakout in January 2017, followed by a powerful trend advance to an all-time high at $122.90 on June 6.

Altria Group expanded into spirits and finance leasing services following the Philip Morris spin-off,​ but tobacco remains its biggest profit component.

The uptrend stalled near $50 at the end of 2015, giving way to a shallow correction that ended with a high-volume October gap to a new high in the mid-$50s. It took three months to clear the high posted in that session, yielding a long series of new highs into last week. (For more, see: Reynolds Announces Leadership Roles Post Acquisition by BAT.) The stock sold off with the broad market, dropping into the first test at the 50-day EMA since January, and it is still testing that level. Weekly stochastics fell into an unconfirmed sell cycle in reaction to the decline, raising odds for an intermediate correction lasting a minimum of eight to 12 weeks. Given this scenario, a pullback into deep support at $50 could offer a buying opportunity. Tobacco manufacturers and distributors are leading the broad market, resistant to broad headwinds facing other high-yielding instruments. This resilience could last into the new decade, given humankind's addictive interest in the controversial crop.

What about a technology company? That sounds crazy, right? Or does it? Don't believe me; look at the makeup of the Financial Select Sectors SPDR ETF (XLF) and see the top 25 holdings: There's no Visa. Yeah, it is a company with a market cap of almost $220 billion, bigger than that of Citigroup (C), but it's not in the top 25 of the financials. So if it's not a financial, then what is it? Well, of course, Visa is a tech company! Just look at the Technology Select Sector XLK SPDR (XLK), and there it is: Visa with 3.38 percent weighting in the ETF. By the way, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is also there, with a 2.21 percent weighting. Incredible, right? How come Visa and Mastercard are technology companies while American Express is a financial company? There's a simple answer: The three companies are fundamentally different in a significant way. Visa is an electronic payment network, while American Express issues cards and takes on the debt of its cardholders. Fundamentally, banks and financials depend for the most part on interest rates because when banks lend money, they charge a rate of interest. When rates are low they make less money, and when rates rise they make more money. Currently, interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve all go to a bank's ability to make money. Visa is dependent on how many transactions are occurring on its network charging a fee for the use of the network. Financials also have default risks associated with them that a company like Visa does not. Because banks and financials hold the debts of their cardholders, there is a risk the cardholder will not pay those debts and default on them, resulting in a loss for the card issuer. Again, for a company such as Visa, those risks are not present. Visa's biggest risk would be declining usage of its network.

Jeff Cox,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for the ouster of 12 board members at Wells Fargo due to the fake accounts scandal that has rocked the bank. In a letter sent Monday to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, the Massachusetts Democrat said the scandal has ""revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices."" Warren said the central bank has the authority under federal statute to remove the members who were on the board as the matter transpired. ""We have received the letter and plan to respond,"" a Fed spokesman told CNBC. In an agreement with multiple authorities last September, Wells agreed to pay a $185 million fine in conjunction with a scandal in which some 2 million client accounts were created without the customers' knowledge. More accounts may be involved, according to subsequent allegations. Even after paying the fine, Wells has continued to undergo reputational damage amid congressional inquiries and additional disclosures Warren, who has been a harsh critic, pointed out in the letter multiple instances where she believes the board at Wells failed customers. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices — problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Wells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo shares gained about 1.1 percent in early trading, about in line with the sector. Warren did not limit her criticism to Wells — she also said the Fed ""has done nothing to date"" to punish the bank ""despite its ample statutory authority."" ""I urge you to use the tools Congress has given you to remove the responsible board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country's largest banks,"" she wrote. The scandal arose as bank employees sought to meet aggressive sales demands. Employees would enroll customers in various programs without their consent in order to make quotas that have since been disbanded. Some 5,300 employees have been terminated as a result, and the bank also has a new CEO, Timothy J. Sloan, who took over for John Stumpf. For the Fed to act, it would need to establish that any individual board member's actions were unsafe or unsound to the bank. The Fed likely would need to initiate an enforcement action and prove its case. Yellen told Congress during testimony shortly after the scandal broke in September that the Fed is reviewing all operations for large banks and believes that in cases of wrongdoing, ""senior management (should) be held accountable.""

Antony Currie,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wells Fargo is driving its stagecoach further into the mud. The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers' mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right. The actions at issue might seem to help struggling borrowers: Wells Fargo lowered some customers' monthly mortgage payments, potentially making them manageable. But there are two huge potential problems. First, the bank did this while also extending the duration of the loans – in one case by some 30 years. That greatly increased the total interest borrowers were on the hook to pay over the life of their loans. Second, Wells Fargo made these changes, according to the lawsuits, without getting the consent of either the customers or the relevant bankruptcy courts. Wells Fargo denies this, saying it notified customers and does ""not finalize a loan modification without receiving signed documents"" from the required parties. The trouble is, Wells Fargo has mucked up mortgage lending and modification in the past. It was one of the five lenders that in 2012 agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government and 49 states to rectify poor loan servicing and foreclosure practices. Last year it forked over $1.2 billion to settle claims of reckless lending under a Federal Housing Administration program. Home loans should have been squeaky-clean after all that. Add to that its recent $185 million fine after retail bankers chasing aggressive account-opening targets created 2 million fake bank and credit-card accounts – events that cost former Chief Executive John Stumpf his job – and there's a sense of a bank still not ensuring it has fundamental checks and balances in place. Wells Fargo isn't alone. The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 exposed the many failings of the financial-services industry. For now, though, most of its big rivals appear to have put the worst of their transgressions behind them. Sloan's shop keeps swerving into new ones.

Tae Kim,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wall Street is increasingly worried over the future growth opportunities for the two best-performing stocks in the market during the past year.Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD shares are both down significantly in recent days. Nvidia declined more than 5 percent over the past week through midday Thursday, while AMD fell 12 percent in that time period.The Nvidia decline was in part sparked by a negative Citron Research report on Nvidia Friday.""Take your profits and move on to Google (Alphabet). Exposure to the identical array of 'sexy businesses' with less risk on the downside,"" Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a post entitled ""NVIDIA: The Moment that Separates the Gamblers from the Investors. NVDA to Trade back to $130."" Left cited competition coming from Intel, Google and Xilinx in the data center markets and the likelihood of slowing growth in its gaming graphics card business as reasons for his skeptical view on Nvidia's market value.Wells Fargo is also concerned over rising competition in Nvidia's data center business. The firm reiterated its underperform rating on the company Wednesday.""We think that Nvidia has done very well in establishing itself as the dominant provider of standalone accelerator solutions for data center, but believe that this is already reflected in Nvidia's stock value,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Wong wrote in a note to clients. ""Over time we think additional providers of standalone accelerators might emerge, helping to drive growth in the standalone processor market but reducing Nvidia's market share in this market.""Even with the move lower, Nvidia shares have rallied 218 percent through midday Thursday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 17 percent return. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. AMD is right behind at No. 2 with a 156 percent return in the same time period. In similar fashion to the negative Nvidia notes, Goldman Sachs told investors to sell AMD shares Monday, questioning whether the recent cryptocurrency-driven demand for the company's graphics cards will last. ""According to our checks, the RX 570 and RX 580 graphics cards are sold out at numerous retail websites including NewEgg and Microcenter. While this dynamic may provide near-term upside to fundamentals, we believe [cryptocurrency mining] is unlikely to become a sustainable driver of EPS,"" Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in the note to clients.Nvidia declined to comment on the Citron and Wells Fargo reports.

"Sumit Roy, ETF.com",06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Who would have thought that on the day  the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark federal funds rate for the third time in six months, interest rates across the curve would plunge? But that's exactly what happened on Wednesday, confounding many analysts who predicted higher long-term rates. The Fed made its widely expected move, raising its overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent, keying off data that showed the U.S. economy at full employment and growing steadily. The central bank's upgraded ""dot plot,"" which maps where central bank officials see rates headed in the future, suggests that another rate hike could be coming later this year. More from ETF.com:Tech ETFs retreat: Pullback aheadHere's what advisors are worried aboutMuni ETFs: No summer vacation But at least for now, the bond market doesn't care. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped by 8 basis points to 2.13 percent after briefly touching 2.1 percent earlier on Wednesday, its lowest level of 2017 (bond prices and yields move inversely). U.S. 10-Year Treasury Bond Yield In turn, many bond ETFs, such as the $46 billion iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), hit their highest levels of the year. AGG is now up 2.8 percent, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is up 4.6 percent; and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) is up 7.1 percent. Those numbers are particularly impressive considering this was supposed to be a bad year for bonds based on the consensus expectation at the start of 2017. YTD Returns For AGG, LQD, TLT According to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, the moves in bond prices on Wednesday may have less to do with the Fed rate hike than a pair of tepid economic data points released on the same day. Early in the day, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell by 0.1 percent in May, while its core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices) only grew by 0.1 percent, below the 0.2 percent increase that was anticipated. That translates into year-over-year growth of 1.9 percent for the headline CPI and 1.7 percent for the core CPI ― both below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target ― and the lowest reading for the core in two years. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in May sagged by 0.3 percent, much worse than the zero change that was expected and the largest decline in 16 months. ""The data that came out on Wednesday showing a slowdown in inflation and contraction in retail sales has made people question whether the Fed will hike as aggressively as previously thought,"" explained Jacobsen. ""The big move in 10-year yields came around the same time as the CPI and retail sales data came out. Weak consumer spending and slowing inflation means the terminal rate for the federal funds rate may be well below what the Fed's aiming for,"" he added. Perhaps the fall in the 10-year yield shouldn't have been surprising. There's been a familiar pattern in recent years where investors anticipate that rates will finally take off as the economy improves, only to see them come back down as data disappoints. In fact, despite all the hand-wringing about rising rates ever since the Fed embarked on the current tightening cycle in late 2015, it turns out that the 10-year yield is actually lower today than it was when the central bank made its first hike. Currently, the 10-year yield stands at 2.13 percent compared with 2.30 percent on Dec. 16, 2015. Even the five-year yield is lower, at 1.73 percent currently, compared with 1.75 percent on the day of the first hike. Wells Fargo's Jacobsen says that for anyone who's been waiting for higher interest rates to invest in bonds, now may be the time to throw in the towel. ""It could feel like a bus that never shows up if you're waiting for yields to spike higher. If you've been sitting in cash and waiting for yields to rise before getting back to your strategic allocation to fixed income, you may want to start dollar cost averaging toward your target,"" he explained. Equities have taken these lower rates in stride. The S&P 500 remains in record-high territory amid record-low volatility. Investors aren't interpreting lower rates as a bad thing, except for perhaps financials, which is now the second-worst-performing stock market sector behind energy. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up 5.3 percent this year, well behind the 9 percent gain for the broader S&P 500. ""Financials have been hurt by the flattening yield curve,"" Jacobsen noted. ""That doesn't look to be getting any better anytime soon. If the Fed talks up another rate hike before the inflation data actually turns, I'd worry about the Fed being too far ahead of the curve rather than too far behind it.""

In a long awaited decision, MSCI said Tuesday it plans to add mainland Chinese shares to its benchmark emerging markets index. The index giant said it will add 222 China A Large Cap stocks on a gradual basis beginning next year.  The review is the fourth straight year MSCI has considered adding the mainland-traded stocks, known as A shares in China. ""International investors have embraced the positive changes in the accessibility of the China A shares market over the last few years and now all conditions are set for MSCI to proceed with the first step of the inclusion,"" Remy Briand, MSCI Managing Director and Chairman of the MSCI Index Policy Committee, said in a release. ""The expansion of Stock Connect has been a game changer for the market opening of China A shares,"" he said, referring to a program giving foreign investors access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets through Hong Kong. The Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) traded more than 2 percent higher after hours. The 222 stocks MSCI is planning to add to the emerging markets index include financial giants like Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, Guotai Junan and Ping An Insurance, according to a document on MSCI's website. Other names include Tsingtao Brewery, SAIC Motor, Suning Commerce and Spring Airlines. Another change for China this time ""is the reduction in the number of suspended stocks since the decline in the market. So there's less control and more availability in the shares,"" MSCI chairman and CEO Henry Fernandez said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""And three, the loosening of restrictions on the data in order to create index-linking investment vehicles."" MSCI also said, contrary to many expectations, Argentina's stocks would not join the emerging markets index due to investor concerns that recent improvements to market access needed to be in place for a longer period. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) rose 0.15 percent in after-hours trade. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is tracked by an estimated $1.6 trillion in assets, as of the end of June last year. The addition of the mainland Chinese shares could be a big boost to the world's second-largest stock market, which has until now drawn limited foreign investor interest because of high volatility, frequent trading halts and limited foreign investor access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. ""Institutional investors have more confidence in China's A share market today,"" said Peter Donisanu, investment strategy analyst Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The Shanghai composite is up 1.2 percent year-to-date, in contrast to gains of more than 18 percent for the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM).

Brian Price,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"With bullion recently hitting a three-week low of $1,257, one commodities trader is adamant that the charts are signaling sunshine on the horizon for gold bugs. Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services, is undeterred by what's been a volatile June for gold as he believes the commodity will enter into a long-term uptrend swing. ""I'm a longer-term bull in gold and if you look at the long-term chart the trend is still higher,"" Iuorio said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""What the Fed said yesterday is disconcerting to the market, and that's why the dollar rallied so hard."" The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for only the fourth time since the financial crisis, which was expected. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen took a decisively more hawkish tone despite the fact that inflation has fallen behind estimates. Iuorio feels deteriorating data will soon pull dollar prices down and, if gold stays above $1,235, then the longer trend is ultimately positive for the yellow metal. Historically, the dollar and gold are inversely correlated as a fall in dollar prices increases the value of other currencies. Such a move drives demand for commodities, like gold, as investors seek alternative assets to invest in. However, Iuorio warned that more hawkish rhetoric could indeed deter his thesis. ""I'm going to be wrong if they keep that talk up,"" the trader said. ""Gold's going to go lower. If it settles below $1,230, that's going to change me into a bear."" That said, Iuorio doesn't believe the Fed can continue with its hawkish tone and therefore feels confident in where gold prices are heading. Lastly, another factor for gold prices in the near term could be India. Bob Iaccino, of Path Trading Partners, noted on ""Futures Now"" that a tax on the precious metal is slated to go into effect at the end of the month in that country. This could cause local jewelers and private citizens to rush into the market and purchase gold in bulk before the tax comes into play, which would also help drive prices higher.

Annie Pei,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Crude officially entered a bear market with Tuesday's drop, and one technical strategist is seeing another 30 percent drop in the commodity. On CNBC's ""Futures Now"" Tuesday, Paul Ciana of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that based on the charts, oil is well on its way to dropping to the $30 range, levels unseen since last April. ""It just keeps going down, breaking supports and failing at lower resistance levels,"" said Ciana. ""It's the absolute definition of a downtrend."" But on the same chart of oil, Ciana also pointed out that the crude crush could actually be signaling a rally in the bond market. A note released by BofAML on Tuesday, titled ""Bonds smile as oil cries,"" remarked on the inverse moves between crude and bonds that has been occurring over the past years. According to Ciana, the inverse relationship is playing out once again ""on an even larger scale,"" meaning that if crude continues to fall, bonds could soar even higher. ""Bond prices have risen to exceed the peak of [that double bottom this year, confirming] that the U.S. 10-year yield will likely fall to 1.97 percent this summer, if not sooner,"" he explained. Additionally, stocks could also be in trouble if crude falls. While Ciana doesn't see oil being a direct cause of a downturn in the market, depending on ""how much more the decline accelerates"" in crude, it could intensify any drop that may happen. And the outlook for crude on a fundamental basis isn't too positive, as Ciana also points out that demand for crude may fall during the summer.With Tuesday's drop, oil prices have now sunk 19 percent year to date, largely thanks to supply issues related to OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Ciana does see $45.50 being a key level to reach and hold for oil, meaning that the commodity would need to rally 4 percent for some of the concerns to subside.

Elizabeth Warren hates big banks. But none more so than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Her displeasure with the California-based bank is understandable given that Wells Fargo spent the last decade and a half opening fake accounts for customers in order to artificially inflate its performance and thereby maximize its executives' annual bonuses. The latest example of Warren's ire was on display Monday, when she sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen calling for the removal of 12 members of Wells Fargo's board of directors -- for the record, that'd leave only three. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote, according to CNBC, which first reported on the letter. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices -- problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Senator Elizabeth Warren. Image source: Senator Warren's official website. Wells Fargo's executives deserve the blame and vitriol that have been heaped on them since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed the scam last year. While they make millions of dollars a year, the customers they preyed on were among the most vulnerable citizens in the country -- retirees living on fixed incomes and recent immigrants. To make matters worse, the company then retaliated against employees who sought to blow the whistle on the scam. Under the watch of Wells Fargo's executives and the board's oversight, the 160-year-old bank's once-sterling reputation has been deeply sullied. Given this, it's hard to disagree with Warren's assessment of Wells Fargo. The board was ultimately responsible for policing these types of risks and behaviors. The fact that they didn't, and that the scam was in many ways an indispensable element of Wells Fargo's business model, is prima facie evidence that they bear culpability for it. At the same time, one might find it worth acknowledging that Wells Fargo's directors were deceived in a sense, too. Prior to the fallout, the board's principal liaison with the bank's operating committee was John Stumpf, who at the time, though no longer, was both its chairman and CEO. As the company wrote in its 2015 proxy statement: Mr. Stumpf, with over 33 years of experience at Wells Fargo, has the knowledge, expertise, and experience to understand and clearly articulate to the Board the opportunities and risks facing the Company, as well as the leadership and management skills to promote and execute the Company's vision, values and strategy. The Board believes that Mr. Stumpf, rather than an outside director, is in the best position, as Chairman and CEO, to lead Board discussions regarding the Company's business and strategy and to help the Board respond quickly and effectively to the many business, market, and regulatory reform issues affecting the Company and the rapidly changing financial services industry. This description is laughable in hindsight, but Stumpf and his predecessor Dick Kovacevich had purposefully cultivated such a pristine image by then that few people would have questioned them. Image source: The Motley Fool. There's also value to keeping some of these directors around. They made an enormous and egregious mistake, but one can hope that they learned a lesson in their failure to perform their oversight duties. And that lesson, if it indeed has been learned, could very well make Wells Fargo a stronger organization. That may or may not be a fair assessment, but assuming that it is, there's value to their continued presence on the board. It's like the story of Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, who learned of an employee's mistake that cost the company $1 million. Watson not only refused to fire the employee, but he even rejected the employee's letter of resignation. ""Fire you?"" Watson responded. ""I've just invested one million dollars in your education.""

At its most basic level, every bank offers the same standard bank account, car loan, mortgage, and so on.

The company boasts that it has a relationship with 60 million households in the United States.

Image source: Company. Unlike the others in the Big Four U.S. banks, Citi is really a global banking institution. It operates out of the world's largest metropolitan areas and has only a modest presence in smaller cities in the U.S. Yet it has remarkable reach into consumer spending through its credit cards business, which recently won a partnership with Costco, giving it the ability to tap into the wallets of the wholesale retailers' 53 million members with its highly rated Costco co-brand card. Customers love its cards' Price Rewind feature, which enables its cardholders to get a refund automatically when a product is advertised at a lower price within 60 days after purchase.

When Brian Moynihan took the job as Bank of America's chief executive officer, he made the customer experience paramount in rebuilding the bank's image -- and its profitability.

The investment has paid off handsomely in the form of increased customer loyalty and approval ratings. Customers processed 108 million checks through the mobile app versus 170 million deposits in one of its branches last year. The bank brought private banking services to all of its clients with a banking-by-appointment feature so that its customers never have to wait in line to speak to a representative. Image source: Company. Bank of New York is hardly a traditional bank. It operates as a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides the back-end accounting services to keep everything running smoothly. Custody banks have inherently loyal customers due to the fact that moving billions of dollars of assets to another custodian is no easy task, and because the bank benefits from scale that enables it to manage its customers' assets at a price other banks would struggle to match. Image source: Company. Like Bank of America, PNC is ahead of the curve in creating products that are more convenient for customers while being more profitable for the bank. Thanks to investments in its online and mobile banking products, it recently reported that 60% of its customers use its ""non-teller channels"" for the majority of their transactions, up from 40% just three years ago. Its Virtual Wallet service enables its customers to make a budget, manage bills with the help of a calendar, and quickly see how they spend each and every dollar that flows into their accounts. Image source: Company. Once a pure-play credit card issuer, Capital One has become a bona fide banking operation that offers everything from checking and savings accounts to auto loans and even commercial banking services. The bank made inroads with consumers when it acquired ING Direct in 2011, which brought the bank more than 7 million customers who used its online banking services. Capital One has built on its ING Direct acquisition with an online banking service that its customers love -- a recent presentation notes that its mobile applications score the highest ratings in the iOS App Store. The bank also offers some of the highest-yielding money market accounts of any bank on this list, which certainly helps to keep its customers' loyalty. Image source: Company. Once known as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC is a worldwide banking operation that operates primarily as a corporate bank and credit card issuer in the United States. The company makes its ""internationally minded"" customers its priority through HSBC Premier, which provides banking and wealth management services to the mass affluent who live in large cities spanning from Seattle to New York City. With 2.4 million customers in the U.S., it has the smallest domestic operation of any of the banks on this list, given its focus on wealthier, international customers. Image source: Company. Calling itself ""America's Most Convenient Bank,"" TD Bank provides retail banking services to 9 million customers through approximately 1,300 branches along the East Coast. Its TD Select Savings Account offers free ATM services and reimburses customers for ATM fees charged at non-TD ATMs around the country. The company has mastered campaigns designed to promote customer loyalty, famously turning its ATMs into ""Automated Thanking Machines"" to deliver gifts to its customers -- cash, a trip to Trinidad to see a family member, and a unique experience throwing out a first pitch at a Blue Jays home game, for example. Image source: Company. Known colloquially as ""America's largest community bank,"" Wells Fargo has always operated as a simple retail banking institution. Convenience is key to customer loyalty, and Wells Fargo has the largest retail branch network of any U.S. bank, providing service to its customers through 6,200 banking locations and 12,000 ATMs scattered from coast to coast. Thanks to its large mortgage servicing business, it also has a relationship with millions of homeowners who aren't located near one of its branches. ","
      
    From First to Worst: Ranking 9 of America's Biggest Banks by Customer Loyalty -- The Motley Fool

If you follow bank stocks and big bank stocks, in particular, you should get acquainted with the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks. I refer to it frequently when I write, and therefore want to give readers a brief overview of exactly what it is, and why investors should care about it. The best way to think about the KBW Bank Index is to analogize it to the S&P 500, which tracks shares of 500 publicly traded companies with the largest market capitalizations in the United States. But instead of being industry agnostic, as the S&P 500 is, the KBW Bank Index focuses on only large-cap banks -- 24 of them, to be precise. These are banks that you've no doubt heard of, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). These are the four biggest banks in the country. They're also -- with the exception of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), the best-run big bank in the country -- the four that are weighted most heavily on the KBW Bank Index. The index weights its components according to a measure of market capitalization, adjusted for a bank's share price. This helps to explain why, as you can see in the table below, Citigroup carries the greatest weight on the Index, even though it has a smaller market capitalization than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, respectively. Name Weight on KBW Bank Index Citigroup 8.82% Bank of America 7.85% JPMorgan Chase 7.83% US Bancorp 7.83% Wells Fargo 7.68% State Street 4.54% Bank of New York Mellon 4.30% Northern Trust 4.03% PNC Financial 3.97% M&T Bank 3.97% SunTrust Banks 3.87% KeyCorp 3.81% BB&T 3.76% Fifth Third 3.63% Citizens Financial 3.52% Capital One 3.48% Regions Financial 3.30% First Republic Bank 2.86% Huntington Bancshares 2.75% Comerica 2.47% SVB Financial 1.80% Zions Bancorporation 1.65% New York Community Bancorp 1.25% People's United Financial 1.06% Source: Invesco. There's one side note that's worth pointing out when it comes to the KBW Bank Index. That is, not all of these banks have the same business model. Some are universal banks, which operate both investment and commercial-banking operations. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup fall most comfortably into this category. A second group consists of so-called custodial or trust banks. The three banks on the list that most naturally fall into this category are State Street, Northern Trust, and Bank of New York Mellon -- and I consider the latter to be a particularly interesting bank. These banks focus less on making loans and taking deposits and more on the administration of fixed-income securities for institutional investors like hedge funds, university endowments, and insurance companies. The final group are pure-play commercial banks, specializing in taking deposits and making loans. When most people think about a bank's business model, this is what they have in mind. The largest among these is Wells Fargo, followed by U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial, and Capital One Financial, respectively. Image source: Getty Images. An index like this is important for investors because it allows you to see whether a particular stock is in line with its peer group. Viewed in isolation, it's impossible to say whether a particular bank stock is cheap or expensive -- or efficient or inefficient -- or whatever metric it is that you're trying to tease out. But if you have a control group against which to compare a bank's valuation, profitability, or efficiency, then you can get a much better idea of its relative value or performance, which explains why I can confidently say that U.S. Bancorp is the best-run big bank in the country. This is what the KBW Bank Index enables one to do. And it's why I recommend that investors have a general understanding of what it is and how to use it. ","

Christy Bieber,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chase announced recently that its Sapphire, Sapphire Preferred, and Sapphire Reserve cardholders would be eligible for 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points if they obtained a mortgage with Chase bank by Aug. 6, 2017.  The offer was available only for current cardholders and only for a new purchase, not a refinance. It was not the first offer of its kind -- Capital One also made an offer of free mileage last year, and Wells Fargo has offered rebates for mortgage loans in the past -- but it was a generous offer, with rewards points worth around 2.1 cents per point. While getting points or other rewards for taking out a mortgage loan seems attractive if you're thinking about buying a home anyway, there are three big reasons why it's unwise to go with a particular mortgage lender just to earn miles or other credit card rewards. Image Source: Getty Images. Chase made its announcement in May and stipulated that cardholders who want the points would have to apply by the deadline on Aug. 6. This is a very limited amount of time to do your research into the mortgage terms offered by different lenders. Most incentive deals that mortgage lenders offer have deadlines, which puts artificial time pressure on you. Your mortgage will likely be the biggest debt you carry during your lifetime. You need time to carefully compare the different fees, interest rates, mortgage points, and other terms various lenders will offer you. The process shouldn't be rushed, and you shouldn't try to move faster than you're comfortable with just so you don't miss out on credit card points, airline miles, or other incentives. Your credit card points will be spent within a matter of months, while airlines miles earned for taking out a loan last only a trip or two. A mortgage is an obligation lasting 15 to 30 years. If you buy a house before you're ready because you don't want to miss out on a mortgage incentive, you'll be stuck with a real estate commission, transfer tax, and a host of other expensive costs if you need to sell the home. Unless you have all of your ducks on a row -- like a 20% down payment at the ready, as well as an emergency fund to cover maintenance and repairs -- you could also end up having to pay for private mortgage insurance or fall into debt if something unexpected happens. If you jump into a loan too fast, you may also feel the need to refinance a few years down the road in order to get better terms. Refinancing is a costly process, as you have to pay for a new appraisal and the closing costs of the new loan. Getting out of one mortgage loan and into another is also a time-consuming process that requires you to produce lots of paperwork. Banks may make up the cost by charging a slightly higher mortgage loan rate -- Chase's rates as of late May were 3.875% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan, while Bankrate had some lenders offering rates as low as 3.750% -- or they may charge more than other lenders for various costs like the credit check, home appraisal, loan origination fee, or underwriting fee. Even a small difference in interest can make a big difference in payments. A $200,000 loan at 3.750% would cost you $926 per month, and the total loan cost would be $333,443. By comparison, the same $200,000 mortgage at a 3.875% interest rate would come with payments of $940 per month, and the total cost of the loan would be $338,571. That tiny difference in the interest rate would cost you an extra $5,000 over the life of the loan -- and odds are the rewards you earned wouldn't come close to that value. Don't cheat yourself out of thousands of dollars by falling for a gimmick. Wait until you're ready to buy a home, carefully research different lenders with good reputations, and choose the best overall deal. If you just happen to get a reward from that lender, that bonus will be icing on the cake. ","
      
    3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Open a Mortgage to Get Rewards -- The Motley Fool

If you're in the market for a bank stock, then valuation is one thing you should keep in mind. Holding all else equal, the cheaper you can buy a stock, the bigger your return is likely to be. It's for this reason that I intermittently check bank stock valuations on the KBW Bank Index, the leading index of large-cap bank stocks headquartered in the United States. The average stock on the index trades for 15.5 times the bank's projected earnings per share over the next 12 months. That's not cheap, but it's far from expensive when you consider that the average stock on the S&P 500 is valued at 35 times forward earnings. But while bank stocks in general are valued at a lower multiple to earnings than the typical large-cap stock, some banks are still cheaper than others. Based on the forward P/E ratio, here are the five cheapest big bank stocks right now: Stock Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) 10.6 Citigroup (NYSE:C) 12.5 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 12.9 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 13.0 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 13.1 KBW Bank Index average 15.5 Data source: YCharts.com. Aside from Capital One, which is heavily concentrated in credit card loans and thus exposed to elevated credit risk, as credit card loans tend to default at higher rates than other types of loans, the four other cheapest big bank stocks have something in common: They're the largest banks in the country. Citigroup is the smallest of the four, yet it still has $1.8 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is the largest, overseeing $2.6 trillion in assets. And Bank of America and Wells Fargo fall in between these two. Why would these banks trade at lower valuations than smaller banks? It seems to me that there are four reasons. First, under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, global systemically important banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup can't operate with as much leverage as their smaller, simpler peers can. This is because they're subject to higher capital requirements, which necessarily reduces leverage and profitability. Second, all of these banks are effectively shut out of the market for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo each hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Therefore, they're prohibited under federal law from acquiring other banks. Citigroup doesn't face the same constraint, as its depositary base is weighted more heavily toward international deposits. But given the New York-based bank's strategy over the past few years of shrinking its balance sheet as opposed to growing it, it's safe to say that Citigroup is not in the market to acquire other banks, either. The net result is that these four banks are all largely confined to organic growth, which could weigh on their returns in the future relative to banks that aren't similarly prohibited from merging with or acquiring other banks. Image source: Getty Images. The third reason is that these four banks are especially difficult to analyze. Much of this comes from their sheer size and the extent of their operations. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup are all universal banks, meaning that they run both investment and commercial banking businesses. Commercial banking is straightforward, consisting of taking deposits and making loans. This yields recurring revenue that doesn't fluctuate widely on a quarterly or annual basis. Investment banking operations are much harder to understand and forecast into the future. This is primarily because an investment bank's top line is influenced by volume and volatility in the credit markets, both of which are all but impossible to predict in advance. Finally, while I've touched on this already, the biggest banks in the country are all subject to much more robust regulatory requirements than smaller banks. Their compliance exams are more intense. They face additional hurdles on the annual stress tests. And the way they structure their balance sheets is much more closely scrutinized by industry overseers. Does this mean you should avoid buying shares of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup? Not necessarily because, remember, while they may face more headwinds than smaller banks, their shares can also be picked up at much lower valuations. That said, as I've written in the past, given the towering heights of the stock market today, I think investors have more to gain than lose from waiting for a potential pullback in the market before diving deeper into stocks.

When I think about banks, I often think about Citigroup (NYSE:C) as being in a league of its own. It isn't because of its performance, which has left a lot to be desired over the past decade. It's rather because of its emphasis on international banking. There are a number of ways to show this, but one of the most obvious is to look at the distribution of Citigroup's deposits. More than half of the New York-based bank's deposits are held in offices outside the United States: Data source: regulatory filings. Chart by author. Even a cursory glance at this chart shows how different Citigroup is from the three other megabanks that sit atop the financial-services industry. JPMorgan Chase, which also has a large international presence, only has 17% of its deposits held in overseas offices. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo and Bank of America both come in at less than 10%. This goes to the core of Citigroup's business model. It was roughly a century ago that the bank became one of the first in the United States to establish a global banking presence, gaining footholds throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America, in addition to its operations in the United States. Citigroup not only has offices in other countries, but its operations abroad also pivot around consumer banking, the primary purpose of which is to attract deposits. This distinguishes it from the three other banks in the chart, whose international operations focus more on investment banking, as is the case with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America in particular. The purpose of investment banking is to help global corporations issue debt and equity, manage risk, and move money around the world. Image source: Getty Images. Citigroup's extensive overseas presence is a double-edged sword. While it serves to distinguish the $1.8 trillion bank from its peers, it also introduces another layer of risk. In the lead-up to the Great Depression, for instance, Citigroup gained notoriety for selling toxic Latin American bonds to its customers in the United States. And throughout the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, Citigroup came within a hair's breadth of failure because of overexposure to soured bonds issued by the likes of Brazil and Argentina. In an effort to reduce risk and simplify its business model since the financial crisis, Citigroup has pared down its operations abroad. In 2008, for instance, it sold its Japanese trust banking unit to Mitsubishi UFG Trust and Banking. Citigroup followed that up a year later by selling its retail brokerage business in Japan. And six years after that, it did the same with its retail banking operations in the East Asian country. These moves have simplified and streamlined Citigroup's business model. They've also helped the bank raise capital and de-risk its operations. But even though they represent a retreat for Citigroup in terms of its long-term focus on global banking, it's clear from the chart that the bank continues to distinguish itself from its peers in terms of the size and reach of its international footprint.

Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","

John Maxfield and Gaby Lapera,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Last week, the Financial CHOICE Act, a hulking 600-page piece of legislation regarding the banking industry, made its way through the House of Representatives. A full transcript follows the video. John Maxfield: It's going great, Gaby, how are you doing? Lapera: I'm doing pretty good. I had an exciting weekend. I was volunteering at Pride with The Motley Fool, so that was really exciting, and I went rock climbing. What a fulfilling weekend. Maxfield: Nice, that is a really fulfilling weekend. I basically spent the weekend mediating disputes between my five-year-old twin sons. [laughs] That's kind of like the referee in a boxing ring. Lapera: [laughs] Oh my gosh, I'm very impressed. My brother also has twins, and they are young and also a handful. You have the patience and energy of a saint. Talking about patience and energy, let's turn to Congress. Today, we're going to talk about the CHOICE Act, which stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs. Another in a long line of acronyms that are kind of just jammed in together to try to make something that's fun to say. The CHOICE Act just passed the House on Friday. The whole thing with the CHOICE Act, the reason that we're talking about it on the show, is that it's basically there to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is what was regulating all of the banking stuff that we've been talking about for literally, what, two years now, Maxfield? Maxfield: Yeah. Or five years. You and I have been talking about it for two years now. One of the ways that I think is really helpful to think about the Financial CHOICE Act is that, in all industries, particularly banking, you can look at it through the lens of cycles, different types of cycles -- the business cycle, the credit cycle, cycles in consumer confidence. But another cycle that you can use to think about, not only in the financial services sector, but in all sectors, is the regulatory cycle, specifically in terms of whether the industry has more power, or the regulators have more power, at any particular point in time. And after the financial crisis, when the Dodd-Frank Act was passed on largely partisan lines, basically just supported by the Democrats, that shifted a lot of power away from the industry over to regulators. And basically what the Financial CHOICE Act does is it reverses that. And it was passed in the house, like we said last week, on largely partisan lines, but the partisan lines were different: This time, it was Republicans supporting it and Democrats not supporting it. What it tries to do is take that power that Dodd-Frank gave to the regulators and give it back to the industry. Lapera: Yeah. The bill is sponsored, unsurprisingly, by a man named Jeb Hensarling, who is a Republican. As with most things political, things are falling along party lines. I want to take an opportunity to say that Maxfield and I are going to do our best to stay unbiased throughout this discussion, but everyone is a person and we all have opinions, and our opinions don't necessarily reflect that of The Motley Fool, but we're going to try to give you an informed, as objective as possible, discussion. My anthropology roots tell me that there is no way to have a completely unbiased discussion, so I'm going to leave it at that and talk a little bit more about the philosophy behind the CHOICE Act. Basically, a lot of people don't like Dodd-Frank. They think it puts too much pressure on the banks, it's too hard for them to make money the way that Dodd-Frank is structured. There's a few different parts to it, the big parts of the Financial CHOICE Act. But I think the one that a lot of people focus on is, the Financial CHOICE Act is looking to end ""too big to fail."" Maxfield: Right. To your point, Gaby, about the partisan basis, I want to address that before I jump into the too-big-to-fail part. The one thing to keep in mind is, even though Dodd-Frank was passed on partisan basis, and the Financial CHOICE Act made it through the House on a partisan basis, the fact of the matter is, almost everybody agrees, most knowledgeable sources agree, that Dodd-Frank went too far. And I'm somebody who thinks that there needs to be a robust regulatory framework around the banking systems, just because banks are so highly leveraged, and because they play a role in the monetary system of the United States and they're kind of, to a certain extent, an extension of the federal government. So you can't let banks go out there and do what they want, because they are acting, in a sense, on the part of taxpayers. So I think that's some good context to keep in mind. But Dodd-Frank, almost everybody would agree that it did go too far. So now the question is, how far do you tailor it back? Lapera: Yeah. And to get into that about being an extension of the government, it's not just that with the systemically important financial institutions. It's not just our country -- it's the entire world is tied into these financial systems. So people get concerned that if they fail, it's going to be -- to borrow a term from the Vietnam era -- a domino effect with other people's economies. So there is a lot of feelings riding on this, and a lot of this depends on how you view economic theory. I think 90% agree with you that Dodd-Frank potentially went too far. I don't know that the CHOICE Act is the answer, either. We'll see what happens. We'll get a little bit more into it. Let's talk a little bit about the actual components of the Financial CHOICE Act, and what they look like, what they mean in terms of existing legislation. Like I said earlier, too big to fail -- that's one of the big key components, ending too big to fail, of the Financial CHOICE Act. Maxfield: Right, if we go back to the financial crisis, here's an overarching way to think about this too-big-to-fail component. You had Citigroup, Bank of America, and AIG, you had your Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns -- these very large financial institutions. These financial institutions hold trillions of dollars in assets on their balance sheets, and oversee a large chunk of the deposits that you and I and everyone else deposits. So if one of those were to fail, it could cause catastrophic damage to the economy. In fact, if you go back to the Great Depression, the thing that caused the Great Depression, or transformed it from a typical recession into the Great Depression, was the failure of a bunch of banks. So that informed this whole too-big-to-fail idea where, even though it's extremely unpalatable to go in and bail out these huge firms with these executives that make tens of millions of dollars a year, and basically save them from their own mistakes, even though that's very unpalatable on almost every level, it does save the U.S. economy. What the CHOICE Act does is it tries to reduce the ability of regulators to step in and bail these banks out. Let me be clear. There is a very solid theoretical framework behind that, because the thought process is, if you go in and bail out these big banks and they know you're going to bail them out in the future, they have much less incentive to act responsibly. That's that whole thought process. If you go back to the financial crisis, the term -- I'm pulling a blank on the term -- but if you go back to the financial crisis, this was one of the main arguments that they asserted. So what Hensarling's act tries to do is dial that back, and it does it in a couple of different ways. No. 1, it removes the regulator's authority to take over these organizations that are troubled and liquidate them in an orderly way, and it transfers that authority over into the bankruptcy code. Lapera: Just a quick side note for listeners, this is called the Orderly Liquidation Authority, that's OLA, which you might see floating around if you're reading about this online. That's actually codified into law, and it's the way the government stepped in and made sure there was an orderly liquidation during the most recent financial crisis of banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Maxfield: Right. Also, the term I was thinking about earlier was moral hazard. That's the hazard that, if you're going to step in and bail someone out -- an institution -- that institution has less incentive to act responsibly. And like I said, that's grounded in theory. Lapera: And it's actually really funny, because earlier you were talking about spending the weekend refereeing between your two children. This is almost just a parenting concept, that if you reward that behavior, you're going to keep getting bad behavior. Maxfield: Exactly, that's exactly right. And all parents can understand that. Another important thing it does in that too-big-to-fail context is that it seeks to restrict the Federal Reserve's discount window lending to what's known as Bagehot's dictum. Lapera: There's a lot of words in there. What is a discount-window lending? I mean, what is discount-window lending? I sound like an old person... ""What is the Facebook?"" What is discount window lending? Maxfield: Discount window is, when a bank gets into trouble, one of the things that will happen is, its depositors will know it's in trouble, so they will all run on the bank at the same time to withdraw their deposits. That's known as a bank run. The problem with a bank run is, because banks are so leveraged, and they only hold a small amount of actual cash in terms of relative to deposits that they have, that can cause them to be completely illiquid. They can run out of cash trying to satisfy their depositors. What the discount window does is it allows banks to take some of its assets on its balance sheet, go to the Federal Reserve, use those assets as collateral, and then get cash from the Federal Reserve to satisfy depositors, to thereby stop or prevent a bank run. Maxfield: It happened with... the name of the bank is escaping me right now, but it happened with a major bank that was based in California during the financial crisis. And it was actually that bank that was taken over and turned into OneWest, which was the institution that was associated with Steven Mnuchin, who's now the Treasury Secretary. But it does still happen, but it's much less frequent because there is FDIC deposit insurance now, as well, that reduces the incentive for people to have to feel like they need to run on the banks and take their deposits out, because the FDIC will be there to stand behind the banks, anyway. So what Bagehot's dictum does is it says that the Federal Reserve should only allow banks to access the discount window -- or it says that the way the Federal Reserve could use the discount window is to lend freely and early in times of crisis, which is what happened last time -- but it should only do so to ""solvent firms and against good collateral at high interest rates."" It's that high-interest rates part that's really significant, because the idea there is, if you were using a punitive interest rate, banks are going to be less inclined to use the discount window. And if they're less inclined to use the discount window in times of crisis, the thought is that, ahead of time, they will be much more careful about the quality of the assets they put on their balance sheets, and the ability to turn those into cash in the public markets as opposed to having to go to the discount window of the Federal Reserve. Lapera: And you have just revealed the disconnect between Democrats and Republicans -- which is that Republicans believe that banks can be forced to be responsible enough to take care of themselves, and Democrats do not, and that's why they're pushing for all this extra regulation. Right now, that falls along partisan lines. Whatever you think is up to you. That's basically what's going on. Maxfield: I will say, to take politics out of this, I studied banks pretty intensely for a number of years, and I will tell you that in history, the thing that we know is that you need a strong and independent central bank, you need it at all times, but particularly in times of crisis. So you do want to be really careful in terms of both the authorities you give to a central bank in that situation and, in this case, the authorities that you take away from it. But again, this is something that, it will get worked out, and the pendulum swings back and forth between regulators and industry. And right now, this is a bill that swings at way back on the other side. I would say, just like Dodd-Frank went too far swinging the pendulum into the favor of regulators, Hensarling's act seems to me to go too far in the other direction. Which makes sense, given that Dodd-Frank was partisan on the Democratic side and the Financial CHOICE Act is partisan on the Republican side. Lapera: Yeah. Actually, you gave me a good segue earlier to kind of slide into this next big thing that the act is going to do, which is that it's going to significantly cut down on the authority of regulatory agencies. I think one of the most important things to note is that they're going to subject financial Regulatory agencies to the REINS Act. The REINS Act basically says that any agency that wants to impose a rule that costs more than $100 million a year needs to run it by Congress first, and if Congress fails to approve a rule within 70 days after it's been proposed, then the rule would go away -- it would be null and void. Which is hard, because if you have partisan control of committees, rules that would go against whatever the nature of that committee is at the moment can just sit for 70 days and never even get heard, and then it just doesn't happen, and that means that regulation is going to happen much more slowly. Maxfield: Right. The way it works now is that the Federal Reserve, the FCC, the CFPB, all these different regulatory agencies -- and this isn't just in the financial services arena, this is across all regulatory agencies and all industries, that in order to regulate their industries, they are given the authority to pass rules that, like, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to pass rules about appropriate products that can be marketed to customers. And those rules, there is a long process where they get insight from the industry and other interested parties. But then those regulatory agencies have the power to put those rules into place and require the industry to follow them. What the Financial CHOICE Act would do is add another layer in that step, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but here's the problem. That additional layer is Congressional approval of these rules. And you can imagine that that really adds a lot of complications to that whole process. It's not like you're just adding just one more hurdle. You're adding an extremely high hurdle that, depending on who is in control of Congress and the Senate at any particular point in time, these regulatory agencies may not be able to jump over. Again, I think that's probably the whole point of subjecting them to the REINS Act, which passed earlier this year. Lapera: Right, it's to reduce the amount of federal legislation that exists, that's really what the point of it is. But it's hard because, yes, maybe regulatory agencies shouldn't be making up rules without Congressional approval, but on the other hand, Congress takes a really long time to do things sometimes. Sometimes, agencies come up with stuff to protect people or help people, and then it gets codified into law, but until then, they're just responding quickly to the needs as they see them. So it's this really hard to push-and-pull thing that you have with government. Let's talk a little bit also about the Fed, which you mentioned is going to be affected by this act. It's hard, because the Fed has also been subjected to the REINS Act, as well. Maxfield: Right. There's one other piece to this. It's not only the REINS Act that they're subjecting the regulators to. They also subject the regulators to the appropriations process. That's a really important thing. Right now, let's take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is actually an agency within the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve is an independent agency. So you have multiple layers of independence. But one of the principal pieces of independence is that, in the case of the Federal Reserve, it is a profit-making entity -- it has a huge balance sheet full of assets that earn interest in time. So it doesn't have to go to Congress to get money to operate, which gives it independence from Congress. The same thing is true with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- don't quote me exactly on this -- since it was put into operation, and in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it has issued a total of something like $11 [billion] to $12 billion worth of fines to the industry, and it can use those fines to do, among other things, fund its own operations. So it, too, is kind of detached or insulated from that political process that is a part of the appropriations process. And what the Financial CHOICE Act does is, it would take away that independence and require these institutions to go to Congress for the funding, which would have a significant impact on them. Lapera: Yeah. And that's one of the big criticisms of the CFBP, that its critics levied at it, is that the CFPB might start just issuing fines just because it has a financial incentive to, as opposed to doing it because the fines really need to be issued. So that's kind of where that Financial CHOICE Act section, that's what it's trying to get at. Maxfield: Right. Then, to your point about going straight at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve is one of those institutions that, people either don't know anything about it, or they love it or hate it, or they don't know anything about it, and they love or hate it. And one of the things that people tend to think about when they think about the Federal Reserve is that it's some sort of conspiratorial entity that controls the money supply and does so for the economic elites, and things like that. And one of the reasons that these conspiracy theories are able to grow take on the forms that they're able to take is because it's a relatively non-transparent organization, particularly when it comes to managing the money supply. Another main principle of the Financial CHOICE Act is to increase the transparency of the Federal Reserve, both in terms of its overall operations and in terms of the way it manages the money supply. And what I mean by managing the money supply is, when it decides to raise or lower interest rates, because that's the lever that causes the money supply to expand or contract. Lapera: Yeah, and it's not just that. For example, the stress tests, no one is 100% sure what's in them. Maxfield: Exactly. So the stress tests right now, these happen once a year for large banks. The purpose of them is to see how they would perform in a hypothetical economic scenario that is analogous to the financial crisis. This is actually a very good piece of the regulatory pie in the banking industry, because it keeps bankers' eyes on making sure that the assets they put on the balance sheets aren't going to submit them to massive losses if, and when, the economy turns down, like it inevitably will. But the issue with the stress tests is that, when the banks submit all the information to the Federal Reserve for the stress test, when the banks are going through their planning process, in terms of structuring their balance sheets and their operations in a way that will help them make it through the stress test, is that the Federal Reserve doesn't actually give them the exact model that the Federal Reserve is using in the course of the stress test. So the banks are flying blind in this regard. If you talk to bankers, most all of them will say that they think the stress tests are a good thing. I'm talking about the bankers, the CEOs of the very large banks in this country, those are the ones under the most stringent stress-test requirements. They will almost universally say that they think the stress tests are a good thing, but they will also almost universally complain about the fact that the Federal Reserve doesn't share the models it uses in the course of the stress test, so banks are just flying blind. Lapera: Yeah. That actually is kind of paired with another aspect of the CHOICE Act, which is that they are proposing that if banks hold a certain amount of money on their balance sheet, essentially as an emergency fund, that they won't be subject to quite as much regulation as they are now. Maxfield: Right. One of the main narratives that emerged from the financial crisis was that the reason the crisis was able to metastasize the way it did was because banks were overleveraged, they were undercapitalized. Which means, a typical bank will hold $1 worth of equity for $10 of assets. At the time, you had, like, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and companies like that -- Lehman Brothers, at certain points, was leveraged by something like 30:1. What that means was, if its assets fell by just 3%, if the value of its assets fell by just 3%, it would render it completely insolvent. In the wake of the financial crisis, all of these additional capital rules came in to require banks to not only hold more capital, but dictated the type of capital that they were supposed to hold. What the Financial CHOICE Act does is say, ""Look, let's do away with all these complicated capital rules,"" and these capital rules are incredibly complicated, ""and let's replace them with a simple leverage ratio where banks, all you do is compare how much equity or capital a bank has to its assets, and just use that simple ratio."" And if banks meet the threshold laid out in the Financial CHOICE Act, then they can be exempt from all of these additional regulations that Dodd-Frank is imposing, particularly on large banks. So the thought process is, look, if you just make them hold more capital, they're safer, so they don't have to do all these other things. Lapera: So the thing that the Financial CHOICE Act offers for banks that do this, in particular, that's probably very valuable for them is that, right now, really large banks have to go to the Fed before doing stuff like issuing a dividend or changing their business plan. And in theory, if they meet this leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they won't have to ask for permission to do any of that stuff anymore. Of course, it's really interesting, because when you say a simple ratio with assets, just like with people, there are assets that are really easy to move and there are assets that are really hard to move. So I don't know, I personally need a little bit more clarity around what that ratio actually looks like. It's a lot harder to sell a house and get that cash than it is to have cash to pay, and that analogy also holds for banks. They have some assets that are really hard to offload and some that are really easy to offload, so how did they end up calculating that ratio? The reason I don't know the answer to this yet is that I have not actually read all 600 pages of this act yet. I'm working on it, I'll do it eventually. So one of the reasons I haven't read all of it yet is because, it's passed the House and it's about to go to the Senate, and the Senate, in my opinion, is not going to let this pass as originally written. There's probably going to be quite a few amendments, and the language is probably going to change quite a lot, if it passes at all. Maxfield: And here's another really important point. They're saying that, if a bank holds enough capital to satisfy this simplified leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they're calling that an off-ramp -- the off-ramp being, you get off the highway with all these other regulations. Well, one of the really interesting regulations that it's looking like the Financial CHOICE Act is trying to attack and would allow these big banks, in particular, to avoid -- and let me read this from the executive summary of the Financial CHOICE Act. It says it will ""exempt banking organizations that have made a qualifying capital election from any federal law, rule, or regulation that provide limitations on mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions of assets or control ... "" So what does that mean? Through the 1970s-1980s, the banking industry deregulated. It allowed banks to open up house, operate branches, and allowed banks to operate across interstate lines, which is something that, in the past, they generally weren't allowed to do. Well, the quid pro quo in that case was that they were going to allow these banks to grow and do all these things and have more flexibility in terms of their operations, but on the other side of that, they wanted to stop these things from getting so enormous that if one of them were to fail, it would basically wipe out all the wealth of the United States. So they did that by saying, ""If you hold 10% or more of the nation's deposits, you are not allowed to then acquire another depository institution."" And right now, there are three banks that fit that -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. So right now, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, they cannot go out and buy any other banks, they're not allowed to because each one of them holds more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, if I'm reading it correctly, it's saying that, as long as those banks hold enough capital to meet that threshold in the act, they would then be free to merge together or buy other banks. So you could theoretically, in this case, see a merger between JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two biggest banks in the country. And I really doubt that that would happen because their branch bases completely overlap each other, so there would be too much redundancy in doing that. But people should think about, is that something we want to do? Do we want each individual bank to hold, say, 25% or 50% of the nation's deposits? Is that a direction we want to go in, given the fact that since the Civil War, more than 17,000 banks have failed? So it's a good thing to keep in mind. Lapera: Yeah, no, that's a really overwhelming thing to think about. We need to wrap up because we've been here for a while. It's partially because there's just so much stuff in this act to discuss. There's so many little things that could end up having really big impact. We'll continue to track the progress of the bill. Like I mentioned earlier, I really, really do not think this is going to get through the Senate completely unchanged. We'll talk about that more when we know more. Was there anything else you wanted to say, Maxfield? Maxfield: No, I think that's it. The only other thing is, it would dramatically impact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We could talk about that on a different show because that deserves its own conversation. But again, to leave off on the same point I made at the very beginning, the Financial CHOICE Act, like the Dodd-Frank Act, is neither good nor bad. It's just a reflection of the swing of the pendulum back and forth between regulators and industries. We've seen this many times in the past. And generally, when the pendulum swings, regardless of the direction in which it swings, it goes too far. Dodd-Frank went too far. The Financial CHOICE Act went too far. So to your point, Gaby, when this goes through the Senate, it's likely that they're going to tailor it back. Lapera: Yeah. That seems very likely, especially given everything that we've seen during this Administration so far. Who knows what'll happen? Things in D.C. either move at breakneck pace, or very, very slowly. We'll keep you guys up to date, don't worry.

Big bank stocks have surged over the past eight months, yet they still look relatively cheap when compared with regional bank stocks. Is this a sign you should buy the former and sell the latter? Not necessarily. The easiest way to see the difference in valuation between banks based on size is to compare the median valuation on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks the two dozen biggest banks in the country, with the KBW Regional Banking Index, which tracks 50 banks with between $5 billion and $40 billion worth of assets on their balance sheets. Index Median Forward Price-to-Earnings Multiple Median Price to Book Value Median Price to Tangible Book Value KBW Bank Index 14.88 1.36 1.92 KBW Regional Banking Index 17.41 1.66 2.18 Data source: YCharts.com. It doesn't matter which of the three primary valuation metrics you use: Regional banks such as Glacier Bancorp (NASDAQ:GBCI) and Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK) generally trade at a higher multiple compared with big banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Based on earnings, which is the metric that should take the lead in an analysis today, the median regional bank on the KBW Regional Banking Index trades for 17.41 times earnings per share over the next 12 months. The figure on the KBW Bank Index is 14.88. The story is the same when you look at valuation as a function of book value. The median regional bank stock trades for 2.18 times tangible book value, while the median big bank trades for a multiple of 1.92. Investors need to appreciate that these figures alone don't mean big banks are better buys than regional banks. A better interpretation of the difference is that regional banks have more opportunities to grow. Regional and community banks are growing like weeds. Image source: Getty Images. There are two ways to grow in the bank industry. The first is through organic growth -- attracting new customers through marketing efforts and gaining more of each customer's overall financial business, be it a mortgage, credit card, car loan, whatever. The second avenue is through mergers and acquisitions. Holding all else equal, a bank that can use both avenues can grow faster than a bank that can use only one. Herein lies the difference in valuation between the nation's biggest banks, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and regional banks, such as Glacier Bancorp and Bank of the Ozarks. As I've discussed in the past, the nation's three biggest banks, which are weighted heavily on KBW's large-cap bank index, are all shut out of the acquisition game, at least insofar as other depository institutions are concerned. That's because Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo each already hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. As such, these three banks are legally prohibited from acquiring other banks. Regional banks aren't similarly proscribed. Because none of the banks on the KBW Regional Banking Index come even close to the 10% deposit threshold, they can still merge with or acquire other banks, thereby supercharging growth. That's exactly what they've been doing. To cite just two examples, Glacier Bancorp has acquired nine banks since the beginning of 2009, and that's on top of 15 other deals it has completed since 1990. The same is true at Bank of the Ozarks, which has purchased a total of 16 other banks since the financial crisis. OZRK Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. The net result is that these two banks have seen their balance sheets expand rapidly over the past decade. Bank of the Ozarks went from $2.5 billion in assets 10 years ago to more than $19 billion today. And while Glacier Bancorp's recent ascent hasn't been as steep, the Montana-based bank has nevertheless more than doubled in size over the same stretch. Thus, the reason big bank stocks seem cheap is that their ability to grow is tightly constrained compared with their smaller, simpler counterparts in the regional banking space. ","

Exchange traded funds have made it easy for investors to drill down on specific types of investments, and Sector SPDR ETFs have become one of the most popular ways to invest in specific sectors of the stock market. Sector SPDRs track 10 different sectors in the S&P 500, with each Sector SPDR ETF delivering performance equal to that of the component stocks within the target industry. The investments have relatively low costs and offer diversification while letting you tailor your portfolio in line with your beliefs about the future of particular parts of the market. Sector SPDR 10-Year Average Annual Return Consumer Staples (NYSEMKT:XLP) 10.26% Consumer Discretionary (NYSEMKT:XLY) 10.25% Technology (NYSEMKT:XLK) 9.97% Health Care (NYSEMKT:XLV) 9.51% Industrials (NYSEMKT:XLI) 7.88% Utilities (NYSEMKT:XLU) 6.47% Materials (NYSEMKT:XLB) 5.06% Energy (NYSEMKT:XLE) 1.53% Financials (NYSEMKT:XLF) (0.72%) Real Estate (NYSEMKT:XLRE) N/A Data source: SPDR. N/A = not applicable; the Real Estate Sector SPDR began trading in October 2015. The Sector SPDR ETFs break up the S&P 500 into 10 separate indexes. Like any ETF, the Sector SPDRs trade throughout the trading day on the NYSE Arca exchange. As index funds, the investment objective for the ETFs is to match the share-price performance and dividend income of the underlying sectors that they track. Sector SPDRs have anywhere from 25 to 85 individual stock holdings in their portfolios, depending on the number of S&P 500 members in each respective industry. Consumer discretionary currently has the most stocks, while the materials sector comes in last. Image source: Getty Images. Just looking at the range of returns on the Sector SPDRs reveals the utility of having these ETFs available. Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has had a total return of about 7%, and the chart above shows that half of the sectors have outperformed that figure while the other half have underperformed. Finally, even if you want to own the whole market, Sector SPDRs give you the opportunity to get some tax benefits. In a rising market, simply owning the S&P 500 ETF as a single holding doesn't give you chances to reap any tax-loss benefits. However, even when the overall market rises, you'll generally find that some sectors lose ground. By using tax-loss harvesting strategies, you can collect tax losses on those underperforming sectors while deferring tax on rising sector ETFs until you sell them well into the future. There are a couple ways in which Sector SPDRs aren't the perfect investment. First, even with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.14%, they're still more expensive than broader-based market ETFs. For instance, you can find ETFs tracking the entire S&P 500 for as little as 0.04%. The other major problem is that like most ETFs, you have to pay brokerage commissions to trade Sector SPDRs. Even those brokers who offer commission-free ETF trading typically don't include the Sector SPDRs, with some instead offering their own proprietary sector-based ETFs. With low commissions available from many brokers, the costs of owning Sector SPDRs doesn't have to be prohibitive, but it is somewhat of a drag on performance. Nevertheless, for investors looking to make plays on specific parts of the market, Sector SPDRs are a good option to consider. With a long history behind them, Sector SPDRs will remain popular ETFs far into the future. ","

Global oil producers have said that crude production “should crater with prices around $40-$50 per barrel, [but] they are having a hard time restraining themselves from producing,” he said.

A chart from Wells Fargo shows that U.S. crude-oil and liquid-fuels production stands around 15.5 million barrels a day. It was at just over 14 million barrels a day in mid-2014: Prices of $80 a barrel are likely unattainable as well, “until the world’s oil producers stop overproducing,” said LaForge. Read: Why global oil production looks set to grow in 2018, despite OPEC-led output cuts “We continue to hear that big cutbacks are on the cusp of happening,” he said. “The evidence, however, implies otherwise. And the longer oil prices remain low and range-bound, the harder it will be for prices to bounced above $60—as production costs have dropped significantly since 2014, which keeps more producers in the game.” And each time prices do bounce toward $60, the “temptation to overproduce,” may be “overwhelming for those countries that rely heavily on oil revenues to sustain their economies and social programs,” LaForge said. Given all of that, “we are not expecting the price of WTI crude oil to climb anywhere near $100 per barrel over the next few years,” he said. Instead, Wells Fargo expects it to remain low and range-bound, bouncing between $30 and $60 per barrel. Still, “there is the possibility that the WTI crude-oil price finds its way into the high $30s to low $40s” at year’s end and if that happens, “we could become bullish in the short term,” LaForge said.

Tomi Kilgore,06222017,MarketWatch,06152017,"Published: June 22, 2017 4:36 p.m. ET Average price target jumps 11% after blowout results By Shares of Oracle Corp. soared to a record close Thursday, in the wake of blowout fiscal fourth-quarter results, sending Wall Street analysts scrambling to raise their price target to keep pace. The software giant reported adjusted earnings per share and revenue that beat expectations by the widest margins in at least five years, according to available FactSet data, sending the stock up $3.97, or 8.6%, to $50.30. That puts the stock

                                   on track for the biggest price and percentage gain since Dec. 18, 2014. The previous record close was Wednesday’s close of $46.33, while the previous all-time intraday high of $46.99 was reached on March 16. Don’t miss: Oracle leaps to record as cloud transition hits turning point. Oracle’s results prompted no less than 22 of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet to raise their stock-price targets. The new average target of $53.64 is 6.6% above current levels, and 11%, above the average target of $48.32 the day before the results were released. Analyst Steve Koenig at Wedbush Securities raised his price target to $56, which is 11.3% above current levels, from $44, which was 5% below Wednesday’s close of $46.33. That prompted Koenig to upgrade the stock to an outperform rating, after being at neutral since at least September 2014. Koenig said his new bullish outlook was based on improved software-as-a-service visibility, as Oracle’s applications business “gets over the ‘hump’ of its transition to cloud,” as well as to robust bookings activity and solid database licensing activity. He wrote in a note to clients that he sees potential for “sustained follow-through on positive price action as long-only investors adjust their [Oracle] weightings.” BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman boosted his stock price target to $57 from $48, citing one of Oracle’s “strongest quarters in years,” while J.P. Morgan’s Mark Murphy lifted his target to $55 from $51, saying he believes “this quarter will mark a turning point in investor sentiment.” Benchmark’s Yun Kim lifted the target to $62 from $55, saying the results indicate Oracle has reached the “critical scale” in its cloud business, making the stock “one of the best ways to play the current cloud computing trend.” Kim’s new target ties him with Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White for the second-highest on the Street, according to FactSet, just behind Wells Fargo’s Philip Winslow’s target of $62.50. Oracle shares have soared 31% year to date, while the SPDR Technology Select Sector exchange-traded fund

Department stores are already suffering from a number of headwinds, including declines in mall traffic and the need for massive store closures. “Prime Wardrobe capitalizes on all of these aspects, providing Prime members access to a broad assortment of real brands (presumably broader than any single department store given the current and likely future breadth of Amazon’s assortment) in one place, at an already familiar point of sale, with minimal friction (free delivery/returns),” Wells Fargo wrote in a note. “Simply put, this adds another nail into the department store coffin.” On Tuesday, the e-commerce giant announced that Amazon Wardrobe is in beta. The new service for Prime members gives customers the chance to try on apparel and footwear for seven days before purchasing. The more customers buy, the bigger the discount. Among the brands that are already involved are Calvin Klein, Levi’s, Adidas AG

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday as an influential U.S. Federal Reserve official expressed confidence that rising wages would help revive domestic inflation, which has shown signs of softening recently. The yen fell to two-week lows against the greenback and the euro after officials of the Bank of Japan at a meeting on Friday downplayed the likelihood that the bank would begin to roll back emergency stimulus to support the economy. Remarks by New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday that tightening in the labor market should help drive up inflation helped offset concerns by some investors that stubbornly low inflation would not allow policy-makers to raise rates further the rest of this year. “The Fed doesn’t seem to be too concerned about the recent pullback in the inflation data. They are committed to policy normalization,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Last week, the Fed, as expected, raised key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point and left the door open for another rate increase later this year. It also provided details on its plan to reduce its bond purchases in a bid to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent,” Dudley told a local business group in Plattsburg, New York. Traders raised their outlook on a rate hike by the Fed’s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting to 47 percent from 41 percent late on Friday FFZ7 FFF8, CME Group’s FedWatch tool showed. The dollar index .DXY, which gauges the dollar against six other currencies, was up 0.4 percent at 97.537. The euro was down 0.4 percent versus the greenback, to $1.1147 EUR=, while against the yen the dollar increased 0.5 percent, at 111.43 yen JPY=. The euro was up 0.1 percent against the yen, at 124.25 yen EURJPY=. Positioning data showed net bullish bets on the euro reached their highest level in more than six years last week. There was no discernible boost for the single currency from the landslide victory of French President Emmanuel Macron’s government in parliamentary elections on Sunday. Sterling declined 0.4 percent to $1.2732 GBP=D3 as Britain began formal negotiations on its planned exit from the European Union. The UK ruling Conservative Party’s loss of its parliament majority earlier this month raised speculation of a drift toward a “soft Brexit,” which had supported the pound. Many analysts, however, expect developments from the talks would hurt sterling. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s apparent “indifference” toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency’s power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the “cramming” of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a “conspicuous silence” on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short, “gossamer” memo “modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.” Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury’s hands for six months. The CFPB’s role as a public watchdog “extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,” Pauley wrote. “Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,” he added. “It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.” The CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office, which handled legal filings in the case, was reviewing the decision. In court papers, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley’s decision. Pauley has criticized government agencies before, including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research. The case is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v Sprint Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09931. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"June 15 (Reuters) - Metlife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, announced added responsibilities for some of its senior executives, adding to the pool of potential successors to its chief executive. The largest U.S. life insurer named Michel Khalaf president of its U.S. business, effective July 1, to replace Maria Morris who retires from the company this fall. Marty Lippert, the company’s head of global technology and operations will take on added responsibility of MetLife Holdings, the company said. The appointments of Khalaf and Lippert set up a “horse race” for MetLife’s CEO position, held by Steven Kandarian, 65, who currently has no plans to retire from his role, an analyst with Wells Fargo said in a note. Other potential candidates for the top job include Chief Financial Officer John Hele, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart, and Asia head Christopher Townsend, the note said. In June last year, Metlife’s board agreed to waive off its 65-year retirement policy for Kandarian, who has been the company’s president and CEO since May 2011. Ramy Tadros will also join MetLife in September as the new chief risk officer, the company said. Tadros comes from Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, where he served as the global head of insurance. He will replace Stan Talbi, who will retire at the end of August after 43 years with MetLife. (Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp said on Thursday it received U.S. approval for its emergency epinephrine syringes to treat severe allergic reactions that it intends to be a lower cost rival to Mylan NV’s widely used EpiPen, sending its shares up more than 50 percent. The company said it was looking for a marketing partner and would set a price for the product before its launch sometime in the second half of this year. Adamis said its pre-filled epinephrine syringes would be sold under the brand name Symjepi. Mylan has faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations after it doubled the cost for a pair of EpiPens to around $600, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing debate over the high cost of prescription medicines in the United States. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor. “We plan to position the product as a lower cost alternative,” Mark Flather, senior director for investor relations and corporate communications for Adamis, told Reuters. “We want to be part of the solution.” Epinephrine is the life-saving recommended treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications. Mylan has for years owned more than 90 percent of the market for emergency epinephrine injectors and its own authorized generic has recently surpassed sales of the branded version. “With an anticipated lower cost and attractive design, we believe Symjepi will be a meaningful competitor to EpiPen,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a research note. Other rival products are available. Impax Laboratories Inc’s Adrenaclick device is being sold through CVS Health Corp’s drugstore chain for about $110 a pair. Privately held Kaleo earlier this year began selling its Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector that it reacquired from Sanofi SA under an unusual pricing strategy but with little  success so far. The company said it would make the product available at no cost to many consumers but charge insurers $4,500. Sanofi in April sued Mylan, accusing it of engaging in illegal practices to squash EpiPen competition when the French drugmaker held the Auvi-Q rights. Adamis shares soared 53.3 percent to close at $5.75 on the Nasdaq and further rose to $6.00 in extended trading. Mylan shares closed down 2.4 percent at $36.98. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - London-based startup Blockchain has raised $40 million (31.5 million pounds) in a fresh round of funding as the software company rides a wave of enthusiasm for digital currency technology. Nokota Management and Digital Currency Group also participated in the financing round, which boosted Blockchain’s total funding to more than $70 million Tom Hulme, general partner at Alphabet’s venture firm GV, said the firm invested because “the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched.” Founded in 2011, Blockchain makes software that allows consumers and businesses to make transactions using digital currencies such as bitcoin. The firm is named after the internet platform that records and validates transactions between two parties without relying on an intermediary such as a bank. Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product. “Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,” Smith said. “My grandmother uses our product today.” The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology. While far from mainstream, digital currency has enjoyed growing popularity that Smith attributes to the instability of traditional currencies in places such as Brazil, and political uncertainty in Britain and the United States. The day after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Smith said, Blockchain had the second-highest number of new users sign up in a single day. “In you’re in an environment of rapidly deteriorating geopolitical stability,” Smith said, “you are open to new ideas and new products.” (1 British pound = $1.2686) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage of an annual stress test, showing they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession to meet regulatory requirements, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed’s most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year’s level. “This year’s results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,” said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank. “This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.” The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations. Wall Street analysts and trade groups quickly cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis. “We see today’s...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,” said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent. “From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,” he said. Thursday’s results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed’s methodology, using materials they submitted. The second portion of the test, to be released on Wednesday, will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks’ capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed’s. Under the Fed’s worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. However, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks’ aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more of its stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed’s approval. Under the Fed’s examination, Citi’s minimum CET1 ratio in the most stressful scenario was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Citi’s own analysis showed that metric at 10 percent. The Fed’s assessment showed the other five largest banks - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley - having minimum CET1 ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent. Of those, Goldman Sachs had the biggest optimism gap compared with the Fed when it came to the worst-case scenario. Its model produced a 9.8 percent minimum CET1 ratio, 1.4 points better than the Fed’s. Wells Fargo’s metric also fared better in its own test than under the Fed’s, by 0.8 of a point. Conversely, JPMorgan’s analysis appeared to be more dour, with its CET1 ratio coming in 1.3 percentage points below the Fed’s. Bank of America’s was 0.7 of a point worse. Banks that decide to resubmit their plans can only make downward revisions to the amount of capital they plan to use, meaning management teams that were too conservative may regret their submissions even if they pass. “If there is disappointment next week,” said Seiberg, “it is likely because the banks failed to ask for big enough distributions more than it is because the Federal Reserve was too tough.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - It took less than 24 hours for Warren Buffett, one of the world’s savviest dealmakers, to make a C$360 million (US$272 million) paper profit by propping up a major Canadian lender on life support. “It’s a typical Buffett bailout trade,” said Jared Dillian, an independent investment strategist and former trader betting the value of the Canadian dollar and several Canadian banks will fall. “He’s set it up where he’s risking a small amount to make a lot.” Its share price soared 27.2 percent on Thursday to C$19.00, leaving Buffett with a potential 90 percent paper profit on shares he is buying for just C$10 each. Home Capital’s share price nonetheless remains nearly two-thirds below its 2014 peak. “The deal is really low risk,” said John Huber, a portfolio manager at Saber Capital Management LLC in Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns Berkshire stock. “It’s an opportunistic deal that gives him very attractive risk-return terms.” Berkshire’s infusion was much needed by Home Capital, which has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run after being accused of, and then admitting to, concealing mortgage fraud. “The assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving,” said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst. “It implies a seal of approval.” Berkshire’s investment lets Buffett deploy some of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills. “Today’s announcement is a modest positive,” wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst. “But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.” Berkshire’s Columbia Insurance unit is acquiring the Home Capital equity, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, the credit line, if fully tapped, could generate C$180 million for Berkshire. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. His $5 billion Bank of America bet looks particularly savvy: it throws off $300 million in annual dividends, and Berkshire is sitting on an $11 billion gain on accompanying warrants. But with most of those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to requests for further comment. Home Capital’s problems accelerated in mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. “Reputational risk is why he’s getting 9 percent interest” at Home Capital, Seifert said. Berkshire has other investments tied to real estate, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. It also has several investments in Canada, including the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, for which it paid about $C3.1 billion in 2014. Many of Berkshire’s more than 90 business units also offer goods and services in the country, including the Ben Bridge jeweler, Benjamin Moore paints and the BNSF railroad. Despite his paper profit on Home Capital, Buffett believes investment gains and losses in a given period are usually meaningless. Buffett’s foray into Canadian real estate comes amid uncertainty about that country’s housing sector. The Ontario government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is “not going to stop the credit cycle up there,” said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital. “But it’s a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Youth tobacco use in the United States fell to historic lows in 2016, leading public health experts to speculate that a smoke-free generation may be within reach. The number of middle and high school students who used any tobacco product fell to 3.9 million in 2016 from 4.7 million in 2015, figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show, the first such decline since the CDC began reporting the measure in 2011. The number of high school students who smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior to being surveyed fell to 8 percent from 9.3 percent in 2015, the data shows. In 2011 the number was 15.8 percent. “This represents a historic public health victory,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, adding that the dramatic decline was the result of public messaging campaigns directed at youth. The decline in e-cigarette use was even greater, falling to 11.3 percent of high schoolers in 2016 from 16 percent in 2015. “These numbers are astounding,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the department of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health. “It really means that we may be within reach of a smoke-free generation.” The decline in cigarette use follows a broad array of public health campaigns and coincides with the rise of vaping. “This should put to bed any remaining concerns that e-cigarettes are a gateway to cigarettes or will lead to a re-normalization of smoking,” Siegel said. Between 2011 and 2016 overall tobacco use remained unchanged, the CDC’s figures show, though the balance between products changed. As e-cigarette use increased, traditional cigarette use declined. Cigarette use among high school students fell during that period to 8 percent from 15.8 percent while use of cigars fell to 7.7 percent from 11.6 percent. At the same time use of e-cigarettes rose to 11.3 percent from 1.5 percent and use of hookahs rose to 4.8 percent from 4.1 percent. President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes a nearly 20 percent drop in the CDC’s disease prevention and health promotion programs, including eliminating dedicated funding for its Office on Smoking and Health. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement that while the latest figures were encouraging “it is critical that we work to ensure this downward trend continues over the long term across all tobacco products.” He said the agency had issued more than 4,000 warning letters to retailers for selling e-cigarettes, cigars or hookah tobacco to minors since youth access restrictions went into effect last August. Gottlieb, who previously held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, has said publicly that certain e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. The latest data showed no decline in cigarette use among middle school students, where the rate was 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2015. Among middle school students, 4.3 percent used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 5.3 percent in 2015. Analysts with Wells Fargo Securities expect sales of vaping products to reach $4.4 billion in 2017.

The report in Preventive Medicine found that young adults who occasionally smoked conventional cigarettes smoked more of them if they also used e-cigarettes – battery-powered gadgets that heat liquid nicotine into vapor. “The participants who were vaping ended up using more cigarettes. It’s actually a risk factor for increasing their cigarette use,” lead author Neal Doran said in a phone interview. “They’re not using e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking,” said Doran, a psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Though smokers have been turning to e-cigarettes since they came on the market in 2007 as a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco, little is known about the long-term effects of the practice known as “vaping.” E-cigarette use grew 900 percent among high school students from 2011 through 2015, according to a report from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The 2016 report declares e-cigarettes “unsafe” for youth and young adults (bit.ly/2sKHv9P). The new study’s findings are “consistent with the worry that, regardless of whether vaping is itself unsafe, vaping causes worse outcomes because it leads to more consumption of cigarettes,” Doran said. Stanton Glantz, who directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the study “has tremendous policy implications.” “What this study shows very convincingly is that if they’re using e-cigarettes it’s actually leading them to smoke more conventional cigarettes, not less,” he said. Glantz was not involved with the new study, but the findings are consistent with those of previous research he conducted on adolescents. “The e-cigarettes are having the effect of stimulating conventional cigarette smoking,” he said in a phone interview. “They’re propping up and reinforcing the conventional cigarette market.” Doran and his team studied 319 Californians, ages 18 to 24. At the start, participants did not smoke daily but had smoked at least one cigarette in the prior six months. During the study, they reported their frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use five times at three-month intervals. Those who vaped more also reported smoking 18 percent more cigarettes, the study found. “In the larger scheme of things, e-cigarettes could be good, bad or neutral,” Doran said. “I don’t think we know the answers yet. This is one of the ways in which they could be bad – by people increasing their cigarette use if they’re using both.” Dual users may be exposed to more nicotine and wind up at risk for chronic tobacco use and dependence, the authors write. Previous studies have shown that e-cigarette use increases the risk of smoking tobacco-filled cigarettes. Some prior studies suggest that e-cigarette vapor may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke. But electronic alternatives nonetheless release potentially hazardous chemicals. Sales of vaping products are expected to reach $4.4 billion this year, according to Wells Fargo Securities analysts. With flavors like bubble gum and chocolate peanut butter cup, e-cigarettes or vape pens are often packaged to appeal to youth, who experts believe are more vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering banning flavored tobacco products. Residents opposed to the legislation recently argued that e-cigarettes help them smoke less. But, Glantz said, “This paper shows exactly the opposite is true.” Numbers released this month from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing declines in youth use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes have led some to claim that as proof of the benefits of vaping. But Doran and Glantz don’t see it that way. Instead, Glantz said he views the smoking decreases as evidence of efforts to educate youth about the potential harms of e-cigarettes as well as the results of efforts to regulate e-cigarettes with clean-indoor air laws and minimum-age requirements. States and local jurisdictions have imposed a patchwork of laws pertaining to the use of electronic cigarettes, and some states, including California, now tax vape products. “There’s this Wild West atmosphere with e-cigarettes, and there’s a lot of controversy and disagreement about whether they’re good or bad,” Doran said. “If they’re harmless, and they help people quit, then they’re great. If they make it harder to quit and also encourage people to smoke cigarettes who would not have smoked otherwise, then they’re terrible,” he said. “The truth probably lies in the middle, but where exactly is the key question.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tscS56 and bit.ly/2rBKmg8 Preventive Medicine, online June 3, 2017.

Alan Farley,06222017,Investopedia,06152017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Tobacco stocks have offered perfect investment vehicles for patient shareholders in the past decade, paying sizable dividends while posting a near endless series of new highs. Of course, taking exposure in this controversial industry isn't for everyone, especially if loved ones have paid the price for nicotine addiction. However, buying shares of a company isn't the same thing is supporting their business practices, and it's our job to seek out superior returns wherever we can find them. Strong Asian growth now drives industry profits, along with a resurgence in U.S. consumption triggered by modern vaporizer technology. In addition, the current administration has plans to strip away regulations across a broad swath of industries, making it unlikely that producers will get singled out for criticism in coming years. Given these tailwinds, tobacco stocks are likely to perform well into the next decade. (For more, check out: Back From the Dead: Why Tobacco Stocks Are Soaring.) Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) carries the highest sector capitalization for tobacco producers trading on the U.S. exchanges at $184 billion. It spun off from parent Altria Group, Inc. (MO) at $50 in March 2008 and entered an immediate downtrend that posted an all-time low at $32.04 in March 2009. The subsequent recovery wave reached the upper $90s in 2013, giving way to a multi-year correction that found support in the mid-$70s. The stock rallied above the prior high in 2016 and stalled out, building a base on new support and then spiraling lower in November. That marked the washout low, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reinstated the breakout in January 2017, followed by a powerful trend advance to an all-time high at $122.90 on June 6. Philip Morris stock has been pulling back in a bull flag pattern since that time, while daily stochastics have dropped into the oversold zone. (See also: Philip Morris, the Best Is Yet to Come: Wells Fargo.) Both monthly and weekly indicators have held buy cycles through this period, signaling a bullish divergence and potential pullback buying opportunity ahead of continued upside. Even so, a more advantageous trade entry might come if aggressive sellers break short-term support and knock the stock down to the top of the first quarter range and 50-day EMA at $115. Altria Group expanded into spirits and finance leasing services following the Philip Morris spin-off,​ but tobacco remains its biggest profit component. It fell just 7 points during the 2008 economic collapse, returning to the prior high in 2010, ahead of a 2011 breakout that reached $70.14 in July 2016. A pullback into the fourth quarter settled near $60, ahead of a January 2017 rally into March's all-time high at $76.54. (See also: Altria Optimistic on FDA's Filing of Heated Products.) Altria Group shares sold off into May, testing new support near $70 and turning higher into June, settling into a narrow platform that traded within 60 cents of resistance this week. On-balance volume (OBV) has already risen to a new high, highlighting strong institutional sponsorship that should support a fresh rally leg into the low $80s, where a two-year rising-highs trendline could trigger another reversal. Reynolds American Inc (RAI) rallied above the 2008 high in 2011 and entered a rising channel that accelerated into a steeper channel in 2014, highlighting impressive relative strength. The uptrend stalled near $50 at the end of 2015, giving way to a shallow correction that ended with a high-volume October gap to a new high in the mid-$50s. It took three months to clear the high posted in that session, yielding a long series of new highs into last week. (For more, see: Reynolds Announces Leadership Roles Post Acquisition by BAT.) The stock sold off with the broad market, dropping into the first test at the 50-day EMA since January, and it is still testing that level. Weekly stochastics fell into an unconfirmed sell cycle in reaction to the decline, raising odds for an intermediate correction lasting a minimum of eight to 12 weeks. Given this scenario, a pullback into deep support at $50 could offer a buying opportunity. Tobacco manufacturers and distributors are leading the broad market, resistant to broad headwinds facing other high-yielding instruments. This resilience could last into the new decade, given humankind's addictive interest in the controversial crop.

As a result, the Marlboro maker has benefited from strong sequential growth, doubling down on its iQOS products in Japan, where it currently holds nearly 10% of the market. The FDA has started its scientific review of the firm’s Modified Risk Tobacco Product application for iQOS, which would give it a competitive edge by allowing it to label its products as lower risk in the U.S. Investors are looking at the global tobacco giant’s new strategy and weighing whether the firm’s “reduced risk” innovation will offset secular pressures.

Michael J. Kramer,06222017,Investopedia,06152017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs What exactly is Visa Inc. (V)? Is it a financial firm or a credit services provider? What about a technology company? That sounds crazy, right? Or does it? Don't believe me; look at the makeup of the Financial Select Sectors SPDR ETF (XLF) and see the top 25 holdings: There's no Visa. Yeah, it is a company with a market cap of almost $220 billion, bigger than that of Citigroup (C), but it's not in the top 25 of the financials. So if it's not a financial, then what is it? Well, of course, Visa is a tech company! Just look at the Technology Select Sector XLK SPDR (XLK), and there it is: Visa with 3.38 percent weighting in the ETF. By the way, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is also there, with a 2.21 percent weighting. Incredible, right? How come Visa and Mastercard are technology companies while American Express is a financial company? There's a simple answer: The three companies are fundamentally different in a significant way. Visa is an electronic payment network, while American Express issues cards and takes on the debt of its cardholders. Fundamentally, banks and financials depend for the most part on interest rates because when banks lend money, they charge a rate of interest. When rates are low they make less money, and when rates rise they make more money. Currently, interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve all go to a bank's ability to make money. Visa is dependent on how many transactions are occurring on its network charging a fee for the use of the network. Financials also have default risks associated with them that a company like Visa does not. Because banks and financials hold the debts of their cardholders, there is a risk the cardholder will not pay those debts and default on them, resulting in a loss for the card issuer. Again, for a company such as Visa, those risks are not present. Visa's biggest risk would be declining usage of its network. V PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts  All of this matters because of the way investors value the company. Visa is priced as a growth stock with a 2018 forward P/E ratio of almost 28. We can see why. Analysts are looking for Visa's revenue to grow to $21.81 billion by 2019 from $17.88 billion in 2017, a growth rate of almost 22 percent. V Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Compare that to the growth of American Express, where revenue is expected to grow to $35.99 billion from $32.74 billion, a top-line growth rate of only 10 percent. AXP Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The difference is reflected in the performance of the stocks over the past decade or so. V data by YCharts Visa's stock performance resembles that much more of a technology company than a financial company.

Jeff Cox,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for the ouster of 12 board members at Wells Fargo due to the fake accounts scandal that has rocked the bank. In a letter sent Monday to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, the Massachusetts Democrat said the scandal has ""revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices."" Warren said the central bank has the authority under federal statute to remove the members who were on the board as the matter transpired. ""We have received the letter and plan to respond,"" a Fed spokesman told CNBC. In an agreement with multiple authorities last September, Wells agreed to pay a $185 million fine in conjunction with a scandal in which some 2 million client accounts were created without the customers' knowledge. More accounts may be involved, according to subsequent allegations. Even after paying the fine, Wells has continued to undergo reputational damage amid congressional inquiries and additional disclosures Warren, who has been a harsh critic, pointed out in the letter multiple instances where she believes the board at Wells failed customers. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices — problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Wells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo shares gained about 1.1 percent in early trading, about in line with the sector. Warren did not limit her criticism to Wells — she also said the Fed ""has done nothing to date"" to punish the bank ""despite its ample statutory authority."" ""I urge you to use the tools Congress has given you to remove the responsible board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country's largest banks,"" she wrote. The scandal arose as bank employees sought to meet aggressive sales demands. Employees would enroll customers in various programs without their consent in order to make quotas that have since been disbanded. Some 5,300 employees have been terminated as a result, and the bank also has a new CEO, Timothy J. Sloan, who took over for John Stumpf. For the Fed to act, it would need to establish that any individual board member's actions were unsafe or unsound to the bank. The Fed likely would need to initiate an enforcement action and prove its case. Yellen told Congress during testimony shortly after the scandal broke in September that the Fed is reviewing all operations for large banks and believes that in cases of wrongdoing, ""senior management (should) be held accountable.""

Antony Currie,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wells Fargo is driving its stagecoach further into the mud. The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers' mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right. The actions at issue might seem to help struggling borrowers: Wells Fargo lowered some customers' monthly mortgage payments, potentially making them manageable. But there are two huge potential problems. First, the bank did this while also extending the duration of the loans – in one case by some 30 years. That greatly increased the total interest borrowers were on the hook to pay over the life of their loans. Second, Wells Fargo made these changes, according to the lawsuits, without getting the consent of either the customers or the relevant bankruptcy courts. Wells Fargo denies this, saying it notified customers and does ""not finalize a loan modification without receiving signed documents"" from the required parties. The trouble is, Wells Fargo has mucked up mortgage lending and modification in the past. It was one of the five lenders that in 2012 agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government and 49 states to rectify poor loan servicing and foreclosure practices. Last year it forked over $1.2 billion to settle claims of reckless lending under a Federal Housing Administration program. Home loans should have been squeaky-clean after all that. Add to that its recent $185 million fine after retail bankers chasing aggressive account-opening targets created 2 million fake bank and credit-card accounts – events that cost former Chief Executive John Stumpf his job – and there's a sense of a bank still not ensuring it has fundamental checks and balances in place. Wells Fargo isn't alone. The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 exposed the many failings of the financial-services industry. For now, though, most of its big rivals appear to have put the worst of their transgressions behind them. Sloan's shop keeps swerving into new ones.

But that's exactly what happened on Wednesday, confounding many analysts who predicted higher long-term rates. The Fed made its widely expected move, raising its overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent, keying off data that showed the U.S. economy at full employment and growing steadily. The central bank's upgraded ""dot plot,"" which maps where central bank officials see rates headed in the future, suggests that another rate hike could be coming later this year. More from ETF.com:Tech ETFs retreat: Pullback aheadHere's what advisors are worried aboutMuni ETFs: No summer vacation But at least for now, the bond market doesn't care. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped by 8 basis points to 2.13 percent after briefly touching 2.1 percent earlier on Wednesday, its lowest level of 2017 (bond prices and yields move inversely). U.S. 10-Year Treasury Bond Yield In turn, many bond ETFs, such as the $46 billion iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), hit their highest levels of the year. AGG is now up 2.8 percent, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is up 4.6 percent; and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) is up 7.1 percent. Those numbers are particularly impressive considering this was supposed to be a bad year for bonds based on the consensus expectation at the start of 2017. YTD Returns For AGG, LQD, TLT According to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, the moves in bond prices on Wednesday may have less to do with the Fed rate hike than a pair of tepid economic data points released on the same day. Early in the day, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell by 0.1 percent in May, while its core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices) only grew by 0.1 percent, below the 0.2 percent increase that was anticipated. That translates into year-over-year growth of 1.9 percent for the headline CPI and 1.7 percent for the core CPI ― both below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target ― and the lowest reading for the core in two years. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in May sagged by 0.3 percent, much worse than the zero change that was expected and the largest decline in 16 months. ""The data that came out on Wednesday showing a slowdown in inflation and contraction in retail sales has made people question whether the Fed will hike as aggressively as previously thought,"" explained Jacobsen. ""The big move in 10-year yields came around the same time as the CPI and retail sales data came out. Weak consumer spending and slowing inflation means the terminal rate for the federal funds rate may be well below what the Fed's aiming for,"" he added. Perhaps the fall in the 10-year yield shouldn't have been surprising. There's been a familiar pattern in recent years where investors anticipate that rates will finally take off as the economy improves, only to see them come back down as data disappoints. In fact, despite all the hand-wringing about rising rates ever since the Fed embarked on the current tightening cycle in late 2015, it turns out that the 10-year yield is actually lower today than it was when the central bank made its first hike. Currently, the 10-year yield stands at 2.13 percent compared with 2.30 percent on Dec. 16, 2015. Even the five-year yield is lower, at 1.73 percent currently, compared with 1.75 percent on the day of the first hike. Wells Fargo's Jacobsen says that for anyone who's been waiting for higher interest rates to invest in bonds, now may be the time to throw in the towel. ""It could feel like a bus that never shows up if you're waiting for yields to spike higher. If you've been sitting in cash and waiting for yields to rise before getting back to your strategic allocation to fixed income, you may want to start dollar cost averaging toward your target,"" he explained. Equities have taken these lower rates in stride. The S&P 500 remains in record-high territory amid record-low volatility. Investors aren't interpreting lower rates as a bad thing, except for perhaps financials, which is now the second-worst-performing stock market sector behind energy. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up 5.3 percent this year, well behind the 9 percent gain for the broader S&P 500. ""Financials have been hurt by the flattening yield curve,"" Jacobsen noted. ""That doesn't look to be getting any better anytime soon. If the Fed talks up another rate hike before the inflation data actually turns, I'd worry about the Fed being too far ahead of the curve rather than too far behind it.""

The 222 stocks MSCI is planning to add to the emerging markets index include financial giants like Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, Guotai Junan and Ping An Insurance, according to a document on MSCI's website. Other names include Tsingtao Brewery, SAIC Motor, Suning Commerce and Spring Airlines. Another change for China this time ""is the reduction in the number of suspended stocks since the decline in the market. So there's less control and more availability in the shares,"" MSCI chairman and CEO Henry Fernandez said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""And three, the loosening of restrictions on the data in order to create index-linking investment vehicles."" MSCI also said, contrary to many expectations, Argentina's stocks would not join the emerging markets index due to investor concerns that recent improvements to market access needed to be in place for a longer period. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) rose 0.15 percent in after-hours trade. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is tracked by an estimated $1.6 trillion in assets, as of the end of June last year. The addition of the mainland Chinese shares could be a big boost to the world's second-largest stock market, which has until now drawn limited foreign investor interest because of high volatility, frequent trading halts and limited foreign investor access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. ""Institutional investors have more confidence in China's A share market today,"" said Peter Donisanu, investment strategy analyst Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The Shanghai composite is up 1.2 percent year-to-date, in contrast to gains of more than 18 percent for the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM). The S&P 500 is up more than 9 percent this year at record highs. MSCI also said next year, it would consider Saudi Arabia stocks for potential inclusion in the Emerging Markets Index.

Brian Price,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"With bullion recently hitting a three-week low of $1,257, one commodities trader is adamant that the charts are signaling sunshine on the horizon for gold bugs. Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services, is undeterred by what's been a volatile June for gold as he believes the commodity will enter into a long-term uptrend swing. ""I'm a longer-term bull in gold and if you look at the long-term chart the trend is still higher,"" Iuorio said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""What the Fed said yesterday is disconcerting to the market, and that's why the dollar rallied so hard."" The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for only the fourth time since the financial crisis, which was expected. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen took a decisively more hawkish tone despite the fact that inflation has fallen behind estimates. Iuorio feels deteriorating data will soon pull dollar prices down and, if gold stays above $1,235, then the longer trend is ultimately positive for the yellow metal. Historically, the dollar and gold are inversely correlated as a fall in dollar prices increases the value of other currencies. Such a move drives demand for commodities, like gold, as investors seek alternative assets to invest in. However, Iuorio warned that more hawkish rhetoric could indeed deter his thesis. ""I'm going to be wrong if they keep that talk up,"" the trader said. ""Gold's going to go lower. If it settles below $1,230, that's going to change me into a bear."" That said, Iuorio doesn't believe the Fed can continue with its hawkish tone and therefore feels confident in where gold prices are heading. Lastly, another factor for gold prices in the near term could be India. Bob Iaccino, of Path Trading Partners, noted on ""Futures Now"" that a tax on the precious metal is slated to go into effect at the end of the month in that country. This could cause local jewelers and private citizens to rush into the market and purchase gold in bulk before the tax comes into play, which would also help drive prices higher. Gold settled 1.5 percent lower on Thursday. The bond market's year in decline could round out with some relief, according to Bank of America's chartist.

Annie Pei,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Crude officially entered a bear market with Tuesday's drop, and one technical strategist is seeing another 30 percent drop in the commodity. On CNBC's ""Futures Now"" Tuesday, Paul Ciana of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that based on the charts, oil is well on its way to dropping to the $30 range, levels unseen since last April. ""It just keeps going down, breaking supports and failing at lower resistance levels,"" said Ciana. ""It's the absolute definition of a downtrend."" But on the same chart of oil, Ciana also pointed out that the crude crush could actually be signaling a rally in the bond market. A note released by BofAML on Tuesday, titled ""Bonds smile as oil cries,"" remarked on the inverse moves between crude and bonds that has been occurring over the past years. According to Ciana, the inverse relationship is playing out once again ""on an even larger scale,"" meaning that if crude continues to fall, bonds could soar even higher. ""Bond prices have risen to exceed the peak of [that double bottom this year, confirming] that the U.S. 10-year yield will likely fall to 1.97 percent this summer, if not sooner,"" he explained. Additionally, stocks could also be in trouble if crude falls. While Ciana doesn't see oil being a direct cause of a downturn in the market, depending on ""how much more the decline accelerates"" in crude, it could intensify any drop that may happen. And the outlook for crude on a fundamental basis isn't too positive, as Ciana also points out that demand for crude may fall during the summer.With Tuesday's drop, oil prices have now sunk 19 percent year to date, largely thanks to supply issues related to OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Ciana does see $45.50 being a key level to reach and hold for oil, meaning that the commodity would need to rally 4 percent for some of the concerns to subside.

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Elizabeth Warren hates big banks. But none more so than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Her displeasure with the California-based bank is understandable given that Wells Fargo spent the last decade and a half opening fake accounts for customers in order to artificially inflate its performance and thereby maximize its executives' annual bonuses. The latest example of Warren's ire was on display Monday, when she sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen calling for the removal of 12 members of Wells Fargo's board of directors -- for the record, that'd leave only three. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote, according to CNBC, which first reported on the letter. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices -- problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Senator Elizabeth Warren. Image source: Senator Warren's official website. Wells Fargo's executives deserve the blame and vitriol that have been heaped on them since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed the scam last year. While they make millions of dollars a year, the customers they preyed on were among the most vulnerable citizens in the country -- retirees living on fixed incomes and recent immigrants. To make matters worse, the company then retaliated against employees who sought to blow the whistle on the scam. Under the watch of Wells Fargo's executives and the board's oversight, the 160-year-old bank's once-sterling reputation has been deeply sullied. Given this, it's hard to disagree with Warren's assessment of Wells Fargo. The board was ultimately responsible for policing these types of risks and behaviors. The fact that they didn't, and that the scam was in many ways an indispensable element of Wells Fargo's business model, is prima facie evidence that they bear culpability for it. At the same time, one might find it worth acknowledging that Wells Fargo's directors were deceived in a sense, too. Prior to the fallout, the board's principal liaison with the bank's operating committee was John Stumpf, who at the time, though no longer, was both its chairman and CEO. As the company wrote in its 2015 proxy statement: Mr. Stumpf, with over 33 years of experience at Wells Fargo, has the knowledge, expertise, and experience to understand and clearly articulate to the Board the opportunities and risks facing the Company, as well as the leadership and management skills to promote and execute the Company's vision, values and strategy. The Board believes that Mr. Stumpf, rather than an outside director, is in the best position, as Chairman and CEO, to lead Board discussions regarding the Company's business and strategy and to help the Board respond quickly and effectively to the many business, market, and regulatory reform issues affecting the Company and the rapidly changing financial services industry. This description is laughable in hindsight, but Stumpf and his predecessor Dick Kovacevich had purposefully cultivated such a pristine image by then that few people would have questioned them. Image source: The Motley Fool. There's also value to keeping some of these directors around. They made an enormous and egregious mistake, but one can hope that they learned a lesson in their failure to perform their oversight duties. And that lesson, if it indeed has been learned, could very well make Wells Fargo a stronger organization. That may or may not be a fair assessment, but assuming that it is, there's value to their continued presence on the board. It's like the story of Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, who learned of an employee's mistake that cost the company $1 million. Watson not only refused to fire the employee, but he even rejected the employee's letter of resignation. ""Fire you?"" Watson responded. ""I've just invested one million dollars in your education.""

Image source: Getty Images. The fundamental challenge facing the banking industry is that the core product is a commodity. At its most basic level, every bank offers the same standard bank account, car loan, mortgage, and so on. Thus a bank's ability to provide other services and features that keep their customers coming back is paramount to retaining deposits and making profitable loans. Below, we'll explore the nine banks ranked most highly on customer loyalty as measured by Brand Keys, from first to the worst. Image source: Company. The largest bank by assets in the United States, JPMorgan has its hands in virtually everything related to banking and finance. The company boasts that it has a relationship with 60 million households in the United States. Its Chase credit card unit scores highly among everyday spenders and the affluent alike, receiving high marks for rewards and customer service, which gives it the No. 1 position in cards. Image source: Company. Unlike the others in the Big Four U.S. banks, Citi is really a global banking institution. It operates out of the world's largest metropolitan areas and has only a modest presence in smaller cities in the U.S. Yet it has remarkable reach into consumer spending through its credit cards business, which recently won a partnership with Costco, giving it the ability to tap into the wallets of the wholesale retailers' 53 million members with its highly rated Costco co-brand card. Customers love its cards' Price Rewind feature, which enables its cardholders to get a refund automatically when a product is advertised at a lower price within 60 days after purchase. Image source: Company. When Brian Moynihan took the job as Bank of America's chief executive officer, he made the customer experience paramount in rebuilding the bank's image -- and its profitability. Bank of America has invested heavily in its mobile and online banking services to improve customer satisfaction even as it has reduced the number of branches across the United States. The investment has paid off handsomely in the form of increased customer loyalty and approval ratings. Customers processed 108 million checks through the mobile app versus 170 million deposits in one of its branches last year. The bank brought private banking services to all of its clients with a banking-by-appointment feature so that its customers never have to wait in line to speak to a representative. Image source: Company. Bank of New York is hardly a traditional bank. It operates as a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides the back-end accounting services to keep everything running smoothly. Custody banks have inherently loyal customers due to the fact that moving billions of dollars of assets to another custodian is no easy task, and because the bank benefits from scale that enables it to manage its customers' assets at a price other banks would struggle to match. Image source: Company. Like Bank of America, PNC is ahead of the curve in creating products that are more convenient for customers while being more profitable for the bank. Thanks to investments in its online and mobile banking products, it recently reported that 60% of its customers use its ""non-teller channels"" for the majority of their transactions, up from 40% just three years ago. Its Virtual Wallet service enables its customers to make a budget, manage bills with the help of a calendar, and quickly see how they spend each and every dollar that flows into their accounts. Image source: Company. Once a pure-play credit card issuer, Capital One has become a bona fide banking operation that offers everything from checking and savings accounts to auto loans and even commercial banking services. The bank made inroads with consumers when it acquired ING Direct in 2011, which brought the bank more than 7 million customers who used its online banking services. Capital One has built on its ING Direct acquisition with an online banking service that its customers love -- a recent presentation notes that its mobile applications score the highest ratings in the iOS App Store. The bank also offers some of the highest-yielding money market accounts of any bank on this list, which certainly helps to keep its customers' loyalty. Image source: Company. Once known as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC is a worldwide banking operation that operates primarily as a corporate bank and credit card issuer in the United States. The company makes its ""internationally minded"" customers its priority through HSBC Premier, which provides banking and wealth management services to the mass affluent who live in large cities spanning from Seattle to New York City. With 2.4 million customers in the U.S., it has the smallest domestic operation of any of the banks on this list, given its focus on wealthier, international customers. Image source: Company. Calling itself ""America's Most Convenient Bank,"" TD Bank provides retail banking services to 9 million customers through approximately 1,300 branches along the East Coast. Its TD Select Savings Account offers free ATM services and reimburses customers for ATM fees charged at non-TD ATMs around the country. The company has mastered campaigns designed to promote customer loyalty, famously turning its ATMs into ""Automated Thanking Machines"" to deliver gifts to its customers -- cash, a trip to Trinidad to see a family member, and a unique experience throwing out a first pitch at a Blue Jays home game, for example. Image source: Company. Known colloquially as ""America's largest community bank,"" Wells Fargo has always operated as a simple retail banking institution. Convenience is key to customer loyalty, and Wells Fargo has the largest retail branch network of any U.S. bank, providing service to its customers through 6,200 banking locations and 12,000 ATMs scattered from coast to coast. Thanks to its large mortgage servicing business, it also has a relationship with millions of homeowners who aren't located near one of its branches. ","

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you follow bank stocks and big bank stocks, in particular, you should get acquainted with the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks. I refer to it frequently when I write, and therefore want to give readers a brief overview of exactly what it is, and why investors should care about it. The best way to think about the KBW Bank Index is to analogize it to the S&P 500, which tracks shares of 500 publicly traded companies with the largest market capitalizations in the United States. But instead of being industry agnostic, as the S&P 500 is, the KBW Bank Index focuses on only large-cap banks -- 24 of them, to be precise. These are banks that you've no doubt heard of, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). These are the four biggest banks in the country. They're also -- with the exception of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), the best-run big bank in the country -- the four that are weighted most heavily on the KBW Bank Index. The index weights its components according to a measure of market capitalization, adjusted for a bank's share price. This helps to explain why, as you can see in the table below, Citigroup carries the greatest weight on the Index, even though it has a smaller market capitalization than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, respectively. Name Weight on KBW Bank Index Citigroup 8.82% Bank of America 7.85% JPMorgan Chase 7.83% US Bancorp 7.83% Wells Fargo 7.68% State Street 4.54% Bank of New York Mellon 4.30% Northern Trust 4.03% PNC Financial 3.97% M&T Bank 3.97% SunTrust Banks 3.87% KeyCorp 3.81% BB&T 3.76% Fifth Third 3.63% Citizens Financial 3.52% Capital One 3.48% Regions Financial 3.30% First Republic Bank 2.86% Huntington Bancshares 2.75% Comerica 2.47% SVB Financial 1.80% Zions Bancorporation 1.65% New York Community Bancorp 1.25% People's United Financial 1.06% Source: Invesco. There's one side note that's worth pointing out when it comes to the KBW Bank Index. That is, not all of these banks have the same business model. Some are universal banks, which operate both investment and commercial-banking operations. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup fall most comfortably into this category. A second group consists of so-called custodial or trust banks. The three banks on the list that most naturally fall into this category are State Street, Northern Trust, and Bank of New York Mellon -- and I consider the latter to be a particularly interesting bank. These banks focus less on making loans and taking deposits and more on the administration of fixed-income securities for institutional investors like hedge funds, university endowments, and insurance companies. The final group are pure-play commercial banks, specializing in taking deposits and making loans. When most people think about a bank's business model, this is what they have in mind. The largest among these is Wells Fargo, followed by U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial, and Capital One Financial, respectively. Image source: Getty Images. An index like this is important for investors because it allows you to see whether a particular stock is in line with its peer group. Viewed in isolation, it's impossible to say whether a particular bank stock is cheap or expensive -- or efficient or inefficient -- or whatever metric it is that you're trying to tease out. But if you have a control group against which to compare a bank's valuation, profitability, or efficiency, then you can get a much better idea of its relative value or performance, which explains why I can confidently say that U.S. Bancorp is the best-run big bank in the country. This is what the KBW Bank Index enables one to do. And it's why I recommend that investors have a general understanding of what it is and how to use it. ","

Christy Bieber,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chase announced recently that its Sapphire, Sapphire Preferred, and Sapphire Reserve cardholders would be eligible for 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points if they obtained a mortgage with Chase bank by Aug. 6, 2017.  The offer was available only for current cardholders and only for a new purchase, not a refinance. It was not the first offer of its kind -- Capital One also made an offer of free mileage last year, and Wells Fargo has offered rebates for mortgage loans in the past -- but it was a generous offer, with rewards points worth around 2.1 cents per point. While getting points or other rewards for taking out a mortgage loan seems attractive if you're thinking about buying a home anyway, there are three big reasons why it's unwise to go with a particular mortgage lender just to earn miles or other credit card rewards. Image Source: Getty Images. Chase made its announcement in May and stipulated that cardholders who want the points would have to apply by the deadline on Aug. 6. This is a very limited amount of time to do your research into the mortgage terms offered by different lenders. Most incentive deals that mortgage lenders offer have deadlines, which puts artificial time pressure on you. Your mortgage will likely be the biggest debt you carry during your lifetime. You need time to carefully compare the different fees, interest rates, mortgage points, and other terms various lenders will offer you. The process shouldn't be rushed, and you shouldn't try to move faster than you're comfortable with just so you don't miss out on credit card points, airline miles, or other incentives. Your credit card points will be spent within a matter of months, while airlines miles earned for taking out a loan last only a trip or two. A mortgage is an obligation lasting 15 to 30 years. If you buy a house before you're ready because you don't want to miss out on a mortgage incentive, you'll be stuck with a real estate commission, transfer tax, and a host of other expensive costs if you need to sell the home. Unless you have all of your ducks on a row -- like a 20% down payment at the ready, as well as an emergency fund to cover maintenance and repairs -- you could also end up having to pay for private mortgage insurance or fall into debt if something unexpected happens. If you jump into a loan too fast, you may also feel the need to refinance a few years down the road in order to get better terms. Refinancing is a costly process, as you have to pay for a new appraisal and the closing costs of the new loan. Getting out of one mortgage loan and into another is also a time-consuming process that requires you to produce lots of paperwork. Banks may make up the cost by charging a slightly higher mortgage loan rate -- Chase's rates as of late May were 3.875% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan, while Bankrate had some lenders offering rates as low as 3.750% -- or they may charge more than other lenders for various costs like the credit check, home appraisal, loan origination fee, or underwriting fee. Even a small difference in interest can make a big difference in payments. A $200,000 loan at 3.750% would cost you $926 per month, and the total loan cost would be $333,443. By comparison, the same $200,000 mortgage at a 3.875% interest rate would come with payments of $940 per month, and the total cost of the loan would be $338,571. That tiny difference in the interest rate would cost you an extra $5,000 over the life of the loan -- and odds are the rewards you earned wouldn't come close to that value. Don't cheat yourself out of thousands of dollars by falling for a gimmick. Wait until you're ready to buy a home, carefully research different lenders with good reputations, and choose the best overall deal. If you just happen to get a reward from that lender, that bonus will be icing on the cake. ","
      
    3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Open a Mortgage to Get Rewards -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're in the market for a bank stock, then valuation is one thing you should keep in mind. Holding all else equal, the cheaper you can buy a stock, the bigger your return is likely to be. It's for this reason that I intermittently check bank stock valuations on the KBW Bank Index, the leading index of large-cap bank stocks headquartered in the United States. The average stock on the index trades for 15.5 times the bank's projected earnings per share over the next 12 months. That's not cheap, but it's far from expensive when you consider that the average stock on the S&P 500 is valued at 35 times forward earnings. But while bank stocks in general are valued at a lower multiple to earnings than the typical large-cap stock, some banks are still cheaper than others. Based on the forward P/E ratio, here are the five cheapest big bank stocks right now: Stock Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) 10.6 Citigroup (NYSE:C) 12.5 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 12.9 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 13.0 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 13.1 KBW Bank Index average 15.5 Data source: YCharts.com. Aside from Capital One, which is heavily concentrated in credit card loans and thus exposed to elevated credit risk, as credit card loans tend to default at higher rates than other types of loans, the four other cheapest big bank stocks have something in common: They're the largest banks in the country. Citigroup is the smallest of the four, yet it still has $1.8 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is the largest, overseeing $2.6 trillion in assets. And Bank of America and Wells Fargo fall in between these two. Why would these banks trade at lower valuations than smaller banks? It seems to me that there are four reasons. First, under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, global systemically important banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup can't operate with as much leverage as their smaller, simpler peers can. This is because they're subject to higher capital requirements, which necessarily reduces leverage and profitability. Second, all of these banks are effectively shut out of the market for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo each hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Therefore, they're prohibited under federal law from acquiring other banks. Citigroup doesn't face the same constraint, as its depositary base is weighted more heavily toward international deposits. But given the New York-based bank's strategy over the past few years of shrinking its balance sheet as opposed to growing it, it's safe to say that Citigroup is not in the market to acquire other banks, either. The net result is that these four banks are all largely confined to organic growth, which could weigh on their returns in the future relative to banks that aren't similarly prohibited from merging with or acquiring other banks. Image source: Getty Images. The third reason is that these four banks are especially difficult to analyze. Much of this comes from their sheer size and the extent of their operations. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup are all universal banks, meaning that they run both investment and commercial banking businesses. Commercial banking is straightforward, consisting of taking deposits and making loans. This yields recurring revenue that doesn't fluctuate widely on a quarterly or annual basis. Investment banking operations are much harder to understand and forecast into the future. This is primarily because an investment bank's top line is influenced by volume and volatility in the credit markets, both of which are all but impossible to predict in advance. Finally, while I've touched on this already, the biggest banks in the country are all subject to much more robust regulatory requirements than smaller banks. Their compliance exams are more intense. They face additional hurdles on the annual stress tests. And the way they structure their balance sheets is much more closely scrutinized by industry overseers. Does this mean you should avoid buying shares of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup? Not necessarily because, remember, while they may face more headwinds than smaller banks, their shares can also be picked up at much lower valuations. That said, as I've written in the past, given the towering heights of the stock market today, I think investors have more to gain than lose from waiting for a potential pullback in the market before diving deeper into stocks.

When I think about banks, I often think about Citigroup (NYSE:C) as being in a league of its own. It isn't because of its performance, which has left a lot to be desired over the past decade. It's rather because of its emphasis on international banking. There are a number of ways to show this, but one of the most obvious is to look at the distribution of Citigroup's deposits. More than half of the New York-based bank's deposits are held in offices outside the United States: Data source: regulatory filings. Chart by author. Even a cursory glance at this chart shows how different Citigroup is from the three other megabanks that sit atop the financial-services industry. JPMorgan Chase, which also has a large international presence, only has 17% of its deposits held in overseas offices. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo and Bank of America both come in at less than 10%. This goes to the core of Citigroup's business model. It was roughly a century ago that the bank became one of the first in the United States to establish a global banking presence, gaining footholds throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America, in addition to its operations in the United States. Citigroup not only has offices in other countries, but its operations abroad also pivot around consumer banking, the primary purpose of which is to attract deposits. This distinguishes it from the three other banks in the chart, whose international operations focus more on investment banking, as is the case with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America in particular. The purpose of investment banking is to help global corporations issue debt and equity, manage risk, and move money around the world. Image source: Getty Images. Citigroup's extensive overseas presence is a double-edged sword. While it serves to distinguish the $1.8 trillion bank from its peers, it also introduces another layer of risk. In the lead-up to the Great Depression, for instance, Citigroup gained notoriety for selling toxic Latin American bonds to its customers in the United States. And throughout the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, Citigroup came within a hair's breadth of failure because of overexposure to soured bonds issued by the likes of Brazil and Argentina. In an effort to reduce risk and simplify its business model since the financial crisis, Citigroup has pared down its operations abroad. In 2008, for instance, it sold its Japanese trust banking unit to Mitsubishi UFG Trust and Banking. Citigroup followed that up a year later by selling its retail brokerage business in Japan. And six years after that, it did the same with its retail banking operations in the East Asian country. These moves have simplified and streamlined Citigroup's business model. They've also helped the bank raise capital and de-risk its operations. But even though they represent a retreat for Citigroup in terms of its long-term focus on global banking, it's clear from the chart that the bank continues to distinguish itself from its peers in terms of the size and reach of its international footprint.

Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","

John Maxfield and Gaby Lapera,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Last week, the Financial CHOICE Act, a hulking 600-page piece of legislation regarding the banking industry, made its way through the House of Representatives. A full transcript follows the video. John Maxfield: It's going great, Gaby, how are you doing? Lapera: I'm doing pretty good. I had an exciting weekend. I was volunteering at Pride with The Motley Fool, so that was really exciting, and I went rock climbing. What a fulfilling weekend. Maxfield: Nice, that is a really fulfilling weekend. I basically spent the weekend mediating disputes between my five-year-old twin sons. [laughs] That's kind of like the referee in a boxing ring. Lapera: [laughs] Oh my gosh, I'm very impressed. My brother also has twins, and they are young and also a handful. You have the patience and energy of a saint. Talking about patience and energy, let's turn to Congress. Today, we're going to talk about the CHOICE Act, which stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs. Another in a long line of acronyms that are kind of just jammed in together to try to make something that's fun to say. The CHOICE Act just passed the House on Friday. The whole thing with the CHOICE Act, the reason that we're talking about it on the show, is that it's basically there to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is what was regulating all of the banking stuff that we've been talking about for literally, what, two years now, Maxfield? Maxfield: Yeah. Or five years. You and I have been talking about it for two years now. One of the ways that I think is really helpful to think about the Financial CHOICE Act is that, in all industries, particularly banking, you can look at it through the lens of cycles, different types of cycles -- the business cycle, the credit cycle, cycles in consumer confidence. But another cycle that you can use to think about, not only in the financial services sector, but in all sectors, is the regulatory cycle, specifically in terms of whether the industry has more power, or the regulators have more power, at any particular point in time. And after the financial crisis, when the Dodd-Frank Act was passed on largely partisan lines, basically just supported by the Democrats, that shifted a lot of power away from the industry over to regulators. And basically what the Financial CHOICE Act does is it reverses that. And it was passed in the house, like we said last week, on largely partisan lines, but the partisan lines were different: This time, it was Republicans supporting it and Democrats not supporting it. What it tries to do is take that power that Dodd-Frank gave to the regulators and give it back to the industry. Lapera: Yeah. The bill is sponsored, unsurprisingly, by a man named Jeb Hensarling, who is a Republican. As with most things political, things are falling along party lines. I want to take an opportunity to say that Maxfield and I are going to do our best to stay unbiased throughout this discussion, but everyone is a person and we all have opinions, and our opinions don't necessarily reflect that of The Motley Fool, but we're going to try to give you an informed, as objective as possible, discussion. My anthropology roots tell me that there is no way to have a completely unbiased discussion, so I'm going to leave it at that and talk a little bit more about the philosophy behind the CHOICE Act. Basically, a lot of people don't like Dodd-Frank. They think it puts too much pressure on the banks, it's too hard for them to make money the way that Dodd-Frank is structured. There's a few different parts to it, the big parts of the Financial CHOICE Act. But I think the one that a lot of people focus on is, the Financial CHOICE Act is looking to end ""too big to fail."" Maxfield: Right. To your point, Gaby, about the partisan basis, I want to address that before I jump into the too-big-to-fail part. The one thing to keep in mind is, even though Dodd-Frank was passed on partisan basis, and the Financial CHOICE Act made it through the House on a partisan basis, the fact of the matter is, almost everybody agrees, most knowledgeable sources agree, that Dodd-Frank went too far. And I'm somebody who thinks that there needs to be a robust regulatory framework around the banking systems, just because banks are so highly leveraged, and because they play a role in the monetary system of the United States and they're kind of, to a certain extent, an extension of the federal government. So you can't let banks go out there and do what they want, because they are acting, in a sense, on the part of taxpayers. So I think that's some good context to keep in mind. But Dodd-Frank, almost everybody would agree that it did go too far. So now the question is, how far do you tailor it back? Lapera: Yeah. And to get into that about being an extension of the government, it's not just that with the systemically important financial institutions. It's not just our country -- it's the entire world is tied into these financial systems. So people get concerned that if they fail, it's going to be -- to borrow a term from the Vietnam era -- a domino effect with other people's economies. So there is a lot of feelings riding on this, and a lot of this depends on how you view economic theory. I think 90% agree with you that Dodd-Frank potentially went too far. I don't know that the CHOICE Act is the answer, either. We'll see what happens. We'll get a little bit more into it. Let's talk a little bit about the actual components of the Financial CHOICE Act, and what they look like, what they mean in terms of existing legislation. Like I said earlier, too big to fail -- that's one of the big key components, ending too big to fail, of the Financial CHOICE Act. Maxfield: Right, if we go back to the financial crisis, here's an overarching way to think about this too-big-to-fail component. You had Citigroup, Bank of America, and AIG, you had your Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns -- these very large financial institutions. These financial institutions hold trillions of dollars in assets on their balance sheets, and oversee a large chunk of the deposits that you and I and everyone else deposits. So if one of those were to fail, it could cause catastrophic damage to the economy. In fact, if you go back to the Great Depression, the thing that caused the Great Depression, or transformed it from a typical recession into the Great Depression, was the failure of a bunch of banks. So that informed this whole too-big-to-fail idea where, even though it's extremely unpalatable to go in and bail out these huge firms with these executives that make tens of millions of dollars a year, and basically save them from their own mistakes, even though that's very unpalatable on almost every level, it does save the U.S. economy. What the CHOICE Act does is it tries to reduce the ability of regulators to step in and bail these banks out. Let me be clear. There is a very solid theoretical framework behind that, because the thought process is, if you go in and bail out these big banks and they know you're going to bail them out in the future, they have much less incentive to act responsibly. That's that whole thought process. If you go back to the financial crisis, the term -- I'm pulling a blank on the term -- but if you go back to the financial crisis, this was one of the main arguments that they asserted. So what Hensarling's act tries to do is dial that back, and it does it in a couple of different ways. No. 1, it removes the regulator's authority to take over these organizations that are troubled and liquidate them in an orderly way, and it transfers that authority over into the bankruptcy code. Lapera: Just a quick side note for listeners, this is called the Orderly Liquidation Authority, that's OLA, which you might see floating around if you're reading about this online. That's actually codified into law, and it's the way the government stepped in and made sure there was an orderly liquidation during the most recent financial crisis of banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Maxfield: Right. Also, the term I was thinking about earlier was moral hazard. That's the hazard that, if you're going to step in and bail someone out -- an institution -- that institution has less incentive to act responsibly. And like I said, that's grounded in theory. Lapera: And it's actually really funny, because earlier you were talking about spending the weekend refereeing between your two children. This is almost just a parenting concept, that if you reward that behavior, you're going to keep getting bad behavior. Maxfield: Exactly, that's exactly right. And all parents can understand that. Another important thing it does in that too-big-to-fail context is that it seeks to restrict the Federal Reserve's discount window lending to what's known as Bagehot's dictum. Lapera: There's a lot of words in there. What is a discount-window lending? I mean, what is discount-window lending? I sound like an old person... ""What is the Facebook?"" What is discount window lending? Maxfield: Discount window is, when a bank gets into trouble, one of the things that will happen is, its depositors will know it's in trouble, so they will all run on the bank at the same time to withdraw their deposits. That's known as a bank run. The problem with a bank run is, because banks are so leveraged, and they only hold a small amount of actual cash in terms of relative to deposits that they have, that can cause them to be completely illiquid. They can run out of cash trying to satisfy their depositors. What the discount window does is it allows banks to take some of its assets on its balance sheet, go to the Federal Reserve, use those assets as collateral, and then get cash from the Federal Reserve to satisfy depositors, to thereby stop or prevent a bank run. Maxfield: It happened with... the name of the bank is escaping me right now, but it happened with a major bank that was based in California during the financial crisis. And it was actually that bank that was taken over and turned into OneWest, which was the institution that was associated with Steven Mnuchin, who's now the Treasury Secretary. But it does still happen, but it's much less frequent because there is FDIC deposit insurance now, as well, that reduces the incentive for people to have to feel like they need to run on the banks and take their deposits out, because the FDIC will be there to stand behind the banks, anyway. So what Bagehot's dictum does is it says that the Federal Reserve should only allow banks to access the discount window -- or it says that the way the Federal Reserve could use the discount window is to lend freely and early in times of crisis, which is what happened last time -- but it should only do so to ""solvent firms and against good collateral at high interest rates."" It's that high-interest rates part that's really significant, because the idea there is, if you were using a punitive interest rate, banks are going to be less inclined to use the discount window. And if they're less inclined to use the discount window in times of crisis, the thought is that, ahead of time, they will be much more careful about the quality of the assets they put on their balance sheets, and the ability to turn those into cash in the public markets as opposed to having to go to the discount window of the Federal Reserve. Lapera: And you have just revealed the disconnect between Democrats and Republicans -- which is that Republicans believe that banks can be forced to be responsible enough to take care of themselves, and Democrats do not, and that's why they're pushing for all this extra regulation. Right now, that falls along partisan lines. Whatever you think is up to you. That's basically what's going on. Maxfield: I will say, to take politics out of this, I studied banks pretty intensely for a number of years, and I will tell you that in history, the thing that we know is that you need a strong and independent central bank, you need it at all times, but particularly in times of crisis. So you do want to be really careful in terms of both the authorities you give to a central bank in that situation and, in this case, the authorities that you take away from it. But again, this is something that, it will get worked out, and the pendulum swings back and forth between regulators and industry. And right now, this is a bill that swings at way back on the other side. I would say, just like Dodd-Frank went too far swinging the pendulum into the favor of regulators, Hensarling's act seems to me to go too far in the other direction. Which makes sense, given that Dodd-Frank was partisan on the Democratic side and the Financial CHOICE Act is partisan on the Republican side. Lapera: Yeah. Actually, you gave me a good segue earlier to kind of slide into this next big thing that the act is going to do, which is that it's going to significantly cut down on the authority of regulatory agencies. I think one of the most important things to note is that they're going to subject financial Regulatory agencies to the REINS Act. The REINS Act basically says that any agency that wants to impose a rule that costs more than $100 million a year needs to run it by Congress first, and if Congress fails to approve a rule within 70 days after it's been proposed, then the rule would go away -- it would be null and void. Which is hard, because if you have partisan control of committees, rules that would go against whatever the nature of that committee is at the moment can just sit for 70 days and never even get heard, and then it just doesn't happen, and that means that regulation is going to happen much more slowly. Maxfield: Right. The way it works now is that the Federal Reserve, the FCC, the CFPB, all these different regulatory agencies -- and this isn't just in the financial services arena, this is across all regulatory agencies and all industries, that in order to regulate their industries, they are given the authority to pass rules that, like, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to pass rules about appropriate products that can be marketed to customers. And those rules, there is a long process where they get insight from the industry and other interested parties. But then those regulatory agencies have the power to put those rules into place and require the industry to follow them. What the Financial CHOICE Act would do is add another layer in that step, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but here's the problem. That additional layer is Congressional approval of these rules. And you can imagine that that really adds a lot of complications to that whole process. It's not like you're just adding just one more hurdle. You're adding an extremely high hurdle that, depending on who is in control of Congress and the Senate at any particular point in time, these regulatory agencies may not be able to jump over. Again, I think that's probably the whole point of subjecting them to the REINS Act, which passed earlier this year. Lapera: Right, it's to reduce the amount of federal legislation that exists, that's really what the point of it is. But it's hard because, yes, maybe regulatory agencies shouldn't be making up rules without Congressional approval, but on the other hand, Congress takes a really long time to do things sometimes. Sometimes, agencies come up with stuff to protect people or help people, and then it gets codified into law, but until then, they're just responding quickly to the needs as they see them. So it's this really hard to push-and-pull thing that you have with government. Let's talk a little bit also about the Fed, which you mentioned is going to be affected by this act. It's hard, because the Fed has also been subjected to the REINS Act, as well. Maxfield: Right. There's one other piece to this. It's not only the REINS Act that they're subjecting the regulators to. They also subject the regulators to the appropriations process. That's a really important thing. Right now, let's take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is actually an agency within the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve is an independent agency. So you have multiple layers of independence. But one of the principal pieces of independence is that, in the case of the Federal Reserve, it is a profit-making entity -- it has a huge balance sheet full of assets that earn interest in time. So it doesn't have to go to Congress to get money to operate, which gives it independence from Congress. The same thing is true with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- don't quote me exactly on this -- since it was put into operation, and in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it has issued a total of something like $11 [billion] to $12 billion worth of fines to the industry, and it can use those fines to do, among other things, fund its own operations. So it, too, is kind of detached or insulated from that political process that is a part of the appropriations process. And what the Financial CHOICE Act does is, it would take away that independence and require these institutions to go to Congress for the funding, which would have a significant impact on them. Lapera: Yeah. And that's one of the big criticisms of the CFBP, that its critics levied at it, is that the CFPB might start just issuing fines just because it has a financial incentive to, as opposed to doing it because the fines really need to be issued. So that's kind of where that Financial CHOICE Act section, that's what it's trying to get at. Maxfield: Right. Then, to your point about going straight at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve is one of those institutions that, people either don't know anything about it, or they love it or hate it, or they don't know anything about it, and they love or hate it. And one of the things that people tend to think about when they think about the Federal Reserve is that it's some sort of conspiratorial entity that controls the money supply and does so for the economic elites, and things like that. And one of the reasons that these conspiracy theories are able to grow take on the forms that they're able to take is because it's a relatively non-transparent organization, particularly when it comes to managing the money supply. Another main principle of the Financial CHOICE Act is to increase the transparency of the Federal Reserve, both in terms of its overall operations and in terms of the way it manages the money supply. And what I mean by managing the money supply is, when it decides to raise or lower interest rates, because that's the lever that causes the money supply to expand or contract. Lapera: Yeah, and it's not just that. For example, the stress tests, no one is 100% sure what's in them. Maxfield: Exactly. So the stress tests right now, these happen once a year for large banks. The purpose of them is to see how they would perform in a hypothetical economic scenario that is analogous to the financial crisis. This is actually a very good piece of the regulatory pie in the banking industry, because it keeps bankers' eyes on making sure that the assets they put on the balance sheets aren't going to submit them to massive losses if, and when, the economy turns down, like it inevitably will. But the issue with the stress tests is that, when the banks submit all the information to the Federal Reserve for the stress test, when the banks are going through their planning process, in terms of structuring their balance sheets and their operations in a way that will help them make it through the stress test, is that the Federal Reserve doesn't actually give them the exact model that the Federal Reserve is using in the course of the stress test. So the banks are flying blind in this regard. If you talk to bankers, most all of them will say that they think the stress tests are a good thing. I'm talking about the bankers, the CEOs of the very large banks in this country, those are the ones under the most stringent stress-test requirements. They will almost universally say that they think the stress tests are a good thing, but they will also almost universally complain about the fact that the Federal Reserve doesn't share the models it uses in the course of the stress test, so banks are just flying blind. Lapera: Yeah. That actually is kind of paired with another aspect of the CHOICE Act, which is that they are proposing that if banks hold a certain amount of money on their balance sheet, essentially as an emergency fund, that they won't be subject to quite as much regulation as they are now. Maxfield: Right. One of the main narratives that emerged from the financial crisis was that the reason the crisis was able to metastasize the way it did was because banks were overleveraged, they were undercapitalized. Which means, a typical bank will hold $1 worth of equity for $10 of assets. At the time, you had, like, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and companies like that -- Lehman Brothers, at certain points, was leveraged by something like 30:1. What that means was, if its assets fell by just 3%, if the value of its assets fell by just 3%, it would render it completely insolvent. In the wake of the financial crisis, all of these additional capital rules came in to require banks to not only hold more capital, but dictated the type of capital that they were supposed to hold. What the Financial CHOICE Act does is say, ""Look, let's do away with all these complicated capital rules,"" and these capital rules are incredibly complicated, ""and let's replace them with a simple leverage ratio where banks, all you do is compare how much equity or capital a bank has to its assets, and just use that simple ratio."" And if banks meet the threshold laid out in the Financial CHOICE Act, then they can be exempt from all of these additional regulations that Dodd-Frank is imposing, particularly on large banks. So the thought process is, look, if you just make them hold more capital, they're safer, so they don't have to do all these other things. Lapera: So the thing that the Financial CHOICE Act offers for banks that do this, in particular, that's probably very valuable for them is that, right now, really large banks have to go to the Fed before doing stuff like issuing a dividend or changing their business plan. And in theory, if they meet this leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they won't have to ask for permission to do any of that stuff anymore. Of course, it's really interesting, because when you say a simple ratio with assets, just like with people, there are assets that are really easy to move and there are assets that are really hard to move. So I don't know, I personally need a little bit more clarity around what that ratio actually looks like. It's a lot harder to sell a house and get that cash than it is to have cash to pay, and that analogy also holds for banks. They have some assets that are really hard to offload and some that are really easy to offload, so how did they end up calculating that ratio? The reason I don't know the answer to this yet is that I have not actually read all 600 pages of this act yet. I'm working on it, I'll do it eventually. So one of the reasons I haven't read all of it yet is because, it's passed the House and it's about to go to the Senate, and the Senate, in my opinion, is not going to let this pass as originally written. There's probably going to be quite a few amendments, and the language is probably going to change quite a lot, if it passes at all. Maxfield: And here's another really important point. They're saying that, if a bank holds enough capital to satisfy this simplified leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they're calling that an off-ramp -- the off-ramp being, you get off the highway with all these other regulations. Well, one of the really interesting regulations that it's looking like the Financial CHOICE Act is trying to attack and would allow these big banks, in particular, to avoid -- and let me read this from the executive summary of the Financial CHOICE Act. It says it will ""exempt banking organizations that have made a qualifying capital election from any federal law, rule, or regulation that provide limitations on mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions of assets or control ... "" So what does that mean? Through the 1970s-1980s, the banking industry deregulated. It allowed banks to open up house, operate branches, and allowed banks to operate across interstate lines, which is something that, in the past, they generally weren't allowed to do. Well, the quid pro quo in that case was that they were going to allow these banks to grow and do all these things and have more flexibility in terms of their operations, but on the other side of that, they wanted to stop these things from getting so enormous that if one of them were to fail, it would basically wipe out all the wealth of the United States. So they did that by saying, ""If you hold 10% or more of the nation's deposits, you are not allowed to then acquire another depository institution."" And right now, there are three banks that fit that -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. So right now, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, they cannot go out and buy any other banks, they're not allowed to because each one of them holds more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, if I'm reading it correctly, it's saying that, as long as those banks hold enough capital to meet that threshold in the act, they would then be free to merge together or buy other banks. So you could theoretically, in this case, see a merger between JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two biggest banks in the country. And I really doubt that that would happen because their branch bases completely overlap each other, so there would be too much redundancy in doing that. But people should think about, is that something we want to do? Do we want each individual bank to hold, say, 25% or 50% of the nation's deposits? Is that a direction we want to go in, given the fact that since the Civil War, more than 17,000 banks have failed? So it's a good thing to keep in mind. Lapera: Yeah, no, that's a really overwhelming thing to think about. We need to wrap up because we've been here for a while. It's partially because there's just so much stuff in this act to discuss. There's so many little things that could end up having really big impact. We'll continue to track the progress of the bill. Like I mentioned earlier, I really, really do not think this is going to get through the Senate completely unchanged. We'll talk about that more when we know more. Was there anything else you wanted to say, Maxfield? Maxfield: No, I think that's it. The only other thing is, it would dramatically impact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We could talk about that on a different show because that deserves its own conversation. But again, to leave off on the same point I made at the very beginning, the Financial CHOICE Act, like the Dodd-Frank Act, is neither good nor bad. It's just a reflection of the swing of the pendulum back and forth between regulators and industries. We've seen this many times in the past. And generally, when the pendulum swings, regardless of the direction in which it swings, it goes too far. Dodd-Frank went too far. The Financial CHOICE Act went too far. So to your point, Gaby, when this goes through the Senate, it's likely that they're going to tailor it back. Lapera: Yeah. That seems very likely, especially given everything that we've seen during this Administration so far. Who knows what'll happen? Things in D.C. either move at breakneck pace, or very, very slowly. We'll keep you guys up to date, don't worry. If you guys have any questions, definitely email us at industryfocus@fool.com, or by tweeting us @MFIndustryFocus, and let us know what you'd like to hear about next. If you tweet us @MFIndustryFocus, I am actually now in charge of our Twitter feed, so yeah, that will actually be me responding to you. Thank you, Austin, for listening to this very long episode about financial regulation. [laughs] Austin Morgan: Of course. Lapera: He's looking at me like, ""You owe me one, bud."" Maxfield: He's asleep, yeah. Morgan: Just another Monday. Lapera: [laughs] As usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I hope everyone has a really great week. I hope that your week is less stressful than mine. I get stressed out every time we talk about politics on this show, so I'm going to go take an antacid and eat some lunch. Everyone, have a great day! ","
      
    What's the Deal with the Financial CHOICE Act? -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big bank stocks have surged over the past eight months, yet they still look relatively cheap when compared with regional bank stocks. Is this a sign you should buy the former and sell the latter? Not necessarily. The easiest way to see the difference in valuation between banks based on size is to compare the median valuation on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks the two dozen biggest banks in the country, with the KBW Regional Banking Index, which tracks 50 banks with between $5 billion and $40 billion worth of assets on their balance sheets. Index Median Forward Price-to-Earnings Multiple Median Price to Book Value Median Price to Tangible Book Value KBW Bank Index 14.88 1.36 1.92 KBW Regional Banking Index 17.41 1.66 2.18 Data source: YCharts.com. It doesn't matter which of the three primary valuation metrics you use: Regional banks such as Glacier Bancorp (NASDAQ:GBCI) and Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK) generally trade at a higher multiple compared with big banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Based on earnings, which is the metric that should take the lead in an analysis today, the median regional bank on the KBW Regional Banking Index trades for 17.41 times earnings per share over the next 12 months. The figure on the KBW Bank Index is 14.88. The story is the same when you look at valuation as a function of book value. The median regional bank stock trades for 2.18 times tangible book value, while the median big bank trades for a multiple of 1.92. Investors need to appreciate that these figures alone don't mean big banks are better buys than regional banks. A better interpretation of the difference is that regional banks have more opportunities to grow. Regional and community banks are growing like weeds. Image source: Getty Images. There are two ways to grow in the bank industry. The first is through organic growth -- attracting new customers through marketing efforts and gaining more of each customer's overall financial business, be it a mortgage, credit card, car loan, whatever. The second avenue is through mergers and acquisitions. Holding all else equal, a bank that can use both avenues can grow faster than a bank that can use only one. Herein lies the difference in valuation between the nation's biggest banks, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and regional banks, such as Glacier Bancorp and Bank of the Ozarks. As I've discussed in the past, the nation's three biggest banks, which are weighted heavily on KBW's large-cap bank index, are all shut out of the acquisition game, at least insofar as other depository institutions are concerned. That's because Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo each already hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. As such, these three banks are legally prohibited from acquiring other banks. Regional banks aren't similarly proscribed. Because none of the banks on the KBW Regional Banking Index come even close to the 10% deposit threshold, they can still merge with or acquire other banks, thereby supercharging growth. That's exactly what they've been doing. To cite just two examples, Glacier Bancorp has acquired nine banks since the beginning of 2009, and that's on top of 15 other deals it has completed since 1990. The same is true at Bank of the Ozarks, which has purchased a total of 16 other banks since the financial crisis. OZRK Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. The net result is that these two banks have seen their balance sheets expand rapidly over the past decade. Bank of the Ozarks went from $2.5 billion in assets 10 years ago to more than $19 billion today. And while Glacier Bancorp's recent ascent hasn't been as steep, the Montana-based bank has nevertheless more than doubled in size over the same stretch. Thus, the reason big bank stocks seem cheap is that their ability to grow is tightly constrained compared with their smaller, simpler counterparts in the regional banking space. ","
      
    Here's Why Big Bank Stocks Look Cheaper Than They Really Are -- The Motley Fool

Dan Caplinger,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Exchange traded funds have made it easy for investors to drill down on specific types of investments, and Sector SPDR ETFs have become one of the most popular ways to invest in specific sectors of the stock market. Sector SPDRs track 10 different sectors in the S&P 500, with each Sector SPDR ETF delivering performance equal to that of the component stocks within the target industry. The investments have relatively low costs and offer diversification while letting you tailor your portfolio in line with your beliefs about the future of particular parts of the market. Sector SPDR 10-Year Average Annual Return Consumer Staples (NYSEMKT:XLP) 10.26% Consumer Discretionary (NYSEMKT:XLY) 10.25% Technology (NYSEMKT:XLK) 9.97% Health Care (NYSEMKT:XLV) 9.51% Industrials (NYSEMKT:XLI) 7.88% Utilities (NYSEMKT:XLU) 6.47% Materials (NYSEMKT:XLB) 5.06% Energy (NYSEMKT:XLE) 1.53% Financials (NYSEMKT:XLF) (0.72%) Real Estate (NYSEMKT:XLRE) N/A Data source: SPDR. N/A = not applicable; the Real Estate Sector SPDR began trading in October 2015. The Sector SPDR ETFs break up the S&P 500 into 10 separate indexes. Like any ETF, the Sector SPDRs trade throughout the trading day on the NYSE Arca exchange. As index funds, the investment objective for the ETFs is to match the share-price performance and dividend income of the underlying sectors that they track. Sector SPDRs have anywhere from 25 to 85 individual stock holdings in their portfolios, depending on the number of S&P 500 members in each respective industry. Consumer discretionary currently has the most stocks, while the materials sector comes in last. Image source: Getty Images. Just looking at the range of returns on the Sector SPDRs reveals the utility of having these ETFs available. Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has had a total return of about 7%, and the chart above shows that half of the sectors have outperformed that figure while the other half have underperformed. Finally, even if you want to own the whole market, Sector SPDRs give you the opportunity to get some tax benefits. In a rising market, simply owning the S&P 500 ETF as a single holding doesn't give you chances to reap any tax-loss benefits. However, even when the overall market rises, you'll generally find that some sectors lose ground. By using tax-loss harvesting strategies, you can collect tax losses on those underperforming sectors while deferring tax on rising sector ETFs until you sell them well into the future. There are a couple ways in which Sector SPDRs aren't the perfect investment. First, even with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.14%, they're still more expensive than broader-based market ETFs. For instance, you can find ETFs tracking the entire S&P 500 for as little as 0.04%. The other major problem is that like most ETFs, you have to pay brokerage commissions to trade Sector SPDRs. Even those brokers who offer commission-free ETF trading typically don't include the Sector SPDRs, with some instead offering their own proprietary sector-based ETFs. With low commissions available from many brokers, the costs of owning Sector SPDRs doesn't have to be prohibitive, but it is somewhat of a drag on performance. Nevertheless, for investors looking to make plays on specific parts of the market, Sector SPDRs are a good option to consider. With a long history behind them, Sector SPDRs will remain popular ETFs far into the future. ","

Global oil producers have said that crude production “should crater with prices around $40-$50 per barrel, [but] they are having a hard time restraining themselves from producing,” he said. That’s particularly true for the U.S., which is producing more petroleum today, with West Texas Intermediate oil prices

A chart from Wells Fargo shows that U.S. crude-oil and liquid-fuels production stands around 15.5 million barrels a day. It was at just over 14 million barrels a day in mid-2014: Prices of $80 a barrel are likely unattainable as well, “until the world’s oil producers stop overproducing,” said LaForge. Read: Why global oil production looks set to grow in 2018, despite OPEC-led output cuts “We continue to hear that big cutbacks are on the cusp of happening,” he said. “The evidence, however, implies otherwise. And the longer oil prices remain low and range-bound, the harder it will be for prices to bounced above $60—as production costs have dropped significantly since 2014, which keeps more producers in the game.” And each time prices do bounce toward $60, the “temptation to overproduce,” may be “overwhelming for those countries that rely heavily on oil revenues to sustain their economies and social programs,” LaForge said. Given all of that, “we are not expecting the price of WTI crude oil to climb anywhere near $100 per barrel over the next few years,” he said. Instead, Wells Fargo expects it to remain low and range-bound, bouncing between $30 and $60 per barrel. Still, “there is the possibility that the WTI crude-oil price finds its way into the high $30s to low $40s” at year’s end and if that happens, “we could become bullish in the short term,” LaForge said.

The previous record close was Wednesday’s close of $46.33, while the previous all-time intraday high of $46.99 was reached on March 16. Don’t miss: Oracle leaps to record as cloud transition hits turning point. Oracle’s results prompted no less than 22 of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet to raise their stock-price targets. The new average target of $53.64 is 6.6% above current levels, and 11%, above the average target of $48.32 the day before the results were released. Analyst Steve Koenig at Wedbush Securities raised his price target to $56, which is 11.3% above current levels, from $44, which was 5% below Wednesday’s close of $46.33. That prompted Koenig to upgrade the stock to an outperform rating, after being at neutral since at least September 2014. Koenig said his new bullish outlook was based on improved software-as-a-service visibility, as Oracle’s applications business “gets over the ‘hump’ of its transition to cloud,” as well as to robust bookings activity and solid database licensing activity. He wrote in a note to clients that he sees potential for “sustained follow-through on positive price action as long-only investors adjust their [Oracle] weightings.” BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman boosted his stock price target to $57 from $48, citing one of Oracle’s “strongest quarters in years,” while J.P. Morgan’s Mark Murphy lifted his target to $55 from $51, saying he believes “this quarter will mark a turning point in investor sentiment.” Benchmark’s Yun Kim lifted the target to $62 from $55, saying the results indicate Oracle has reached the “critical scale” in its cloud business, making the stock “one of the best ways to play the current cloud computing trend.” Kim’s new target ties him with Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White for the second-highest on the Street, according to FactSet, just behind Wells Fargo’s Philip Winslow’s target of $62.50.

This analyst isn’t so sure Even without a stylist, experts say Wardrobe gives Amazon another benefit against the retail competition. “They’ve made improvements in style recommendation tactics, and providing a cleaner, more digestible user interface; but, the sheer amount of brands, styles and product offering on Amazon can still prove somewhat overwhelming,” said Andrea Timmerman, senior vice president at PMX Agency, a global marketing firm. “With this added availability of ‘try before you buy,’ it may very well entice more consumers to buy clothing from Amazon, but it also perhaps points to the fact that Amazon is putting more emphasis on what has traditionally been its best selling point: convenience.” See also: Blue Apron seeks IPO valuation boost despite Amazon-Whole Foods fears The service also adds a bit of personalization to Amazon’s multiplatform process, even if there isn’t a stylist available to help customers pick out an outfit. “The retail landscape has already been transformed by concierge services and by entering the concierge space, Amazon is further validating the demand,” said Adrien Nussenbaum, co-founder of Mirakl, a marketplace software company. “Combining the concierge experience with a seamless way to repurchase the same or similar products will be a successful endeavor for Amazon.” Amazon shares are up 41% for the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 index

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday as an influential U.S. Federal Reserve official expressed confidence that rising wages would help revive domestic inflation, which has shown signs of softening recently. The yen fell to two-week lows against the greenback and the euro after officials of the Bank of Japan at a meeting on Friday downplayed the likelihood that the bank would begin to roll back emergency stimulus to support the economy. Remarks by New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday that tightening in the labor market should help drive up inflation helped offset concerns by some investors that stubbornly low inflation would not allow policy-makers to raise rates further the rest of this year. “The Fed doesn’t seem to be too concerned about the recent pullback in the inflation data. They are committed to policy normalization,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Last week, the Fed, as expected, raised key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point and left the door open for another rate increase later this year. It also provided details on its plan to reduce its bond purchases in a bid to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent,” Dudley told a local business group in Plattsburg, New York. Traders raised their outlook on a rate hike by the Fed’s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting to 47 percent from 41 percent late on Friday FFZ7 FFF8, CME Group’s FedWatch tool showed. The dollar index .DXY, which gauges the dollar against six other currencies, was up 0.4 percent at 97.537. The euro was down 0.4 percent versus the greenback, to $1.1147 EUR=, while against the yen the dollar increased 0.5 percent, at 111.43 yen JPY=. The euro was up 0.1 percent against the yen, at 124.25 yen EURJPY=. Positioning data showed net bullish bets on the euro reached their highest level in more than six years last week. There was no discernible boost for the single currency from the landslide victory of French President Emmanuel Macron’s government in parliamentary elections on Sunday. Sterling declined 0.4 percent to $1.2732 GBP=D3 as Britain began formal negotiations on its planned exit from the European Union. The UK ruling Conservative Party’s loss of its parliament majority earlier this month raised speculation of a drift toward a “soft Brexit,” which had supported the pound. Many analysts, however, expect developments from the talks would hurt sterling. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s apparent “indifference” toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency’s power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the “cramming” of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a “conspicuous silence” on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short, “gossamer” memo “modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.” Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury’s hands for six months. The CFPB’s role as a public watchdog “extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,” Pauley wrote. “Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,” he added. “It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.” The CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office, which handled legal filings in the case, was reviewing the decision. In court papers, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley’s decision. Pauley has criticized government agencies before, including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research. The case is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v Sprint Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09931. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"June 15 (Reuters) - Metlife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, announced added responsibilities for some of its senior executives, adding to the pool of potential successors to its chief executive. The largest U.S. life insurer named Michel Khalaf president of its U.S. business, effective July 1, to replace Maria Morris who retires from the company this fall. Marty Lippert, the company’s head of global technology and operations will take on added responsibility of MetLife Holdings, the company said. The appointments of Khalaf and Lippert set up a “horse race” for MetLife’s CEO position, held by Steven Kandarian, 65, who currently has no plans to retire from his role, an analyst with Wells Fargo said in a note. Other potential candidates for the top job include Chief Financial Officer John Hele, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart, and Asia head Christopher Townsend, the note said. In June last year, Metlife’s board agreed to waive off its 65-year retirement policy for Kandarian, who has been the company’s president and CEO since May 2011. Ramy Tadros will also join MetLife in September as the new chief risk officer, the company said. Tadros comes from Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, where he served as the global head of insurance. He will replace Stan Talbi, who will retire at the end of August after 43 years with MetLife. (Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp said on Thursday it received U.S. approval for its emergency epinephrine syringes to treat severe allergic reactions that it intends to be a lower cost rival to Mylan NV’s widely used EpiPen, sending its shares up more than 50 percent. The company said it was looking for a marketing partner and would set a price for the product before its launch sometime in the second half of this year. Adamis said its pre-filled epinephrine syringes would be sold under the brand name Symjepi. Mylan has faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations after it doubled the cost for a pair of EpiPens to around $600, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing debate over the high cost of prescription medicines in the United States. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor. “We plan to position the product as a lower cost alternative,” Mark Flather, senior director for investor relations and corporate communications for Adamis, told Reuters. “We want to be part of the solution.” Epinephrine is the life-saving recommended treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications. Mylan has for years owned more than 90 percent of the market for emergency epinephrine injectors and its own authorized generic has recently surpassed sales of the branded version. “With an anticipated lower cost and attractive design, we believe Symjepi will be a meaningful competitor to EpiPen,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a research note. Other rival products are available. Impax Laboratories Inc’s Adrenaclick device is being sold through CVS Health Corp’s drugstore chain for about $110 a pair. Privately held Kaleo earlier this year began selling its Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector that it reacquired from Sanofi SA under an unusual pricing strategy but with little  success so far. The company said it would make the product available at no cost to many consumers but charge insurers $4,500. Sanofi in April sued Mylan, accusing it of engaging in illegal practices to squash EpiPen competition when the French drugmaker held the Auvi-Q rights. Adamis shares soared 53.3 percent to close at $5.75 on the Nasdaq and further rose to $6.00 in extended trading. Mylan shares closed down 2.4 percent at $36.98. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - London-based startup Blockchain has raised $40 million (31.5 million pounds) in a fresh round of funding as the software company rides a wave of enthusiasm for digital currency technology. Nokota Management and Digital Currency Group also participated in the financing round, which boosted Blockchain’s total funding to more than $70 million Tom Hulme, general partner at Alphabet’s venture firm GV, said the firm invested because “the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched.” Founded in 2011, Blockchain makes software that allows consumers and businesses to make transactions using digital currencies such as bitcoin. The firm is named after the internet platform that records and validates transactions between two parties without relying on an intermediary such as a bank. Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product. “Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,” Smith said. “My grandmother uses our product today.” The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology. While far from mainstream, digital currency has enjoyed growing popularity that Smith attributes to the instability of traditional currencies in places such as Brazil, and political uncertainty in Britain and the United States. The day after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Smith said, Blockchain had the second-highest number of new users sign up in a single day. “In you’re in an environment of rapidly deteriorating geopolitical stability,” Smith said, “you are open to new ideas and new products.” (1 British pound = $1.2686) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage of an annual stress test, showing they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession to meet regulatory requirements, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed’s most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year’s level. “This year’s results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,” said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank. “This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.” The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations. Wall Street analysts and trade groups quickly cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis. “We see today’s...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,” said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent. “From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,” he said. Thursday’s results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed’s methodology, using materials they submitted. The second portion of the test, to be released on Wednesday, will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks’ capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed’s. Under the Fed’s worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. However, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks’ aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more of its stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed’s approval. Under the Fed’s examination, Citi’s minimum CET1 ratio in the most stressful scenario was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Citi’s own analysis showed that metric at 10 percent. The Fed’s assessment showed the other five largest banks - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley - having minimum CET1 ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent. Of those, Goldman Sachs had the biggest optimism gap compared with the Fed when it came to the worst-case scenario. Its model produced a 9.8 percent minimum CET1 ratio, 1.4 points better than the Fed’s. Wells Fargo’s metric also fared better in its own test than under the Fed’s, by 0.8 of a point. Conversely, JPMorgan’s analysis appeared to be more dour, with its CET1 ratio coming in 1.3 percentage points below the Fed’s. Bank of America’s was 0.7 of a point worse. Banks that decide to resubmit their plans can only make downward revisions to the amount of capital they plan to use, meaning management teams that were too conservative may regret their submissions even if they pass. “If there is disappointment next week,” said Seiberg, “it is likely because the banks failed to ask for big enough distributions more than it is because the Federal Reserve was too tough.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - It took less than 24 hours for Warren Buffett, one of the world’s savviest dealmakers, to make a C$360 million (US$272 million) paper profit by propping up a major Canadian lender on life support. “It’s a typical Buffett bailout trade,” said Jared Dillian, an independent investment strategist and former trader betting the value of the Canadian dollar and several Canadian banks will fall. “He’s set it up where he’s risking a small amount to make a lot.” Its share price soared 27.2 percent on Thursday to C$19.00, leaving Buffett with a potential 90 percent paper profit on shares he is buying for just C$10 each. Home Capital’s share price nonetheless remains nearly two-thirds below its 2014 peak. “The deal is really low risk,” said John Huber, a portfolio manager at Saber Capital Management LLC in Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns Berkshire stock. “It’s an opportunistic deal that gives him very attractive risk-return terms.” Berkshire’s infusion was much needed by Home Capital, which has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run after being accused of, and then admitting to, concealing mortgage fraud. “The assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving,” said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst. “It implies a seal of approval.” Berkshire’s investment lets Buffett deploy some of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills. “Today’s announcement is a modest positive,” wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst. “But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.” Berkshire’s Columbia Insurance unit is acquiring the Home Capital equity, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, the credit line, if fully tapped, could generate C$180 million for Berkshire. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. His $5 billion Bank of America bet looks particularly savvy: it throws off $300 million in annual dividends, and Berkshire is sitting on an $11 billion gain on accompanying warrants. But with most of those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to requests for further comment. Home Capital’s problems accelerated in mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. “Reputational risk is why he’s getting 9 percent interest” at Home Capital, Seifert said. Berkshire has other investments tied to real estate, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. It also has several investments in Canada, including the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, for which it paid about $C3.1 billion in 2014. Many of Berkshire’s more than 90 business units also offer goods and services in the country, including the Ben Bridge jeweler, Benjamin Moore paints and the BNSF railroad. Despite his paper profit on Home Capital, Buffett believes investment gains and losses in a given period are usually meaningless. Buffett’s foray into Canadian real estate comes amid uncertainty about that country’s housing sector. The Ontario government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is “not going to stop the credit cycle up there,” said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital. “But it’s a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Youth tobacco use in the United States fell to historic lows in 2016, leading public health experts to speculate that a smoke-free generation may be within reach. The number of middle and high school students who used any tobacco product fell to 3.9 million in 2016 from 4.7 million in 2015, figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show, the first such decline since the CDC began reporting the measure in 2011. The number of high school students who smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior to being surveyed fell to 8 percent from 9.3 percent in 2015, the data shows. In 2011 the number was 15.8 percent. “This represents a historic public health victory,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, adding that the dramatic decline was the result of public messaging campaigns directed at youth. The decline in e-cigarette use was even greater, falling to 11.3 percent of high schoolers in 2016 from 16 percent in 2015. “These numbers are astounding,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the department of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health. “It really means that we may be within reach of a smoke-free generation.” The decline in cigarette use follows a broad array of public health campaigns and coincides with the rise of vaping. “This should put to bed any remaining concerns that e-cigarettes are a gateway to cigarettes or will lead to a re-normalization of smoking,” Siegel said. Between 2011 and 2016 overall tobacco use remained unchanged, the CDC’s figures show, though the balance between products changed. As e-cigarette use increased, traditional cigarette use declined. Cigarette use among high school students fell during that period to 8 percent from 15.8 percent while use of cigars fell to 7.7 percent from 11.6 percent. At the same time use of e-cigarettes rose to 11.3 percent from 1.5 percent and use of hookahs rose to 4.8 percent from 4.1 percent. President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes a nearly 20 percent drop in the CDC’s disease prevention and health promotion programs, including eliminating dedicated funding for its Office on Smoking and Health. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement that while the latest figures were encouraging “it is critical that we work to ensure this downward trend continues over the long term across all tobacco products.” He said the agency had issued more than 4,000 warning letters to retailers for selling e-cigarettes, cigars or hookah tobacco to minors since youth access restrictions went into effect last August. Gottlieb, who previously held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, has said publicly that certain e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. The latest data showed no decline in cigarette use among middle school students, where the rate was 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2015. Among middle school students, 4.3 percent used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 5.3 percent in 2015. Analysts with Wells Fargo Securities expect sales of vaping products to reach $4.4 billion in 2017.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters Health) - Tobacco companies have been selling electronic cigarettes as a way to wean smokers off paper cigarettes, but a new study suggests the strategy could backfire. The report in Preventive Medicine found that young adults who occasionally smoked conventional cigarettes smoked more of them if they also used e-cigarettes – battery-powered gadgets that heat liquid nicotine into vapor. “The participants who were vaping ended up using more cigarettes. It’s actually a risk factor for increasing their cigarette use,” lead author Neal Doran said in a phone interview. “They’re not using e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking,” said Doran, a psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Though smokers have been turning to e-cigarettes since they came on the market in 2007 as a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco, little is known about the long-term effects of the practice known as “vaping.” E-cigarette use grew 900 percent among high school students from 2011 through 2015, according to a report from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The 2016 report declares e-cigarettes “unsafe” for youth and young adults (bit.ly/2sKHv9P). The new study’s findings are “consistent with the worry that, regardless of whether vaping is itself unsafe, vaping causes worse outcomes because it leads to more consumption of cigarettes,” Doran said. Stanton Glantz, who directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the study “has tremendous policy implications.” “What this study shows very convincingly is that if they’re using e-cigarettes it’s actually leading them to smoke more conventional cigarettes, not less,” he said. Glantz was not involved with the new study, but the findings are consistent with those of previous research he conducted on adolescents. “The e-cigarettes are having the effect of stimulating conventional cigarette smoking,” he said in a phone interview. “They’re propping up and reinforcing the conventional cigarette market.” Doran and his team studied 319 Californians, ages 18 to 24. At the start, participants did not smoke daily but had smoked at least one cigarette in the prior six months. During the study, they reported their frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use five times at three-month intervals. Those who vaped more also reported smoking 18 percent more cigarettes, the study found. “In the larger scheme of things, e-cigarettes could be good, bad or neutral,” Doran said. “I don’t think we know the answers yet. This is one of the ways in which they could be bad – by people increasing their cigarette use if they’re using both.” Dual users may be exposed to more nicotine and wind up at risk for chronic tobacco use and dependence, the authors write. Previous studies have shown that e-cigarette use increases the risk of smoking tobacco-filled cigarettes. Some prior studies suggest that e-cigarette vapor may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke. But electronic alternatives nonetheless release potentially hazardous chemicals. Sales of vaping products are expected to reach $4.4 billion this year, according to Wells Fargo Securities analysts. With flavors like bubble gum and chocolate peanut butter cup, e-cigarettes or vape pens are often packaged to appeal to youth, who experts believe are more vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering banning flavored tobacco products. Residents opposed to the legislation recently argued that e-cigarettes help them smoke less. But, Glantz said, “This paper shows exactly the opposite is true.” Numbers released this month from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing declines in youth use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes have led some to claim that as proof of the benefits of vaping. But Doran and Glantz don’t see it that way. Instead, Glantz said he views the smoking decreases as evidence of efforts to educate youth about the potential harms of e-cigarettes as well as the results of efforts to regulate e-cigarettes with clean-indoor air laws and minimum-age requirements. States and local jurisdictions have imposed a patchwork of laws pertaining to the use of electronic cigarettes, and some states, including California, now tax vape products. “There’s this Wild West atmosphere with e-cigarettes, and there’s a lot of controversy and disagreement about whether they’re good or bad,” Doran said. “If they’re harmless, and they help people quit, then they’re great. If they make it harder to quit and also encourage people to smoke cigarettes who would not have smoked otherwise, then they’re terrible,” he said. “The truth probably lies in the middle, but where exactly is the key question.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tscS56 and bit.ly/2rBKmg8 Preventive Medicine, online June 3, 2017.

However, buying shares of a company isn't the same thing is supporting their business practices, and it's our job to seek out superior returns wherever we can find them. Strong Asian growth now drives industry profits, along with a resurgence in U.S. consumption triggered by modern vaporizer technology.

The subsequent recovery wave reached the upper $90s in 2013, giving way to a multi-year correction that found support in the mid-$70s. The stock rallied above the prior high in 2016 and stalled out, building a base on new support and then spiraling lower in November. That marked the washout low, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reinstated the breakout in January 2017, followed by a powerful trend advance to an all-time high at $122.90 on June 6. Philip Morris stock has been pulling back in a bull flag pattern since that time, while daily stochastics have dropped into the oversold zone.

Both monthly and weekly indicators have held buy cycles through this period, signaling a bullish divergence and potential pullback buying opportunity ahead of continued upside. Even so, a more advantageous trade entry might come if aggressive sellers break short-term support and knock the stock down to the top of the first quarter range and 50-day EMA at $115. Altria Group expanded into spirits and finance leasing services following the Philip Morris spin-off,​ but tobacco remains its biggest profit component. It fell just 7 points during the 2008 economic collapse, returning to the prior high in 2010, ahead of a 2011 breakout that reached $70.14 in July 2016. A pullback into the fourth quarter settled near $60, ahead of a January 2017 rally into March's all-time high at $76.54. (See also: Altria Optimistic on FDA's Filing of Heated Products.) Altria Group shares sold off into May, testing new support near $70 and turning higher into June, settling into a narrow platform that traded within 60 cents of resistance this week. On-balance volume (OBV) has already risen to a new high, highlighting strong institutional sponsorship that should support a fresh rally leg into the low $80s, where a two-year rising-highs trendline could trigger another reversal. Reynolds American Inc (RAI) rallied above the 2008 high in 2011 and entered a rising channel that accelerated into a steeper channel in 2014, highlighting impressive relative strength. The uptrend stalled near $50 at the end of 2015, giving way to a shallow correction that ended with a high-volume October gap to a new high in the mid-$50s. It took three months to clear the high posted in that session, yielding a long series of new highs into last week. (For more, see: Reynolds Announces Leadership Roles Post Acquisition by BAT.) The stock sold off with the broad market, dropping into the first test at the 50-day EMA since January, and it is still testing that level. Weekly stochastics fell into an unconfirmed sell cycle in reaction to the decline, raising odds for an intermediate correction lasting a minimum of eight to 12 weeks. Given this scenario, a pullback into deep support at $50 could offer a buying opportunity. Tobacco manufacturers and distributors are leading the broad market, resistant to broad headwinds facing other high-yielding instruments. This resilience could last into the new decade, given humankind's addictive interest in the controversial crop.

What about a technology company? That sounds crazy, right? Or does it? Don't believe me; look at the makeup of the Financial Select Sectors SPDR ETF (XLF) and see the top 25 holdings: There's no Visa. Yeah, it is a company with a market cap of almost $220 billion, bigger than that of Citigroup (C), but it's not in the top 25 of the financials. So if it's not a financial, then what is it? Well, of course, Visa is a tech company! Just look at the Technology Select Sector XLK SPDR (XLK), and there it is: Visa with 3.38 percent weighting in the ETF. By the way, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is also there, with a 2.21 percent weighting. Incredible, right? How come Visa and Mastercard are technology companies while American Express is a financial company? There's a simple answer: The three companies are fundamentally different in a significant way. Visa is an electronic payment network, while American Express issues cards and takes on the debt of its cardholders. Fundamentally, banks and financials depend for the most part on interest rates because when banks lend money, they charge a rate of interest. When rates are low they make less money, and when rates rise they make more money. Currently, interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve all go to a bank's ability to make money. Visa is dependent on how many transactions are occurring on its network charging a fee for the use of the network. Financials also have default risks associated with them that a company like Visa does not. Because banks and financials hold the debts of their cardholders, there is a risk the cardholder will not pay those debts and default on them, resulting in a loss for the card issuer. Again, for a company such as Visa, those risks are not present. Visa's biggest risk would be declining usage of its network.

Jeff Cox,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for the ouster of 12 board members at Wells Fargo due to the fake accounts scandal that has rocked the bank. In a letter sent Monday to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, the Massachusetts Democrat said the scandal has ""revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices."" Warren said the central bank has the authority under federal statute to remove the members who were on the board as the matter transpired. ""We have received the letter and plan to respond,"" a Fed spokesman told CNBC. In an agreement with multiple authorities last September, Wells agreed to pay a $185 million fine in conjunction with a scandal in which some 2 million client accounts were created without the customers' knowledge. More accounts may be involved, according to subsequent allegations. Even after paying the fine, Wells has continued to undergo reputational damage amid congressional inquiries and additional disclosures Warren, who has been a harsh critic, pointed out in the letter multiple instances where she believes the board at Wells failed customers. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices — problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Wells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo shares gained about 1.1 percent in early trading, about in line with the sector. Warren did not limit her criticism to Wells — she also said the Fed ""has done nothing to date"" to punish the bank ""despite its ample statutory authority."" ""I urge you to use the tools Congress has given you to remove the responsible board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country's largest banks,"" she wrote. The scandal arose as bank employees sought to meet aggressive sales demands. Employees would enroll customers in various programs without their consent in order to make quotas that have since been disbanded. Some 5,300 employees have been terminated as a result, and the bank also has a new CEO, Timothy J. Sloan, who took over for John Stumpf. For the Fed to act, it would need to establish that any individual board member's actions were unsafe or unsound to the bank. The Fed likely would need to initiate an enforcement action and prove its case.

Antony Currie,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wells Fargo is driving its stagecoach further into the mud. The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers' mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right. The actions at issue might seem to help struggling borrowers: Wells Fargo lowered some customers' monthly mortgage payments, potentially making them manageable. But there are two huge potential problems. First, the bank did this while also extending the duration of the loans – in one case by some 30 years. That greatly increased the total interest borrowers were on the hook to pay over the life of their loans. Second, Wells Fargo made these changes, according to the lawsuits, without getting the consent of either the customers or the relevant bankruptcy courts. Wells Fargo denies this, saying it notified customers and does ""not finalize a loan modification without receiving signed documents"" from the required parties. The trouble is, Wells Fargo has mucked up mortgage lending and modification in the past. It was one of the five lenders that in 2012 agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government and 49 states to rectify poor loan servicing and foreclosure practices. Last year it forked over $1.2 billion to settle claims of reckless lending under a Federal Housing Administration program. Home loans should have been squeaky-clean after all that. Add to that its recent $185 million fine after retail bankers chasing aggressive account-opening targets created 2 million fake bank and credit-card accounts – events that cost former Chief Executive John Stumpf his job – and there's a sense of a bank still not ensuring it has fundamental checks and balances in place. Wells Fargo isn't alone. The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 exposed the many failings of the financial-services industry. For now, though, most of its big rivals appear to have put the worst of their transgressions behind them. Sloan's shop keeps swerving into new ones.

Marguerite Ward,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Each summer, a new crop of college students take to Wall Street to dive into highly-competitive financial internships. Software engineering and other tech internships top the national list of best-paying gigs, but financial analyst and banking positions aren't far behind. Focusing on the 10 largest commercial banks in the U.S., CNBC collected Glassdoor salary data for roles titled ""summer financial analyst"" or ""summer analyst"" in New York City. Data stated as an hourly or yearly wage was converted to a monthly salary. Here's how much interns at big financial institutions can expect to make this summer, according to Glassdoor: 10.

Tae Kim,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wall Street is increasingly worried over the future growth opportunities for the two best-performing stocks in the market during the past year.Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD shares are both down significantly in recent days. Nvidia declined more than 5 percent over the past week through midday Thursday, while AMD fell 12 percent in that time period.The Nvidia decline was in part sparked by a negative Citron Research report on Nvidia Friday.""Take your profits and move on to Google (Alphabet). Exposure to the identical array of 'sexy businesses' with less risk on the downside,"" Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a post entitled ""NVIDIA: The Moment that Separates the Gamblers from the Investors. NVDA to Trade back to $130."" Left cited competition coming from Intel, Google and Xilinx in the data center markets and the likelihood of slowing growth in its gaming graphics card business as reasons for his skeptical view on Nvidia's market value.Wells Fargo is also concerned over rising competition in Nvidia's data center business. The firm reiterated its underperform rating on the company Wednesday.""We think that Nvidia has done very well in establishing itself as the dominant provider of standalone accelerator solutions for data center, but believe that this is already reflected in Nvidia's stock value,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Wong wrote in a note to clients. ""Over time we think additional providers of standalone accelerators might emerge, helping to drive growth in the standalone processor market but reducing Nvidia's market share in this market.""Even with the move lower, Nvidia shares have rallied 218 percent through midday Thursday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 17 percent return. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. AMD is right behind at No. 2 with a 156 percent return in the same time period. In similar fashion to the negative Nvidia notes, Goldman Sachs told investors to sell AMD shares Monday, questioning whether the recent cryptocurrency-driven demand for the company's graphics cards will last. ""According to our checks, the RX 570 and RX 580 graphics cards are sold out at numerous retail websites including NewEgg and Microcenter. While this dynamic may provide near-term upside to fundamentals, we believe [cryptocurrency mining] is unlikely to become a sustainable driver of EPS,"" Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in the note to clients.Nvidia declined to comment on the Citron and Wells Fargo reports.

"Sumit Roy, ETF.com",06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Who would have thought that on the day  the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark federal funds rate for the third time in six months, interest rates across the curve would plunge? But that's exactly what happened on Wednesday, confounding many analysts who predicted higher long-term rates. The Fed made its widely expected move, raising its overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent, keying off data that showed the U.S. economy at full employment and growing steadily. The central bank's upgraded ""dot plot,"" which maps where central bank officials see rates headed in the future, suggests that another rate hike could be coming later this year. More from ETF.com:Tech ETFs retreat: Pullback aheadHere's what advisors are worried aboutMuni ETFs: No summer vacation But at least for now, the bond market doesn't care. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped by 8 basis points to 2.13 percent after briefly touching 2.1 percent earlier on Wednesday, its lowest level of 2017 (bond prices and yields move inversely). U.S. 10-Year Treasury Bond Yield In turn, many bond ETFs, such as the $46 billion iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), hit their highest levels of the year. AGG is now up 2.8 percent, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is up 4.6 percent; and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) is up 7.1 percent. Those numbers are particularly impressive considering this was supposed to be a bad year for bonds based on the consensus expectation at the start of 2017. YTD Returns For AGG, LQD, TLT According to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, the moves in bond prices on Wednesday may have less to do with the Fed rate hike than a pair of tepid economic data points released on the same day. Early in the day, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell by 0.1 percent in May, while its core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices) only grew by 0.1 percent, below the 0.2 percent increase that was anticipated. That translates into year-over-year growth of 1.9 percent for the headline CPI and 1.7 percent for the core CPI ― both below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target ― and the lowest reading for the core in two years. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in May sagged by 0.3 percent, much worse than the zero change that was expected and the largest decline in 16 months. ""The data that came out on Wednesday showing a slowdown in inflation and contraction in retail sales has made people question whether the Fed will hike as aggressively as previously thought,"" explained Jacobsen. ""The big move in 10-year yields came around the same time as the CPI and retail sales data came out. Weak consumer spending and slowing inflation means the terminal rate for the federal funds rate may be well below what the Fed's aiming for,"" he added. Perhaps the fall in the 10-year yield shouldn't have been surprising. There's been a familiar pattern in recent years where investors anticipate that rates will finally take off as the economy improves, only to see them come back down as data disappoints. In fact, despite all the hand-wringing about rising rates ever since the Fed embarked on the current tightening cycle in late 2015, it turns out that the 10-year yield is actually lower today than it was when the central bank made its first hike. Currently, the 10-year yield stands at 2.13 percent compared with 2.30 percent on Dec. 16, 2015. Even the five-year yield is lower, at 1.73 percent currently, compared with 1.75 percent on the day of the first hike. Wells Fargo's Jacobsen says that for anyone who's been waiting for higher interest rates to invest in bonds, now may be the time to throw in the towel. ""It could feel like a bus that never shows up if you're waiting for yields to spike higher. If you've been sitting in cash and waiting for yields to rise before getting back to your strategic allocation to fixed income, you may want to start dollar cost averaging toward your target,"" he explained. Equities have taken these lower rates in stride. The S&P 500 remains in record-high territory amid record-low volatility. Investors aren't interpreting lower rates as a bad thing, except for perhaps financials, which is now the second-worst-performing stock market sector behind energy. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up 5.3 percent this year, well behind the 9 percent gain for the broader S&P 500. ""Financials have been hurt by the flattening yield curve,"" Jacobsen noted. ""That doesn't look to be getting any better anytime soon. If the Fed talks up another rate hike before the inflation data actually turns, I'd worry about the Fed being too far ahead of the curve rather than too far behind it.""

Evelyn Cheng,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"MSCI said Tuesday it plans to add 222 China A Large Cap stocks to its benchmark emerging markets index on a gradual basis beginning next year. This was the fourth-straight year MSCI was considering adding the mainland-traded stocks. In a long awaited decision, MSCI said Tuesday it plans to add mainland Chinese shares to its benchmark emerging markets index. The index giant said it will add 222 China A Large Cap stocks on a gradual basis beginning next year.  The review is the fourth straight year MSCI has considered adding the mainland-traded stocks, known as A shares in China. ""International investors have embraced the positive changes in the accessibility of the China A shares market over the last few years and now all conditions are set for MSCI to proceed with the first step of the inclusion,"" Remy Briand, MSCI Managing Director and Chairman of the MSCI Index Policy Committee, said in a release. ""The expansion of Stock Connect has been a game changer for the market opening of China A shares,"" he said, referring to a program giving foreign investors access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets through Hong Kong. The Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) traded more than 2 percent higher after hours. The 222 stocks MSCI is planning to add to the emerging markets index include financial giants like Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, Guotai Junan and Ping An Insurance, according to a document on MSCI's website. Other names include Tsingtao Brewery, SAIC Motor, Suning Commerce and Spring Airlines. Another change for China this time ""is the reduction in the number of suspended stocks since the decline in the market. So there's less control and more availability in the shares,"" MSCI chairman and CEO Henry Fernandez said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""And three, the loosening of restrictions on the data in order to create index-linking investment vehicles."" MSCI also said, contrary to many expectations, Argentina's stocks would not join the emerging markets index due to investor concerns that recent improvements to market access needed to be in place for a longer period. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) rose 0.15 percent in after-hours trade. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is tracked by an estimated $1.6 trillion in assets, as of the end of June last year. The addition of the mainland Chinese shares could be a big boost to the world's second-largest stock market, which has until now drawn limited foreign investor interest because of high volatility, frequent trading halts and limited foreign investor access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. ""Institutional investors have more confidence in China's A share market today,"" said Peter Donisanu, investment strategy analyst Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The Shanghai composite is up 1.2 percent year-to-date, in contrast to gains of more than 18 percent for the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM).

Brian Price,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"With bullion recently hitting a three-week low of $1,257, one commodities trader is adamant that the charts are signaling sunshine on the horizon for gold bugs. Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services, is undeterred by what's been a volatile June for gold as he believes the commodity will enter into a long-term uptrend swing. ""I'm a longer-term bull in gold and if you look at the long-term chart the trend is still higher,"" Iuorio said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""What the Fed said yesterday is disconcerting to the market, and that's why the dollar rallied so hard."" The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for only the fourth time since the financial crisis, which was expected. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen took a decisively more hawkish tone despite the fact that inflation has fallen behind estimates. Iuorio feels deteriorating data will soon pull dollar prices down and, if gold stays above $1,235, then the longer trend is ultimately positive for the yellow metal. Historically, the dollar and gold are inversely correlated as a fall in dollar prices increases the value of other currencies. Such a move drives demand for commodities, like gold, as investors seek alternative assets to invest in. However, Iuorio warned that more hawkish rhetoric could indeed deter his thesis. ""I'm going to be wrong if they keep that talk up,"" the trader said. ""Gold's going to go lower. If it settles below $1,230, that's going to change me into a bear."" That said, Iuorio doesn't believe the Fed can continue with its hawkish tone and therefore feels confident in where gold prices are heading. Lastly, another factor for gold prices in the near term could be India. Bob Iaccino, of Path Trading Partners, noted on ""Futures Now"" that a tax on the precious metal is slated to go into effect at the end of the month in that country. This could cause local jewelers and private citizens to rush into the market and purchase gold in bulk before the tax comes into play, which would also help drive prices higher.

Annie Pei,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Crude officially entered a bear market with Tuesday's drop, and one technical strategist is seeing another 30 percent drop in the commodity. On CNBC's ""Futures Now"" Tuesday, Paul Ciana of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that based on the charts, oil is well on its way to dropping to the $30 range, levels unseen since last April. ""It just keeps going down, breaking supports and failing at lower resistance levels,"" said Ciana. ""It's the absolute definition of a downtrend."" But on the same chart of oil, Ciana also pointed out that the crude crush could actually be signaling a rally in the bond market. A note released by BofAML on Tuesday, titled ""Bonds smile as oil cries,"" remarked on the inverse moves between crude and bonds that has been occurring over the past years. According to Ciana, the inverse relationship is playing out once again ""on an even larger scale,"" meaning that if crude continues to fall, bonds could soar even higher. ""Bond prices have risen to exceed the peak of [that double bottom this year, confirming] that the U.S. 10-year yield will likely fall to 1.97 percent this summer, if not sooner,"" he explained. Additionally, stocks could also be in trouble if crude falls. While Ciana doesn't see oil being a direct cause of a downturn in the market, depending on ""how much more the decline accelerates"" in crude, it could intensify any drop that may happen. And the outlook for crude on a fundamental basis isn't too positive, as Ciana also points out that demand for crude may fall during the summer.With Tuesday's drop, oil prices have now sunk 19 percent year to date, largely thanks to supply issues related to OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Ciana does see $45.50 being a key level to reach and hold for oil, meaning that the commodity would need to rally 4 percent for some of the concerns to subside.

Elizabeth Warren hates big banks. But none more so than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Her displeasure with the California-based bank is understandable given that Wells Fargo spent the last decade and a half opening fake accounts for customers in order to artificially inflate its performance and thereby maximize its executives' annual bonuses. The latest example of Warren's ire was on display Monday, when she sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen calling for the removal of 12 members of Wells Fargo's board of directors -- for the record, that'd leave only three. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote, according to CNBC, which first reported on the letter. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices -- problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Senator Elizabeth Warren. Image source: Senator Warren's official website. Wells Fargo's executives deserve the blame and vitriol that have been heaped on them since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed the scam last year. While they make millions of dollars a year, the customers they preyed on were among the most vulnerable citizens in the country -- retirees living on fixed incomes and recent immigrants. To make matters worse, the company then retaliated against employees who sought to blow the whistle on the scam. Under the watch of Wells Fargo's executives and the board's oversight, the 160-year-old bank's once-sterling reputation has been deeply sullied. Given this, it's hard to disagree with Warren's assessment of Wells Fargo. The board was ultimately responsible for policing these types of risks and behaviors. The fact that they didn't, and that the scam was in many ways an indispensable element of Wells Fargo's business model, is prima facie evidence that they bear culpability for it. At the same time, one might find it worth acknowledging that Wells Fargo's directors were deceived in a sense, too. Prior to the fallout, the board's principal liaison with the bank's operating committee was John Stumpf, who at the time, though no longer, was both its chairman and CEO. As the company wrote in its 2015 proxy statement: Mr. Stumpf, with over 33 years of experience at Wells Fargo, has the knowledge, expertise, and experience to understand and clearly articulate to the Board the opportunities and risks facing the Company, as well as the leadership and management skills to promote and execute the Company's vision, values and strategy. The Board believes that Mr. Stumpf, rather than an outside director, is in the best position, as Chairman and CEO, to lead Board discussions regarding the Company's business and strategy and to help the Board respond quickly and effectively to the many business, market, and regulatory reform issues affecting the Company and the rapidly changing financial services industry. This description is laughable in hindsight, but Stumpf and his predecessor Dick Kovacevich had purposefully cultivated such a pristine image by then that few people would have questioned them. Image source: The Motley Fool. There's also value to keeping some of these directors around. They made an enormous and egregious mistake, but one can hope that they learned a lesson in their failure to perform their oversight duties. And that lesson, if it indeed has been learned, could very well make Wells Fargo a stronger organization. That may or may not be a fair assessment, but assuming that it is, there's value to their continued presence on the board. It's like the story of Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, who learned of an employee's mistake that cost the company $1 million. Watson not only refused to fire the employee, but he even rejected the employee's letter of resignation. ""Fire you?"" Watson responded. ""I've just invested one million dollars in your education.""

At its most basic level, every bank offers the same standard bank account, car loan, mortgage, and so on. Thus a bank's ability to provide other services and features that keep their customers coming back is paramount to retaining deposits and making profitable loans. Below, we'll explore the nine banks ranked most highly on customer loyalty as measured by Brand Keys, from first to the worst. Image source: Company. The largest bank by assets in the United States, JPMorgan has its hands in virtually everything related to banking and finance. The company boasts that it has a relationship with 60 million households in the United States. Its Chase credit card unit scores highly among everyday spenders and the affluent alike, receiving high marks for rewards and customer service, which gives it the No. 1 position in cards. Image source: Company. Unlike the others in the Big Four U.S. banks, Citi is really a global banking institution. It operates out of the world's largest metropolitan areas and has only a modest presence in smaller cities in the U.S. Yet it has remarkable reach into consumer spending through its credit cards business, which recently won a partnership with Costco, giving it the ability to tap into the wallets of the wholesale retailers' 53 million members with its highly rated Costco co-brand card. Customers love its cards' Price Rewind feature, which enables its cardholders to get a refund automatically when a product is advertised at a lower price within 60 days after purchase. Image source: Company. When Brian Moynihan took the job as Bank of America's chief executive officer, he made the customer experience paramount in rebuilding the bank's image -- and its profitability. Bank of America has invested heavily in its mobile and online banking services to improve customer satisfaction even as it has reduced the number of branches across the United States. The investment has paid off handsomely in the form of increased customer loyalty and approval ratings. Customers processed 108 million checks through the mobile app versus 170 million deposits in one of its branches last year. The bank brought private banking services to all of its clients with a banking-by-appointment feature so that its customers never have to wait in line to speak to a representative. Image source: Company. Bank of New York is hardly a traditional bank. It operates as a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides the back-end accounting services to keep everything running smoothly. Custody banks have inherently loyal customers due to the fact that moving billions of dollars of assets to another custodian is no easy task, and because the bank benefits from scale that enables it to manage its customers' assets at a price other banks would struggle to match. Image source: Company. Like Bank of America, PNC is ahead of the curve in creating products that are more convenient for customers while being more profitable for the bank. Thanks to investments in its online and mobile banking products, it recently reported that 60% of its customers use its ""non-teller channels"" for the majority of their transactions, up from 40% just three years ago. Its Virtual Wallet service enables its customers to make a budget, manage bills with the help of a calendar, and quickly see how they spend each and every dollar that flows into their accounts. Image source: Company. Once a pure-play credit card issuer, Capital One has become a bona fide banking operation that offers everything from checking and savings accounts to auto loans and even commercial banking services. The bank made inroads with consumers when it acquired ING Direct in 2011, which brought the bank more than 7 million customers who used its online banking services. Capital One has built on its ING Direct acquisition with an online banking service that its customers love -- a recent presentation notes that its mobile applications score the highest ratings in the iOS App Store. The bank also offers some of the highest-yielding money market accounts of any bank on this list, which certainly helps to keep its customers' loyalty. Image source: Company. Once known as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC is a worldwide banking operation that operates primarily as a corporate bank and credit card issuer in the United States. The company makes its ""internationally minded"" customers its priority through HSBC Premier, which provides banking and wealth management services to the mass affluent who live in large cities spanning from Seattle to New York City. With 2.4 million customers in the U.S., it has the smallest domestic operation of any of the banks on this list, given its focus on wealthier, international customers. Image source: Company. Calling itself ""America's Most Convenient Bank,"" TD Bank provides retail banking services to 9 million customers through approximately 1,300 branches along the East Coast. Its TD Select Savings Account offers free ATM services and reimburses customers for ATM fees charged at non-TD ATMs around the country.

If you follow bank stocks and big bank stocks, in particular, you should get acquainted with the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks. I refer to it frequently when I write, and therefore want to give readers a brief overview of exactly what it is, and why investors should care about it. The best way to think about the KBW Bank Index is to analogize it to the S&P 500, which tracks shares of 500 publicly traded companies with the largest market capitalizations in the United States. But instead of being industry agnostic, as the S&P 500 is, the KBW Bank Index focuses on only large-cap banks -- 24 of them, to be precise. These are banks that you've no doubt heard of, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). These are the four biggest banks in the country. They're also -- with the exception of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), the best-run big bank in the country -- the four that are weighted most heavily on the KBW Bank Index. The index weights its components according to a measure of market capitalization, adjusted for a bank's share price. This helps to explain why, as you can see in the table below, Citigroup carries the greatest weight on the Index, even though it has a smaller market capitalization than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, respectively. Name Weight on KBW Bank Index Citigroup 8.82% Bank of America 7.85% JPMorgan Chase 7.83% US Bancorp 7.83% Wells Fargo 7.68% State Street 4.54% Bank of New York Mellon 4.30% Northern Trust 4.03% PNC Financial 3.97% M&T Bank 3.97% SunTrust Banks 3.87% KeyCorp 3.81% BB&T 3.76% Fifth Third 3.63% Citizens Financial 3.52% Capital One 3.48% Regions Financial 3.30% First Republic Bank 2.86% Huntington Bancshares 2.75% Comerica 2.47% SVB Financial 1.80% Zions Bancorporation 1.65% New York Community Bancorp 1.25% People's United Financial 1.06% Source: Invesco. There's one side note that's worth pointing out when it comes to the KBW Bank Index. That is, not all of these banks have the same business model. Some are universal banks, which operate both investment and commercial-banking operations. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup fall most comfortably into this category. A second group consists of so-called custodial or trust banks. The three banks on the list that most naturally fall into this category are State Street, Northern Trust, and Bank of New York Mellon -- and I consider the latter to be a particularly interesting bank. These banks focus less on making loans and taking deposits and more on the administration of fixed-income securities for institutional investors like hedge funds, university endowments, and insurance companies. The final group are pure-play commercial banks, specializing in taking deposits and making loans. When most people think about a bank's business model, this is what they have in mind. The largest among these is Wells Fargo, followed by U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial, and Capital One Financial, respectively. Image source: Getty Images. An index like this is important for investors because it allows you to see whether a particular stock is in line with its peer group. Viewed in isolation, it's impossible to say whether a particular bank stock is cheap or expensive -- or efficient or inefficient -- or whatever metric it is that you're trying to tease out. But if you have a control group against which to compare a bank's valuation, profitability, or efficiency, then you can get a much better idea of its relative value or performance, which explains why I can confidently say that U.S. Bancorp is the best-run big bank in the country. This is what the KBW Bank Index enables one to do. And it's why I recommend that investors have a general understanding of what it is and how to use it. ","

Chase announced recently that its Sapphire, Sapphire Preferred, and Sapphire Reserve cardholders would be eligible for 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points if they obtained a mortgage with Chase bank by Aug. 6, 2017.  The offer was available only for current cardholders and only for a new purchase, not a refinance. It was not the first offer of its kind -- Capital One also made an offer of free mileage last year, and Wells Fargo has offered rebates for mortgage loans in the past -- but it was a generous offer, with rewards points worth around 2.1 cents per point. While getting points or other rewards for taking out a mortgage loan seems attractive if you're thinking about buying a home anyway, there are three big reasons why it's unwise to go with a particular mortgage lender just to earn miles or other credit card rewards. Image Source: Getty Images. Chase made its announcement in May and stipulated that cardholders who want the points would have to apply by the deadline on Aug. 6. This is a very limited amount of time to do your research into the mortgage terms offered by different lenders. Most incentive deals that mortgage lenders offer have deadlines, which puts artificial time pressure on you. Your mortgage will likely be the biggest debt you carry during your lifetime. You need time to carefully compare the different fees, interest rates, mortgage points, and other terms various lenders will offer you. The process shouldn't be rushed, and you shouldn't try to move faster than you're comfortable with just so you don't miss out on credit card points, airline miles, or other incentives. Your credit card points will be spent within a matter of months, while airlines miles earned for taking out a loan last only a trip or two. A mortgage is an obligation lasting 15 to 30 years. If you buy a house before you're ready because you don't want to miss out on a mortgage incentive, you'll be stuck with a real estate commission, transfer tax, and a host of other expensive costs if you need to sell the home. Unless you have all of your ducks on a row -- like a 20% down payment at the ready, as well as an emergency fund to cover maintenance and repairs -- you could also end up having to pay for private mortgage insurance or fall into debt if something unexpected happens. If you jump into a loan too fast, you may also feel the need to refinance a few years down the road in order to get better terms. Refinancing is a costly process, as you have to pay for a new appraisal and the closing costs of the new loan. Getting out of one mortgage loan and into another is also a time-consuming process that requires you to produce lots of paperwork. Banks may make up the cost by charging a slightly higher mortgage loan rate -- Chase's rates as of late May were 3.875% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan, while Bankrate had some lenders offering rates as low as 3.750% -- or they may charge more than other lenders for various costs like the credit check, home appraisal, loan origination fee, or underwriting fee. Even a small difference in interest can make a big difference in payments. A $200,000 loan at 3.750% would cost you $926 per month, and the total loan cost would be $333,443. By comparison, the same $200,000 mortgage at a 3.875% interest rate would come with payments of $940 per month, and the total cost of the loan would be $338,571. That tiny difference in the interest rate would cost you an extra $5,000 over the life of the loan -- and odds are the rewards you earned wouldn't come close to that value. Don't cheat yourself out of thousands of dollars by falling for a gimmick. Wait until you're ready to buy a home, carefully research different lenders with good reputations, and choose the best overall deal. If you just happen to get a reward from that lender, that bonus will be icing on the cake. ","
      
    3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Open a Mortgage to Get Rewards -- The Motley Fool

If you're in the market for a bank stock, then valuation is one thing you should keep in mind. Holding all else equal, the cheaper you can buy a stock, the bigger your return is likely to be. It's for this reason that I intermittently check bank stock valuations on the KBW Bank Index, the leading index of large-cap bank stocks headquartered in the United States. The average stock on the index trades for 15.5 times the bank's projected earnings per share over the next 12 months. That's not cheap, but it's far from expensive when you consider that the average stock on the S&P 500 is valued at 35 times forward earnings. But while bank stocks in general are valued at a lower multiple to earnings than the typical large-cap stock, some banks are still cheaper than others. Based on the forward P/E ratio, here are the five cheapest big bank stocks right now: Stock Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) 10.6 Citigroup (NYSE:C) 12.5 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 12.9 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 13.0 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 13.1 KBW Bank Index average 15.5 Data source: YCharts.com. Aside from Capital One, which is heavily concentrated in credit card loans and thus exposed to elevated credit risk, as credit card loans tend to default at higher rates than other types of loans, the four other cheapest big bank stocks have something in common: They're the largest banks in the country. Citigroup is the smallest of the four, yet it still has $1.8 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is the largest, overseeing $2.6 trillion in assets. And Bank of America and Wells Fargo fall in between these two. Why would these banks trade at lower valuations than smaller banks? It seems to me that there are four reasons. First, under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, global systemically important banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup can't operate with as much leverage as their smaller, simpler peers can. This is because they're subject to higher capital requirements, which necessarily reduces leverage and profitability. Second, all of these banks are effectively shut out of the market for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo each hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Therefore, they're prohibited under federal law from acquiring other banks. Citigroup doesn't face the same constraint, as its depositary base is weighted more heavily toward international deposits. But given the New York-based bank's strategy over the past few years of shrinking its balance sheet as opposed to growing it, it's safe to say that Citigroup is not in the market to acquire other banks, either. The net result is that these four banks are all largely confined to organic growth, which could weigh on their returns in the future relative to banks that aren't similarly prohibited from merging with or acquiring other banks. Image source: Getty Images. The third reason is that these four banks are especially difficult to analyze. Much of this comes from their sheer size and the extent of their operations. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup are all universal banks, meaning that they run both investment and commercial banking businesses. Commercial banking is straightforward, consisting of taking deposits and making loans. This yields recurring revenue that doesn't fluctuate widely on a quarterly or annual basis. Investment banking operations are much harder to understand and forecast into the future. This is primarily because an investment bank's top line is influenced by volume and volatility in the credit markets, both of which are all but impossible to predict in advance. Finally, while I've touched on this already, the biggest banks in the country are all subject to much more robust regulatory requirements than smaller banks. Their compliance exams are more intense. They face additional hurdles on the annual stress tests. And the way they structure their balance sheets is much more closely scrutinized by industry overseers. Does this mean you should avoid buying shares of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup? Not necessarily because, remember, while they may face more headwinds than smaller banks, their shares can also be picked up at much lower valuations. That said, as I've written in the past, given the towering heights of the stock market today, I think investors have more to gain than lose from waiting for a potential pullback in the market before diving deeper into stocks.

When I think about banks, I often think about Citigroup (NYSE:C) as being in a league of its own. It isn't because of its performance, which has left a lot to be desired over the past decade. It's rather because of its emphasis on international banking. There are a number of ways to show this, but one of the most obvious is to look at the distribution of Citigroup's deposits. More than half of the New York-based bank's deposits are held in offices outside the United States: Data source: regulatory filings. Chart by author. Even a cursory glance at this chart shows how different Citigroup is from the three other megabanks that sit atop the financial-services industry. JPMorgan Chase, which also has a large international presence, only has 17% of its deposits held in overseas offices. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo and Bank of America both come in at less than 10%. This goes to the core of Citigroup's business model. It was roughly a century ago that the bank became one of the first in the United States to establish a global banking presence, gaining footholds throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America, in addition to its operations in the United States. Citigroup not only has offices in other countries, but its operations abroad also pivot around consumer banking, the primary purpose of which is to attract deposits. This distinguishes it from the three other banks in the chart, whose international operations focus more on investment banking, as is the case with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America in particular. The purpose of investment banking is to help global corporations issue debt and equity, manage risk, and move money around the world. Image source: Getty Images. Citigroup's extensive overseas presence is a double-edged sword. While it serves to distinguish the $1.8 trillion bank from its peers, it also introduces another layer of risk. In the lead-up to the Great Depression, for instance, Citigroup gained notoriety for selling toxic Latin American bonds to its customers in the United States. And throughout the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, Citigroup came within a hair's breadth of failure because of overexposure to soured bonds issued by the likes of Brazil and Argentina. In an effort to reduce risk and simplify its business model since the financial crisis, Citigroup has pared down its operations abroad. In 2008, for instance, it sold its Japanese trust banking unit to Mitsubishi UFG Trust and Banking. Citigroup followed that up a year later by selling its retail brokerage business in Japan. And six years after that, it did the same with its retail banking operations in the East Asian country. These moves have simplified and streamlined Citigroup's business model. They've also helped the bank raise capital and de-risk its operations. But even though they represent a retreat for Citigroup in terms of its long-term focus on global banking, it's clear from the chart that the bank continues to distinguish itself from its peers in terms of the size and reach of its international footprint.

Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","

John Maxfield and Gaby Lapera,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Last week, the Financial CHOICE Act, a hulking 600-page piece of legislation regarding the banking industry, made its way through the House of Representatives. A full transcript follows the video. John Maxfield: It's going great, Gaby, how are you doing? Lapera: I'm doing pretty good. I had an exciting weekend. I was volunteering at Pride with The Motley Fool, so that was really exciting, and I went rock climbing. What a fulfilling weekend. Maxfield: Nice, that is a really fulfilling weekend. I basically spent the weekend mediating disputes between my five-year-old twin sons. [laughs] That's kind of like the referee in a boxing ring. Lapera: [laughs] Oh my gosh, I'm very impressed. My brother also has twins, and they are young and also a handful. You have the patience and energy of a saint. Talking about patience and energy, let's turn to Congress. Today, we're going to talk about the CHOICE Act, which stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs. Another in a long line of acronyms that are kind of just jammed in together to try to make something that's fun to say. The CHOICE Act just passed the House on Friday. The whole thing with the CHOICE Act, the reason that we're talking about it on the show, is that it's basically there to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is what was regulating all of the banking stuff that we've been talking about for literally, what, two years now, Maxfield? Maxfield: Yeah. Or five years. You and I have been talking about it for two years now. One of the ways that I think is really helpful to think about the Financial CHOICE Act is that, in all industries, particularly banking, you can look at it through the lens of cycles, different types of cycles -- the business cycle, the credit cycle, cycles in consumer confidence. But another cycle that you can use to think about, not only in the financial services sector, but in all sectors, is the regulatory cycle, specifically in terms of whether the industry has more power, or the regulators have more power, at any particular point in time. And after the financial crisis, when the Dodd-Frank Act was passed on largely partisan lines, basically just supported by the Democrats, that shifted a lot of power away from the industry over to regulators. And basically what the Financial CHOICE Act does is it reverses that. And it was passed in the house, like we said last week, on largely partisan lines, but the partisan lines were different: This time, it was Republicans supporting it and Democrats not supporting it. What it tries to do is take that power that Dodd-Frank gave to the regulators and give it back to the industry. Lapera: Yeah. The bill is sponsored, unsurprisingly, by a man named Jeb Hensarling, who is a Republican. As with most things political, things are falling along party lines. I want to take an opportunity to say that Maxfield and I are going to do our best to stay unbiased throughout this discussion, but everyone is a person and we all have opinions, and our opinions don't necessarily reflect that of The Motley Fool, but we're going to try to give you an informed, as objective as possible, discussion. My anthropology roots tell me that there is no way to have a completely unbiased discussion, so I'm going to leave it at that and talk a little bit more about the philosophy behind the CHOICE Act. Basically, a lot of people don't like Dodd-Frank. They think it puts too much pressure on the banks, it's too hard for them to make money the way that Dodd-Frank is structured. There's a few different parts to it, the big parts of the Financial CHOICE Act. But I think the one that a lot of people focus on is, the Financial CHOICE Act is looking to end ""too big to fail."" Maxfield: Right. To your point, Gaby, about the partisan basis, I want to address that before I jump into the too-big-to-fail part. The one thing to keep in mind is, even though Dodd-Frank was passed on partisan basis, and the Financial CHOICE Act made it through the House on a partisan basis, the fact of the matter is, almost everybody agrees, most knowledgeable sources agree, that Dodd-Frank went too far. And I'm somebody who thinks that there needs to be a robust regulatory framework around the banking systems, just because banks are so highly leveraged, and because they play a role in the monetary system of the United States and they're kind of, to a certain extent, an extension of the federal government. So you can't let banks go out there and do what they want, because they are acting, in a sense, on the part of taxpayers. So I think that's some good context to keep in mind. But Dodd-Frank, almost everybody would agree that it did go too far. So now the question is, how far do you tailor it back? Lapera: Yeah. And to get into that about being an extension of the government, it's not just that with the systemically important financial institutions. It's not just our country -- it's the entire world is tied into these financial systems. So people get concerned that if they fail, it's going to be -- to borrow a term from the Vietnam era -- a domino effect with other people's economies. So there is a lot of feelings riding on this, and a lot of this depends on how you view economic theory. I think 90% agree with you that Dodd-Frank potentially went too far. I don't know that the CHOICE Act is the answer, either. We'll see what happens. We'll get a little bit more into it. Let's talk a little bit about the actual components of the Financial CHOICE Act, and what they look like, what they mean in terms of existing legislation. Like I said earlier, too big to fail -- that's one of the big key components, ending too big to fail, of the Financial CHOICE Act. Maxfield: Right, if we go back to the financial crisis, here's an overarching way to think about this too-big-to-fail component. You had Citigroup, Bank of America, and AIG, you had your Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns -- these very large financial institutions. These financial institutions hold trillions of dollars in assets on their balance sheets, and oversee a large chunk of the deposits that you and I and everyone else deposits. So if one of those were to fail, it could cause catastrophic damage to the economy. In fact, if you go back to the Great Depression, the thing that caused the Great Depression, or transformed it from a typical recession into the Great Depression, was the failure of a bunch of banks. So that informed this whole too-big-to-fail idea where, even though it's extremely unpalatable to go in and bail out these huge firms with these executives that make tens of millions of dollars a year, and basically save them from their own mistakes, even though that's very unpalatable on almost every level, it does save the U.S. economy. What the CHOICE Act does is it tries to reduce the ability of regulators to step in and bail these banks out. Let me be clear. There is a very solid theoretical framework behind that, because the thought process is, if you go in and bail out these big banks and they know you're going to bail them out in the future, they have much less incentive to act responsibly. That's that whole thought process. If you go back to the financial crisis, the term -- I'm pulling a blank on the term -- but if you go back to the financial crisis, this was one of the main arguments that they asserted. So what Hensarling's act tries to do is dial that back, and it does it in a couple of different ways. No. 1, it removes the regulator's authority to take over these organizations that are troubled and liquidate them in an orderly way, and it transfers that authority over into the bankruptcy code. Lapera: Just a quick side note for listeners, this is called the Orderly Liquidation Authority, that's OLA, which you might see floating around if you're reading about this online. That's actually codified into law, and it's the way the government stepped in and made sure there was an orderly liquidation during the most recent financial crisis of banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Maxfield: Right. Also, the term I was thinking about earlier was moral hazard. That's the hazard that, if you're going to step in and bail someone out -- an institution -- that institution has less incentive to act responsibly. And like I said, that's grounded in theory. Lapera: And it's actually really funny, because earlier you were talking about spending the weekend refereeing between your two children. This is almost just a parenting concept, that if you reward that behavior, you're going to keep getting bad behavior. Maxfield: Exactly, that's exactly right. And all parents can understand that. Another important thing it does in that too-big-to-fail context is that it seeks to restrict the Federal Reserve's discount window lending to what's known as Bagehot's dictum. Lapera: There's a lot of words in there. What is a discount-window lending? I mean, what is discount-window lending? I sound like an old person... ""What is the Facebook?"" What is discount window lending? Maxfield: Discount window is, when a bank gets into trouble, one of the things that will happen is, its depositors will know it's in trouble, so they will all run on the bank at the same time to withdraw their deposits. That's known as a bank run. The problem with a bank run is, because banks are so leveraged, and they only hold a small amount of actual cash in terms of relative to deposits that they have, that can cause them to be completely illiquid. They can run out of cash trying to satisfy their depositors. What the discount window does is it allows banks to take some of its assets on its balance sheet, go to the Federal Reserve, use those assets as collateral, and then get cash from the Federal Reserve to satisfy depositors, to thereby stop or prevent a bank run. Maxfield: It happened with... the name of the bank is escaping me right now, but it happened with a major bank that was based in California during the financial crisis. And it was actually that bank that was taken over and turned into OneWest, which was the institution that was associated with Steven Mnuchin, who's now the Treasury Secretary. But it does still happen, but it's much less frequent because there is FDIC deposit insurance now, as well, that reduces the incentive for people to have to feel like they need to run on the banks and take their deposits out, because the FDIC will be there to stand behind the banks, anyway. So what Bagehot's dictum does is it says that the Federal Reserve should only allow banks to access the discount window -- or it says that the way the Federal Reserve could use the discount window is to lend freely and early in times of crisis, which is what happened last time -- but it should only do so to ""solvent firms and against good collateral at high interest rates."" It's that high-interest rates part that's really significant, because the idea there is, if you were using a punitive interest rate, banks are going to be less inclined to use the discount window. And if they're less inclined to use the discount window in times of crisis, the thought is that, ahead of time, they will be much more careful about the quality of the assets they put on their balance sheets, and the ability to turn those into cash in the public markets as opposed to having to go to the discount window of the Federal Reserve. Lapera: And you have just revealed the disconnect between Democrats and Republicans -- which is that Republicans believe that banks can be forced to be responsible enough to take care of themselves, and Democrats do not, and that's why they're pushing for all this extra regulation. Right now, that falls along partisan lines. Whatever you think is up to you. That's basically what's going on. Maxfield: I will say, to take politics out of this, I studied banks pretty intensely for a number of years, and I will tell you that in history, the thing that we know is that you need a strong and independent central bank, you need it at all times, but particularly in times of crisis. So you do want to be really careful in terms of both the authorities you give to a central bank in that situation and, in this case, the authorities that you take away from it. But again, this is something that, it will get worked out, and the pendulum swings back and forth between regulators and industry. And right now, this is a bill that swings at way back on the other side. I would say, just like Dodd-Frank went too far swinging the pendulum into the favor of regulators, Hensarling's act seems to me to go too far in the other direction. Which makes sense, given that Dodd-Frank was partisan on the Democratic side and the Financial CHOICE Act is partisan on the Republican side. Lapera: Yeah. Actually, you gave me a good segue earlier to kind of slide into this next big thing that the act is going to do, which is that it's going to significantly cut down on the authority of regulatory agencies. I think one of the most important things to note is that they're going to subject financial Regulatory agencies to the REINS Act. The REINS Act basically says that any agency that wants to impose a rule that costs more than $100 million a year needs to run it by Congress first, and if Congress fails to approve a rule within 70 days after it's been proposed, then the rule would go away -- it would be null and void. Which is hard, because if you have partisan control of committees, rules that would go against whatever the nature of that committee is at the moment can just sit for 70 days and never even get heard, and then it just doesn't happen, and that means that regulation is going to happen much more slowly. Maxfield: Right. The way it works now is that the Federal Reserve, the FCC, the CFPB, all these different regulatory agencies -- and this isn't just in the financial services arena, this is across all regulatory agencies and all industries, that in order to regulate their industries, they are given the authority to pass rules that, like, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to pass rules about appropriate products that can be marketed to customers. And those rules, there is a long process where they get insight from the industry and other interested parties. But then those regulatory agencies have the power to put those rules into place and require the industry to follow them. What the Financial CHOICE Act would do is add another layer in that step, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but here's the problem. That additional layer is Congressional approval of these rules. And you can imagine that that really adds a lot of complications to that whole process. It's not like you're just adding just one more hurdle. You're adding an extremely high hurdle that, depending on who is in control of Congress and the Senate at any particular point in time, these regulatory agencies may not be able to jump over. Again, I think that's probably the whole point of subjecting them to the REINS Act, which passed earlier this year. Lapera: Right, it's to reduce the amount of federal legislation that exists, that's really what the point of it is. But it's hard because, yes, maybe regulatory agencies shouldn't be making up rules without Congressional approval, but on the other hand, Congress takes a really long time to do things sometimes. Sometimes, agencies come up with stuff to protect people or help people, and then it gets codified into law, but until then, they're just responding quickly to the needs as they see them. So it's this really hard to push-and-pull thing that you have with government. Let's talk a little bit also about the Fed, which you mentioned is going to be affected by this act. It's hard, because the Fed has also been subjected to the REINS Act, as well. Maxfield: Right. There's one other piece to this. It's not only the REINS Act that they're subjecting the regulators to. They also subject the regulators to the appropriations process. That's a really important thing. Right now, let's take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is actually an agency within the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve is an independent agency. So you have multiple layers of independence. But one of the principal pieces of independence is that, in the case of the Federal Reserve, it is a profit-making entity -- it has a huge balance sheet full of assets that earn interest in time. So it doesn't have to go to Congress to get money to operate, which gives it independence from Congress. The same thing is true with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- don't quote me exactly on this -- since it was put into operation, and in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it has issued a total of something like $11 [billion] to $12 billion worth of fines to the industry, and it can use those fines to do, among other things, fund its own operations. So it, too, is kind of detached or insulated from that political process that is a part of the appropriations process. And what the Financial CHOICE Act does is, it would take away that independence and require these institutions to go to Congress for the funding, which would have a significant impact on them. Lapera: Yeah. And that's one of the big criticisms of the CFBP, that its critics levied at it, is that the CFPB might start just issuing fines just because it has a financial incentive to, as opposed to doing it because the fines really need to be issued. So that's kind of where that Financial CHOICE Act section, that's what it's trying to get at. Maxfield: Right. Then, to your point about going straight at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve is one of those institutions that, people either don't know anything about it, or they love it or hate it, or they don't know anything about it, and they love or hate it. And one of the things that people tend to think about when they think about the Federal Reserve is that it's some sort of conspiratorial entity that controls the money supply and does so for the economic elites, and things like that. And one of the reasons that these conspiracy theories are able to grow take on the forms that they're able to take is because it's a relatively non-transparent organization, particularly when it comes to managing the money supply. Another main principle of the Financial CHOICE Act is to increase the transparency of the Federal Reserve, both in terms of its overall operations and in terms of the way it manages the money supply. And what I mean by managing the money supply is, when it decides to raise or lower interest rates, because that's the lever that causes the money supply to expand or contract. Lapera: Yeah, and it's not just that. For example, the stress tests, no one is 100% sure what's in them. Maxfield: Exactly. So the stress tests right now, these happen once a year for large banks. The purpose of them is to see how they would perform in a hypothetical economic scenario that is analogous to the financial crisis. This is actually a very good piece of the regulatory pie in the banking industry, because it keeps bankers' eyes on making sure that the assets they put on the balance sheets aren't going to submit them to massive losses if, and when, the economy turns down, like it inevitably will. But the issue with the stress tests is that, when the banks submit all the information to the Federal Reserve for the stress test, when the banks are going through their planning process, in terms of structuring their balance sheets and their operations in a way that will help them make it through the stress test, is that the Federal Reserve doesn't actually give them the exact model that the Federal Reserve is using in the course of the stress test. So the banks are flying blind in this regard. If you talk to bankers, most all of them will say that they think the stress tests are a good thing. I'm talking about the bankers, the CEOs of the very large banks in this country, those are the ones under the most stringent stress-test requirements. They will almost universally say that they think the stress tests are a good thing, but they will also almost universally complain about the fact that the Federal Reserve doesn't share the models it uses in the course of the stress test, so banks are just flying blind. Lapera: Yeah. That actually is kind of paired with another aspect of the CHOICE Act, which is that they are proposing that if banks hold a certain amount of money on their balance sheet, essentially as an emergency fund, that they won't be subject to quite as much regulation as they are now. Maxfield: Right. One of the main narratives that emerged from the financial crisis was that the reason the crisis was able to metastasize the way it did was because banks were overleveraged, they were undercapitalized. Which means, a typical bank will hold $1 worth of equity for $10 of assets. At the time, you had, like, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and companies like that -- Lehman Brothers, at certain points, was leveraged by something like 30:1. What that means was, if its assets fell by just 3%, if the value of its assets fell by just 3%, it would render it completely insolvent. In the wake of the financial crisis, all of these additional capital rules came in to require banks to not only hold more capital, but dictated the type of capital that they were supposed to hold. What the Financial CHOICE Act does is say, ""Look, let's do away with all these complicated capital rules,"" and these capital rules are incredibly complicated, ""and let's replace them with a simple leverage ratio where banks, all you do is compare how much equity or capital a bank has to its assets, and just use that simple ratio."" And if banks meet the threshold laid out in the Financial CHOICE Act, then they can be exempt from all of these additional regulations that Dodd-Frank is imposing, particularly on large banks. So the thought process is, look, if you just make them hold more capital, they're safer, so they don't have to do all these other things. Lapera: So the thing that the Financial CHOICE Act offers for banks that do this, in particular, that's probably very valuable for them is that, right now, really large banks have to go to the Fed before doing stuff like issuing a dividend or changing their business plan. And in theory, if they meet this leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they won't have to ask for permission to do any of that stuff anymore. Of course, it's really interesting, because when you say a simple ratio with assets, just like with people, there are assets that are really easy to move and there are assets that are really hard to move. So I don't know, I personally need a little bit more clarity around what that ratio actually looks like. It's a lot harder to sell a house and get that cash than it is to have cash to pay, and that analogy also holds for banks. They have some assets that are really hard to offload and some that are really easy to offload, so how did they end up calculating that ratio? The reason I don't know the answer to this yet is that I have not actually read all 600 pages of this act yet. I'm working on it, I'll do it eventually. So one of the reasons I haven't read all of it yet is because, it's passed the House and it's about to go to the Senate, and the Senate, in my opinion, is not going to let this pass as originally written. There's probably going to be quite a few amendments, and the language is probably going to change quite a lot, if it passes at all. Maxfield: And here's another really important point. They're saying that, if a bank holds enough capital to satisfy this simplified leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they're calling that an off-ramp -- the off-ramp being, you get off the highway with all these other regulations. Well, one of the really interesting regulations that it's looking like the Financial CHOICE Act is trying to attack and would allow these big banks, in particular, to avoid -- and let me read this from the executive summary of the Financial CHOICE Act. It says it will ""exempt banking organizations that have made a qualifying capital election from any federal law, rule, or regulation that provide limitations on mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions of assets or control ... "" So what does that mean? Through the 1970s-1980s, the banking industry deregulated. It allowed banks to open up house, operate branches, and allowed banks to operate across interstate lines, which is something that, in the past, they generally weren't allowed to do. Well, the quid pro quo in that case was that they were going to allow these banks to grow and do all these things and have more flexibility in terms of their operations, but on the other side of that, they wanted to stop these things from getting so enormous that if one of them were to fail, it would basically wipe out all the wealth of the United States. So they did that by saying, ""If you hold 10% or more of the nation's deposits, you are not allowed to then acquire another depository institution."" And right now, there are three banks that fit that -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. So right now, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, they cannot go out and buy any other banks, they're not allowed to because each one of them holds more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, if I'm reading it correctly, it's saying that, as long as those banks hold enough capital to meet that threshold in the act, they would then be free to merge together or buy other banks. So you could theoretically, in this case, see a merger between JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two biggest banks in the country. And I really doubt that that would happen because their branch bases completely overlap each other, so there would be too much redundancy in doing that. But people should think about, is that something we want to do? Do we want each individual bank to hold, say, 25% or 50% of the nation's deposits? Is that a direction we want to go in, given the fact that since the Civil War, more than 17,000 banks have failed? So it's a good thing to keep in mind. Lapera: Yeah, no, that's a really overwhelming thing to think about. We need to wrap up because we've been here for a while. It's partially because there's just so much stuff in this act to discuss. There's so many little things that could end up having really big impact. We'll continue to track the progress of the bill. Like I mentioned earlier, I really, really do not think this is going to get through the Senate completely unchanged. We'll talk about that more when we know more. Was there anything else you wanted to say, Maxfield? Maxfield: No, I think that's it. The only other thing is, it would dramatically impact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We could talk about that on a different show because that deserves its own conversation. But again, to leave off on the same point I made at the very beginning, the Financial CHOICE Act, like the Dodd-Frank Act, is neither good nor bad. It's just a reflection of the swing of the pendulum back and forth between regulators and industries. We've seen this many times in the past. And generally, when the pendulum swings, regardless of the direction in which it swings, it goes too far. Dodd-Frank went too far. The Financial CHOICE Act went too far. So to your point, Gaby, when this goes through the Senate, it's likely that they're going to tailor it back. Lapera: Yeah. That seems very likely, especially given everything that we've seen during this Administration so far. Who knows what'll happen? Things in D.C. either move at breakneck pace, or very, very slowly. We'll keep you guys up to date, don't worry.

Maxfield: He's asleep, yeah. Morgan: Just another Monday.

    What's the Deal with the Financial CHOICE Act? -- The Motley Fool

Big bank stocks have surged over the past eight months, yet they still look relatively cheap when compared with regional bank stocks. Is this a sign you should buy the former and sell the latter? Not necessarily. The easiest way to see the difference in valuation between banks based on size is to compare the median valuation on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks the two dozen biggest banks in the country, with the KBW Regional Banking Index, which tracks 50 banks with between $5 billion and $40 billion worth of assets on their balance sheets. Index Median Forward Price-to-Earnings Multiple Median Price to Book Value Median Price to Tangible Book Value KBW Bank Index 14.88 1.36 1.92 KBW Regional Banking Index 17.41 1.66 2.18 Data source: YCharts.com. It doesn't matter which of the three primary valuation metrics you use: Regional banks such as Glacier Bancorp (NASDAQ:GBCI) and Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK) generally trade at a higher multiple compared with big banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Based on earnings, which is the metric that should take the lead in an analysis today, the median regional bank on the KBW Regional Banking Index trades for 17.41 times earnings per share over the next 12 months. The figure on the KBW Bank Index is 14.88. The story is the same when you look at valuation as a function of book value. The median regional bank stock trades for 2.18 times tangible book value, while the median big bank trades for a multiple of 1.92. Investors need to appreciate that these figures alone don't mean big banks are better buys than regional banks. A better interpretation of the difference is that regional banks have more opportunities to grow. Regional and community banks are growing like weeds. Image source: Getty Images. There are two ways to grow in the bank industry. The first is through organic growth -- attracting new customers through marketing efforts and gaining more of each customer's overall financial business, be it a mortgage, credit card, car loan, whatever. The second avenue is through mergers and acquisitions. Holding all else equal, a bank that can use both avenues can grow faster than a bank that can use only one. Herein lies the difference in valuation between the nation's biggest banks, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and regional banks, such as Glacier Bancorp and Bank of the Ozarks. As I've discussed in the past, the nation's three biggest banks, which are weighted heavily on KBW's large-cap bank index, are all shut out of the acquisition game, at least insofar as other depository institutions are concerned. That's because Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo each already hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. As such, these three banks are legally prohibited from acquiring other banks. Regional banks aren't similarly proscribed. Because none of the banks on the KBW Regional Banking Index come even close to the 10% deposit threshold, they can still merge with or acquire other banks, thereby supercharging growth. That's exactly what they've been doing. To cite just two examples, Glacier Bancorp has acquired nine banks since the beginning of 2009, and that's on top of 15 other deals it has completed since 1990. The same is true at Bank of the Ozarks, which has purchased a total of 16 other banks since the financial crisis. OZRK Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. The net result is that these two banks have seen their balance sheets expand rapidly over the past decade. Bank of the Ozarks went from $2.5 billion in assets 10 years ago to more than $19 billion today. And while Glacier Bancorp's recent ascent hasn't been as steep, the Montana-based bank has nevertheless more than doubled in size over the same stretch. Thus, the reason big bank stocks seem cheap is that their ability to grow is tightly constrained compared with their smaller, simpler counterparts in the regional banking space. ","

Exchange traded funds have made it easy for investors to drill down on specific types of investments, and Sector SPDR ETFs have become one of the most popular ways to invest in specific sectors of the stock market. Sector SPDRs track 10 different sectors in the S&P 500, with each Sector SPDR ETF delivering performance equal to that of the component stocks within the target industry. The investments have relatively low costs and offer diversification while letting you tailor your portfolio in line with your beliefs about the future of particular parts of the market. Sector SPDR 10-Year Average Annual Return Consumer Staples (NYSEMKT:XLP) 10.26% Consumer Discretionary (NYSEMKT:XLY) 10.25% Technology (NYSEMKT:XLK) 9.97% Health Care (NYSEMKT:XLV) 9.51% Industrials (NYSEMKT:XLI) 7.88% Utilities (NYSEMKT:XLU) 6.47% Materials (NYSEMKT:XLB) 5.06% Energy (NYSEMKT:XLE) 1.53% Financials (NYSEMKT:XLF) (0.72%) Real Estate (NYSEMKT:XLRE) N/A Data source: SPDR. N/A = not applicable; the Real Estate Sector SPDR began trading in October 2015. The Sector SPDR ETFs break up the S&P 500 into 10 separate indexes. Like any ETF, the Sector SPDRs trade throughout the trading day on the NYSE Arca exchange. As index funds, the investment objective for the ETFs is to match the share-price performance and dividend income of the underlying sectors that they track. Sector SPDRs have anywhere from 25 to 85 individual stock holdings in their portfolios, depending on the number of S&P 500 members in each respective industry. Consumer discretionary currently has the most stocks, while the materials sector comes in last. Image source: Getty Images. Just looking at the range of returns on the Sector SPDRs reveals the utility of having these ETFs available. Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has had a total return of about 7%, and the chart above shows that half of the sectors have outperformed that figure while the other half have underperformed. Finally, even if you want to own the whole market, Sector SPDRs give you the opportunity to get some tax benefits. In a rising market, simply owning the S&P 500 ETF as a single holding doesn't give you chances to reap any tax-loss benefits. However, even when the overall market rises, you'll generally find that some sectors lose ground. By using tax-loss harvesting strategies, you can collect tax losses on those underperforming sectors while deferring tax on rising sector ETFs until you sell them well into the future. There are a couple ways in which Sector SPDRs aren't the perfect investment. First, even with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.14%, they're still more expensive than broader-based market ETFs. For instance, you can find ETFs tracking the entire S&P 500 for as little as 0.04%. The other major problem is that like most ETFs, you have to pay brokerage commissions to trade Sector SPDRs. Even those brokers who offer commission-free ETF trading typically don't include the Sector SPDRs, with some instead offering their own proprietary sector-based ETFs. With low commissions available from many brokers, the costs of owning Sector SPDRs doesn't have to be prohibitive, but it is somewhat of a drag on performance. Nevertheless, for investors looking to make plays on specific parts of the market, Sector SPDRs are a good option to consider. With a long history behind them, Sector SPDRs will remain popular ETFs far into the future. ","

Global oil producers have said that crude production “should crater with prices around $40-$50 per barrel, [but] they are having a hard time restraining themselves from producing,” he said.

A chart from Wells Fargo shows that U.S. crude-oil and liquid-fuels production stands around 15.5 million barrels a day. It was at just over 14 million barrels a day in mid-2014: Prices of $80 a barrel are likely unattainable as well, “until the world’s oil producers stop overproducing,” said LaForge. Read: Why global oil production looks set to grow in 2018, despite OPEC-led output cuts “We continue to hear that big cutbacks are on the cusp of happening,” he said. “The evidence, however, implies otherwise. And the longer oil prices remain low and range-bound, the harder it will be for prices to bounced above $60—as production costs have dropped significantly since 2014, which keeps more producers in the game.” And each time prices do bounce toward $60, the “temptation to overproduce,” may be “overwhelming for those countries that rely heavily on oil revenues to sustain their economies and social programs,” LaForge said. Given all of that, “we are not expecting the price of WTI crude oil to climb anywhere near $100 per barrel over the next few years,” he said. Instead, Wells Fargo expects it to remain low and range-bound, bouncing between $30 and $60 per barrel. Still, “there is the possibility that the WTI crude-oil price finds its way into the high $30s to low $40s” at year’s end and if that happens, “we could become bullish in the short term,” LaForge said.

That puts the stock

                                   on track for the biggest price and percentage gain since Dec. 18, 2014. The previous record close was Wednesday’s close of $46.33, while the previous all-time intraday high of $46.99 was reached on March 16. Don’t miss: Oracle leaps to record as cloud transition hits turning point. Oracle’s results prompted no less than 22 of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet to raise their stock-price targets. The new average target of $53.64 is 6.6% above current levels, and 11%, above the average target of $48.32 the day before the results were released. Analyst Steve Koenig at Wedbush Securities raised his price target to $56, which is 11.3% above current levels, from $44, which was 5% below Wednesday’s close of $46.33. That prompted Koenig to upgrade the stock to an outperform rating, after being at neutral since at least September 2014. Koenig said his new bullish outlook was based on improved software-as-a-service visibility, as Oracle’s applications business “gets over the ‘hump’ of its transition to cloud,” as well as to robust bookings activity and solid database licensing activity. He wrote in a note to clients that he sees potential for “sustained follow-through on positive price action as long-only investors adjust their [Oracle] weightings.” BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman boosted his stock price target to $57 from $48, citing one of Oracle’s “strongest quarters in years,” while J.P. Morgan’s Mark Murphy lifted his target to $55 from $51, saying he believes “this quarter will mark a turning point in investor sentiment.” Benchmark’s Yun Kim lifted the target to $62 from $55, saying the results indicate Oracle has reached the “critical scale” in its cloud business, making the stock “one of the best ways to play the current cloud computing trend.” Kim’s new target ties him with Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White for the second-highest on the Street, according to FactSet, just behind Wells Fargo’s Philip Winslow’s target of $62.50. Oracle shares have soared 31% year to date, while the SPDR Technology Select Sector exchange-traded fund

Department stores are already suffering from a number of headwinds, including declines in mall traffic and the need for massive store closures. “Prime Wardrobe capitalizes on all of these aspects, providing Prime members access to a broad assortment of real brands (presumably broader than any single department store given the current and likely future breadth of Amazon’s assortment) in one place, at an already familiar point of sale, with minimal friction (free delivery/returns),” Wells Fargo wrote in a note. “Simply put, this adds another nail into the department store coffin.” On Tuesday, the e-commerce giant announced that Amazon Wardrobe is in beta. The new service for Prime members gives customers the chance to try on apparel and footwear for seven days before purchasing. The more customers buy, the bigger the discount. Among the brands that are already involved are Calvin Klein, Levi’s, Adidas AG

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday as an influential U.S. Federal Reserve official expressed confidence that rising wages would help revive domestic inflation, which has shown signs of softening recently. The yen fell to two-week lows against the greenback and the euro after officials of the Bank of Japan at a meeting on Friday downplayed the likelihood that the bank would begin to roll back emergency stimulus to support the economy. Remarks by New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday that tightening in the labor market should help drive up inflation helped offset concerns by some investors that stubbornly low inflation would not allow policy-makers to raise rates further the rest of this year. “The Fed doesn’t seem to be too concerned about the recent pullback in the inflation data. They are committed to policy normalization,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Last week, the Fed, as expected, raised key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point and left the door open for another rate increase later this year. It also provided details on its plan to reduce its bond purchases in a bid to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent,” Dudley told a local business group in Plattsburg, New York. Traders raised their outlook on a rate hike by the Fed’s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting to 47 percent from 41 percent late on Friday FFZ7 FFF8, CME Group’s FedWatch tool showed. The dollar index .DXY, which gauges the dollar against six other currencies, was up 0.4 percent at 97.537. The euro was down 0.4 percent versus the greenback, to $1.1147 EUR=, while against the yen the dollar increased 0.5 percent, at 111.43 yen JPY=. The euro was up 0.1 percent against the yen, at 124.25 yen EURJPY=. Positioning data showed net bullish bets on the euro reached their highest level in more than six years last week. There was no discernible boost for the single currency from the landslide victory of French President Emmanuel Macron’s government in parliamentary elections on Sunday. Sterling declined 0.4 percent to $1.2732 GBP=D3 as Britain began formal negotiations on its planned exit from the European Union. The UK ruling Conservative Party’s loss of its parliament majority earlier this month raised speculation of a drift toward a “soft Brexit,” which had supported the pound. Many analysts, however, expect developments from the talks would hurt sterling. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s apparent “indifference” toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency’s power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the “cramming” of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a “conspicuous silence” on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short, “gossamer” memo “modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.” Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury’s hands for six months. The CFPB’s role as a public watchdog “extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,” Pauley wrote. “Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,” he added. “It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.” The CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office, which handled legal filings in the case, was reviewing the decision. In court papers, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley’s decision. Pauley has criticized government agencies before, including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research. The case is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v Sprint Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09931. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"June 15 (Reuters) - Metlife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, announced added responsibilities for some of its senior executives, adding to the pool of potential successors to its chief executive. The largest U.S. life insurer named Michel Khalaf president of its U.S. business, effective July 1, to replace Maria Morris who retires from the company this fall. Marty Lippert, the company’s head of global technology and operations will take on added responsibility of MetLife Holdings, the company said. The appointments of Khalaf and Lippert set up a “horse race” for MetLife’s CEO position, held by Steven Kandarian, 65, who currently has no plans to retire from his role, an analyst with Wells Fargo said in a note. Other potential candidates for the top job include Chief Financial Officer John Hele, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart, and Asia head Christopher Townsend, the note said. In June last year, Metlife’s board agreed to waive off its 65-year retirement policy for Kandarian, who has been the company’s president and CEO since May 2011. Ramy Tadros will also join MetLife in September as the new chief risk officer, the company said. Tadros comes from Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, where he served as the global head of insurance. He will replace Stan Talbi, who will retire at the end of August after 43 years with MetLife. (Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp said on Thursday it received U.S. approval for its emergency epinephrine syringes to treat severe allergic reactions that it intends to be a lower cost rival to Mylan NV’s widely used EpiPen, sending its shares up more than 50 percent. The company said it was looking for a marketing partner and would set a price for the product before its launch sometime in the second half of this year. Adamis said its pre-filled epinephrine syringes would be sold under the brand name Symjepi. Mylan has faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations after it doubled the cost for a pair of EpiPens to around $600, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing debate over the high cost of prescription medicines in the United States. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor. “We plan to position the product as a lower cost alternative,” Mark Flather, senior director for investor relations and corporate communications for Adamis, told Reuters. “We want to be part of the solution.” Epinephrine is the life-saving recommended treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications. Mylan has for years owned more than 90 percent of the market for emergency epinephrine injectors and its own authorized generic has recently surpassed sales of the branded version. “With an anticipated lower cost and attractive design, we believe Symjepi will be a meaningful competitor to EpiPen,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a research note. Other rival products are available. Impax Laboratories Inc’s Adrenaclick device is being sold through CVS Health Corp’s drugstore chain for about $110 a pair. Privately held Kaleo earlier this year began selling its Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector that it reacquired from Sanofi SA under an unusual pricing strategy but with little  success so far. The company said it would make the product available at no cost to many consumers but charge insurers $4,500. Sanofi in April sued Mylan, accusing it of engaging in illegal practices to squash EpiPen competition when the French drugmaker held the Auvi-Q rights. Adamis shares soared 53.3 percent to close at $5.75 on the Nasdaq and further rose to $6.00 in extended trading. Mylan shares closed down 2.4 percent at $36.98. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - London-based startup Blockchain has raised $40 million (31.5 million pounds) in a fresh round of funding as the software company rides a wave of enthusiasm for digital currency technology. Nokota Management and Digital Currency Group also participated in the financing round, which boosted Blockchain’s total funding to more than $70 million Tom Hulme, general partner at Alphabet’s venture firm GV, said the firm invested because “the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched.” Founded in 2011, Blockchain makes software that allows consumers and businesses to make transactions using digital currencies such as bitcoin. The firm is named after the internet platform that records and validates transactions between two parties without relying on an intermediary such as a bank. Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product. “Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,” Smith said. “My grandmother uses our product today.” The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology. While far from mainstream, digital currency has enjoyed growing popularity that Smith attributes to the instability of traditional currencies in places such as Brazil, and political uncertainty in Britain and the United States. The day after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Smith said, Blockchain had the second-highest number of new users sign up in a single day. “In you’re in an environment of rapidly deteriorating geopolitical stability,” Smith said, “you are open to new ideas and new products.” (1 British pound = $1.2686) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage of an annual stress test, showing they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession to meet regulatory requirements, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed’s most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year’s level. “This year’s results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,” said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank. “This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.” The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations. Wall Street analysts and trade groups quickly cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis. “We see today’s...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,” said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent. “From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,” he said. Thursday’s results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed’s methodology, using materials they submitted. The second portion of the test, to be released on Wednesday, will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks’ capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed’s. Under the Fed’s worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. However, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks’ aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more of its stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed’s approval. Under the Fed’s examination, Citi’s minimum CET1 ratio in the most stressful scenario was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Citi’s own analysis showed that metric at 10 percent. The Fed’s assessment showed the other five largest banks - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley - having minimum CET1 ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent. Of those, Goldman Sachs had the biggest optimism gap compared with the Fed when it came to the worst-case scenario. Its model produced a 9.8 percent minimum CET1 ratio, 1.4 points better than the Fed’s. Wells Fargo’s metric also fared better in its own test than under the Fed’s, by 0.8 of a point. Conversely, JPMorgan’s analysis appeared to be more dour, with its CET1 ratio coming in 1.3 percentage points below the Fed’s. Bank of America’s was 0.7 of a point worse. Banks that decide to resubmit their plans can only make downward revisions to the amount of capital they plan to use, meaning management teams that were too conservative may regret their submissions even if they pass. “If there is disappointment next week,” said Seiberg, “it is likely because the banks failed to ask for big enough distributions more than it is because the Federal Reserve was too tough.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - It took less than 24 hours for Warren Buffett, one of the world’s savviest dealmakers, to make a C$360 million (US$272 million) paper profit by propping up a major Canadian lender on life support. “It’s a typical Buffett bailout trade,” said Jared Dillian, an independent investment strategist and former trader betting the value of the Canadian dollar and several Canadian banks will fall. “He’s set it up where he’s risking a small amount to make a lot.” Its share price soared 27.2 percent on Thursday to C$19.00, leaving Buffett with a potential 90 percent paper profit on shares he is buying for just C$10 each. Home Capital’s share price nonetheless remains nearly two-thirds below its 2014 peak. “The deal is really low risk,” said John Huber, a portfolio manager at Saber Capital Management LLC in Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns Berkshire stock. “It’s an opportunistic deal that gives him very attractive risk-return terms.” Berkshire’s infusion was much needed by Home Capital, which has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run after being accused of, and then admitting to, concealing mortgage fraud. “The assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving,” said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst. “It implies a seal of approval.” Berkshire’s investment lets Buffett deploy some of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills. “Today’s announcement is a modest positive,” wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst. “But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.” Berkshire’s Columbia Insurance unit is acquiring the Home Capital equity, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, the credit line, if fully tapped, could generate C$180 million for Berkshire. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. His $5 billion Bank of America bet looks particularly savvy: it throws off $300 million in annual dividends, and Berkshire is sitting on an $11 billion gain on accompanying warrants. But with most of those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to requests for further comment. Home Capital’s problems accelerated in mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. “Reputational risk is why he’s getting 9 percent interest” at Home Capital, Seifert said. Berkshire has other investments tied to real estate, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. It also has several investments in Canada, including the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, for which it paid about $C3.1 billion in 2014. Many of Berkshire’s more than 90 business units also offer goods and services in the country, including the Ben Bridge jeweler, Benjamin Moore paints and the BNSF railroad. Despite his paper profit on Home Capital, Buffett believes investment gains and losses in a given period are usually meaningless. Buffett’s foray into Canadian real estate comes amid uncertainty about that country’s housing sector. The Ontario government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is “not going to stop the credit cycle up there,” said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital. “But it’s a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Youth tobacco use in the United States fell to historic lows in 2016, leading public health experts to speculate that a smoke-free generation may be within reach. The number of middle and high school students who used any tobacco product fell to 3.9 million in 2016 from 4.7 million in 2015, figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show, the first such decline since the CDC began reporting the measure in 2011. The number of high school students who smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior to being surveyed fell to 8 percent from 9.3 percent in 2015, the data shows. In 2011 the number was 15.8 percent. “This represents a historic public health victory,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, adding that the dramatic decline was the result of public messaging campaigns directed at youth. The decline in e-cigarette use was even greater, falling to 11.3 percent of high schoolers in 2016 from 16 percent in 2015. “These numbers are astounding,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the department of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health. “It really means that we may be within reach of a smoke-free generation.” The decline in cigarette use follows a broad array of public health campaigns and coincides with the rise of vaping. “This should put to bed any remaining concerns that e-cigarettes are a gateway to cigarettes or will lead to a re-normalization of smoking,” Siegel said. Between 2011 and 2016 overall tobacco use remained unchanged, the CDC’s figures show, though the balance between products changed. As e-cigarette use increased, traditional cigarette use declined. Cigarette use among high school students fell during that period to 8 percent from 15.8 percent while use of cigars fell to 7.7 percent from 11.6 percent. At the same time use of e-cigarettes rose to 11.3 percent from 1.5 percent and use of hookahs rose to 4.8 percent from 4.1 percent. President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes a nearly 20 percent drop in the CDC’s disease prevention and health promotion programs, including eliminating dedicated funding for its Office on Smoking and Health. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement that while the latest figures were encouraging “it is critical that we work to ensure this downward trend continues over the long term across all tobacco products.” He said the agency had issued more than 4,000 warning letters to retailers for selling e-cigarettes, cigars or hookah tobacco to minors since youth access restrictions went into effect last August. Gottlieb, who previously held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, has said publicly that certain e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. The latest data showed no decline in cigarette use among middle school students, where the rate was 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2015. Among middle school students, 4.3 percent used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 5.3 percent in 2015. Analysts with Wells Fargo Securities expect sales of vaping products to reach $4.4 billion in 2017.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters Health) - Tobacco companies have been selling electronic cigarettes as a way to wean smokers off paper cigarettes, but a new study suggests the strategy could backfire. The report in Preventive Medicine found that young adults who occasionally smoked conventional cigarettes smoked more of them if they also used e-cigarettes – battery-powered gadgets that heat liquid nicotine into vapor. “The participants who were vaping ended up using more cigarettes. It’s actually a risk factor for increasing their cigarette use,” lead author Neal Doran said in a phone interview. “They’re not using e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking,” said Doran, a psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Though smokers have been turning to e-cigarettes since they came on the market in 2007 as a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco, little is known about the long-term effects of the practice known as “vaping.” E-cigarette use grew 900 percent among high school students from 2011 through 2015, according to a report from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The 2016 report declares e-cigarettes “unsafe” for youth and young adults (bit.ly/2sKHv9P). The new study’s findings are “consistent with the worry that, regardless of whether vaping is itself unsafe, vaping causes worse outcomes because it leads to more consumption of cigarettes,” Doran said. Stanton Glantz, who directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the study “has tremendous policy implications.” “What this study shows very convincingly is that if they’re using e-cigarettes it’s actually leading them to smoke more conventional cigarettes, not less,” he said. Glantz was not involved with the new study, but the findings are consistent with those of previous research he conducted on adolescents. “The e-cigarettes are having the effect of stimulating conventional cigarette smoking,” he said in a phone interview. “They’re propping up and reinforcing the conventional cigarette market.” Doran and his team studied 319 Californians, ages 18 to 24. At the start, participants did not smoke daily but had smoked at least one cigarette in the prior six months. During the study, they reported their frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use five times at three-month intervals. Those who vaped more also reported smoking 18 percent more cigarettes, the study found. “In the larger scheme of things, e-cigarettes could be good, bad or neutral,” Doran said. “I don’t think we know the answers yet. This is one of the ways in which they could be bad – by people increasing their cigarette use if they’re using both.” Dual users may be exposed to more nicotine and wind up at risk for chronic tobacco use and dependence, the authors write. Previous studies have shown that e-cigarette use increases the risk of smoking tobacco-filled cigarettes. Some prior studies suggest that e-cigarette vapor may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke. But electronic alternatives nonetheless release potentially hazardous chemicals. Sales of vaping products are expected to reach $4.4 billion this year, according to Wells Fargo Securities analysts. With flavors like bubble gum and chocolate peanut butter cup, e-cigarettes or vape pens are often packaged to appeal to youth, who experts believe are more vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering banning flavored tobacco products. Residents opposed to the legislation recently argued that e-cigarettes help them smoke less. But, Glantz said, “This paper shows exactly the opposite is true.” Numbers released this month from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing declines in youth use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes have led some to claim that as proof of the benefits of vaping. But Doran and Glantz don’t see it that way. Instead, Glantz said he views the smoking decreases as evidence of efforts to educate youth about the potential harms of e-cigarettes as well as the results of efforts to regulate e-cigarettes with clean-indoor air laws and minimum-age requirements. States and local jurisdictions have imposed a patchwork of laws pertaining to the use of electronic cigarettes, and some states, including California, now tax vape products. “There’s this Wild West atmosphere with e-cigarettes, and there’s a lot of controversy and disagreement about whether they’re good or bad,” Doran said. “If they’re harmless, and they help people quit, then they’re great. If they make it harder to quit and also encourage people to smoke cigarettes who would not have smoked otherwise, then they’re terrible,” he said. “The truth probably lies in the middle, but where exactly is the key question.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tscS56 and bit.ly/2rBKmg8 Preventive Medicine, online June 3, 2017.

Alan Farley,06222017,Investopedia,06152017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Tobacco stocks have offered perfect investment vehicles for patient shareholders in the past decade, paying sizable dividends while posting a near endless series of new highs. Of course, taking exposure in this controversial industry isn't for everyone, especially if loved ones have paid the price for nicotine addiction. However, buying shares of a company isn't the same thing is supporting their business practices, and it's our job to seek out superior returns wherever we can find them. Strong Asian growth now drives industry profits, along with a resurgence in U.S. consumption triggered by modern vaporizer technology. In addition, the current administration has plans to strip away regulations across a broad swath of industries, making it unlikely that producers will get singled out for criticism in coming years. Given these tailwinds, tobacco stocks are likely to perform well into the next decade. (For more, check out: Back From the Dead: Why Tobacco Stocks Are Soaring.) Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) carries the highest sector capitalization for tobacco producers trading on the U.S. exchanges at $184 billion. It spun off from parent Altria Group, Inc. (MO) at $50 in March 2008 and entered an immediate downtrend that posted an all-time low at $32.04 in March 2009. The subsequent recovery wave reached the upper $90s in 2013, giving way to a multi-year correction that found support in the mid-$70s. The stock rallied above the prior high in 2016 and stalled out, building a base on new support and then spiraling lower in November. That marked the washout low, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reinstated the breakout in January 2017, followed by a powerful trend advance to an all-time high at $122.90 on June 6. Philip Morris stock has been pulling back in a bull flag pattern since that time, while daily stochastics have dropped into the oversold zone. (See also: Philip Morris, the Best Is Yet to Come: Wells Fargo.) Both monthly and weekly indicators have held buy cycles through this period, signaling a bullish divergence and potential pullback buying opportunity ahead of continued upside. Even so, a more advantageous trade entry might come if aggressive sellers break short-term support and knock the stock down to the top of the first quarter range and 50-day EMA at $115. Altria Group expanded into spirits and finance leasing services following the Philip Morris spin-off,​ but tobacco remains its biggest profit component. It fell just 7 points during the 2008 economic collapse, returning to the prior high in 2010, ahead of a 2011 breakout that reached $70.14 in July 2016. A pullback into the fourth quarter settled near $60, ahead of a January 2017 rally into March's all-time high at $76.54. (See also: Altria Optimistic on FDA's Filing of Heated Products.) Altria Group shares sold off into May, testing new support near $70 and turning higher into June, settling into a narrow platform that traded within 60 cents of resistance this week. On-balance volume (OBV) has already risen to a new high, highlighting strong institutional sponsorship that should support a fresh rally leg into the low $80s, where a two-year rising-highs trendline could trigger another reversal. Reynolds American Inc (RAI) rallied above the 2008 high in 2011 and entered a rising channel that accelerated into a steeper channel in 2014, highlighting impressive relative strength. The uptrend stalled near $50 at the end of 2015, giving way to a shallow correction that ended with a high-volume October gap to a new high in the mid-$50s. It took three months to clear the high posted in that session, yielding a long series of new highs into last week. (For more, see: Reynolds Announces Leadership Roles Post Acquisition by BAT.) The stock sold off with the broad market, dropping into the first test at the 50-day EMA since January, and it is still testing that level. Weekly stochastics fell into an unconfirmed sell cycle in reaction to the decline, raising odds for an intermediate correction lasting a minimum of eight to 12 weeks. Given this scenario, a pullback into deep support at $50 could offer a buying opportunity. Tobacco manufacturers and distributors are leading the broad market, resistant to broad headwinds facing other high-yielding instruments. This resilience could last into the new decade, given humankind's addictive interest in the controversial crop.

Michael J. Kramer,06222017,Investopedia,06152017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs What exactly is Visa Inc. (V)? Is it a financial firm or a credit services provider? What about a technology company? That sounds crazy, right? Or does it? Don't believe me; look at the makeup of the Financial Select Sectors SPDR ETF (XLF) and see the top 25 holdings: There's no Visa. Yeah, it is a company with a market cap of almost $220 billion, bigger than that of Citigroup (C), but it's not in the top 25 of the financials. So if it's not a financial, then what is it? Well, of course, Visa is a tech company! Just look at the Technology Select Sector XLK SPDR (XLK), and there it is: Visa with 3.38 percent weighting in the ETF. By the way, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is also there, with a 2.21 percent weighting. Incredible, right? How come Visa and Mastercard are technology companies while American Express is a financial company? There's a simple answer: The three companies are fundamentally different in a significant way. Visa is an electronic payment network, while American Express issues cards and takes on the debt of its cardholders. Fundamentally, banks and financials depend for the most part on interest rates because when banks lend money, they charge a rate of interest. When rates are low they make less money, and when rates rise they make more money. Currently, interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve all go to a bank's ability to make money. Visa is dependent on how many transactions are occurring on its network charging a fee for the use of the network. Financials also have default risks associated with them that a company like Visa does not. Because banks and financials hold the debts of their cardholders, there is a risk the cardholder will not pay those debts and default on them, resulting in a loss for the card issuer. Again, for a company such as Visa, those risks are not present. Visa's biggest risk would be declining usage of its network. V PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts  All of this matters because of the way investors value the company. Visa is priced as a growth stock with a 2018 forward P/E ratio of almost 28. We can see why. Analysts are looking for Visa's revenue to grow to $21.81 billion by 2019 from $17.88 billion in 2017, a growth rate of almost 22 percent. V Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Compare that to the growth of American Express, where revenue is expected to grow to $35.99 billion from $32.74 billion, a top-line growth rate of only 10 percent. AXP Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The difference is reflected in the performance of the stocks over the past decade or so. V data by YCharts Visa's stock performance resembles that much more of a technology company than a financial company.

Jeff Cox,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for the ouster of 12 board members at Wells Fargo due to the fake accounts scandal that has rocked the bank. In a letter sent Monday to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, the Massachusetts Democrat said the scandal has ""revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices."" Warren said the central bank has the authority under federal statute to remove the members who were on the board as the matter transpired. ""We have received the letter and plan to respond,"" a Fed spokesman told CNBC. In an agreement with multiple authorities last September, Wells agreed to pay a $185 million fine in conjunction with a scandal in which some 2 million client accounts were created without the customers' knowledge. More accounts may be involved, according to subsequent allegations. Even after paying the fine, Wells has continued to undergo reputational damage amid congressional inquiries and additional disclosures Warren, who has been a harsh critic, pointed out in the letter multiple instances where she believes the board at Wells failed customers. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices — problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Wells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo shares gained about 1.1 percent in early trading, about in line with the sector. Warren did not limit her criticism to Wells — she also said the Fed ""has done nothing to date"" to punish the bank ""despite its ample statutory authority."" ""I urge you to use the tools Congress has given you to remove the responsible board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country's largest banks,"" she wrote. The scandal arose as bank employees sought to meet aggressive sales demands. Employees would enroll customers in various programs without their consent in order to make quotas that have since been disbanded. Some 5,300 employees have been terminated as a result, and the bank also has a new CEO, Timothy J. Sloan, who took over for John Stumpf. For the Fed to act, it would need to establish that any individual board member's actions were unsafe or unsound to the bank. The Fed likely would need to initiate an enforcement action and prove its case. Yellen told Congress during testimony shortly after the scandal broke in September that the Fed is reviewing all operations for large banks and believes that in cases of wrongdoing, ""senior management (should) be held accountable.""

Antony Currie,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wells Fargo is driving its stagecoach further into the mud. The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers' mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right. The actions at issue might seem to help struggling borrowers: Wells Fargo lowered some customers' monthly mortgage payments, potentially making them manageable. But there are two huge potential problems. First, the bank did this while also extending the duration of the loans – in one case by some 30 years. That greatly increased the total interest borrowers were on the hook to pay over the life of their loans. Second, Wells Fargo made these changes, according to the lawsuits, without getting the consent of either the customers or the relevant bankruptcy courts. Wells Fargo denies this, saying it notified customers and does ""not finalize a loan modification without receiving signed documents"" from the required parties. The trouble is, Wells Fargo has mucked up mortgage lending and modification in the past. It was one of the five lenders that in 2012 agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government and 49 states to rectify poor loan servicing and foreclosure practices. Last year it forked over $1.2 billion to settle claims of reckless lending under a Federal Housing Administration program. Home loans should have been squeaky-clean after all that. Add to that its recent $185 million fine after retail bankers chasing aggressive account-opening targets created 2 million fake bank and credit-card accounts – events that cost former Chief Executive John Stumpf his job – and there's a sense of a bank still not ensuring it has fundamental checks and balances in place. Wells Fargo isn't alone. The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 exposed the many failings of the financial-services industry. For now, though, most of its big rivals appear to have put the worst of their transgressions behind them. Sloan's shop keeps swerving into new ones.

Nvidia declined more than 5 percent over the past week through midday Thursday, while AMD fell 12 percent in that time period.The Nvidia decline was in part sparked by a negative Citron Research report on Nvidia Friday.""Take your profits and move on to Google (Alphabet).

Left cited competition coming from Intel, Google and Xilinx in the data center markets and the likelihood of slowing growth in its gaming graphics card business as reasons for his skeptical view on Nvidia's market value.Wells Fargo is also concerned over rising competition in Nvidia's data center business. The firm reiterated its underperform rating on the company Wednesday.""We think that Nvidia has done very well in establishing itself as the dominant provider of standalone accelerator solutions for data center, but believe that this is already reflected in Nvidia's stock value,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Wong wrote in a note to clients. ""Over time we think additional providers of standalone accelerators might emerge, helping to drive growth in the standalone processor market but reducing Nvidia's market share in this market.""Even with the move lower, Nvidia shares have rallied 218 percent through midday Thursday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 17 percent return.

But that's exactly what happened on Wednesday, confounding many analysts who predicted higher long-term rates. The Fed made its widely expected move, raising its overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent, keying off data that showed the U.S. economy at full employment and growing steadily. The central bank's upgraded ""dot plot,"" which maps where central bank officials see rates headed in the future, suggests that another rate hike could be coming later this year. More from ETF.com:Tech ETFs retreat: Pullback aheadHere's what advisors are worried aboutMuni ETFs: No summer vacation But at least for now, the bond market doesn't care. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped by 8 basis points to 2.13 percent after briefly touching 2.1 percent earlier on Wednesday, its lowest level of 2017 (bond prices and yields move inversely). U.S. 10-Year Treasury Bond Yield In turn, many bond ETFs, such as the $46 billion iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), hit their highest levels of the year. AGG is now up 2.8 percent, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is up 4.6 percent; and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) is up 7.1 percent. Those numbers are particularly impressive considering this was supposed to be a bad year for bonds based on the consensus expectation at the start of 2017. YTD Returns For AGG, LQD, TLT According to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, the moves in bond prices on Wednesday may have less to do with the Fed rate hike than a pair of tepid economic data points released on the same day. Early in the day, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell by 0.1 percent in May, while its core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices) only grew by 0.1 percent, below the 0.2 percent increase that was anticipated. That translates into year-over-year growth of 1.9 percent for the headline CPI and 1.7 percent for the core CPI ― both below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target ― and the lowest reading for the core in two years. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in May sagged by 0.3 percent, much worse than the zero change that was expected and the largest decline in 16 months. ""The data that came out on Wednesday showing a slowdown in inflation and contraction in retail sales has made people question whether the Fed will hike as aggressively as previously thought,"" explained Jacobsen. ""The big move in 10-year yields came around the same time as the CPI and retail sales data came out. Weak consumer spending and slowing inflation means the terminal rate for the federal funds rate may be well below what the Fed's aiming for,"" he added. Perhaps the fall in the 10-year yield shouldn't have been surprising. There's been a familiar pattern in recent years where investors anticipate that rates will finally take off as the economy improves, only to see them come back down as data disappoints. In fact, despite all the hand-wringing about rising rates ever since the Fed embarked on the current tightening cycle in late 2015, it turns out that the 10-year yield is actually lower today than it was when the central bank made its first hike. Currently, the 10-year yield stands at 2.13 percent compared with 2.30 percent on Dec. 16, 2015. Even the five-year yield is lower, at 1.73 percent currently, compared with 1.75 percent on the day of the first hike. Wells Fargo's Jacobsen says that for anyone who's been waiting for higher interest rates to invest in bonds, now may be the time to throw in the towel. ""It could feel like a bus that never shows up if you're waiting for yields to spike higher. If you've been sitting in cash and waiting for yields to rise before getting back to your strategic allocation to fixed income, you may want to start dollar cost averaging toward your target,"" he explained. Equities have taken these lower rates in stride. The S&P 500 remains in record-high territory amid record-low volatility. Investors aren't interpreting lower rates as a bad thing, except for perhaps financials, which is now the second-worst-performing stock market sector behind energy. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up 5.3 percent this year, well behind the 9 percent gain for the broader S&P 500. ""Financials have been hurt by the flattening yield curve,"" Jacobsen noted. ""That doesn't look to be getting any better anytime soon. If the Fed talks up another rate hike before the inflation data actually turns, I'd worry about the Fed being too far ahead of the curve rather than too far behind it.""

Brian Price,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"With bullion recently hitting a three-week low of $1,257, one commodities trader is adamant that the charts are signaling sunshine on the horizon for gold bugs. Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services, is undeterred by what's been a volatile June for gold as he believes the commodity will enter into a long-term uptrend swing. ""I'm a longer-term bull in gold and if you look at the long-term chart the trend is still higher,"" Iuorio said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""What the Fed said yesterday is disconcerting to the market, and that's why the dollar rallied so hard."" The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for only the fourth time since the financial crisis, which was expected. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen took a decisively more hawkish tone despite the fact that inflation has fallen behind estimates. Iuorio feels deteriorating data will soon pull dollar prices down and, if gold stays above $1,235, then the longer trend is ultimately positive for the yellow metal. Historically, the dollar and gold are inversely correlated as a fall in dollar prices increases the value of other currencies. Such a move drives demand for commodities, like gold, as investors seek alternative assets to invest in. However, Iuorio warned that more hawkish rhetoric could indeed deter his thesis. ""I'm going to be wrong if they keep that talk up,"" the trader said. ""Gold's going to go lower. If it settles below $1,230, that's going to change me into a bear."" That said, Iuorio doesn't believe the Fed can continue with its hawkish tone and therefore feels confident in where gold prices are heading. Lastly, another factor for gold prices in the near term could be India. Bob Iaccino, of Path Trading Partners, noted on ""Futures Now"" that a tax on the precious metal is slated to go into effect at the end of the month in that country. This could cause local jewelers and private citizens to rush into the market and purchase gold in bulk before the tax comes into play, which would also help drive prices higher. Gold settled 1.5 percent lower on Thursday. The bond market's year in decline could round out with some relief, according to Bank of America's chartist.

Annie Pei,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Crude officially entered a bear market with Tuesday's drop, and one technical strategist is seeing another 30 percent drop in the commodity. On CNBC's ""Futures Now"" Tuesday, Paul Ciana of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that based on the charts, oil is well on its way to dropping to the $30 range, levels unseen since last April. ""It just keeps going down, breaking supports and failing at lower resistance levels,"" said Ciana. ""It's the absolute definition of a downtrend."" But on the same chart of oil, Ciana also pointed out that the crude crush could actually be signaling a rally in the bond market. A note released by BofAML on Tuesday, titled ""Bonds smile as oil cries,"" remarked on the inverse moves between crude and bonds that has been occurring over the past years. According to Ciana, the inverse relationship is playing out once again ""on an even larger scale,"" meaning that if crude continues to fall, bonds could soar even higher. ""Bond prices have risen to exceed the peak of [that double bottom this year, confirming] that the U.S. 10-year yield will likely fall to 1.97 percent this summer, if not sooner,"" he explained. Additionally, stocks could also be in trouble if crude falls. While Ciana doesn't see oil being a direct cause of a downturn in the market, depending on ""how much more the decline accelerates"" in crude, it could intensify any drop that may happen. And the outlook for crude on a fundamental basis isn't too positive, as Ciana also points out that demand for crude may fall during the summer.With Tuesday's drop, oil prices have now sunk 19 percent year to date, largely thanks to supply issues related to OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Ciana does see $45.50 being a key level to reach and hold for oil, meaning that the commodity would need to rally 4 percent for some of the concerns to subside.

Elizabeth Warren hates big banks. But none more so than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Her displeasure with the California-based bank is understandable given that Wells Fargo spent the last decade and a half opening fake accounts for customers in order to artificially inflate its performance and thereby maximize its executives' annual bonuses. The latest example of Warren's ire was on display Monday, when she sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen calling for the removal of 12 members of Wells Fargo's board of directors -- for the record, that'd leave only three. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote, according to CNBC, which first reported on the letter. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices -- problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Senator Elizabeth Warren. Image source: Senator Warren's official website. Wells Fargo's executives deserve the blame and vitriol that have been heaped on them since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed the scam last year. While they make millions of dollars a year, the customers they preyed on were among the most vulnerable citizens in the country -- retirees living on fixed incomes and recent immigrants. To make matters worse, the company then retaliated against employees who sought to blow the whistle on the scam. Under the watch of Wells Fargo's executives and the board's oversight, the 160-year-old bank's once-sterling reputation has been deeply sullied. Given this, it's hard to disagree with Warren's assessment of Wells Fargo. The board was ultimately responsible for policing these types of risks and behaviors. The fact that they didn't, and that the scam was in many ways an indispensable element of Wells Fargo's business model, is prima facie evidence that they bear culpability for it. At the same time, one might find it worth acknowledging that Wells Fargo's directors were deceived in a sense, too. Prior to the fallout, the board's principal liaison with the bank's operating committee was John Stumpf, who at the time, though no longer, was both its chairman and CEO. As the company wrote in its 2015 proxy statement: Mr. Stumpf, with over 33 years of experience at Wells Fargo, has the knowledge, expertise, and experience to understand and clearly articulate to the Board the opportunities and risks facing the Company, as well as the leadership and management skills to promote and execute the Company's vision, values and strategy. The Board believes that Mr. Stumpf, rather than an outside director, is in the best position, as Chairman and CEO, to lead Board discussions regarding the Company's business and strategy and to help the Board respond quickly and effectively to the many business, market, and regulatory reform issues affecting the Company and the rapidly changing financial services industry. This description is laughable in hindsight, but Stumpf and his predecessor Dick Kovacevich had purposefully cultivated such a pristine image by then that few people would have questioned them. Image source: The Motley Fool. There's also value to keeping some of these directors around. They made an enormous and egregious mistake, but one can hope that they learned a lesson in their failure to perform their oversight duties. And that lesson, if it indeed has been learned, could very well make Wells Fargo a stronger organization. That may or may not be a fair assessment, but assuming that it is, there's value to their continued presence on the board. It's like the story of Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, who learned of an employee's mistake that cost the company $1 million. Watson not only refused to fire the employee, but he even rejected the employee's letter of resignation. ""Fire you?"" Watson responded. ""I've just invested one million dollars in your education.""

Image source: Getty Images. The fundamental challenge facing the banking industry is that the core product is a commodity. At its most basic level, every bank offers the same standard bank account, car loan, mortgage, and so on. Thus a bank's ability to provide other services and features that keep their customers coming back is paramount to retaining deposits and making profitable loans. Below, we'll explore the nine banks ranked most highly on customer loyalty as measured by Brand Keys, from first to the worst. Image source: Company. The largest bank by assets in the United States, JPMorgan has its hands in virtually everything related to banking and finance. The company boasts that it has a relationship with 60 million households in the United States. Its Chase credit card unit scores highly among everyday spenders and the affluent alike, receiving high marks for rewards and customer service, which gives it the No. 1 position in cards. Image source: Company. Unlike the others in the Big Four U.S. banks, Citi is really a global banking institution. It operates out of the world's largest metropolitan areas and has only a modest presence in smaller cities in the U.S. Yet it has remarkable reach into consumer spending through its credit cards business, which recently won a partnership with Costco, giving it the ability to tap into the wallets of the wholesale retailers' 53 million members with its highly rated Costco co-brand card. Customers love its cards' Price Rewind feature, which enables its cardholders to get a refund automatically when a product is advertised at a lower price within 60 days after purchase. Image source: Company. When Brian Moynihan took the job as Bank of America's chief executive officer, he made the customer experience paramount in rebuilding the bank's image -- and its profitability. Bank of America has invested heavily in its mobile and online banking services to improve customer satisfaction even as it has reduced the number of branches across the United States. The investment has paid off handsomely in the form of increased customer loyalty and approval ratings. Customers processed 108 million checks through the mobile app versus 170 million deposits in one of its branches last year. The bank brought private banking services to all of its clients with a banking-by-appointment feature so that its customers never have to wait in line to speak to a representative. Image source: Company. Bank of New York is hardly a traditional bank. It operates as a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides the back-end accounting services to keep everything running smoothly. Custody banks have inherently loyal customers due to the fact that moving billions of dollars of assets to another custodian is no easy task, and because the bank benefits from scale that enables it to manage its customers' assets at a price other banks would struggle to match. Image source: Company. Like Bank of America, PNC is ahead of the curve in creating products that are more convenient for customers while being more profitable for the bank. Thanks to investments in its online and mobile banking products, it recently reported that 60% of its customers use its ""non-teller channels"" for the majority of their transactions, up from 40% just three years ago. Its Virtual Wallet service enables its customers to make a budget, manage bills with the help of a calendar, and quickly see how they spend each and every dollar that flows into their accounts. Image source: Company. Once a pure-play credit card issuer, Capital One has become a bona fide banking operation that offers everything from checking and savings accounts to auto loans and even commercial banking services. The bank made inroads with consumers when it acquired ING Direct in 2011, which brought the bank more than 7 million customers who used its online banking services. Capital One has built on its ING Direct acquisition with an online banking service that its customers love -- a recent presentation notes that its mobile applications score the highest ratings in the iOS App Store. The bank also offers some of the highest-yielding money market accounts of any bank on this list, which certainly helps to keep its customers' loyalty. Image source: Company. Once known as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC is a worldwide banking operation that operates primarily as a corporate bank and credit card issuer in the United States. The company makes its ""internationally minded"" customers its priority through HSBC Premier, which provides banking and wealth management services to the mass affluent who live in large cities spanning from Seattle to New York City. With 2.4 million customers in the U.S., it has the smallest domestic operation of any of the banks on this list, given its focus on wealthier, international customers. Image source: Company. Calling itself ""America's Most Convenient Bank,"" TD Bank provides retail banking services to 9 million customers through approximately 1,300 branches along the East Coast. Its TD Select Savings Account offers free ATM services and reimburses customers for ATM fees charged at non-TD ATMs around the country. The company has mastered campaigns designed to promote customer loyalty, famously turning its ATMs into ""Automated Thanking Machines"" to deliver gifts to its customers -- cash, a trip to Trinidad to see a family member, and a unique experience throwing out a first pitch at a Blue Jays home game, for example. Image source: Company. Known colloquially as ""America's largest community bank,"" Wells Fargo has always operated as a simple retail banking institution. Convenience is key to customer loyalty, and Wells Fargo has the largest retail branch network of any U.S. bank, providing service to its customers through 6,200 banking locations and 12,000 ATMs scattered from coast to coast. Thanks to its large mortgage servicing business, it also has a relationship with millions of homeowners who aren't located near one of its branches. ","

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you follow bank stocks and big bank stocks, in particular, you should get acquainted with the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks. I refer to it frequently when I write, and therefore want to give readers a brief overview of exactly what it is, and why investors should care about it. The best way to think about the KBW Bank Index is to analogize it to the S&P 500, which tracks shares of 500 publicly traded companies with the largest market capitalizations in the United States. But instead of being industry agnostic, as the S&P 500 is, the KBW Bank Index focuses on only large-cap banks -- 24 of them, to be precise. These are banks that you've no doubt heard of, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). These are the four biggest banks in the country. They're also -- with the exception of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), the best-run big bank in the country -- the four that are weighted most heavily on the KBW Bank Index. The index weights its components according to a measure of market capitalization, adjusted for a bank's share price. This helps to explain why, as you can see in the table below, Citigroup carries the greatest weight on the Index, even though it has a smaller market capitalization than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, respectively. Name Weight on KBW Bank Index Citigroup 8.82% Bank of America 7.85% JPMorgan Chase 7.83% US Bancorp 7.83% Wells Fargo 7.68% State Street 4.54% Bank of New York Mellon 4.30% Northern Trust 4.03% PNC Financial 3.97% M&T Bank 3.97% SunTrust Banks 3.87% KeyCorp 3.81% BB&T 3.76% Fifth Third 3.63% Citizens Financial 3.52% Capital One 3.48% Regions Financial 3.30% First Republic Bank 2.86% Huntington Bancshares 2.75% Comerica 2.47% SVB Financial 1.80% Zions Bancorporation 1.65% New York Community Bancorp 1.25% People's United Financial 1.06% Source: Invesco. There's one side note that's worth pointing out when it comes to the KBW Bank Index. That is, not all of these banks have the same business model. Some are universal banks, which operate both investment and commercial-banking operations. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup fall most comfortably into this category. A second group consists of so-called custodial or trust banks. The three banks on the list that most naturally fall into this category are State Street, Northern Trust, and Bank of New York Mellon -- and I consider the latter to be a particularly interesting bank. These banks focus less on making loans and taking deposits and more on the administration of fixed-income securities for institutional investors like hedge funds, university endowments, and insurance companies. The final group are pure-play commercial banks, specializing in taking deposits and making loans. When most people think about a bank's business model, this is what they have in mind. The largest among these is Wells Fargo, followed by U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial, and Capital One Financial, respectively. Image source: Getty Images. An index like this is important for investors because it allows you to see whether a particular stock is in line with its peer group. Viewed in isolation, it's impossible to say whether a particular bank stock is cheap or expensive -- or efficient or inefficient -- or whatever metric it is that you're trying to tease out. But if you have a control group against which to compare a bank's valuation, profitability, or efficiency, then you can get a much better idea of its relative value or performance, which explains why I can confidently say that U.S. Bancorp is the best-run big bank in the country. This is what the KBW Bank Index enables one to do. And it's why I recommend that investors have a general understanding of what it is and how to use it. ","

Christy Bieber,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chase announced recently that its Sapphire, Sapphire Preferred, and Sapphire Reserve cardholders would be eligible for 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points if they obtained a mortgage with Chase bank by Aug. 6, 2017.  The offer was available only for current cardholders and only for a new purchase, not a refinance. It was not the first offer of its kind -- Capital One also made an offer of free mileage last year, and Wells Fargo has offered rebates for mortgage loans in the past -- but it was a generous offer, with rewards points worth around 2.1 cents per point. While getting points or other rewards for taking out a mortgage loan seems attractive if you're thinking about buying a home anyway, there are three big reasons why it's unwise to go with a particular mortgage lender just to earn miles or other credit card rewards. Image Source: Getty Images. Chase made its announcement in May and stipulated that cardholders who want the points would have to apply by the deadline on Aug. 6. This is a very limited amount of time to do your research into the mortgage terms offered by different lenders. Most incentive deals that mortgage lenders offer have deadlines, which puts artificial time pressure on you. Your mortgage will likely be the biggest debt you carry during your lifetime. You need time to carefully compare the different fees, interest rates, mortgage points, and other terms various lenders will offer you. The process shouldn't be rushed, and you shouldn't try to move faster than you're comfortable with just so you don't miss out on credit card points, airline miles, or other incentives. Your credit card points will be spent within a matter of months, while airlines miles earned for taking out a loan last only a trip or two. A mortgage is an obligation lasting 15 to 30 years. If you buy a house before you're ready because you don't want to miss out on a mortgage incentive, you'll be stuck with a real estate commission, transfer tax, and a host of other expensive costs if you need to sell the home. Unless you have all of your ducks on a row -- like a 20% down payment at the ready, as well as an emergency fund to cover maintenance and repairs -- you could also end up having to pay for private mortgage insurance or fall into debt if something unexpected happens. If you jump into a loan too fast, you may also feel the need to refinance a few years down the road in order to get better terms. Refinancing is a costly process, as you have to pay for a new appraisal and the closing costs of the new loan. Getting out of one mortgage loan and into another is also a time-consuming process that requires you to produce lots of paperwork. Banks may make up the cost by charging a slightly higher mortgage loan rate -- Chase's rates as of late May were 3.875% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan, while Bankrate had some lenders offering rates as low as 3.750% -- or they may charge more than other lenders for various costs like the credit check, home appraisal, loan origination fee, or underwriting fee. Even a small difference in interest can make a big difference in payments. A $200,000 loan at 3.750% would cost you $926 per month, and the total loan cost would be $333,443. By comparison, the same $200,000 mortgage at a 3.875% interest rate would come with payments of $940 per month, and the total cost of the loan would be $338,571. That tiny difference in the interest rate would cost you an extra $5,000 over the life of the loan -- and odds are the rewards you earned wouldn't come close to that value. Don't cheat yourself out of thousands of dollars by falling for a gimmick. Wait until you're ready to buy a home, carefully research different lenders with good reputations, and choose the best overall deal. If you just happen to get a reward from that lender, that bonus will be icing on the cake. ","
      
    3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Open a Mortgage to Get Rewards -- The Motley Fool

If you're in the market for a bank stock, then valuation is one thing you should keep in mind. Holding all else equal, the cheaper you can buy a stock, the bigger your return is likely to be. It's for this reason that I intermittently check bank stock valuations on the KBW Bank Index, the leading index of large-cap bank stocks headquartered in the United States. The average stock on the index trades for 15.5 times the bank's projected earnings per share over the next 12 months. That's not cheap, but it's far from expensive when you consider that the average stock on the S&P 500 is valued at 35 times forward earnings. But while bank stocks in general are valued at a lower multiple to earnings than the typical large-cap stock, some banks are still cheaper than others. Based on the forward P/E ratio, here are the five cheapest big bank stocks right now: Stock Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) 10.6 Citigroup (NYSE:C) 12.5 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 12.9 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 13.0 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 13.1 KBW Bank Index average 15.5 Data source: YCharts.com. Aside from Capital One, which is heavily concentrated in credit card loans and thus exposed to elevated credit risk, as credit card loans tend to default at higher rates than other types of loans, the four other cheapest big bank stocks have something in common: They're the largest banks in the country. Citigroup is the smallest of the four, yet it still has $1.8 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is the largest, overseeing $2.6 trillion in assets. And Bank of America and Wells Fargo fall in between these two. Why would these banks trade at lower valuations than smaller banks? It seems to me that there are four reasons. First, under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, global systemically important banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup can't operate with as much leverage as their smaller, simpler peers can. This is because they're subject to higher capital requirements, which necessarily reduces leverage and profitability. Second, all of these banks are effectively shut out of the market for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo each hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Therefore, they're prohibited under federal law from acquiring other banks. Citigroup doesn't face the same constraint, as its depositary base is weighted more heavily toward international deposits. But given the New York-based bank's strategy over the past few years of shrinking its balance sheet as opposed to growing it, it's safe to say that Citigroup is not in the market to acquire other banks, either. The net result is that these four banks are all largely confined to organic growth, which could weigh on their returns in the future relative to banks that aren't similarly prohibited from merging with or acquiring other banks. Image source: Getty Images. The third reason is that these four banks are especially difficult to analyze. Much of this comes from their sheer size and the extent of their operations. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup are all universal banks, meaning that they run both investment and commercial banking businesses. Commercial banking is straightforward, consisting of taking deposits and making loans. This yields recurring revenue that doesn't fluctuate widely on a quarterly or annual basis. Investment banking operations are much harder to understand and forecast into the future. This is primarily because an investment bank's top line is influenced by volume and volatility in the credit markets, both of which are all but impossible to predict in advance. Finally, while I've touched on this already, the biggest banks in the country are all subject to much more robust regulatory requirements than smaller banks. Their compliance exams are more intense. They face additional hurdles on the annual stress tests. And the way they structure their balance sheets is much more closely scrutinized by industry overseers. Does this mean you should avoid buying shares of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup? Not necessarily because, remember, while they may face more headwinds than smaller banks, their shares can also be picked up at much lower valuations. That said, as I've written in the past, given the towering heights of the stock market today, I think investors have more to gain than lose from waiting for a potential pullback in the market before diving deeper into stocks.

When I think about banks, I often think about Citigroup (NYSE:C) as being in a league of its own. It isn't because of its performance, which has left a lot to be desired over the past decade. It's rather because of its emphasis on international banking. There are a number of ways to show this, but one of the most obvious is to look at the distribution of Citigroup's deposits. More than half of the New York-based bank's deposits are held in offices outside the United States: Data source: regulatory filings. Chart by author. Even a cursory glance at this chart shows how different Citigroup is from the three other megabanks that sit atop the financial-services industry. JPMorgan Chase, which also has a large international presence, only has 17% of its deposits held in overseas offices. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo and Bank of America both come in at less than 10%. This goes to the core of Citigroup's business model. It was roughly a century ago that the bank became one of the first in the United States to establish a global banking presence, gaining footholds throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America, in addition to its operations in the United States. Citigroup not only has offices in other countries, but its operations abroad also pivot around consumer banking, the primary purpose of which is to attract deposits. This distinguishes it from the three other banks in the chart, whose international operations focus more on investment banking, as is the case with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America in particular. The purpose of investment banking is to help global corporations issue debt and equity, manage risk, and move money around the world. Image source: Getty Images. Citigroup's extensive overseas presence is a double-edged sword. While it serves to distinguish the $1.8 trillion bank from its peers, it also introduces another layer of risk. In the lead-up to the Great Depression, for instance, Citigroup gained notoriety for selling toxic Latin American bonds to its customers in the United States. And throughout the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, Citigroup came within a hair's breadth of failure because of overexposure to soured bonds issued by the likes of Brazil and Argentina. In an effort to reduce risk and simplify its business model since the financial crisis, Citigroup has pared down its operations abroad. In 2008, for instance, it sold its Japanese trust banking unit to Mitsubishi UFG Trust and Banking. Citigroup followed that up a year later by selling its retail brokerage business in Japan. And six years after that, it did the same with its retail banking operations in the East Asian country. These moves have simplified and streamlined Citigroup's business model. They've also helped the bank raise capital and de-risk its operations. But even though they represent a retreat for Citigroup in terms of its long-term focus on global banking, it's clear from the chart that the bank continues to distinguish itself from its peers in terms of the size and reach of its international footprint.

Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","

John Maxfield and Gaby Lapera,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Last week, the Financial CHOICE Act, a hulking 600-page piece of legislation regarding the banking industry, made its way through the House of Representatives. A full transcript follows the video. John Maxfield: It's going great, Gaby, how are you doing? Lapera: I'm doing pretty good. I had an exciting weekend. I was volunteering at Pride with The Motley Fool, so that was really exciting, and I went rock climbing. What a fulfilling weekend. Maxfield: Nice, that is a really fulfilling weekend. I basically spent the weekend mediating disputes between my five-year-old twin sons. [laughs] That's kind of like the referee in a boxing ring. Lapera: [laughs] Oh my gosh, I'm very impressed. My brother also has twins, and they are young and also a handful. You have the patience and energy of a saint. Talking about patience and energy, let's turn to Congress. Today, we're going to talk about the CHOICE Act, which stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs. Another in a long line of acronyms that are kind of just jammed in together to try to make something that's fun to say. The CHOICE Act just passed the House on Friday. The whole thing with the CHOICE Act, the reason that we're talking about it on the show, is that it's basically there to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is what was regulating all of the banking stuff that we've been talking about for literally, what, two years now, Maxfield? Maxfield: Yeah. Or five years. You and I have been talking about it for two years now. One of the ways that I think is really helpful to think about the Financial CHOICE Act is that, in all industries, particularly banking, you can look at it through the lens of cycles, different types of cycles -- the business cycle, the credit cycle, cycles in consumer confidence. But another cycle that you can use to think about, not only in the financial services sector, but in all sectors, is the regulatory cycle, specifically in terms of whether the industry has more power, or the regulators have more power, at any particular point in time. And after the financial crisis, when the Dodd-Frank Act was passed on largely partisan lines, basically just supported by the Democrats, that shifted a lot of power away from the industry over to regulators. And basically what the Financial CHOICE Act does is it reverses that. And it was passed in the house, like we said last week, on largely partisan lines, but the partisan lines were different: This time, it was Republicans supporting it and Democrats not supporting it. What it tries to do is take that power that Dodd-Frank gave to the regulators and give it back to the industry. Lapera: Yeah. The bill is sponsored, unsurprisingly, by a man named Jeb Hensarling, who is a Republican. As with most things political, things are falling along party lines. I want to take an opportunity to say that Maxfield and I are going to do our best to stay unbiased throughout this discussion, but everyone is a person and we all have opinions, and our opinions don't necessarily reflect that of The Motley Fool, but we're going to try to give you an informed, as objective as possible, discussion. My anthropology roots tell me that there is no way to have a completely unbiased discussion, so I'm going to leave it at that and talk a little bit more about the philosophy behind the CHOICE Act. Basically, a lot of people don't like Dodd-Frank. They think it puts too much pressure on the banks, it's too hard for them to make money the way that Dodd-Frank is structured. There's a few different parts to it, the big parts of the Financial CHOICE Act. But I think the one that a lot of people focus on is, the Financial CHOICE Act is looking to end ""too big to fail."" Maxfield: Right. To your point, Gaby, about the partisan basis, I want to address that before I jump into the too-big-to-fail part. The one thing to keep in mind is, even though Dodd-Frank was passed on partisan basis, and the Financial CHOICE Act made it through the House on a partisan basis, the fact of the matter is, almost everybody agrees, most knowledgeable sources agree, that Dodd-Frank went too far. And I'm somebody who thinks that there needs to be a robust regulatory framework around the banking systems, just because banks are so highly leveraged, and because they play a role in the monetary system of the United States and they're kind of, to a certain extent, an extension of the federal government. So you can't let banks go out there and do what they want, because they are acting, in a sense, on the part of taxpayers. So I think that's some good context to keep in mind. But Dodd-Frank, almost everybody would agree that it did go too far. So now the question is, how far do you tailor it back? Lapera: Yeah. And to get into that about being an extension of the government, it's not just that with the systemically important financial institutions. It's not just our country -- it's the entire world is tied into these financial systems. So people get concerned that if they fail, it's going to be -- to borrow a term from the Vietnam era -- a domino effect with other people's economies. So there is a lot of feelings riding on this, and a lot of this depends on how you view economic theory. I think 90% agree with you that Dodd-Frank potentially went too far. I don't know that the CHOICE Act is the answer, either. We'll see what happens. We'll get a little bit more into it. Let's talk a little bit about the actual components of the Financial CHOICE Act, and what they look like, what they mean in terms of existing legislation. Like I said earlier, too big to fail -- that's one of the big key components, ending too big to fail, of the Financial CHOICE Act. Maxfield: Right, if we go back to the financial crisis, here's an overarching way to think about this too-big-to-fail component. You had Citigroup, Bank of America, and AIG, you had your Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns -- these very large financial institutions. These financial institutions hold trillions of dollars in assets on their balance sheets, and oversee a large chunk of the deposits that you and I and everyone else deposits. So if one of those were to fail, it could cause catastrophic damage to the economy. In fact, if you go back to the Great Depression, the thing that caused the Great Depression, or transformed it from a typical recession into the Great Depression, was the failure of a bunch of banks. So that informed this whole too-big-to-fail idea where, even though it's extremely unpalatable to go in and bail out these huge firms with these executives that make tens of millions of dollars a year, and basically save them from their own mistakes, even though that's very unpalatable on almost every level, it does save the U.S. economy. What the CHOICE Act does is it tries to reduce the ability of regulators to step in and bail these banks out. Let me be clear. There is a very solid theoretical framework behind that, because the thought process is, if you go in and bail out these big banks and they know you're going to bail them out in the future, they have much less incentive to act responsibly. That's that whole thought process. If you go back to the financial crisis, the term -- I'm pulling a blank on the term -- but if you go back to the financial crisis, this was one of the main arguments that they asserted. So what Hensarling's act tries to do is dial that back, and it does it in a couple of different ways. No. 1, it removes the regulator's authority to take over these organizations that are troubled and liquidate them in an orderly way, and it transfers that authority over into the bankruptcy code. Lapera: Just a quick side note for listeners, this is called the Orderly Liquidation Authority, that's OLA, which you might see floating around if you're reading about this online. That's actually codified into law, and it's the way the government stepped in and made sure there was an orderly liquidation during the most recent financial crisis of banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Maxfield: Right. Also, the term I was thinking about earlier was moral hazard. That's the hazard that, if you're going to step in and bail someone out -- an institution -- that institution has less incentive to act responsibly. And like I said, that's grounded in theory. Lapera: And it's actually really funny, because earlier you were talking about spending the weekend refereeing between your two children. This is almost just a parenting concept, that if you reward that behavior, you're going to keep getting bad behavior. Maxfield: Exactly, that's exactly right. And all parents can understand that. Another important thing it does in that too-big-to-fail context is that it seeks to restrict the Federal Reserve's discount window lending to what's known as Bagehot's dictum. Lapera: There's a lot of words in there. What is a discount-window lending? I mean, what is discount-window lending? I sound like an old person... ""What is the Facebook?"" What is discount window lending? Maxfield: Discount window is, when a bank gets into trouble, one of the things that will happen is, its depositors will know it's in trouble, so they will all run on the bank at the same time to withdraw their deposits. That's known as a bank run. The problem with a bank run is, because banks are so leveraged, and they only hold a small amount of actual cash in terms of relative to deposits that they have, that can cause them to be completely illiquid. They can run out of cash trying to satisfy their depositors. What the discount window does is it allows banks to take some of its assets on its balance sheet, go to the Federal Reserve, use those assets as collateral, and then get cash from the Federal Reserve to satisfy depositors, to thereby stop or prevent a bank run. Maxfield: It happened with... the name of the bank is escaping me right now, but it happened with a major bank that was based in California during the financial crisis. And it was actually that bank that was taken over and turned into OneWest, which was the institution that was associated with Steven Mnuchin, who's now the Treasury Secretary. But it does still happen, but it's much less frequent because there is FDIC deposit insurance now, as well, that reduces the incentive for people to have to feel like they need to run on the banks and take their deposits out, because the FDIC will be there to stand behind the banks, anyway. So what Bagehot's dictum does is it says that the Federal Reserve should only allow banks to access the discount window -- or it says that the way the Federal Reserve could use the discount window is to lend freely and early in times of crisis, which is what happened last time -- but it should only do so to ""solvent firms and against good collateral at high interest rates."" It's that high-interest rates part that's really significant, because the idea there is, if you were using a punitive interest rate, banks are going to be less inclined to use the discount window. And if they're less inclined to use the discount window in times of crisis, the thought is that, ahead of time, they will be much more careful about the quality of the assets they put on their balance sheets, and the ability to turn those into cash in the public markets as opposed to having to go to the discount window of the Federal Reserve. Lapera: And you have just revealed the disconnect between Democrats and Republicans -- which is that Republicans believe that banks can be forced to be responsible enough to take care of themselves, and Democrats do not, and that's why they're pushing for all this extra regulation. Right now, that falls along partisan lines. Whatever you think is up to you. That's basically what's going on. Maxfield: I will say, to take politics out of this, I studied banks pretty intensely for a number of years, and I will tell you that in history, the thing that we know is that you need a strong and independent central bank, you need it at all times, but particularly in times of crisis. So you do want to be really careful in terms of both the authorities you give to a central bank in that situation and, in this case, the authorities that you take away from it. But again, this is something that, it will get worked out, and the pendulum swings back and forth between regulators and industry. And right now, this is a bill that swings at way back on the other side. I would say, just like Dodd-Frank went too far swinging the pendulum into the favor of regulators, Hensarling's act seems to me to go too far in the other direction. Which makes sense, given that Dodd-Frank was partisan on the Democratic side and the Financial CHOICE Act is partisan on the Republican side. Lapera: Yeah. Actually, you gave me a good segue earlier to kind of slide into this next big thing that the act is going to do, which is that it's going to significantly cut down on the authority of regulatory agencies. I think one of the most important things to note is that they're going to subject financial Regulatory agencies to the REINS Act. The REINS Act basically says that any agency that wants to impose a rule that costs more than $100 million a year needs to run it by Congress first, and if Congress fails to approve a rule within 70 days after it's been proposed, then the rule would go away -- it would be null and void. Which is hard, because if you have partisan control of committees, rules that would go against whatever the nature of that committee is at the moment can just sit for 70 days and never even get heard, and then it just doesn't happen, and that means that regulation is going to happen much more slowly. Maxfield: Right. The way it works now is that the Federal Reserve, the FCC, the CFPB, all these different regulatory agencies -- and this isn't just in the financial services arena, this is across all regulatory agencies and all industries, that in order to regulate their industries, they are given the authority to pass rules that, like, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to pass rules about appropriate products that can be marketed to customers. And those rules, there is a long process where they get insight from the industry and other interested parties. But then those regulatory agencies have the power to put those rules into place and require the industry to follow them. What the Financial CHOICE Act would do is add another layer in that step, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but here's the problem. That additional layer is Congressional approval of these rules. And you can imagine that that really adds a lot of complications to that whole process. It's not like you're just adding just one more hurdle. You're adding an extremely high hurdle that, depending on who is in control of Congress and the Senate at any particular point in time, these regulatory agencies may not be able to jump over. Again, I think that's probably the whole point of subjecting them to the REINS Act, which passed earlier this year. Lapera: Right, it's to reduce the amount of federal legislation that exists, that's really what the point of it is. But it's hard because, yes, maybe regulatory agencies shouldn't be making up rules without Congressional approval, but on the other hand, Congress takes a really long time to do things sometimes. Sometimes, agencies come up with stuff to protect people or help people, and then it gets codified into law, but until then, they're just responding quickly to the needs as they see them. So it's this really hard to push-and-pull thing that you have with government. Let's talk a little bit also about the Fed, which you mentioned is going to be affected by this act. It's hard, because the Fed has also been subjected to the REINS Act, as well. Maxfield: Right. There's one other piece to this. It's not only the REINS Act that they're subjecting the regulators to. They also subject the regulators to the appropriations process. That's a really important thing. Right now, let's take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is actually an agency within the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve is an independent agency. So you have multiple layers of independence. But one of the principal pieces of independence is that, in the case of the Federal Reserve, it is a profit-making entity -- it has a huge balance sheet full of assets that earn interest in time. So it doesn't have to go to Congress to get money to operate, which gives it independence from Congress. The same thing is true with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- don't quote me exactly on this -- since it was put into operation, and in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it has issued a total of something like $11 [billion] to $12 billion worth of fines to the industry, and it can use those fines to do, among other things, fund its own operations. So it, too, is kind of detached or insulated from that political process that is a part of the appropriations process. And what the Financial CHOICE Act does is, it would take away that independence and require these institutions to go to Congress for the funding, which would have a significant impact on them. Lapera: Yeah. And that's one of the big criticisms of the CFBP, that its critics levied at it, is that the CFPB might start just issuing fines just because it has a financial incentive to, as opposed to doing it because the fines really need to be issued. So that's kind of where that Financial CHOICE Act section, that's what it's trying to get at. Maxfield: Right. Then, to your point about going straight at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve is one of those institutions that, people either don't know anything about it, or they love it or hate it, or they don't know anything about it, and they love or hate it. And one of the things that people tend to think about when they think about the Federal Reserve is that it's some sort of conspiratorial entity that controls the money supply and does so for the economic elites, and things like that. And one of the reasons that these conspiracy theories are able to grow take on the forms that they're able to take is because it's a relatively non-transparent organization, particularly when it comes to managing the money supply. Another main principle of the Financial CHOICE Act is to increase the transparency of the Federal Reserve, both in terms of its overall operations and in terms of the way it manages the money supply. And what I mean by managing the money supply is, when it decides to raise or lower interest rates, because that's the lever that causes the money supply to expand or contract. Lapera: Yeah, and it's not just that. For example, the stress tests, no one is 100% sure what's in them. Maxfield: Exactly. So the stress tests right now, these happen once a year for large banks. The purpose of them is to see how they would perform in a hypothetical economic scenario that is analogous to the financial crisis. This is actually a very good piece of the regulatory pie in the banking industry, because it keeps bankers' eyes on making sure that the assets they put on the balance sheets aren't going to submit them to massive losses if, and when, the economy turns down, like it inevitably will. But the issue with the stress tests is that, when the banks submit all the information to the Federal Reserve for the stress test, when the banks are going through their planning process, in terms of structuring their balance sheets and their operations in a way that will help them make it through the stress test, is that the Federal Reserve doesn't actually give them the exact model that the Federal Reserve is using in the course of the stress test. So the banks are flying blind in this regard. If you talk to bankers, most all of them will say that they think the stress tests are a good thing. I'm talking about the bankers, the CEOs of the very large banks in this country, those are the ones under the most stringent stress-test requirements. They will almost universally say that they think the stress tests are a good thing, but they will also almost universally complain about the fact that the Federal Reserve doesn't share the models it uses in the course of the stress test, so banks are just flying blind. Lapera: Yeah. That actually is kind of paired with another aspect of the CHOICE Act, which is that they are proposing that if banks hold a certain amount of money on their balance sheet, essentially as an emergency fund, that they won't be subject to quite as much regulation as they are now. Maxfield: Right. One of the main narratives that emerged from the financial crisis was that the reason the crisis was able to metastasize the way it did was because banks were overleveraged, they were undercapitalized. Which means, a typical bank will hold $1 worth of equity for $10 of assets. At the time, you had, like, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and companies like that -- Lehman Brothers, at certain points, was leveraged by something like 30:1. What that means was, if its assets fell by just 3%, if the value of its assets fell by just 3%, it would render it completely insolvent. In the wake of the financial crisis, all of these additional capital rules came in to require banks to not only hold more capital, but dictated the type of capital that they were supposed to hold. What the Financial CHOICE Act does is say, ""Look, let's do away with all these complicated capital rules,"" and these capital rules are incredibly complicated, ""and let's replace them with a simple leverage ratio where banks, all you do is compare how much equity or capital a bank has to its assets, and just use that simple ratio."" And if banks meet the threshold laid out in the Financial CHOICE Act, then they can be exempt from all of these additional regulations that Dodd-Frank is imposing, particularly on large banks. So the thought process is, look, if you just make them hold more capital, they're safer, so they don't have to do all these other things. Lapera: So the thing that the Financial CHOICE Act offers for banks that do this, in particular, that's probably very valuable for them is that, right now, really large banks have to go to the Fed before doing stuff like issuing a dividend or changing their business plan. And in theory, if they meet this leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they won't have to ask for permission to do any of that stuff anymore. Of course, it's really interesting, because when you say a simple ratio with assets, just like with people, there are assets that are really easy to move and there are assets that are really hard to move. So I don't know, I personally need a little bit more clarity around what that ratio actually looks like. It's a lot harder to sell a house and get that cash than it is to have cash to pay, and that analogy also holds for banks. They have some assets that are really hard to offload and some that are really easy to offload, so how did they end up calculating that ratio? The reason I don't know the answer to this yet is that I have not actually read all 600 pages of this act yet. I'm working on it, I'll do it eventually. So one of the reasons I haven't read all of it yet is because, it's passed the House and it's about to go to the Senate, and the Senate, in my opinion, is not going to let this pass as originally written. There's probably going to be quite a few amendments, and the language is probably going to change quite a lot, if it passes at all. Maxfield: And here's another really important point. They're saying that, if a bank holds enough capital to satisfy this simplified leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they're calling that an off-ramp -- the off-ramp being, you get off the highway with all these other regulations. Well, one of the really interesting regulations that it's looking like the Financial CHOICE Act is trying to attack and would allow these big banks, in particular, to avoid -- and let me read this from the executive summary of the Financial CHOICE Act. It says it will ""exempt banking organizations that have made a qualifying capital election from any federal law, rule, or regulation that provide limitations on mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions of assets or control ... "" So what does that mean? Through the 1970s-1980s, the banking industry deregulated. It allowed banks to open up house, operate branches, and allowed banks to operate across interstate lines, which is something that, in the past, they generally weren't allowed to do. Well, the quid pro quo in that case was that they were going to allow these banks to grow and do all these things and have more flexibility in terms of their operations, but on the other side of that, they wanted to stop these things from getting so enormous that if one of them were to fail, it would basically wipe out all the wealth of the United States. So they did that by saying, ""If you hold 10% or more of the nation's deposits, you are not allowed to then acquire another depository institution."" And right now, there are three banks that fit that -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. So right now, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, they cannot go out and buy any other banks, they're not allowed to because each one of them holds more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, if I'm reading it correctly, it's saying that, as long as those banks hold enough capital to meet that threshold in the act, they would then be free to merge together or buy other banks. So you could theoretically, in this case, see a merger between JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two biggest banks in the country. And I really doubt that that would happen because their branch bases completely overlap each other, so there would be too much redundancy in doing that. But people should think about, is that something we want to do? Do we want each individual bank to hold, say, 25% or 50% of the nation's deposits? Is that a direction we want to go in, given the fact that since the Civil War, more than 17,000 banks have failed? So it's a good thing to keep in mind. Lapera: Yeah, no, that's a really overwhelming thing to think about. We need to wrap up because we've been here for a while. It's partially because there's just so much stuff in this act to discuss. There's so many little things that could end up having really big impact. We'll continue to track the progress of the bill. Like I mentioned earlier, I really, really do not think this is going to get through the Senate completely unchanged. We'll talk about that more when we know more. Was there anything else you wanted to say, Maxfield? Maxfield: No, I think that's it. The only other thing is, it would dramatically impact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We could talk about that on a different show because that deserves its own conversation. But again, to leave off on the same point I made at the very beginning, the Financial CHOICE Act, like the Dodd-Frank Act, is neither good nor bad. It's just a reflection of the swing of the pendulum back and forth between regulators and industries. We've seen this many times in the past. And generally, when the pendulum swings, regardless of the direction in which it swings, it goes too far. Dodd-Frank went too far. The Financial CHOICE Act went too far. So to your point, Gaby, when this goes through the Senate, it's likely that they're going to tailor it back. Lapera: Yeah. That seems very likely, especially given everything that we've seen during this Administration so far. Who knows what'll happen? Things in D.C. either move at breakneck pace, or very, very slowly. We'll keep you guys up to date, don't worry. If you guys have any questions, definitely email us at industryfocus@fool.com, or by tweeting us @MFIndustryFocus, and let us know what you'd like to hear about next. If you tweet us @MFIndustryFocus, I am actually now in charge of our Twitter feed, so yeah, that will actually be me responding to you. Thank you, Austin, for listening to this very long episode about financial regulation. [laughs] Austin Morgan: Of course. Lapera: He's looking at me like, ""You owe me one, bud."" Maxfield: He's asleep, yeah. Morgan: Just another Monday.

    What's the Deal with the Financial CHOICE Act? -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big bank stocks have surged over the past eight months, yet they still look relatively cheap when compared with regional bank stocks. Is this a sign you should buy the former and sell the latter? Not necessarily. The easiest way to see the difference in valuation between banks based on size is to compare the median valuation on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks the two dozen biggest banks in the country, with the KBW Regional Banking Index, which tracks 50 banks with between $5 billion and $40 billion worth of assets on their balance sheets. Index Median Forward Price-to-Earnings Multiple Median Price to Book Value Median Price to Tangible Book Value KBW Bank Index 14.88 1.36 1.92 KBW Regional Banking Index 17.41 1.66 2.18 Data source: YCharts.com. It doesn't matter which of the three primary valuation metrics you use: Regional banks such as Glacier Bancorp (NASDAQ:GBCI) and Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK) generally trade at a higher multiple compared with big banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Based on earnings, which is the metric that should take the lead in an analysis today, the median regional bank on the KBW Regional Banking Index trades for 17.41 times earnings per share over the next 12 months. The figure on the KBW Bank Index is 14.88. The story is the same when you look at valuation as a function of book value. The median regional bank stock trades for 2.18 times tangible book value, while the median big bank trades for a multiple of 1.92. Investors need to appreciate that these figures alone don't mean big banks are better buys than regional banks. A better interpretation of the difference is that regional banks have more opportunities to grow. Regional and community banks are growing like weeds. Image source: Getty Images. There are two ways to grow in the bank industry. The first is through organic growth -- attracting new customers through marketing efforts and gaining more of each customer's overall financial business, be it a mortgage, credit card, car loan, whatever. The second avenue is through mergers and acquisitions. Holding all else equal, a bank that can use both avenues can grow faster than a bank that can use only one. Herein lies the difference in valuation between the nation's biggest banks, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and regional banks, such as Glacier Bancorp and Bank of the Ozarks. As I've discussed in the past, the nation's three biggest banks, which are weighted heavily on KBW's large-cap bank index, are all shut out of the acquisition game, at least insofar as other depository institutions are concerned. That's because Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo each already hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. As such, these three banks are legally prohibited from acquiring other banks. Regional banks aren't similarly proscribed. Because none of the banks on the KBW Regional Banking Index come even close to the 10% deposit threshold, they can still merge with or acquire other banks, thereby supercharging growth. That's exactly what they've been doing. To cite just two examples, Glacier Bancorp has acquired nine banks since the beginning of 2009, and that's on top of 15 other deals it has completed since 1990. The same is true at Bank of the Ozarks, which has purchased a total of 16 other banks since the financial crisis. OZRK Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. The net result is that these two banks have seen their balance sheets expand rapidly over the past decade. Bank of the Ozarks went from $2.5 billion in assets 10 years ago to more than $19 billion today. And while Glacier Bancorp's recent ascent hasn't been as steep, the Montana-based bank has nevertheless more than doubled in size over the same stretch. Thus, the reason big bank stocks seem cheap is that their ability to grow is tightly constrained compared with their smaller, simpler counterparts in the regional banking space. ","
      
    Here's Why Big Bank Stocks Look Cheaper Than They Really Are -- The Motley Fool

Dan Caplinger,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Exchange traded funds have made it easy for investors to drill down on specific types of investments, and Sector SPDR ETFs have become one of the most popular ways to invest in specific sectors of the stock market. Sector SPDRs track 10 different sectors in the S&P 500, with each Sector SPDR ETF delivering performance equal to that of the component stocks within the target industry. The investments have relatively low costs and offer diversification while letting you tailor your portfolio in line with your beliefs about the future of particular parts of the market. Sector SPDR 10-Year Average Annual Return Consumer Staples (NYSEMKT:XLP) 10.26% Consumer Discretionary (NYSEMKT:XLY) 10.25% Technology (NYSEMKT:XLK) 9.97% Health Care (NYSEMKT:XLV) 9.51% Industrials (NYSEMKT:XLI) 7.88% Utilities (NYSEMKT:XLU) 6.47% Materials (NYSEMKT:XLB) 5.06% Energy (NYSEMKT:XLE) 1.53% Financials (NYSEMKT:XLF) (0.72%) Real Estate (NYSEMKT:XLRE) N/A Data source: SPDR. N/A = not applicable; the Real Estate Sector SPDR began trading in October 2015. The Sector SPDR ETFs break up the S&P 500 into 10 separate indexes. Like any ETF, the Sector SPDRs trade throughout the trading day on the NYSE Arca exchange. As index funds, the investment objective for the ETFs is to match the share-price performance and dividend income of the underlying sectors that they track. Sector SPDRs have anywhere from 25 to 85 individual stock holdings in their portfolios, depending on the number of S&P 500 members in each respective industry. Consumer discretionary currently has the most stocks, while the materials sector comes in last. Image source: Getty Images. Just looking at the range of returns on the Sector SPDRs reveals the utility of having these ETFs available. Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has had a total return of about 7%, and the chart above shows that half of the sectors have outperformed that figure while the other half have underperformed. Finally, even if you want to own the whole market, Sector SPDRs give you the opportunity to get some tax benefits. In a rising market, simply owning the S&P 500 ETF as a single holding doesn't give you chances to reap any tax-loss benefits. However, even when the overall market rises, you'll generally find that some sectors lose ground. By using tax-loss harvesting strategies, you can collect tax losses on those underperforming sectors while deferring tax on rising sector ETFs until you sell them well into the future. There are a couple ways in which Sector SPDRs aren't the perfect investment. First, even with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.14%, they're still more expensive than broader-based market ETFs. For instance, you can find ETFs tracking the entire S&P 500 for as little as 0.04%. The other major problem is that like most ETFs, you have to pay brokerage commissions to trade Sector SPDRs. Even those brokers who offer commission-free ETF trading typically don't include the Sector SPDRs, with some instead offering their own proprietary sector-based ETFs. With low commissions available from many brokers, the costs of owning Sector SPDRs doesn't have to be prohibitive, but it is somewhat of a drag on performance. Nevertheless, for investors looking to make plays on specific parts of the market, Sector SPDRs are a good option to consider. With a long history behind them, Sector SPDRs will remain popular ETFs far into the future. ","

Global oil producers have said that crude production “should crater with prices around $40-$50 per barrel, [but] they are having a hard time restraining themselves from producing,” he said. That’s particularly true for the U.S., which is producing more petroleum today, with West Texas Intermediate oil prices

A chart from Wells Fargo shows that U.S. crude-oil and liquid-fuels production stands around 15.5 million barrels a day. It was at just over 14 million barrels a day in mid-2014: Prices of $80 a barrel are likely unattainable as well, “until the world’s oil producers stop overproducing,” said LaForge. Read: Why global oil production looks set to grow in 2018, despite OPEC-led output cuts “We continue to hear that big cutbacks are on the cusp of happening,” he said. “The evidence, however, implies otherwise. And the longer oil prices remain low and range-bound, the harder it will be for prices to bounced above $60—as production costs have dropped significantly since 2014, which keeps more producers in the game.” And each time prices do bounce toward $60, the “temptation to overproduce,” may be “overwhelming for those countries that rely heavily on oil revenues to sustain their economies and social programs,” LaForge said. Given all of that, “we are not expecting the price of WTI crude oil to climb anywhere near $100 per barrel over the next few years,” he said. Instead, Wells Fargo expects it to remain low and range-bound, bouncing between $30 and $60 per barrel. Still, “there is the possibility that the WTI crude-oil price finds its way into the high $30s to low $40s” at year’s end and if that happens, “we could become bullish in the short term,” LaForge said.

The previous record close was Wednesday’s close of $46.33, while the previous all-time intraday high of $46.99 was reached on March 16. Don’t miss: Oracle leaps to record as cloud transition hits turning point. Oracle’s results prompted no less than 22 of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet to raise their stock-price targets. The new average target of $53.64 is 6.6% above current levels, and 11%, above the average target of $48.32 the day before the results were released. Analyst Steve Koenig at Wedbush Securities raised his price target to $56, which is 11.3% above current levels, from $44, which was 5% below Wednesday’s close of $46.33. That prompted Koenig to upgrade the stock to an outperform rating, after being at neutral since at least September 2014. Koenig said his new bullish outlook was based on improved software-as-a-service visibility, as Oracle’s applications business “gets over the ‘hump’ of its transition to cloud,” as well as to robust bookings activity and solid database licensing activity. He wrote in a note to clients that he sees potential for “sustained follow-through on positive price action as long-only investors adjust their [Oracle] weightings.” BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman boosted his stock price target to $57 from $48, citing one of Oracle’s “strongest quarters in years,” while J.P. Morgan’s Mark Murphy lifted his target to $55 from $51, saying he believes “this quarter will mark a turning point in investor sentiment.” Benchmark’s Yun Kim lifted the target to $62 from $55, saying the results indicate Oracle has reached the “critical scale” in its cloud business, making the stock “one of the best ways to play the current cloud computing trend.” Kim’s new target ties him with Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White for the second-highest on the Street, according to FactSet, just behind Wells Fargo’s Philip Winslow’s target of $62.50.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday as an influential U.S. Federal Reserve official expressed confidence that rising wages would help revive domestic inflation, which has shown signs of softening recently. The yen fell to two-week lows against the greenback and the euro after officials of the Bank of Japan at a meeting on Friday downplayed the likelihood that the bank would begin to roll back emergency stimulus to support the economy. Remarks by New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday that tightening in the labor market should help drive up inflation helped offset concerns by some investors that stubbornly low inflation would not allow policy-makers to raise rates further the rest of this year. “The Fed doesn’t seem to be too concerned about the recent pullback in the inflation data. They are committed to policy normalization,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Last week, the Fed, as expected, raised key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point and left the door open for another rate increase later this year. It also provided details on its plan to reduce its bond purchases in a bid to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent,” Dudley told a local business group in Plattsburg, New York. Traders raised their outlook on a rate hike by the Fed’s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting to 47 percent from 41 percent late on Friday FFZ7 FFF8, CME Group’s FedWatch tool showed. The dollar index .DXY, which gauges the dollar against six other currencies, was up 0.4 percent at 97.537. The euro was down 0.4 percent versus the greenback, to $1.1147 EUR=, while against the yen the dollar increased 0.5 percent, at 111.43 yen JPY=. The euro was up 0.1 percent against the yen, at 124.25 yen EURJPY=. Positioning data showed net bullish bets on the euro reached their highest level in more than six years last week. There was no discernible boost for the single currency from the landslide victory of French President Emmanuel Macron’s government in parliamentary elections on Sunday. Sterling declined 0.4 percent to $1.2732 GBP=D3 as Britain began formal negotiations on its planned exit from the European Union. The UK ruling Conservative Party’s loss of its parliament majority earlier this month raised speculation of a drift toward a “soft Brexit,” which had supported the pound. Many analysts, however, expect developments from the talks would hurt sterling. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s apparent “indifference” toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency’s power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the “cramming” of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a “conspicuous silence” on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short, “gossamer” memo “modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.” Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury’s hands for six months. The CFPB’s role as a public watchdog “extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,” Pauley wrote. “Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,” he added. “It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.” The CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office, which handled legal filings in the case, was reviewing the decision. In court papers, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley’s decision. Pauley has criticized government agencies before, including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research. The case is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v Sprint Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09931. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"June 15 (Reuters) - Metlife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, announced added responsibilities for some of its senior executives, adding to the pool of potential successors to its chief executive. The largest U.S. life insurer named Michel Khalaf president of its U.S. business, effective July 1, to replace Maria Morris who retires from the company this fall. Marty Lippert, the company’s head of global technology and operations will take on added responsibility of MetLife Holdings, the company said. The appointments of Khalaf and Lippert set up a “horse race” for MetLife’s CEO position, held by Steven Kandarian, 65, who currently has no plans to retire from his role, an analyst with Wells Fargo said in a note. Other potential candidates for the top job include Chief Financial Officer John Hele, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart, and Asia head Christopher Townsend, the note said. In June last year, Metlife’s board agreed to waive off its 65-year retirement policy for Kandarian, who has been the company’s president and CEO since May 2011. Ramy Tadros will also join MetLife in September as the new chief risk officer, the company said. Tadros comes from Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, where he served as the global head of insurance. He will replace Stan Talbi, who will retire at the end of August after 43 years with MetLife. (Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp said on Thursday it received U.S. approval for its emergency epinephrine syringes to treat severe allergic reactions that it intends to be a lower cost rival to Mylan NV’s widely used EpiPen, sending its shares up more than 50 percent. The company said it was looking for a marketing partner and would set a price for the product before its launch sometime in the second half of this year. Adamis said its pre-filled epinephrine syringes would be sold under the brand name Symjepi. Mylan has faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations after it doubled the cost for a pair of EpiPens to around $600, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing debate over the high cost of prescription medicines in the United States. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor. “We plan to position the product as a lower cost alternative,” Mark Flather, senior director for investor relations and corporate communications for Adamis, told Reuters. “We want to be part of the solution.” Epinephrine is the life-saving recommended treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications. Mylan has for years owned more than 90 percent of the market for emergency epinephrine injectors and its own authorized generic has recently surpassed sales of the branded version. “With an anticipated lower cost and attractive design, we believe Symjepi will be a meaningful competitor to EpiPen,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a research note. Other rival products are available. Impax Laboratories Inc’s Adrenaclick device is being sold through CVS Health Corp’s drugstore chain for about $110 a pair. Privately held Kaleo earlier this year began selling its Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector that it reacquired from Sanofi SA under an unusual pricing strategy but with little  success so far. The company said it would make the product available at no cost to many consumers but charge insurers $4,500. Sanofi in April sued Mylan, accusing it of engaging in illegal practices to squash EpiPen competition when the French drugmaker held the Auvi-Q rights. Adamis shares soared 53.3 percent to close at $5.75 on the Nasdaq and further rose to $6.00 in extended trading. Mylan shares closed down 2.4 percent at $36.98. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - London-based startup Blockchain has raised $40 million (31.5 million pounds) in a fresh round of funding as the software company rides a wave of enthusiasm for digital currency technology. Nokota Management and Digital Currency Group also participated in the financing round, which boosted Blockchain’s total funding to more than $70 million Tom Hulme, general partner at Alphabet’s venture firm GV, said the firm invested because “the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched.” Founded in 2011, Blockchain makes software that allows consumers and businesses to make transactions using digital currencies such as bitcoin. The firm is named after the internet platform that records and validates transactions between two parties without relying on an intermediary such as a bank. Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product. “Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,” Smith said. “My grandmother uses our product today.” The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage of an annual stress test, showing they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession to meet regulatory requirements, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed’s most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year’s level. “This year’s results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,” said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank. “This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.” The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations. Wall Street analysts and trade groups quickly cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis. “We see today’s...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,” said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent. “From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,” he said. Thursday’s results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed’s methodology, using materials they submitted. The second portion of the test, to be released on Wednesday, will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks’ capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed’s. Under the Fed’s worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. However, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks’ aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more of its stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed’s approval. Under the Fed’s examination, Citi’s minimum CET1 ratio in the most stressful scenario was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Citi’s own analysis showed that metric at 10 percent. The Fed’s assessment showed the other five largest banks - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley - having minimum CET1 ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent. Of those, Goldman Sachs had the biggest optimism gap compared with the Fed when it came to the worst-case scenario. Its model produced a 9.8 percent minimum CET1 ratio, 1.4 points better than the Fed’s. Wells Fargo’s metric also fared better in its own test than under the Fed’s, by 0.8 of a point. Conversely, JPMorgan’s analysis appeared to be more dour, with its CET1 ratio coming in 1.3 percentage points below the Fed’s. Bank of America’s was 0.7 of a point worse. Banks that decide to resubmit their plans can only make downward revisions to the amount of capital they plan to use, meaning management teams that were too conservative may regret their submissions even if they pass. “If there is disappointment next week,” said Seiberg, “it is likely because the banks failed to ask for big enough distributions more than it is because the Federal Reserve was too tough.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - It took less than 24 hours for Warren Buffett, one of the world’s savviest dealmakers, to make a C$360 million (US$272 million) paper profit by propping up a major Canadian lender on life support. “It’s a typical Buffett bailout trade,” said Jared Dillian, an independent investment strategist and former trader betting the value of the Canadian dollar and several Canadian banks will fall. “He’s set it up where he’s risking a small amount to make a lot.” Its share price soared 27.2 percent on Thursday to C$19.00, leaving Buffett with a potential 90 percent paper profit on shares he is buying for just C$10 each. Home Capital’s share price nonetheless remains nearly two-thirds below its 2014 peak. “The deal is really low risk,” said John Huber, a portfolio manager at Saber Capital Management LLC in Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns Berkshire stock. “It’s an opportunistic deal that gives him very attractive risk-return terms.” Berkshire’s infusion was much needed by Home Capital, which has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run after being accused of, and then admitting to, concealing mortgage fraud. “The assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving,” said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst. “It implies a seal of approval.” Berkshire’s investment lets Buffett deploy some of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills. “Today’s announcement is a modest positive,” wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst. “But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.” Berkshire’s Columbia Insurance unit is acquiring the Home Capital equity, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, the credit line, if fully tapped, could generate C$180 million for Berkshire. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. His $5 billion Bank of America bet looks particularly savvy: it throws off $300 million in annual dividends, and Berkshire is sitting on an $11 billion gain on accompanying warrants. But with most of those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to requests for further comment. Home Capital’s problems accelerated in mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. “Reputational risk is why he’s getting 9 percent interest” at Home Capital, Seifert said. Berkshire has other investments tied to real estate, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. It also has several investments in Canada, including the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, for which it paid about $C3.1 billion in 2014. Many of Berkshire’s more than 90 business units also offer goods and services in the country, including the Ben Bridge jeweler, Benjamin Moore paints and the BNSF railroad. Despite his paper profit on Home Capital, Buffett believes investment gains and losses in a given period are usually meaningless. Buffett’s foray into Canadian real estate comes amid uncertainty about that country’s housing sector. The Ontario government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is “not going to stop the credit cycle up there,” said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital. “But it’s a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Youth tobacco use in the United States fell to historic lows in 2016, leading public health experts to speculate that a smoke-free generation may be within reach. The number of middle and high school students who used any tobacco product fell to 3.9 million in 2016 from 4.7 million in 2015, figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show, the first such decline since the CDC began reporting the measure in 2011. The number of high school students who smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior to being surveyed fell to 8 percent from 9.3 percent in 2015, the data shows. In 2011 the number was 15.8 percent. “This represents a historic public health victory,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, adding that the dramatic decline was the result of public messaging campaigns directed at youth. The decline in e-cigarette use was even greater, falling to 11.3 percent of high schoolers in 2016 from 16 percent in 2015. “These numbers are astounding,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the department of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health. “It really means that we may be within reach of a smoke-free generation.” The decline in cigarette use follows a broad array of public health campaigns and coincides with the rise of vaping. “This should put to bed any remaining concerns that e-cigarettes are a gateway to cigarettes or will lead to a re-normalization of smoking,” Siegel said. Between 2011 and 2016 overall tobacco use remained unchanged, the CDC’s figures show, though the balance between products changed. As e-cigarette use increased, traditional cigarette use declined. Cigarette use among high school students fell during that period to 8 percent from 15.8 percent while use of cigars fell to 7.7 percent from 11.6 percent. At the same time use of e-cigarettes rose to 11.3 percent from 1.5 percent and use of hookahs rose to 4.8 percent from 4.1 percent. President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes a nearly 20 percent drop in the CDC’s disease prevention and health promotion programs, including eliminating dedicated funding for its Office on Smoking and Health. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement that while the latest figures were encouraging “it is critical that we work to ensure this downward trend continues over the long term across all tobacco products.” He said the agency had issued more than 4,000 warning letters to retailers for selling e-cigarettes, cigars or hookah tobacco to minors since youth access restrictions went into effect last August. Gottlieb, who previously held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, has said publicly that certain e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. The latest data showed no decline in cigarette use among middle school students, where the rate was 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2015. Among middle school students, 4.3 percent used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 5.3 percent in 2015. Analysts with Wells Fargo Securities expect sales of vaping products to reach $4.4 billion in 2017.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters Health) - Tobacco companies have been selling electronic cigarettes as a way to wean smokers off paper cigarettes, but a new study suggests the strategy could backfire. The report in Preventive Medicine found that young adults who occasionally smoked conventional cigarettes smoked more of them if they also used e-cigarettes – battery-powered gadgets that heat liquid nicotine into vapor. “The participants who were vaping ended up using more cigarettes. It’s actually a risk factor for increasing their cigarette use,” lead author Neal Doran said in a phone interview. “They’re not using e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking,” said Doran, a psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Though smokers have been turning to e-cigarettes since they came on the market in 2007 as a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco, little is known about the long-term effects of the practice known as “vaping.” E-cigarette use grew 900 percent among high school students from 2011 through 2015, according to a report from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The 2016 report declares e-cigarettes “unsafe” for youth and young adults (bit.ly/2sKHv9P). The new study’s findings are “consistent with the worry that, regardless of whether vaping is itself unsafe, vaping causes worse outcomes because it leads to more consumption of cigarettes,” Doran said. Stanton Glantz, who directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the study “has tremendous policy implications.” “What this study shows very convincingly is that if they’re using e-cigarettes it’s actually leading them to smoke more conventional cigarettes, not less,” he said. Glantz was not involved with the new study, but the findings are consistent with those of previous research he conducted on adolescents. “The e-cigarettes are having the effect of stimulating conventional cigarette smoking,” he said in a phone interview. “They’re propping up and reinforcing the conventional cigarette market.” Doran and his team studied 319 Californians, ages 18 to 24. At the start, participants did not smoke daily but had smoked at least one cigarette in the prior six months. During the study, they reported their frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use five times at three-month intervals. Those who vaped more also reported smoking 18 percent more cigarettes, the study found. “In the larger scheme of things, e-cigarettes could be good, bad or neutral,” Doran said. “I don’t think we know the answers yet. This is one of the ways in which they could be bad – by people increasing their cigarette use if they’re using both.” Dual users may be exposed to more nicotine and wind up at risk for chronic tobacco use and dependence, the authors write. Previous studies have shown that e-cigarette use increases the risk of smoking tobacco-filled cigarettes. Some prior studies suggest that e-cigarette vapor may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke. But electronic alternatives nonetheless release potentially hazardous chemicals. Sales of vaping products are expected to reach $4.4 billion this year, according to Wells Fargo Securities analysts. With flavors like bubble gum and chocolate peanut butter cup, e-cigarettes or vape pens are often packaged to appeal to youth, who experts believe are more vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering banning flavored tobacco products. Residents opposed to the legislation recently argued that e-cigarettes help them smoke less. But, Glantz said, “This paper shows exactly the opposite is true.” Numbers released this month from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing declines in youth use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes have led some to claim that as proof of the benefits of vaping. But Doran and Glantz don’t see it that way. Instead, Glantz said he views the smoking decreases as evidence of efforts to educate youth about the potential harms of e-cigarettes as well as the results of efforts to regulate e-cigarettes with clean-indoor air laws and minimum-age requirements. States and local jurisdictions have imposed a patchwork of laws pertaining to the use of electronic cigarettes, and some states, including California, now tax vape products. “There’s this Wild West atmosphere with e-cigarettes, and there’s a lot of controversy and disagreement about whether they’re good or bad,” Doran said. “If they’re harmless, and they help people quit, then they’re great. If they make it harder to quit and also encourage people to smoke cigarettes who would not have smoked otherwise, then they’re terrible,” he said. “The truth probably lies in the middle, but where exactly is the key question.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tscS56 and bit.ly/2rBKmg8 Preventive Medicine, online June 3, 2017.

Of course, taking exposure in this controversial industry isn't for everyone, especially if loved ones have paid the price for nicotine addiction. However, buying shares of a company isn't the same thing is supporting their business practices, and it's our job to seek out superior returns wherever we can find them. Strong Asian growth now drives industry profits, along with a resurgence in U.S. consumption triggered by modern vaporizer technology. In addition, the current administration has plans to strip away regulations across a broad swath of industries, making it unlikely that producers will get singled out for criticism in coming years. Given these tailwinds, tobacco stocks are likely to perform well into the next decade. (For more, check out: Back From the Dead: Why Tobacco Stocks Are Soaring.) Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) carries the highest sector capitalization for tobacco producers trading on the U.S. exchanges at $184 billion. It spun off from parent Altria Group, Inc. (MO) at $50 in March 2008 and entered an immediate downtrend that posted an all-time low at $32.04 in March 2009. The subsequent recovery wave reached the upper $90s in 2013, giving way to a multi-year correction that found support in the mid-$70s. The stock rallied above the prior high in 2016 and stalled out, building a base on new support and then spiraling lower in November. That marked the washout low, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reinstated the breakout in January 2017, followed by a powerful trend advance to an all-time high at $122.90 on June 6. Philip Morris stock has been pulling back in a bull flag pattern since that time, while daily stochastics have dropped into the oversold zone. (See also: Philip Morris, the Best Is Yet to Come: Wells Fargo.) Both monthly and weekly indicators have held buy cycles through this period, signaling a bullish divergence and potential pullback buying opportunity ahead of continued upside. Even so, a more advantageous trade entry might come if aggressive sellers break short-term support and knock the stock down to the top of the first quarter range and 50-day EMA at $115. Altria Group expanded into spirits and finance leasing services following the Philip Morris spin-off,​ but tobacco remains its biggest profit component. It fell just 7 points during the 2008 economic collapse, returning to the prior high in 2010, ahead of a 2011 breakout that reached $70.14 in July 2016. A pullback into the fourth quarter settled near $60, ahead of a January 2017 rally into March's all-time high at $76.54. (See also: Altria Optimistic on FDA's Filing of Heated Products.) Altria Group shares sold off into May, testing new support near $70 and turning higher into June, settling into a narrow platform that traded within 60 cents of resistance this week. On-balance volume (OBV) has already risen to a new high, highlighting strong institutional sponsorship that should support a fresh rally leg into the low $80s, where a two-year rising-highs trendline could trigger another reversal. Reynolds American Inc (RAI) rallied above the 2008 high in 2011 and entered a rising channel that accelerated into a steeper channel in 2014, highlighting impressive relative strength. The uptrend stalled near $50 at the end of 2015, giving way to a shallow correction that ended with a high-volume October gap to a new high in the mid-$50s. It took three months to clear the high posted in that session, yielding a long series of new highs into last week. (For more, see: Reynolds Announces Leadership Roles Post Acquisition by BAT.) The stock sold off with the broad market, dropping into the first test at the 50-day EMA since January, and it is still testing that level. Weekly stochastics fell into an unconfirmed sell cycle in reaction to the decline, raising odds for an intermediate correction lasting a minimum of eight to 12 weeks. Given this scenario, a pullback into deep support at $50 could offer a buying opportunity. Tobacco manufacturers and distributors are leading the broad market, resistant to broad headwinds facing other high-yielding instruments. This resilience could last into the new decade, given humankind's addictive interest in the controversial crop.

What about a technology company? That sounds crazy, right? Or does it? Don't believe me; look at the makeup of the Financial Select Sectors SPDR ETF (XLF) and see the top 25 holdings: There's no Visa. Yeah, it is a company with a market cap of almost $220 billion, bigger than that of Citigroup (C), but it's not in the top 25 of the financials. So if it's not a financial, then what is it? Well, of course, Visa is a tech company! Just look at the Technology Select Sector XLK SPDR (XLK), and there it is: Visa with 3.38 percent weighting in the ETF. By the way, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is also there, with a 2.21 percent weighting. Incredible, right? How come Visa and Mastercard are technology companies while American Express is a financial company? There's a simple answer: The three companies are fundamentally different in a significant way. Visa is an electronic payment network, while American Express issues cards and takes on the debt of its cardholders. Fundamentally, banks and financials depend for the most part on interest rates because when banks lend money, they charge a rate of interest. When rates are low they make less money, and when rates rise they make more money. Currently, interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve all go to a bank's ability to make money. Visa is dependent on how many transactions are occurring on its network charging a fee for the use of the network. Financials also have default risks associated with them that a company like Visa does not. Because banks and financials hold the debts of their cardholders, there is a risk the cardholder will not pay those debts and default on them, resulting in a loss for the card issuer. Again, for a company such as Visa, those risks are not present. Visa's biggest risk would be declining usage of its network.

Jeff Cox,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for the ouster of 12 board members at Wells Fargo due to the fake accounts scandal that has rocked the bank. In a letter sent Monday to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, the Massachusetts Democrat said the scandal has ""revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices."" Warren said the central bank has the authority under federal statute to remove the members who were on the board as the matter transpired. ""We have received the letter and plan to respond,"" a Fed spokesman told CNBC. In an agreement with multiple authorities last September, Wells agreed to pay a $185 million fine in conjunction with a scandal in which some 2 million client accounts were created without the customers' knowledge. More accounts may be involved, according to subsequent allegations. Even after paying the fine, Wells has continued to undergo reputational damage amid congressional inquiries and additional disclosures Warren, who has been a harsh critic, pointed out in the letter multiple instances where she believes the board at Wells failed customers. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices — problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Wells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo shares gained about 1.1 percent in early trading, about in line with the sector. Warren did not limit her criticism to Wells — she also said the Fed ""has done nothing to date"" to punish the bank ""despite its ample statutory authority."" ""I urge you to use the tools Congress has given you to remove the responsible board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country's largest banks,"" she wrote. The scandal arose as bank employees sought to meet aggressive sales demands. Employees would enroll customers in various programs without their consent in order to make quotas that have since been disbanded. Some 5,300 employees have been terminated as a result, and the bank also has a new CEO, Timothy J. Sloan, who took over for John Stumpf. For the Fed to act, it would need to establish that any individual board member's actions were unsafe or unsound to the bank. The Fed likely would need to initiate an enforcement action and prove its case. Yellen told Congress during testimony shortly after the scandal broke in September that the Fed is reviewing all operations for large banks and believes that in cases of wrongdoing, ""senior management (should) be held accountable.""

Antony Currie,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wells Fargo is driving its stagecoach further into the mud. The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers' mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right. The actions at issue might seem to help struggling borrowers: Wells Fargo lowered some customers' monthly mortgage payments, potentially making them manageable. But there are two huge potential problems. First, the bank did this while also extending the duration of the loans – in one case by some 30 years. That greatly increased the total interest borrowers were on the hook to pay over the life of their loans. Second, Wells Fargo made these changes, according to the lawsuits, without getting the consent of either the customers or the relevant bankruptcy courts. Wells Fargo denies this, saying it notified customers and does ""not finalize a loan modification without receiving signed documents"" from the required parties. The trouble is, Wells Fargo has mucked up mortgage lending and modification in the past. It was one of the five lenders that in 2012 agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government and 49 states to rectify poor loan servicing and foreclosure practices. Last year it forked over $1.2 billion to settle claims of reckless lending under a Federal Housing Administration program. Home loans should have been squeaky-clean after all that. Add to that its recent $185 million fine after retail bankers chasing aggressive account-opening targets created 2 million fake bank and credit-card accounts – events that cost former Chief Executive John Stumpf his job – and there's a sense of a bank still not ensuring it has fundamental checks and balances in place. Wells Fargo isn't alone. The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 exposed the many failings of the financial-services industry. For now, though, most of its big rivals appear to have put the worst of their transgressions behind them. Sloan's shop keeps swerving into new ones.

Tae Kim,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wall Street is increasingly worried over the future growth opportunities for the two best-performing stocks in the market during the past year.Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD shares are both down significantly in recent days. Nvidia declined more than 5 percent over the past week through midday Thursday, while AMD fell 12 percent in that time period.The Nvidia decline was in part sparked by a negative Citron Research report on Nvidia Friday.""Take your profits and move on to Google (Alphabet). Exposure to the identical array of 'sexy businesses' with less risk on the downside,"" Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a post entitled ""NVIDIA: The Moment that Separates the Gamblers from the Investors. NVDA to Trade back to $130."" Left cited competition coming from Intel, Google and Xilinx in the data center markets and the likelihood of slowing growth in its gaming graphics card business as reasons for his skeptical view on Nvidia's market value.Wells Fargo is also concerned over rising competition in Nvidia's data center business. The firm reiterated its underperform rating on the company Wednesday.""We think that Nvidia has done very well in establishing itself as the dominant provider of standalone accelerator solutions for data center, but believe that this is already reflected in Nvidia's stock value,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Wong wrote in a note to clients. ""Over time we think additional providers of standalone accelerators might emerge, helping to drive growth in the standalone processor market but reducing Nvidia's market share in this market.""Even with the move lower, Nvidia shares have rallied 218 percent through midday Thursday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 17 percent return. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. AMD is right behind at No. 2 with a 156 percent return in the same time period. In similar fashion to the negative Nvidia notes, Goldman Sachs told investors to sell AMD shares Monday, questioning whether the recent cryptocurrency-driven demand for the company's graphics cards will last. ""According to our checks, the RX 570 and RX 580 graphics cards are sold out at numerous retail websites including NewEgg and Microcenter. While this dynamic may provide near-term upside to fundamentals, we believe [cryptocurrency mining] is unlikely to become a sustainable driver of EPS,"" Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in the note to clients.Nvidia declined to comment on the Citron and Wells Fargo reports. An AMD spokesperson responded to the Goldman report by email: ""When we outlined our growth strategy at our financial analyst day earlier this quarter we didn't highlight cryptocurrency market as one of the drivers of growth for the business.""

The complaint details that Heiser became concerned about company practices after news broke about Wells Fargo employees opening deposit and credit card accounts without customer consent in order to meet sales goals. Heiser estimated that alleged unauthorized fees by people ""who had a personal incentive to add services or lines to customer accounts"" amounted to ""many millions"" of dollars.

"Sumit Roy, ETF.com",06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Who would have thought that on the day  the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark federal funds rate for the third time in six months, interest rates across the curve would plunge? But that's exactly what happened on Wednesday, confounding many analysts who predicted higher long-term rates. The Fed made its widely expected move, raising its overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent, keying off data that showed the U.S. economy at full employment and growing steadily. The central bank's upgraded ""dot plot,"" which maps where central bank officials see rates headed in the future, suggests that another rate hike could be coming later this year. More from ETF.com:Tech ETFs retreat: Pullback aheadHere's what advisors are worried aboutMuni ETFs: No summer vacation But at least for now, the bond market doesn't care. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped by 8 basis points to 2.13 percent after briefly touching 2.1 percent earlier on Wednesday, its lowest level of 2017 (bond prices and yields move inversely). U.S. 10-Year Treasury Bond Yield In turn, many bond ETFs, such as the $46 billion iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), hit their highest levels of the year. AGG is now up 2.8 percent, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is up 4.6 percent; and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) is up 7.1 percent. Those numbers are particularly impressive considering this was supposed to be a bad year for bonds based on the consensus expectation at the start of 2017. YTD Returns For AGG, LQD, TLT According to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, the moves in bond prices on Wednesday may have less to do with the Fed rate hike than a pair of tepid economic data points released on the same day. Early in the day, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell by 0.1 percent in May, while its core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices) only grew by 0.1 percent, below the 0.2 percent increase that was anticipated. That translates into year-over-year growth of 1.9 percent for the headline CPI and 1.7 percent for the core CPI ― both below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target ― and the lowest reading for the core in two years. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in May sagged by 0.3 percent, much worse than the zero change that was expected and the largest decline in 16 months. ""The data that came out on Wednesday showing a slowdown in inflation and contraction in retail sales has made people question whether the Fed will hike as aggressively as previously thought,"" explained Jacobsen. ""The big move in 10-year yields came around the same time as the CPI and retail sales data came out. Weak consumer spending and slowing inflation means the terminal rate for the federal funds rate may be well below what the Fed's aiming for,"" he added. Perhaps the fall in the 10-year yield shouldn't have been surprising. There's been a familiar pattern in recent years where investors anticipate that rates will finally take off as the economy improves, only to see them come back down as data disappoints. In fact, despite all the hand-wringing about rising rates ever since the Fed embarked on the current tightening cycle in late 2015, it turns out that the 10-year yield is actually lower today than it was when the central bank made its first hike. Currently, the 10-year yield stands at 2.13 percent compared with 2.30 percent on Dec. 16, 2015. Even the five-year yield is lower, at 1.73 percent currently, compared with 1.75 percent on the day of the first hike. Wells Fargo's Jacobsen says that for anyone who's been waiting for higher interest rates to invest in bonds, now may be the time to throw in the towel. ""It could feel like a bus that never shows up if you're waiting for yields to spike higher. If you've been sitting in cash and waiting for yields to rise before getting back to your strategic allocation to fixed income, you may want to start dollar cost averaging toward your target,"" he explained. Equities have taken these lower rates in stride. The S&P 500 remains in record-high territory amid record-low volatility. Investors aren't interpreting lower rates as a bad thing, except for perhaps financials, which is now the second-worst-performing stock market sector behind energy. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up 5.3 percent this year, well behind the 9 percent gain for the broader S&P 500. ""Financials have been hurt by the flattening yield curve,"" Jacobsen noted. ""That doesn't look to be getting any better anytime soon. If the Fed talks up another rate hike before the inflation data actually turns, I'd worry about the Fed being too far ahead of the curve rather than too far behind it.""

Evelyn Cheng,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"MSCI said Tuesday it plans to add 222 China A Large Cap stocks to its benchmark emerging markets index on a gradual basis beginning next year. This was the fourth-straight year MSCI was considering adding the mainland-traded stocks. In a long awaited decision, MSCI said Tuesday it plans to add mainland Chinese shares to its benchmark emerging markets index. The index giant said it will add 222 China A Large Cap stocks on a gradual basis beginning next year.  The review is the fourth straight year MSCI has considered adding the mainland-traded stocks, known as A shares in China. ""International investors have embraced the positive changes in the accessibility of the China A shares market over the last few years and now all conditions are set for MSCI to proceed with the first step of the inclusion,"" Remy Briand, MSCI Managing Director and Chairman of the MSCI Index Policy Committee, said in a release. ""The expansion of Stock Connect has been a game changer for the market opening of China A shares,"" he said, referring to a program giving foreign investors access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets through Hong Kong. The Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) traded more than 2 percent higher after hours. The 222 stocks MSCI is planning to add to the emerging markets index include financial giants like Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, Guotai Junan and Ping An Insurance, according to a document on MSCI's website. Other names include Tsingtao Brewery, SAIC Motor, Suning Commerce and Spring Airlines. Another change for China this time ""is the reduction in the number of suspended stocks since the decline in the market. So there's less control and more availability in the shares,"" MSCI chairman and CEO Henry Fernandez said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""And three, the loosening of restrictions on the data in order to create index-linking investment vehicles."" MSCI also said, contrary to many expectations, Argentina's stocks would not join the emerging markets index due to investor concerns that recent improvements to market access needed to be in place for a longer period. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) rose 0.15 percent in after-hours trade. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is tracked by an estimated $1.6 trillion in assets, as of the end of June last year. The addition of the mainland Chinese shares could be a big boost to the world's second-largest stock market, which has until now drawn limited foreign investor interest because of high volatility, frequent trading halts and limited foreign investor access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. ""Institutional investors have more confidence in China's A share market today,"" said Peter Donisanu, investment strategy analyst Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The Shanghai composite is up 1.2 percent year-to-date, in contrast to gains of more than 18 percent for the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM). The S&P 500 is up more than 9 percent this year at record highs. MSCI also said next year, it would consider Saudi Arabia stocks for potential inclusion in the Emerging Markets Index.

Brian Price,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"With bullion recently hitting a three-week low of $1,257, one commodities trader is adamant that the charts are signaling sunshine on the horizon for gold bugs. Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services, is undeterred by what's been a volatile June for gold as he believes the commodity will enter into a long-term uptrend swing. ""I'm a longer-term bull in gold and if you look at the long-term chart the trend is still higher,"" Iuorio said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""What the Fed said yesterday is disconcerting to the market, and that's why the dollar rallied so hard."" The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for only the fourth time since the financial crisis, which was expected. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen took a decisively more hawkish tone despite the fact that inflation has fallen behind estimates. Iuorio feels deteriorating data will soon pull dollar prices down and, if gold stays above $1,235, then the longer trend is ultimately positive for the yellow metal. Historically, the dollar and gold are inversely correlated as a fall in dollar prices increases the value of other currencies. Such a move drives demand for commodities, like gold, as investors seek alternative assets to invest in. However, Iuorio warned that more hawkish rhetoric could indeed deter his thesis. ""I'm going to be wrong if they keep that talk up,"" the trader said. ""Gold's going to go lower. If it settles below $1,230, that's going to change me into a bear."" That said, Iuorio doesn't believe the Fed can continue with its hawkish tone and therefore feels confident in where gold prices are heading. Lastly, another factor for gold prices in the near term could be India. Bob Iaccino, of Path Trading Partners, noted on ""Futures Now"" that a tax on the precious metal is slated to go into effect at the end of the month in that country. This could cause local jewelers and private citizens to rush into the market and purchase gold in bulk before the tax comes into play, which would also help drive prices higher. Gold settled 1.5 percent lower on Thursday. The bond market's year in decline could round out with some relief, according to Bank of America's chartist.

Annie Pei,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Crude officially entered a bear market with Tuesday's drop, and one technical strategist is seeing another 30 percent drop in the commodity. On CNBC's ""Futures Now"" Tuesday, Paul Ciana of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that based on the charts, oil is well on its way to dropping to the $30 range, levels unseen since last April. ""It just keeps going down, breaking supports and failing at lower resistance levels,"" said Ciana. ""It's the absolute definition of a downtrend."" But on the same chart of oil, Ciana also pointed out that the crude crush could actually be signaling a rally in the bond market. A note released by BofAML on Tuesday, titled ""Bonds smile as oil cries,"" remarked on the inverse moves between crude and bonds that has been occurring over the past years. According to Ciana, the inverse relationship is playing out once again ""on an even larger scale,"" meaning that if crude continues to fall, bonds could soar even higher. ""Bond prices have risen to exceed the peak of [that double bottom this year, confirming] that the U.S. 10-year yield will likely fall to 1.97 percent this summer, if not sooner,"" he explained. Additionally, stocks could also be in trouble if crude falls. While Ciana doesn't see oil being a direct cause of a downturn in the market, depending on ""how much more the decline accelerates"" in crude, it could intensify any drop that may happen. And the outlook for crude on a fundamental basis isn't too positive, as Ciana also points out that demand for crude may fall during the summer.With Tuesday's drop, oil prices have now sunk 19 percent year to date, largely thanks to supply issues related to OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Ciana does see $45.50 being a key level to reach and hold for oil, meaning that the commodity would need to rally 4 percent for some of the concerns to subside.

Elizabeth Warren hates big banks. But none more so than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Her displeasure with the California-based bank is understandable given that Wells Fargo spent the last decade and a half opening fake accounts for customers in order to artificially inflate its performance and thereby maximize its executives' annual bonuses. The latest example of Warren's ire was on display Monday, when she sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen calling for the removal of 12 members of Wells Fargo's board of directors -- for the record, that'd leave only three. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote, according to CNBC, which first reported on the letter. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices -- problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Senator Elizabeth Warren. Image source: Senator Warren's official website. Wells Fargo's executives deserve the blame and vitriol that have been heaped on them since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed the scam last year. While they make millions of dollars a year, the customers they preyed on were among the most vulnerable citizens in the country -- retirees living on fixed incomes and recent immigrants. To make matters worse, the company then retaliated against employees who sought to blow the whistle on the scam. Under the watch of Wells Fargo's executives and the board's oversight, the 160-year-old bank's once-sterling reputation has been deeply sullied. Given this, it's hard to disagree with Warren's assessment of Wells Fargo. The board was ultimately responsible for policing these types of risks and behaviors. The fact that they didn't, and that the scam was in many ways an indispensable element of Wells Fargo's business model, is prima facie evidence that they bear culpability for it. At the same time, one might find it worth acknowledging that Wells Fargo's directors were deceived in a sense, too. Prior to the fallout, the board's principal liaison with the bank's operating committee was John Stumpf, who at the time, though no longer, was both its chairman and CEO. As the company wrote in its 2015 proxy statement: Mr. Stumpf, with over 33 years of experience at Wells Fargo, has the knowledge, expertise, and experience to understand and clearly articulate to the Board the opportunities and risks facing the Company, as well as the leadership and management skills to promote and execute the Company's vision, values and strategy. The Board believes that Mr. Stumpf, rather than an outside director, is in the best position, as Chairman and CEO, to lead Board discussions regarding the Company's business and strategy and to help the Board respond quickly and effectively to the many business, market, and regulatory reform issues affecting the Company and the rapidly changing financial services industry. This description is laughable in hindsight, but Stumpf and his predecessor Dick Kovacevich had purposefully cultivated such a pristine image by then that few people would have questioned them. Image source: The Motley Fool. There's also value to keeping some of these directors around. They made an enormous and egregious mistake, but one can hope that they learned a lesson in their failure to perform their oversight duties. And that lesson, if it indeed has been learned, could very well make Wells Fargo a stronger organization. That may or may not be a fair assessment, but assuming that it is, there's value to their continued presence on the board. It's like the story of Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, who learned of an employee's mistake that cost the company $1 million. Watson not only refused to fire the employee, but he even rejected the employee's letter of resignation. ""Fire you?"" Watson responded. ""I've just invested one million dollars in your education.""

Image source: Getty Images. The fundamental challenge facing the banking industry is that the core product is a commodity. At its most basic level, every bank offers the same standard bank account, car loan, mortgage, and so on. Thus a bank's ability to provide other services and features that keep their customers coming back is paramount to retaining deposits and making profitable loans. Below, we'll explore the nine banks ranked most highly on customer loyalty as measured by Brand Keys, from first to the worst. Image source: Company. The largest bank by assets in the United States, JPMorgan has its hands in virtually everything related to banking and finance. The company boasts that it has a relationship with 60 million households in the United States. Its Chase credit card unit scores highly among everyday spenders and the affluent alike, receiving high marks for rewards and customer service, which gives it the No. 1 position in cards. Image source: Company. Unlike the others in the Big Four U.S. banks, Citi is really a global banking institution. It operates out of the world's largest metropolitan areas and has only a modest presence in smaller cities in the U.S. Yet it has remarkable reach into consumer spending through its credit cards business, which recently won a partnership with Costco, giving it the ability to tap into the wallets of the wholesale retailers' 53 million members with its highly rated Costco co-brand card. Customers love its cards' Price Rewind feature, which enables its cardholders to get a refund automatically when a product is advertised at a lower price within 60 days after purchase. Image source: Company. When Brian Moynihan took the job as Bank of America's chief executive officer, he made the customer experience paramount in rebuilding the bank's image -- and its profitability. Bank of America has invested heavily in its mobile and online banking services to improve customer satisfaction even as it has reduced the number of branches across the United States. The investment has paid off handsomely in the form of increased customer loyalty and approval ratings. Customers processed 108 million checks through the mobile app versus 170 million deposits in one of its branches last year. The bank brought private banking services to all of its clients with a banking-by-appointment feature so that its customers never have to wait in line to speak to a representative. Image source: Company. Bank of New York is hardly a traditional bank. It operates as a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides the back-end accounting services to keep everything running smoothly. Custody banks have inherently loyal customers due to the fact that moving billions of dollars of assets to another custodian is no easy task, and because the bank benefits from scale that enables it to manage its customers' assets at a price other banks would struggle to match. Image source: Company. Like Bank of America, PNC is ahead of the curve in creating products that are more convenient for customers while being more profitable for the bank. Thanks to investments in its online and mobile banking products, it recently reported that 60% of its customers use its ""non-teller channels"" for the majority of their transactions, up from 40% just three years ago. Its Virtual Wallet service enables its customers to make a budget, manage bills with the help of a calendar, and quickly see how they spend each and every dollar that flows into their accounts. Image source: Company. Once a pure-play credit card issuer, Capital One has become a bona fide banking operation that offers everything from checking and savings accounts to auto loans and even commercial banking services. The bank made inroads with consumers when it acquired ING Direct in 2011, which brought the bank more than 7 million customers who used its online banking services. Capital One has built on its ING Direct acquisition with an online banking service that its customers love -- a recent presentation notes that its mobile applications score the highest ratings in the iOS App Store. The bank also offers some of the highest-yielding money market accounts of any bank on this list, which certainly helps to keep its customers' loyalty. Image source: Company. Once known as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC is a worldwide banking operation that operates primarily as a corporate bank and credit card issuer in the United States. The company makes its ""internationally minded"" customers its priority through HSBC Premier, which provides banking and wealth management services to the mass affluent who live in large cities spanning from Seattle to New York City. With 2.4 million customers in the U.S., it has the smallest domestic operation of any of the banks on this list, given its focus on wealthier, international customers. Image source: Company. Calling itself ""America's Most Convenient Bank,"" TD Bank provides retail banking services to 9 million customers through approximately 1,300 branches along the East Coast. Its TD Select Savings Account offers free ATM services and reimburses customers for ATM fees charged at non-TD ATMs around the country. The company has mastered campaigns designed to promote customer loyalty, famously turning its ATMs into ""Automated Thanking Machines"" to deliver gifts to its customers -- cash, a trip to Trinidad to see a family member, and a unique experience throwing out a first pitch at a Blue Jays home game, for example. Image source: Company. Known colloquially as ""America's largest community bank,"" Wells Fargo has always operated as a simple retail banking institution. Convenience is key to customer loyalty, and Wells Fargo has the largest retail branch network of any U.S. bank, providing service to its customers through 6,200 banking locations and 12,000 ATMs scattered from coast to coast. Thanks to its large mortgage servicing business, it also has a relationship with millions of homeowners who aren't located near one of its branches. ","

If you follow bank stocks and big bank stocks, in particular, you should get acquainted with the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks. I refer to it frequently when I write, and therefore want to give readers a brief overview of exactly what it is, and why investors should care about it. The best way to think about the KBW Bank Index is to analogize it to the S&P 500, which tracks shares of 500 publicly traded companies with the largest market capitalizations in the United States. But instead of being industry agnostic, as the S&P 500 is, the KBW Bank Index focuses on only large-cap banks -- 24 of them, to be precise. These are banks that you've no doubt heard of, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). These are the four biggest banks in the country. They're also -- with the exception of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), the best-run big bank in the country -- the four that are weighted most heavily on the KBW Bank Index. The index weights its components according to a measure of market capitalization, adjusted for a bank's share price. This helps to explain why, as you can see in the table below, Citigroup carries the greatest weight on the Index, even though it has a smaller market capitalization than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, respectively. Name Weight on KBW Bank Index Citigroup 8.82% Bank of America 7.85% JPMorgan Chase 7.83% US Bancorp 7.83% Wells Fargo 7.68% State Street 4.54% Bank of New York Mellon 4.30% Northern Trust 4.03% PNC Financial 3.97% M&T Bank 3.97% SunTrust Banks 3.87% KeyCorp 3.81% BB&T 3.76% Fifth Third 3.63% Citizens Financial 3.52% Capital One 3.48% Regions Financial 3.30% First Republic Bank 2.86% Huntington Bancshares 2.75% Comerica 2.47% SVB Financial 1.80% Zions Bancorporation 1.65% New York Community Bancorp 1.25% People's United Financial 1.06% Source: Invesco. There's one side note that's worth pointing out when it comes to the KBW Bank Index. That is, not all of these banks have the same business model. Some are universal banks, which operate both investment and commercial-banking operations. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup fall most comfortably into this category. A second group consists of so-called custodial or trust banks. The three banks on the list that most naturally fall into this category are State Street, Northern Trust, and Bank of New York Mellon -- and I consider the latter to be a particularly interesting bank. These banks focus less on making loans and taking deposits and more on the administration of fixed-income securities for institutional investors like hedge funds, university endowments, and insurance companies. The final group are pure-play commercial banks, specializing in taking deposits and making loans. When most people think about a bank's business model, this is what they have in mind. The largest among these is Wells Fargo, followed by U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial, and Capital One Financial, respectively. Image source: Getty Images. An index like this is important for investors because it allows you to see whether a particular stock is in line with its peer group. Viewed in isolation, it's impossible to say whether a particular bank stock is cheap or expensive -- or efficient or inefficient -- or whatever metric it is that you're trying to tease out. But if you have a control group against which to compare a bank's valuation, profitability, or efficiency, then you can get a much better idea of its relative value or performance, which explains why I can confidently say that U.S. Bancorp is the best-run big bank in the country. This is what the KBW Bank Index enables one to do. And it's why I recommend that investors have a general understanding of what it is and how to use it. ","

Chase announced recently that its Sapphire, Sapphire Preferred, and Sapphire Reserve cardholders would be eligible for 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points if they obtained a mortgage with Chase bank by Aug. 6, 2017.  The offer was available only for current cardholders and only for a new purchase, not a refinance. It was not the first offer of its kind -- Capital One also made an offer of free mileage last year, and Wells Fargo has offered rebates for mortgage loans in the past -- but it was a generous offer, with rewards points worth around 2.1 cents per point. While getting points or other rewards for taking out a mortgage loan seems attractive if you're thinking about buying a home anyway, there are three big reasons why it's unwise to go with a particular mortgage lender just to earn miles or other credit card rewards. Image Source: Getty Images. Chase made its announcement in May and stipulated that cardholders who want the points would have to apply by the deadline on Aug. 6. This is a very limited amount of time to do your research into the mortgage terms offered by different lenders. Most incentive deals that mortgage lenders offer have deadlines, which puts artificial time pressure on you. Your mortgage will likely be the biggest debt you carry during your lifetime. You need time to carefully compare the different fees, interest rates, mortgage points, and other terms various lenders will offer you. The process shouldn't be rushed, and you shouldn't try to move faster than you're comfortable with just so you don't miss out on credit card points, airline miles, or other incentives. Your credit card points will be spent within a matter of months, while airlines miles earned for taking out a loan last only a trip or two. A mortgage is an obligation lasting 15 to 30 years. If you buy a house before you're ready because you don't want to miss out on a mortgage incentive, you'll be stuck with a real estate commission, transfer tax, and a host of other expensive costs if you need to sell the home. Unless you have all of your ducks on a row -- like a 20% down payment at the ready, as well as an emergency fund to cover maintenance and repairs -- you could also end up having to pay for private mortgage insurance or fall into debt if something unexpected happens. If you jump into a loan too fast, you may also feel the need to refinance a few years down the road in order to get better terms. Refinancing is a costly process, as you have to pay for a new appraisal and the closing costs of the new loan. Getting out of one mortgage loan and into another is also a time-consuming process that requires you to produce lots of paperwork. Banks may make up the cost by charging a slightly higher mortgage loan rate -- Chase's rates as of late May were 3.875% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan, while Bankrate had some lenders offering rates as low as 3.750% -- or they may charge more than other lenders for various costs like the credit check, home appraisal, loan origination fee, or underwriting fee. Even a small difference in interest can make a big difference in payments. A $200,000 loan at 3.750% would cost you $926 per month, and the total loan cost would be $333,443. By comparison, the same $200,000 mortgage at a 3.875% interest rate would come with payments of $940 per month, and the total cost of the loan would be $338,571. That tiny difference in the interest rate would cost you an extra $5,000 over the life of the loan -- and odds are the rewards you earned wouldn't come close to that value. Don't cheat yourself out of thousands of dollars by falling for a gimmick. Wait until you're ready to buy a home, carefully research different lenders with good reputations, and choose the best overall deal. If you just happen to get a reward from that lender, that bonus will be icing on the cake. ","
      
    3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Open a Mortgage to Get Rewards -- The Motley Fool

If you're in the market for a bank stock, then valuation is one thing you should keep in mind. Holding all else equal, the cheaper you can buy a stock, the bigger your return is likely to be. It's for this reason that I intermittently check bank stock valuations on the KBW Bank Index, the leading index of large-cap bank stocks headquartered in the United States. The average stock on the index trades for 15.5 times the bank's projected earnings per share over the next 12 months. That's not cheap, but it's far from expensive when you consider that the average stock on the S&P 500 is valued at 35 times forward earnings. But while bank stocks in general are valued at a lower multiple to earnings than the typical large-cap stock, some banks are still cheaper than others. Based on the forward P/E ratio, here are the five cheapest big bank stocks right now: Stock Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) 10.6 Citigroup (NYSE:C) 12.5 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 12.9 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 13.0 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 13.1 KBW Bank Index average 15.5 Data source: YCharts.com. Aside from Capital One, which is heavily concentrated in credit card loans and thus exposed to elevated credit risk, as credit card loans tend to default at higher rates than other types of loans, the four other cheapest big bank stocks have something in common: They're the largest banks in the country. Citigroup is the smallest of the four, yet it still has $1.8 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is the largest, overseeing $2.6 trillion in assets. And Bank of America and Wells Fargo fall in between these two. Why would these banks trade at lower valuations than smaller banks? It seems to me that there are four reasons. First, under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, global systemically important banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup can't operate with as much leverage as their smaller, simpler peers can. This is because they're subject to higher capital requirements, which necessarily reduces leverage and profitability. Second, all of these banks are effectively shut out of the market for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo each hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Therefore, they're prohibited under federal law from acquiring other banks. Citigroup doesn't face the same constraint, as its depositary base is weighted more heavily toward international deposits. But given the New York-based bank's strategy over the past few years of shrinking its balance sheet as opposed to growing it, it's safe to say that Citigroup is not in the market to acquire other banks, either. The net result is that these four banks are all largely confined to organic growth, which could weigh on their returns in the future relative to banks that aren't similarly prohibited from merging with or acquiring other banks. Image source: Getty Images. The third reason is that these four banks are especially difficult to analyze. Much of this comes from their sheer size and the extent of their operations. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup are all universal banks, meaning that they run both investment and commercial banking businesses. Commercial banking is straightforward, consisting of taking deposits and making loans. This yields recurring revenue that doesn't fluctuate widely on a quarterly or annual basis. Investment banking operations are much harder to understand and forecast into the future. This is primarily because an investment bank's top line is influenced by volume and volatility in the credit markets, both of which are all but impossible to predict in advance. Finally, while I've touched on this already, the biggest banks in the country are all subject to much more robust regulatory requirements than smaller banks. Their compliance exams are more intense. They face additional hurdles on the annual stress tests. And the way they structure their balance sheets is much more closely scrutinized by industry overseers. Does this mean you should avoid buying shares of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup? Not necessarily because, remember, while they may face more headwinds than smaller banks, their shares can also be picked up at much lower valuations. That said, as I've written in the past, given the towering heights of the stock market today, I think investors have more to gain than lose from waiting for a potential pullback in the market before diving deeper into stocks.

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When I think about banks, I often think about Citigroup (NYSE:C) as being in a league of its own. It isn't because of its performance, which has left a lot to be desired over the past decade. It's rather because of its emphasis on international banking. There are a number of ways to show this, but one of the most obvious is to look at the distribution of Citigroup's deposits. More than half of the New York-based bank's deposits are held in offices outside the United States: Data source: regulatory filings. Chart by author. Even a cursory glance at this chart shows how different Citigroup is from the three other megabanks that sit atop the financial-services industry. JPMorgan Chase, which also has a large international presence, only has 17% of its deposits held in overseas offices. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo and Bank of America both come in at less than 10%. This goes to the core of Citigroup's business model. It was roughly a century ago that the bank became one of the first in the United States to establish a global banking presence, gaining footholds throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America, in addition to its operations in the United States. Citigroup not only has offices in other countries, but its operations abroad also pivot around consumer banking, the primary purpose of which is to attract deposits. This distinguishes it from the three other banks in the chart, whose international operations focus more on investment banking, as is the case with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America in particular. The purpose of investment banking is to help global corporations issue debt and equity, manage risk, and move money around the world. Image source: Getty Images. Citigroup's extensive overseas presence is a double-edged sword. While it serves to distinguish the $1.8 trillion bank from its peers, it also introduces another layer of risk. In the lead-up to the Great Depression, for instance, Citigroup gained notoriety for selling toxic Latin American bonds to its customers in the United States. And throughout the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, Citigroup came within a hair's breadth of failure because of overexposure to soured bonds issued by the likes of Brazil and Argentina. In an effort to reduce risk and simplify its business model since the financial crisis, Citigroup has pared down its operations abroad. In 2008, for instance, it sold its Japanese trust banking unit to Mitsubishi UFG Trust and Banking. Citigroup followed that up a year later by selling its retail brokerage business in Japan. And six years after that, it did the same with its retail banking operations in the East Asian country. These moves have simplified and streamlined Citigroup's business model. They've also helped the bank raise capital and de-risk its operations. But even though they represent a retreat for Citigroup in terms of its long-term focus on global banking, it's clear from the chart that the bank continues to distinguish itself from its peers in terms of the size and reach of its international footprint.

Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","

John Maxfield and Gaby Lapera,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Last week, the Financial CHOICE Act, a hulking 600-page piece of legislation regarding the banking industry, made its way through the House of Representatives. A full transcript follows the video. John Maxfield: It's going great, Gaby, how are you doing? Lapera: I'm doing pretty good. I had an exciting weekend. I was volunteering at Pride with The Motley Fool, so that was really exciting, and I went rock climbing. What a fulfilling weekend. Maxfield: Nice, that is a really fulfilling weekend. I basically spent the weekend mediating disputes between my five-year-old twin sons. [laughs] That's kind of like the referee in a boxing ring. Lapera: [laughs] Oh my gosh, I'm very impressed. My brother also has twins, and they are young and also a handful. You have the patience and energy of a saint. Talking about patience and energy, let's turn to Congress. Today, we're going to talk about the CHOICE Act, which stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs. Another in a long line of acronyms that are kind of just jammed in together to try to make something that's fun to say. The CHOICE Act just passed the House on Friday. The whole thing with the CHOICE Act, the reason that we're talking about it on the show, is that it's basically there to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is what was regulating all of the banking stuff that we've been talking about for literally, what, two years now, Maxfield? Maxfield: Yeah. Or five years. You and I have been talking about it for two years now. One of the ways that I think is really helpful to think about the Financial CHOICE Act is that, in all industries, particularly banking, you can look at it through the lens of cycles, different types of cycles -- the business cycle, the credit cycle, cycles in consumer confidence. But another cycle that you can use to think about, not only in the financial services sector, but in all sectors, is the regulatory cycle, specifically in terms of whether the industry has more power, or the regulators have more power, at any particular point in time. And after the financial crisis, when the Dodd-Frank Act was passed on largely partisan lines, basically just supported by the Democrats, that shifted a lot of power away from the industry over to regulators. And basically what the Financial CHOICE Act does is it reverses that. And it was passed in the house, like we said last week, on largely partisan lines, but the partisan lines were different: This time, it was Republicans supporting it and Democrats not supporting it. What it tries to do is take that power that Dodd-Frank gave to the regulators and give it back to the industry. Lapera: Yeah. The bill is sponsored, unsurprisingly, by a man named Jeb Hensarling, who is a Republican. As with most things political, things are falling along party lines. I want to take an opportunity to say that Maxfield and I are going to do our best to stay unbiased throughout this discussion, but everyone is a person and we all have opinions, and our opinions don't necessarily reflect that of The Motley Fool, but we're going to try to give you an informed, as objective as possible, discussion. My anthropology roots tell me that there is no way to have a completely unbiased discussion, so I'm going to leave it at that and talk a little bit more about the philosophy behind the CHOICE Act. Basically, a lot of people don't like Dodd-Frank. They think it puts too much pressure on the banks, it's too hard for them to make money the way that Dodd-Frank is structured. There's a few different parts to it, the big parts of the Financial CHOICE Act. But I think the one that a lot of people focus on is, the Financial CHOICE Act is looking to end ""too big to fail."" Maxfield: Right. To your point, Gaby, about the partisan basis, I want to address that before I jump into the too-big-to-fail part. The one thing to keep in mind is, even though Dodd-Frank was passed on partisan basis, and the Financial CHOICE Act made it through the House on a partisan basis, the fact of the matter is, almost everybody agrees, most knowledgeable sources agree, that Dodd-Frank went too far. And I'm somebody who thinks that there needs to be a robust regulatory framework around the banking systems, just because banks are so highly leveraged, and because they play a role in the monetary system of the United States and they're kind of, to a certain extent, an extension of the federal government. So you can't let banks go out there and do what they want, because they are acting, in a sense, on the part of taxpayers. So I think that's some good context to keep in mind. But Dodd-Frank, almost everybody would agree that it did go too far. So now the question is, how far do you tailor it back? Lapera: Yeah. And to get into that about being an extension of the government, it's not just that with the systemically important financial institutions. It's not just our country -- it's the entire world is tied into these financial systems. So people get concerned that if they fail, it's going to be -- to borrow a term from the Vietnam era -- a domino effect with other people's economies. So there is a lot of feelings riding on this, and a lot of this depends on how you view economic theory. I think 90% agree with you that Dodd-Frank potentially went too far. I don't know that the CHOICE Act is the answer, either. We'll see what happens. We'll get a little bit more into it. Let's talk a little bit about the actual components of the Financial CHOICE Act, and what they look like, what they mean in terms of existing legislation. Like I said earlier, too big to fail -- that's one of the big key components, ending too big to fail, of the Financial CHOICE Act. Maxfield: Right, if we go back to the financial crisis, here's an overarching way to think about this too-big-to-fail component. You had Citigroup, Bank of America, and AIG, you had your Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns -- these very large financial institutions. These financial institutions hold trillions of dollars in assets on their balance sheets, and oversee a large chunk of the deposits that you and I and everyone else deposits. So if one of those were to fail, it could cause catastrophic damage to the economy. In fact, if you go back to the Great Depression, the thing that caused the Great Depression, or transformed it from a typical recession into the Great Depression, was the failure of a bunch of banks. So that informed this whole too-big-to-fail idea where, even though it's extremely unpalatable to go in and bail out these huge firms with these executives that make tens of millions of dollars a year, and basically save them from their own mistakes, even though that's very unpalatable on almost every level, it does save the U.S. economy. What the CHOICE Act does is it tries to reduce the ability of regulators to step in and bail these banks out. Let me be clear. There is a very solid theoretical framework behind that, because the thought process is, if you go in and bail out these big banks and they know you're going to bail them out in the future, they have much less incentive to act responsibly. That's that whole thought process. If you go back to the financial crisis, the term -- I'm pulling a blank on the term -- but if you go back to the financial crisis, this was one of the main arguments that they asserted. So what Hensarling's act tries to do is dial that back, and it does it in a couple of different ways. No. 1, it removes the regulator's authority to take over these organizations that are troubled and liquidate them in an orderly way, and it transfers that authority over into the bankruptcy code. Lapera: Just a quick side note for listeners, this is called the Orderly Liquidation Authority, that's OLA, which you might see floating around if you're reading about this online. That's actually codified into law, and it's the way the government stepped in and made sure there was an orderly liquidation during the most recent financial crisis of banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Maxfield: Right. Also, the term I was thinking about earlier was moral hazard. That's the hazard that, if you're going to step in and bail someone out -- an institution -- that institution has less incentive to act responsibly. And like I said, that's grounded in theory. Lapera: And it's actually really funny, because earlier you were talking about spending the weekend refereeing between your two children. This is almost just a parenting concept, that if you reward that behavior, you're going to keep getting bad behavior. Maxfield: Exactly, that's exactly right. And all parents can understand that. Another important thing it does in that too-big-to-fail context is that it seeks to restrict the Federal Reserve's discount window lending to what's known as Bagehot's dictum. Lapera: There's a lot of words in there. What is a discount-window lending? I mean, what is discount-window lending? I sound like an old person... ""What is the Facebook?"" What is discount window lending? Maxfield: Discount window is, when a bank gets into trouble, one of the things that will happen is, its depositors will know it's in trouble, so they will all run on the bank at the same time to withdraw their deposits. That's known as a bank run. The problem with a bank run is, because banks are so leveraged, and they only hold a small amount of actual cash in terms of relative to deposits that they have, that can cause them to be completely illiquid. They can run out of cash trying to satisfy their depositors. What the discount window does is it allows banks to take some of its assets on its balance sheet, go to the Federal Reserve, use those assets as collateral, and then get cash from the Federal Reserve to satisfy depositors, to thereby stop or prevent a bank run. Maxfield: It happened with... the name of the bank is escaping me right now, but it happened with a major bank that was based in California during the financial crisis. And it was actually that bank that was taken over and turned into OneWest, which was the institution that was associated with Steven Mnuchin, who's now the Treasury Secretary. But it does still happen, but it's much less frequent because there is FDIC deposit insurance now, as well, that reduces the incentive for people to have to feel like they need to run on the banks and take their deposits out, because the FDIC will be there to stand behind the banks, anyway. So what Bagehot's dictum does is it says that the Federal Reserve should only allow banks to access the discount window -- or it says that the way the Federal Reserve could use the discount window is to lend freely and early in times of crisis, which is what happened last time -- but it should only do so to ""solvent firms and against good collateral at high interest rates."" It's that high-interest rates part that's really significant, because the idea there is, if you were using a punitive interest rate, banks are going to be less inclined to use the discount window. And if they're less inclined to use the discount window in times of crisis, the thought is that, ahead of time, they will be much more careful about the quality of the assets they put on their balance sheets, and the ability to turn those into cash in the public markets as opposed to having to go to the discount window of the Federal Reserve. Lapera: And you have just revealed the disconnect between Democrats and Republicans -- which is that Republicans believe that banks can be forced to be responsible enough to take care of themselves, and Democrats do not, and that's why they're pushing for all this extra regulation. Right now, that falls along partisan lines. Whatever you think is up to you. That's basically what's going on. Maxfield: I will say, to take politics out of this, I studied banks pretty intensely for a number of years, and I will tell you that in history, the thing that we know is that you need a strong and independent central bank, you need it at all times, but particularly in times of crisis. So you do want to be really careful in terms of both the authorities you give to a central bank in that situation and, in this case, the authorities that you take away from it. But again, this is something that, it will get worked out, and the pendulum swings back and forth between regulators and industry. And right now, this is a bill that swings at way back on the other side. I would say, just like Dodd-Frank went too far swinging the pendulum into the favor of regulators, Hensarling's act seems to me to go too far in the other direction. Which makes sense, given that Dodd-Frank was partisan on the Democratic side and the Financial CHOICE Act is partisan on the Republican side. Lapera: Yeah. Actually, you gave me a good segue earlier to kind of slide into this next big thing that the act is going to do, which is that it's going to significantly cut down on the authority of regulatory agencies. I think one of the most important things to note is that they're going to subject financial Regulatory agencies to the REINS Act. The REINS Act basically says that any agency that wants to impose a rule that costs more than $100 million a year needs to run it by Congress first, and if Congress fails to approve a rule within 70 days after it's been proposed, then the rule would go away -- it would be null and void. Which is hard, because if you have partisan control of committees, rules that would go against whatever the nature of that committee is at the moment can just sit for 70 days and never even get heard, and then it just doesn't happen, and that means that regulation is going to happen much more slowly. Maxfield: Right. The way it works now is that the Federal Reserve, the FCC, the CFPB, all these different regulatory agencies -- and this isn't just in the financial services arena, this is across all regulatory agencies and all industries, that in order to regulate their industries, they are given the authority to pass rules that, like, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to pass rules about appropriate products that can be marketed to customers. And those rules, there is a long process where they get insight from the industry and other interested parties. But then those regulatory agencies have the power to put those rules into place and require the industry to follow them. What the Financial CHOICE Act would do is add another layer in that step, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but here's the problem. That additional layer is Congressional approval of these rules. And you can imagine that that really adds a lot of complications to that whole process. It's not like you're just adding just one more hurdle. You're adding an extremely high hurdle that, depending on who is in control of Congress and the Senate at any particular point in time, these regulatory agencies may not be able to jump over. Again, I think that's probably the whole point of subjecting them to the REINS Act, which passed earlier this year. Lapera: Right, it's to reduce the amount of federal legislation that exists, that's really what the point of it is. But it's hard because, yes, maybe regulatory agencies shouldn't be making up rules without Congressional approval, but on the other hand, Congress takes a really long time to do things sometimes. Sometimes, agencies come up with stuff to protect people or help people, and then it gets codified into law, but until then, they're just responding quickly to the needs as they see them. So it's this really hard to push-and-pull thing that you have with government. Let's talk a little bit also about the Fed, which you mentioned is going to be affected by this act. It's hard, because the Fed has also been subjected to the REINS Act, as well. Maxfield: Right. There's one other piece to this. It's not only the REINS Act that they're subjecting the regulators to. They also subject the regulators to the appropriations process. That's a really important thing. Right now, let's take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is actually an agency within the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve is an independent agency. So you have multiple layers of independence. But one of the principal pieces of independence is that, in the case of the Federal Reserve, it is a profit-making entity -- it has a huge balance sheet full of assets that earn interest in time. So it doesn't have to go to Congress to get money to operate, which gives it independence from Congress. The same thing is true with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- don't quote me exactly on this -- since it was put into operation, and in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it has issued a total of something like $11 [billion] to $12 billion worth of fines to the industry, and it can use those fines to do, among other things, fund its own operations. So it, too, is kind of detached or insulated from that political process that is a part of the appropriations process. And what the Financial CHOICE Act does is, it would take away that independence and require these institutions to go to Congress for the funding, which would have a significant impact on them. Lapera: Yeah. And that's one of the big criticisms of the CFBP, that its critics levied at it, is that the CFPB might start just issuing fines just because it has a financial incentive to, as opposed to doing it because the fines really need to be issued. So that's kind of where that Financial CHOICE Act section, that's what it's trying to get at. Maxfield: Right. Then, to your point about going straight at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve is one of those institutions that, people either don't know anything about it, or they love it or hate it, or they don't know anything about it, and they love or hate it. And one of the things that people tend to think about when they think about the Federal Reserve is that it's some sort of conspiratorial entity that controls the money supply and does so for the economic elites, and things like that. And one of the reasons that these conspiracy theories are able to grow take on the forms that they're able to take is because it's a relatively non-transparent organization, particularly when it comes to managing the money supply. Another main principle of the Financial CHOICE Act is to increase the transparency of the Federal Reserve, both in terms of its overall operations and in terms of the way it manages the money supply. And what I mean by managing the money supply is, when it decides to raise or lower interest rates, because that's the lever that causes the money supply to expand or contract. Lapera: Yeah, and it's not just that. For example, the stress tests, no one is 100% sure what's in them. Maxfield: Exactly. So the stress tests right now, these happen once a year for large banks. The purpose of them is to see how they would perform in a hypothetical economic scenario that is analogous to the financial crisis. This is actually a very good piece of the regulatory pie in the banking industry, because it keeps bankers' eyes on making sure that the assets they put on the balance sheets aren't going to submit them to massive losses if, and when, the economy turns down, like it inevitably will. But the issue with the stress tests is that, when the banks submit all the information to the Federal Reserve for the stress test, when the banks are going through their planning process, in terms of structuring their balance sheets and their operations in a way that will help them make it through the stress test, is that the Federal Reserve doesn't actually give them the exact model that the Federal Reserve is using in the course of the stress test. So the banks are flying blind in this regard. If you talk to bankers, most all of them will say that they think the stress tests are a good thing. I'm talking about the bankers, the CEOs of the very large banks in this country, those are the ones under the most stringent stress-test requirements. They will almost universally say that they think the stress tests are a good thing, but they will also almost universally complain about the fact that the Federal Reserve doesn't share the models it uses in the course of the stress test, so banks are just flying blind. Lapera: Yeah. That actually is kind of paired with another aspect of the CHOICE Act, which is that they are proposing that if banks hold a certain amount of money on their balance sheet, essentially as an emergency fund, that they won't be subject to quite as much regulation as they are now. Maxfield: Right. One of the main narratives that emerged from the financial crisis was that the reason the crisis was able to metastasize the way it did was because banks were overleveraged, they were undercapitalized. Which means, a typical bank will hold $1 worth of equity for $10 of assets. At the time, you had, like, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and companies like that -- Lehman Brothers, at certain points, was leveraged by something like 30:1. What that means was, if its assets fell by just 3%, if the value of its assets fell by just 3%, it would render it completely insolvent. In the wake of the financial crisis, all of these additional capital rules came in to require banks to not only hold more capital, but dictated the type of capital that they were supposed to hold. What the Financial CHOICE Act does is say, ""Look, let's do away with all these complicated capital rules,"" and these capital rules are incredibly complicated, ""and let's replace them with a simple leverage ratio where banks, all you do is compare how much equity or capital a bank has to its assets, and just use that simple ratio."" And if banks meet the threshold laid out in the Financial CHOICE Act, then they can be exempt from all of these additional regulations that Dodd-Frank is imposing, particularly on large banks. So the thought process is, look, if you just make them hold more capital, they're safer, so they don't have to do all these other things. Lapera: So the thing that the Financial CHOICE Act offers for banks that do this, in particular, that's probably very valuable for them is that, right now, really large banks have to go to the Fed before doing stuff like issuing a dividend or changing their business plan. And in theory, if they meet this leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they won't have to ask for permission to do any of that stuff anymore. Of course, it's really interesting, because when you say a simple ratio with assets, just like with people, there are assets that are really easy to move and there are assets that are really hard to move. So I don't know, I personally need a little bit more clarity around what that ratio actually looks like. It's a lot harder to sell a house and get that cash than it is to have cash to pay, and that analogy also holds for banks. They have some assets that are really hard to offload and some that are really easy to offload, so how did they end up calculating that ratio? The reason I don't know the answer to this yet is that I have not actually read all 600 pages of this act yet. I'm working on it, I'll do it eventually. So one of the reasons I haven't read all of it yet is because, it's passed the House and it's about to go to the Senate, and the Senate, in my opinion, is not going to let this pass as originally written. There's probably going to be quite a few amendments, and the language is probably going to change quite a lot, if it passes at all. Maxfield: And here's another really important point. They're saying that, if a bank holds enough capital to satisfy this simplified leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they're calling that an off-ramp -- the off-ramp being, you get off the highway with all these other regulations. Well, one of the really interesting regulations that it's looking like the Financial CHOICE Act is trying to attack and would allow these big banks, in particular, to avoid -- and let me read this from the executive summary of the Financial CHOICE Act. It says it will ""exempt banking organizations that have made a qualifying capital election from any federal law, rule, or regulation that provide limitations on mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions of assets or control ... "" So what does that mean? Through the 1970s-1980s, the banking industry deregulated. It allowed banks to open up house, operate branches, and allowed banks to operate across interstate lines, which is something that, in the past, they generally weren't allowed to do. Well, the quid pro quo in that case was that they were going to allow these banks to grow and do all these things and have more flexibility in terms of their operations, but on the other side of that, they wanted to stop these things from getting so enormous that if one of them were to fail, it would basically wipe out all the wealth of the United States. So they did that by saying, ""If you hold 10% or more of the nation's deposits, you are not allowed to then acquire another depository institution."" And right now, there are three banks that fit that -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. So right now, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, they cannot go out and buy any other banks, they're not allowed to because each one of them holds more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, if I'm reading it correctly, it's saying that, as long as those banks hold enough capital to meet that threshold in the act, they would then be free to merge together or buy other banks. So you could theoretically, in this case, see a merger between JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two biggest banks in the country. And I really doubt that that would happen because their branch bases completely overlap each other, so there would be too much redundancy in doing that. But people should think about, is that something we want to do? Do we want each individual bank to hold, say, 25% or 50% of the nation's deposits? Is that a direction we want to go in, given the fact that since the Civil War, more than 17,000 banks have failed? So it's a good thing to keep in mind. Lapera: Yeah, no, that's a really overwhelming thing to think about. We need to wrap up because we've been here for a while. It's partially because there's just so much stuff in this act to discuss. There's so many little things that could end up having really big impact. We'll continue to track the progress of the bill. Like I mentioned earlier, I really, really do not think this is going to get through the Senate completely unchanged. We'll talk about that more when we know more. Was there anything else you wanted to say, Maxfield? Maxfield: No, I think that's it. The only other thing is, it would dramatically impact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We could talk about that on a different show because that deserves its own conversation. But again, to leave off on the same point I made at the very beginning, the Financial CHOICE Act, like the Dodd-Frank Act, is neither good nor bad. It's just a reflection of the swing of the pendulum back and forth between regulators and industries. We've seen this many times in the past. And generally, when the pendulum swings, regardless of the direction in which it swings, it goes too far. Dodd-Frank went too far. The Financial CHOICE Act went too far. So to your point, Gaby, when this goes through the Senate, it's likely that they're going to tailor it back. Lapera: Yeah. That seems very likely, especially given everything that we've seen during this Administration so far. Who knows what'll happen? Things in D.C. either move at breakneck pace, or very, very slowly. We'll keep you guys up to date, don't worry.

    What's the Deal with the Financial CHOICE Act? -- The Motley Fool

Big bank stocks have surged over the past eight months, yet they still look relatively cheap when compared with regional bank stocks. Is this a sign you should buy the former and sell the latter? Not necessarily. The easiest way to see the difference in valuation between banks based on size is to compare the median valuation on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks the two dozen biggest banks in the country, with the KBW Regional Banking Index, which tracks 50 banks with between $5 billion and $40 billion worth of assets on their balance sheets. Index Median Forward Price-to-Earnings Multiple Median Price to Book Value Median Price to Tangible Book Value KBW Bank Index 14.88 1.36 1.92 KBW Regional Banking Index 17.41 1.66 2.18 Data source: YCharts.com. It doesn't matter which of the three primary valuation metrics you use: Regional banks such as Glacier Bancorp (NASDAQ:GBCI) and Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK) generally trade at a higher multiple compared with big banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Based on earnings, which is the metric that should take the lead in an analysis today, the median regional bank on the KBW Regional Banking Index trades for 17.41 times earnings per share over the next 12 months. The figure on the KBW Bank Index is 14.88. The story is the same when you look at valuation as a function of book value. The median regional bank stock trades for 2.18 times tangible book value, while the median big bank trades for a multiple of 1.92. Investors need to appreciate that these figures alone don't mean big banks are better buys than regional banks. A better interpretation of the difference is that regional banks have more opportunities to grow. Regional and community banks are growing like weeds. Image source: Getty Images. There are two ways to grow in the bank industry. The first is through organic growth -- attracting new customers through marketing efforts and gaining more of each customer's overall financial business, be it a mortgage, credit card, car loan, whatever. The second avenue is through mergers and acquisitions. Holding all else equal, a bank that can use both avenues can grow faster than a bank that can use only one. Herein lies the difference in valuation between the nation's biggest banks, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and regional banks, such as Glacier Bancorp and Bank of the Ozarks. As I've discussed in the past, the nation's three biggest banks, which are weighted heavily on KBW's large-cap bank index, are all shut out of the acquisition game, at least insofar as other depository institutions are concerned. That's because Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo each already hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. As such, these three banks are legally prohibited from acquiring other banks. Regional banks aren't similarly proscribed. Because none of the banks on the KBW Regional Banking Index come even close to the 10% deposit threshold, they can still merge with or acquire other banks, thereby supercharging growth. That's exactly what they've been doing. To cite just two examples, Glacier Bancorp has acquired nine banks since the beginning of 2009, and that's on top of 15 other deals it has completed since 1990. The same is true at Bank of the Ozarks, which has purchased a total of 16 other banks since the financial crisis. OZRK Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. The net result is that these two banks have seen their balance sheets expand rapidly over the past decade. Bank of the Ozarks went from $2.5 billion in assets 10 years ago to more than $19 billion today. And while Glacier Bancorp's recent ascent hasn't been as steep, the Montana-based bank has nevertheless more than doubled in size over the same stretch. Thus, the reason big bank stocks seem cheap is that their ability to grow is tightly constrained compared with their smaller, simpler counterparts in the regional banking space. ","

Exchange traded funds have made it easy for investors to drill down on specific types of investments, and Sector SPDR ETFs have become one of the most popular ways to invest in specific sectors of the stock market. Sector SPDRs track 10 different sectors in the S&P 500, with each Sector SPDR ETF delivering performance equal to that of the component stocks within the target industry. The investments have relatively low costs and offer diversification while letting you tailor your portfolio in line with your beliefs about the future of particular parts of the market. Sector SPDR 10-Year Average Annual Return Consumer Staples (NYSEMKT:XLP) 10.26% Consumer Discretionary (NYSEMKT:XLY) 10.25% Technology (NYSEMKT:XLK) 9.97% Health Care (NYSEMKT:XLV) 9.51% Industrials (NYSEMKT:XLI) 7.88% Utilities (NYSEMKT:XLU) 6.47% Materials (NYSEMKT:XLB) 5.06% Energy (NYSEMKT:XLE) 1.53% Financials (NYSEMKT:XLF) (0.72%) Real Estate (NYSEMKT:XLRE) N/A Data source: SPDR. N/A = not applicable; the Real Estate Sector SPDR began trading in October 2015. The Sector SPDR ETFs break up the S&P 500 into 10 separate indexes. Like any ETF, the Sector SPDRs trade throughout the trading day on the NYSE Arca exchange. As index funds, the investment objective for the ETFs is to match the share-price performance and dividend income of the underlying sectors that they track. Sector SPDRs have anywhere from 25 to 85 individual stock holdings in their portfolios, depending on the number of S&P 500 members in each respective industry. Consumer discretionary currently has the most stocks, while the materials sector comes in last. Image source: Getty Images. Just looking at the range of returns on the Sector SPDRs reveals the utility of having these ETFs available. Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has had a total return of about 7%, and the chart above shows that half of the sectors have outperformed that figure while the other half have underperformed. Finally, even if you want to own the whole market, Sector SPDRs give you the opportunity to get some tax benefits. In a rising market, simply owning the S&P 500 ETF as a single holding doesn't give you chances to reap any tax-loss benefits. However, even when the overall market rises, you'll generally find that some sectors lose ground. By using tax-loss harvesting strategies, you can collect tax losses on those underperforming sectors while deferring tax on rising sector ETFs until you sell them well into the future. There are a couple ways in which Sector SPDRs aren't the perfect investment. First, even with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.14%, they're still more expensive than broader-based market ETFs. For instance, you can find ETFs tracking the entire S&P 500 for as little as 0.04%. The other major problem is that like most ETFs, you have to pay brokerage commissions to trade Sector SPDRs. Even those brokers who offer commission-free ETF trading typically don't include the Sector SPDRs, with some instead offering their own proprietary sector-based ETFs. With low commissions available from many brokers, the costs of owning Sector SPDRs doesn't have to be prohibitive, but it is somewhat of a drag on performance. Nevertheless, for investors looking to make plays on specific parts of the market, Sector SPDRs are a good option to consider. With a long history behind them, Sector SPDRs will remain popular ETFs far into the future. ","

A chart from Wells Fargo shows that U.S. crude-oil and liquid-fuels production stands around 15.5 million barrels a day. It was at just over 14 million barrels a day in mid-2014: Prices of $80 a barrel are likely unattainable as well, “until the world’s oil producers stop overproducing,” said LaForge. Read: Why global oil production looks set to grow in 2018, despite OPEC-led output cuts “We continue to hear that big cutbacks are on the cusp of happening,” he said. “The evidence, however, implies otherwise. And the longer oil prices remain low and range-bound, the harder it will be for prices to bounced above $60—as production costs have dropped significantly since 2014, which keeps more producers in the game.” And each time prices do bounce toward $60, the “temptation to overproduce,” may be “overwhelming for those countries that rely heavily on oil revenues to sustain their economies and social programs,” LaForge said. Given all of that, “we are not expecting the price of WTI crude oil to climb anywhere near $100 per barrel over the next few years,” he said. Instead, Wells Fargo expects it to remain low and range-bound, bouncing between $30 and $60 per barrel. Still, “there is the possibility that the WTI crude-oil price finds its way into the high $30s to low $40s” at year’s end and if that happens, “we could become bullish in the short term,” LaForge said.

Koenig said his new bullish outlook was based on improved software-as-a-service visibility, as Oracle’s applications business “gets over the ‘hump’ of its transition to cloud,” as well as to robust bookings activity and solid database licensing activity. He wrote in a note to clients that he sees potential for “sustained follow-through on positive price action as long-only investors adjust their [Oracle] weightings.” BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman boosted his stock price target to $57 from $48, citing one of Oracle’s “strongest quarters in years,” while J.P. Morgan’s Mark Murphy lifted his target to $55 from $51, saying he believes “this quarter will mark a turning point in investor sentiment.” Benchmark’s Yun Kim lifted the target to $62 from $55, saying the results indicate Oracle has reached the “critical scale” in its cloud business, making the stock “one of the best ways to play the current cloud computing trend.” Kim’s new target ties him with Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White for the second-highest on the Street, according to FactSet, just behind Wells Fargo’s Philip Winslow’s target of $62.50. Oracle shares have soared 31% year to date, while the SPDR Technology Select Sector exchange-traded fund

Department stores are already suffering from a number of headwinds, including declines in mall traffic and the need for massive store closures. “Prime Wardrobe capitalizes on all of these aspects, providing Prime members access to a broad assortment of real brands (presumably broader than any single department store given the current and likely future breadth of Amazon’s assortment) in one place, at an already familiar point of sale, with minimal friction (free delivery/returns),” Wells Fargo wrote in a note. “Simply put, this adds another nail into the department store coffin.” On Tuesday, the e-commerce giant announced that Amazon Wardrobe is in beta. The new service for Prime members gives customers the chance to try on apparel and footwear for seven days before purchasing. The more customers buy, the bigger the discount. Among the brands that are already involved are Calvin Klein, Levi’s, Adidas AG

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday as an influential U.S. Federal Reserve official expressed confidence that rising wages would help revive domestic inflation, which has shown signs of softening recently. The yen fell to two-week lows against the greenback and the euro after officials of the Bank of Japan at a meeting on Friday downplayed the likelihood that the bank would begin to roll back emergency stimulus to support the economy. Remarks by New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday that tightening in the labor market should help drive up inflation helped offset concerns by some investors that stubbornly low inflation would not allow policy-makers to raise rates further the rest of this year. “The Fed doesn’t seem to be too concerned about the recent pullback in the inflation data. They are committed to policy normalization,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Last week, the Fed, as expected, raised key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter point and left the door open for another rate increase later this year. It also provided details on its plan to reduce its bond purchases in a bid to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. “Inflation is a little lower than what we would like, but we think that if the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that inflation will gradually get back to 2 percent,” Dudley told a local business group in Plattsburg, New York. Traders raised their outlook on a rate hike by the Fed’s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting to 47 percent from 41 percent late on Friday FFZ7 FFF8, CME Group’s FedWatch tool showed. The dollar index .DXY, which gauges the dollar against six other currencies, was up 0.4 percent at 97.537. The euro was down 0.4 percent versus the greenback, to $1.1147 EUR=, while against the yen the dollar increased 0.5 percent, at 111.43 yen JPY=. The euro was up 0.1 percent against the yen, at 124.25 yen EURJPY=. Positioning data showed net bullish bets on the euro reached their highest level in more than six years last week. There was no discernible boost for the single currency from the landslide victory of French President Emmanuel Macron’s government in parliamentary elections on Sunday. Sterling declined 0.4 percent to $1.2732 GBP=D3 as Britain began formal negotiations on its planned exit from the European Union. The UK ruling Conservative Party’s loss of its parliament majority earlier this month raised speculation of a drift toward a “soft Brexit,” which had supported the pound. Many analysts, however, expect developments from the talks would hurt sterling. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s apparent “indifference” toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency’s power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the “cramming” of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a “conspicuous silence” on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short, “gossamer” memo “modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.” Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury’s hands for six months. The CFPB’s role as a public watchdog “extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,” Pauley wrote. “Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,” he added. “It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.” The CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office, which handled legal filings in the case, was reviewing the decision. In court papers, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley’s decision. Pauley has criticized government agencies before, including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research. The case is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v Sprint Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09931. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"June 15 (Reuters) - Metlife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, announced added responsibilities for some of its senior executives, adding to the pool of potential successors to its chief executive. The largest U.S. life insurer named Michel Khalaf president of its U.S. business, effective July 1, to replace Maria Morris who retires from the company this fall. Marty Lippert, the company’s head of global technology and operations will take on added responsibility of MetLife Holdings, the company said. The appointments of Khalaf and Lippert set up a “horse race” for MetLife’s CEO position, held by Steven Kandarian, 65, who currently has no plans to retire from his role, an analyst with Wells Fargo said in a note. Other potential candidates for the top job include Chief Financial Officer John Hele, Chief Investment Officer Steven Goulart, and Asia head Christopher Townsend, the note said. In June last year, Metlife’s board agreed to waive off its 65-year retirement policy for Kandarian, who has been the company’s president and CEO since May 2011. Ramy Tadros will also join MetLife in September as the new chief risk officer, the company said. Tadros comes from Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, where he served as the global head of insurance. He will replace Stan Talbi, who will retire at the end of August after 43 years with MetLife. (Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp said on Thursday it received U.S. approval for its emergency epinephrine syringes to treat severe allergic reactions that it intends to be a lower cost rival to Mylan NV’s widely used EpiPen, sending its shares up more than 50 percent. The company said it was looking for a marketing partner and would set a price for the product before its launch sometime in the second half of this year. Adamis said its pre-filled epinephrine syringes would be sold under the brand name Symjepi. Mylan has faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations after it doubled the cost for a pair of EpiPens to around $600, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing debate over the high cost of prescription medicines in the United States. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor. “We plan to position the product as a lower cost alternative,” Mark Flather, senior director for investor relations and corporate communications for Adamis, told Reuters. “We want to be part of the solution.” Epinephrine is the life-saving recommended treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications. Mylan has for years owned more than 90 percent of the market for emergency epinephrine injectors and its own authorized generic has recently surpassed sales of the branded version. “With an anticipated lower cost and attractive design, we believe Symjepi will be a meaningful competitor to EpiPen,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a research note. Other rival products are available. Impax Laboratories Inc’s Adrenaclick device is being sold through CVS Health Corp’s drugstore chain for about $110 a pair. Privately held Kaleo earlier this year began selling its Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector that it reacquired from Sanofi SA under an unusual pricing strategy but with little  success so far. The company said it would make the product available at no cost to many consumers but charge insurers $4,500. Sanofi in April sued Mylan, accusing it of engaging in illegal practices to squash EpiPen competition when the French drugmaker held the Auvi-Q rights. Adamis shares soared 53.3 percent to close at $5.75 on the Nasdaq and further rose to $6.00 in extended trading. Mylan shares closed down 2.4 percent at $36.98. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - London-based startup Blockchain has raised $40 million (31.5 million pounds) in a fresh round of funding as the software company rides a wave of enthusiasm for digital currency technology. Nokota Management and Digital Currency Group also participated in the financing round, which boosted Blockchain’s total funding to more than $70 million Tom Hulme, general partner at Alphabet’s venture firm GV, said the firm invested because “the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched.” Founded in 2011, Blockchain makes software that allows consumers and businesses to make transactions using digital currencies such as bitcoin. The firm is named after the internet platform that records and validates transactions between two parties without relying on an intermediary such as a bank. Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product. “Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,” Smith said. “My grandmother uses our product today.” The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology. While far from mainstream, digital currency has enjoyed growing popularity that Smith attributes to the instability of traditional currencies in places such as Brazil, and political uncertainty in Britain and the United States. The day after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Smith said, Blockchain had the second-highest number of new users sign up in a single day. “In you’re in an environment of rapidly deteriorating geopolitical stability,” Smith said, “you are open to new ideas and new products.” (1 British pound = $1.2686) ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage of an annual stress test, showing they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession to meet regulatory requirements, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed’s most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year’s level. “This year’s results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,” said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank. “This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.” The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations. Wall Street analysts and trade groups quickly cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis. “We see today’s...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,” said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent. “From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,” he said. Thursday’s results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed’s methodology, using materials they submitted. The second portion of the test, to be released on Wednesday, will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks’ capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed’s. Under the Fed’s worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. However, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks’ aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more of its stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed’s approval. Under the Fed’s examination, Citi’s minimum CET1 ratio in the most stressful scenario was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Citi’s own analysis showed that metric at 10 percent. The Fed’s assessment showed the other five largest banks - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley - having minimum CET1 ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent. Of those, Goldman Sachs had the biggest optimism gap compared with the Fed when it came to the worst-case scenario. Its model produced a 9.8 percent minimum CET1 ratio, 1.4 points better than the Fed’s. Wells Fargo’s metric also fared better in its own test than under the Fed’s, by 0.8 of a point. Conversely, JPMorgan’s analysis appeared to be more dour, with its CET1 ratio coming in 1.3 percentage points below the Fed’s. Bank of America’s was 0.7 of a point worse. Banks that decide to resubmit their plans can only make downward revisions to the amount of capital they plan to use, meaning management teams that were too conservative may regret their submissions even if they pass. “If there is disappointment next week,” said Seiberg, “it is likely because the banks failed to ask for big enough distributions more than it is because the Federal Reserve was too tough.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - It took less than 24 hours for Warren Buffett, one of the world’s savviest dealmakers, to make a C$360 million (US$272 million) paper profit by propping up a major Canadian lender on life support. “It’s a typical Buffett bailout trade,” said Jared Dillian, an independent investment strategist and former trader betting the value of the Canadian dollar and several Canadian banks will fall. “He’s set it up where he’s risking a small amount to make a lot.” Its share price soared 27.2 percent on Thursday to C$19.00, leaving Buffett with a potential 90 percent paper profit on shares he is buying for just C$10 each. Home Capital’s share price nonetheless remains nearly two-thirds below its 2014 peak. “The deal is really low risk,” said John Huber, a portfolio manager at Saber Capital Management LLC in Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns Berkshire stock. “It’s an opportunistic deal that gives him very attractive risk-return terms.” Berkshire’s infusion was much needed by Home Capital, which has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run after being accused of, and then admitting to, concealing mortgage fraud. “The assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving,” said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst. “It implies a seal of approval.” Berkshire’s investment lets Buffett deploy some of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills. “Today’s announcement is a modest positive,” wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst. “But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.” Berkshire’s Columbia Insurance unit is acquiring the Home Capital equity, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, the credit line, if fully tapped, could generate C$180 million for Berkshire. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. His $5 billion Bank of America bet looks particularly savvy: it throws off $300 million in annual dividends, and Berkshire is sitting on an $11 billion gain on accompanying warrants. But with most of those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to requests for further comment. Home Capital’s problems accelerated in mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. “Reputational risk is why he’s getting 9 percent interest” at Home Capital, Seifert said. Berkshire has other investments tied to real estate, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. It also has several investments in Canada, including the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, for which it paid about $C3.1 billion in 2014. Many of Berkshire’s more than 90 business units also offer goods and services in the country, including the Ben Bridge jeweler, Benjamin Moore paints and the BNSF railroad. Despite his paper profit on Home Capital, Buffett believes investment gains and losses in a given period are usually meaningless. Buffett’s foray into Canadian real estate comes amid uncertainty about that country’s housing sector. The Ontario government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is “not going to stop the credit cycle up there,” said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital. “But it’s a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.” ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Youth tobacco use in the United States fell to historic lows in 2016, leading public health experts to speculate that a smoke-free generation may be within reach. The number of middle and high school students who used any tobacco product fell to 3.9 million in 2016 from 4.7 million in 2015, figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show, the first such decline since the CDC began reporting the measure in 2011. The number of high school students who smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior to being surveyed fell to 8 percent from 9.3 percent in 2015, the data shows. In 2011 the number was 15.8 percent. “This represents a historic public health victory,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, adding that the dramatic decline was the result of public messaging campaigns directed at youth. The decline in e-cigarette use was even greater, falling to 11.3 percent of high schoolers in 2016 from 16 percent in 2015. “These numbers are astounding,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the department of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health. “It really means that we may be within reach of a smoke-free generation.” The decline in cigarette use follows a broad array of public health campaigns and coincides with the rise of vaping. “This should put to bed any remaining concerns that e-cigarettes are a gateway to cigarettes or will lead to a re-normalization of smoking,” Siegel said. Between 2011 and 2016 overall tobacco use remained unchanged, the CDC’s figures show, though the balance between products changed. As e-cigarette use increased, traditional cigarette use declined. Cigarette use among high school students fell during that period to 8 percent from 15.8 percent while use of cigars fell to 7.7 percent from 11.6 percent. At the same time use of e-cigarettes rose to 11.3 percent from 1.5 percent and use of hookahs rose to 4.8 percent from 4.1 percent. President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes a nearly 20 percent drop in the CDC’s disease prevention and health promotion programs, including eliminating dedicated funding for its Office on Smoking and Health. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement that while the latest figures were encouraging “it is critical that we work to ensure this downward trend continues over the long term across all tobacco products.” He said the agency had issued more than 4,000 warning letters to retailers for selling e-cigarettes, cigars or hookah tobacco to minors since youth access restrictions went into effect last August. Gottlieb, who previously held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, has said publicly that certain e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. The latest data showed no decline in cigarette use among middle school students, where the rate was 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2015. Among middle school students, 4.3 percent used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 5.3 percent in 2015. Analysts with Wells Fargo Securities expect sales of vaping products to reach $4.4 billion in 2017.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters Health) - Tobacco companies have been selling electronic cigarettes as a way to wean smokers off paper cigarettes, but a new study suggests the strategy could backfire. The report in Preventive Medicine found that young adults who occasionally smoked conventional cigarettes smoked more of them if they also used e-cigarettes – battery-powered gadgets that heat liquid nicotine into vapor. “The participants who were vaping ended up using more cigarettes. It’s actually a risk factor for increasing their cigarette use,” lead author Neal Doran said in a phone interview. “They’re not using e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking,” said Doran, a psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Though smokers have been turning to e-cigarettes since they came on the market in 2007 as a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco, little is known about the long-term effects of the practice known as “vaping.” E-cigarette use grew 900 percent among high school students from 2011 through 2015, according to a report from U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The 2016 report declares e-cigarettes “unsafe” for youth and young adults (bit.ly/2sKHv9P). The new study’s findings are “consistent with the worry that, regardless of whether vaping is itself unsafe, vaping causes worse outcomes because it leads to more consumption of cigarettes,” Doran said. Stanton Glantz, who directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the study “has tremendous policy implications.” “What this study shows very convincingly is that if they’re using e-cigarettes it’s actually leading them to smoke more conventional cigarettes, not less,” he said. Glantz was not involved with the new study, but the findings are consistent with those of previous research he conducted on adolescents. “The e-cigarettes are having the effect of stimulating conventional cigarette smoking,” he said in a phone interview. “They’re propping up and reinforcing the conventional cigarette market.” Doran and his team studied 319 Californians, ages 18 to 24. At the start, participants did not smoke daily but had smoked at least one cigarette in the prior six months. During the study, they reported their frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use five times at three-month intervals. Those who vaped more also reported smoking 18 percent more cigarettes, the study found. “In the larger scheme of things, e-cigarettes could be good, bad or neutral,” Doran said. “I don’t think we know the answers yet. This is one of the ways in which they could be bad – by people increasing their cigarette use if they’re using both.” Dual users may be exposed to more nicotine and wind up at risk for chronic tobacco use and dependence, the authors write. Previous studies have shown that e-cigarette use increases the risk of smoking tobacco-filled cigarettes. Some prior studies suggest that e-cigarette vapor may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke. But electronic alternatives nonetheless release potentially hazardous chemicals. Sales of vaping products are expected to reach $4.4 billion this year, according to Wells Fargo Securities analysts. With flavors like bubble gum and chocolate peanut butter cup, e-cigarettes or vape pens are often packaged to appeal to youth, who experts believe are more vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering banning flavored tobacco products. Residents opposed to the legislation recently argued that e-cigarettes help them smoke less. But, Glantz said, “This paper shows exactly the opposite is true.” Numbers released this month from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing declines in youth use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes have led some to claim that as proof of the benefits of vaping. But Doran and Glantz don’t see it that way. Instead, Glantz said he views the smoking decreases as evidence of efforts to educate youth about the potential harms of e-cigarettes as well as the results of efforts to regulate e-cigarettes with clean-indoor air laws and minimum-age requirements. States and local jurisdictions have imposed a patchwork of laws pertaining to the use of electronic cigarettes, and some states, including California, now tax vape products. “There’s this Wild West atmosphere with e-cigarettes, and there’s a lot of controversy and disagreement about whether they’re good or bad,” Doran said. “If they’re harmless, and they help people quit, then they’re great. If they make it harder to quit and also encourage people to smoke cigarettes who would not have smoked otherwise, then they’re terrible,” he said. “The truth probably lies in the middle, but where exactly is the key question.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tscS56 and bit.ly/2rBKmg8 Preventive Medicine, online June 3, 2017.

(PM) carries the highest sector capitalization for tobacco producers trading on the U.S. exchanges at $184 billion. It spun off from parent Altria Group, Inc. (MO) at $50 in March 2008 and entered an immediate downtrend that posted an all-time low at $32.04 in March 2009. The subsequent recovery wave reached the upper $90s in 2013, giving way to a multi-year correction that found support in the mid-$70s. The stock rallied above the prior high in 2016 and stalled out, building a base on new support and then spiraling lower in November. That marked the washout low, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reinstated the breakout in January 2017, followed by a powerful trend advance to an all-time high at $122.90 on June 6. Philip Morris stock has been pulling back in a bull flag pattern since that time, while daily stochastics have dropped into the oversold zone. (See also: Philip Morris, the Best Is Yet to Come: Wells Fargo.) Both monthly and weekly indicators have held buy cycles through this period, signaling a bullish divergence and potential pullback buying opportunity ahead of continued upside. Even so, a more advantageous trade entry might come if aggressive sellers break short-term support and knock the stock down to the top of the first quarter range and 50-day EMA at $115. Altria Group expanded into spirits and finance leasing services following the Philip Morris spin-off,​ but tobacco remains its biggest profit component. It fell just 7 points during the 2008 economic collapse, returning to the prior high in 2010, ahead of a 2011 breakout that reached $70.14 in July 2016. A pullback into the fourth quarter settled near $60, ahead of a January 2017 rally into March's all-time high at $76.54. (See also: Altria Optimistic on FDA's Filing of Heated Products.) Altria Group shares sold off into May, testing new support near $70 and turning higher into June, settling into a narrow platform that traded within 60 cents of resistance this week. On-balance volume (OBV) has already risen to a new high, highlighting strong institutional sponsorship that should support a fresh rally leg into the low $80s, where a two-year rising-highs trendline could trigger another reversal. Reynolds American Inc (RAI) rallied above the 2008 high in 2011 and entered a rising channel that accelerated into a steeper channel in 2014, highlighting impressive relative strength. The uptrend stalled near $50 at the end of 2015, giving way to a shallow correction that ended with a high-volume October gap to a new high in the mid-$50s. It took three months to clear the high posted in that session, yielding a long series of new highs into last week. (For more, see: Reynolds Announces Leadership Roles Post Acquisition by BAT.) The stock sold off with the broad market, dropping into the first test at the 50-day EMA since January, and it is still testing that level. Weekly stochastics fell into an unconfirmed sell cycle in reaction to the decline, raising odds for an intermediate correction lasting a minimum of eight to 12 weeks. Given this scenario, a pullback into deep support at $50 could offer a buying opportunity. Tobacco manufacturers and distributors are leading the broad market, resistant to broad headwinds facing other high-yielding instruments. This resilience could last into the new decade, given humankind's addictive interest in the controversial crop.

Michael J. Kramer,06222017,Investopedia,06152017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs What exactly is Visa Inc. (V)? Is it a financial firm or a credit services provider? What about a technology company? That sounds crazy, right? Or does it? Don't believe me; look at the makeup of the Financial Select Sectors SPDR ETF (XLF) and see the top 25 holdings: There's no Visa. Yeah, it is a company with a market cap of almost $220 billion, bigger than that of Citigroup (C), but it's not in the top 25 of the financials. So if it's not a financial, then what is it? Well, of course, Visa is a tech company! Just look at the Technology Select Sector XLK SPDR (XLK), and there it is: Visa with 3.38 percent weighting in the ETF. By the way, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is also there, with a 2.21 percent weighting. Incredible, right? How come Visa and Mastercard are technology companies while American Express is a financial company? There's a simple answer: The three companies are fundamentally different in a significant way. Visa is an electronic payment network, while American Express issues cards and takes on the debt of its cardholders. Fundamentally, banks and financials depend for the most part on interest rates because when banks lend money, they charge a rate of interest. When rates are low they make less money, and when rates rise they make more money. Currently, interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve all go to a bank's ability to make money. Visa is dependent on how many transactions are occurring on its network charging a fee for the use of the network. Financials also have default risks associated with them that a company like Visa does not. Because banks and financials hold the debts of their cardholders, there is a risk the cardholder will not pay those debts and default on them, resulting in a loss for the card issuer. Again, for a company such as Visa, those risks are not present. Visa's biggest risk would be declining usage of its network. V PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts  All of this matters because of the way investors value the company. Visa is priced as a growth stock with a 2018 forward P/E ratio of almost 28. We can see why. Analysts are looking for Visa's revenue to grow to $21.81 billion by 2019 from $17.88 billion in 2017, a growth rate of almost 22 percent. V Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Compare that to the growth of American Express, where revenue is expected to grow to $35.99 billion from $32.74 billion, a top-line growth rate of only 10 percent. AXP Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The difference is reflected in the performance of the stocks over the past decade or so. V data by YCharts Visa's stock performance resembles that much more of a technology company than a financial company. The market certainly values Visa like a tech company, with a valuation closer to that of Facebook Inc. (FB) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) than JP Morgan Chase & Co.(JPM), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), or American Express.

Jeff Cox,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for the ouster of 12 board members at Wells Fargo due to the fake accounts scandal that has rocked the bank. In a letter sent Monday to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, the Massachusetts Democrat said the scandal has ""revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices."" Warren said the central bank has the authority under federal statute to remove the members who were on the board as the matter transpired. ""We have received the letter and plan to respond,"" a Fed spokesman told CNBC. In an agreement with multiple authorities last September, Wells agreed to pay a $185 million fine in conjunction with a scandal in which some 2 million client accounts were created without the customers' knowledge. More accounts may be involved, according to subsequent allegations. Even after paying the fine, Wells has continued to undergo reputational damage amid congressional inquiries and additional disclosures Warren, who has been a harsh critic, pointed out in the letter multiple instances where she believes the board at Wells failed customers. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices — problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Wells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo shares gained about 1.1 percent in early trading, about in line with the sector. Warren did not limit her criticism to Wells — she also said the Fed ""has done nothing to date"" to punish the bank ""despite its ample statutory authority."" ""I urge you to use the tools Congress has given you to remove the responsible board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country's largest banks,"" she wrote. The scandal arose as bank employees sought to meet aggressive sales demands. Employees would enroll customers in various programs without their consent in order to make quotas that have since been disbanded. Some 5,300 employees have been terminated as a result, and the bank also has a new CEO, Timothy J. Sloan, who took over for John Stumpf. For the Fed to act, it would need to establish that any individual board member's actions were unsafe or unsound to the bank. The Fed likely would need to initiate an enforcement action and prove its case. Yellen told Congress during testimony shortly after the scandal broke in September that the Fed is reviewing all operations for large banks and believes that in cases of wrongdoing, ""senior management (should) be held accountable.""

Antony Currie,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wells Fargo is driving its stagecoach further into the mud. The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers' mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right. The actions at issue might seem to help struggling borrowers: Wells Fargo lowered some customers' monthly mortgage payments, potentially making them manageable. But there are two huge potential problems. First, the bank did this while also extending the duration of the loans – in one case by some 30 years. That greatly increased the total interest borrowers were on the hook to pay over the life of their loans. Second, Wells Fargo made these changes, according to the lawsuits, without getting the consent of either the customers or the relevant bankruptcy courts. Wells Fargo denies this, saying it notified customers and does ""not finalize a loan modification without receiving signed documents"" from the required parties. The trouble is, Wells Fargo has mucked up mortgage lending and modification in the past. It was one of the five lenders that in 2012 agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government and 49 states to rectify poor loan servicing and foreclosure practices. Last year it forked over $1.2 billion to settle claims of reckless lending under a Federal Housing Administration program. Home loans should have been squeaky-clean after all that. Add to that its recent $185 million fine after retail bankers chasing aggressive account-opening targets created 2 million fake bank and credit-card accounts – events that cost former Chief Executive John Stumpf his job – and there's a sense of a bank still not ensuring it has fundamental checks and balances in place. Wells Fargo isn't alone. The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 exposed the many failings of the financial-services industry. For now, though, most of its big rivals appear to have put the worst of their transgressions behind them. Sloan's shop keeps swerving into new ones.

Nvidia declined more than 5 percent over the past week through midday Thursday, while AMD fell 12 percent in that time period.The Nvidia decline was in part sparked by a negative Citron Research report on Nvidia Friday.""Take your profits and move on to Google (Alphabet). Exposure to the identical array of 'sexy businesses' with less risk on the downside,"" Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a post entitled ""NVIDIA: The Moment that Separates the Gamblers from the Investors.

Left cited competition coming from Intel, Google and Xilinx in the data center markets and the likelihood of slowing growth in its gaming graphics card business as reasons for his skeptical view on Nvidia's market value.Wells Fargo is also concerned over rising competition in Nvidia's data center business. The firm reiterated its underperform rating on the company Wednesday.""We think that Nvidia has done very well in establishing itself as the dominant provider of standalone accelerator solutions for data center, but believe that this is already reflected in Nvidia's stock value,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Wong wrote in a note to clients. ""Over time we think additional providers of standalone accelerators might emerge, helping to drive growth in the standalone processor market but reducing Nvidia's market share in this market.""Even with the move lower, Nvidia shares have rallied 218 percent through midday Thursday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 17 percent return. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. AMD is right behind at No. 2 with a 156 percent return in the same time period.

But that's exactly what happened on Wednesday, confounding many analysts who predicted higher long-term rates. The Fed made its widely expected move, raising its overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent, keying off data that showed the U.S. economy at full employment and growing steadily. The central bank's upgraded ""dot plot,"" which maps where central bank officials see rates headed in the future, suggests that another rate hike could be coming later this year. More from ETF.com:Tech ETFs retreat: Pullback aheadHere's what advisors are worried aboutMuni ETFs: No summer vacation But at least for now, the bond market doesn't care. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped by 8 basis points to 2.13 percent after briefly touching 2.1 percent earlier on Wednesday, its lowest level of 2017 (bond prices and yields move inversely). U.S. 10-Year Treasury Bond Yield In turn, many bond ETFs, such as the $46 billion iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), hit their highest levels of the year. AGG is now up 2.8 percent, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is up 4.6 percent; and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) is up 7.1 percent. Those numbers are particularly impressive considering this was supposed to be a bad year for bonds based on the consensus expectation at the start of 2017. YTD Returns For AGG, LQD, TLT According to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, the moves in bond prices on Wednesday may have less to do with the Fed rate hike than a pair of tepid economic data points released on the same day. Early in the day, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell by 0.1 percent in May, while its core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices) only grew by 0.1 percent, below the 0.2 percent increase that was anticipated. That translates into year-over-year growth of 1.9 percent for the headline CPI and 1.7 percent for the core CPI ― both below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target ― and the lowest reading for the core in two years. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in May sagged by 0.3 percent, much worse than the zero change that was expected and the largest decline in 16 months. ""The data that came out on Wednesday showing a slowdown in inflation and contraction in retail sales has made people question whether the Fed will hike as aggressively as previously thought,"" explained Jacobsen. ""The big move in 10-year yields came around the same time as the CPI and retail sales data came out. Weak consumer spending and slowing inflation means the terminal rate for the federal funds rate may be well below what the Fed's aiming for,"" he added. Perhaps the fall in the 10-year yield shouldn't have been surprising. There's been a familiar pattern in recent years where investors anticipate that rates will finally take off as the economy improves, only to see them come back down as data disappoints. In fact, despite all the hand-wringing about rising rates ever since the Fed embarked on the current tightening cycle in late 2015, it turns out that the 10-year yield is actually lower today than it was when the central bank made its first hike. Currently, the 10-year yield stands at 2.13 percent compared with 2.30 percent on Dec. 16, 2015. Even the five-year yield is lower, at 1.73 percent currently, compared with 1.75 percent on the day of the first hike. Wells Fargo's Jacobsen says that for anyone who's been waiting for higher interest rates to invest in bonds, now may be the time to throw in the towel. ""It could feel like a bus that never shows up if you're waiting for yields to spike higher. If you've been sitting in cash and waiting for yields to rise before getting back to your strategic allocation to fixed income, you may want to start dollar cost averaging toward your target,"" he explained. Equities have taken these lower rates in stride. The S&P 500 remains in record-high territory amid record-low volatility. Investors aren't interpreting lower rates as a bad thing, except for perhaps financials, which is now the second-worst-performing stock market sector behind energy. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up 5.3 percent this year, well behind the 9 percent gain for the broader S&P 500. ""Financials have been hurt by the flattening yield curve,"" Jacobsen noted. ""That doesn't look to be getting any better anytime soon. If the Fed talks up another rate hike before the inflation data actually turns, I'd worry about the Fed being too far ahead of the curve rather than too far behind it.""

Brian Price,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"With bullion recently hitting a three-week low of $1,257, one commodities trader is adamant that the charts are signaling sunshine on the horizon for gold bugs. Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services, is undeterred by what's been a volatile June for gold as he believes the commodity will enter into a long-term uptrend swing. ""I'm a longer-term bull in gold and if you look at the long-term chart the trend is still higher,"" Iuorio said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""What the Fed said yesterday is disconcerting to the market, and that's why the dollar rallied so hard."" The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for only the fourth time since the financial crisis, which was expected. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen took a decisively more hawkish tone despite the fact that inflation has fallen behind estimates. Iuorio feels deteriorating data will soon pull dollar prices down and, if gold stays above $1,235, then the longer trend is ultimately positive for the yellow metal. Historically, the dollar and gold are inversely correlated as a fall in dollar prices increases the value of other currencies. Such a move drives demand for commodities, like gold, as investors seek alternative assets to invest in. However, Iuorio warned that more hawkish rhetoric could indeed deter his thesis. ""I'm going to be wrong if they keep that talk up,"" the trader said. ""Gold's going to go lower. If it settles below $1,230, that's going to change me into a bear."" That said, Iuorio doesn't believe the Fed can continue with its hawkish tone and therefore feels confident in where gold prices are heading. Lastly, another factor for gold prices in the near term could be India. Bob Iaccino, of Path Trading Partners, noted on ""Futures Now"" that a tax on the precious metal is slated to go into effect at the end of the month in that country. This could cause local jewelers and private citizens to rush into the market and purchase gold in bulk before the tax comes into play, which would also help drive prices higher.

On CNBC's ""Futures Now"" Tuesday, Paul Ciana of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that based on the charts, oil is well on its way to dropping to the $30 range, levels unseen since last April. ""It just keeps going down, breaking supports and failing at lower resistance levels,"" said Ciana. ""It's the absolute definition of a downtrend."" But on the same chart of oil, Ciana also pointed out that the crude crush could actually be signaling a rally in the bond market. A note released by BofAML on Tuesday, titled ""Bonds smile as oil cries,"" remarked on the inverse moves between crude and bonds that has been occurring over the past years. According to Ciana, the inverse relationship is playing out once again ""on an even larger scale,"" meaning that if crude continues to fall, bonds could soar even higher. ""Bond prices have risen to exceed the peak of [that double bottom this year, confirming] that the U.S. 10-year yield will likely fall to 1.97 percent this summer, if not sooner,"" he explained. Additionally, stocks could also be in trouble if crude falls. While Ciana doesn't see oil being a direct cause of a downturn in the market, depending on ""how much more the decline accelerates"" in crude, it could intensify any drop that may happen. And the outlook for crude on a fundamental basis isn't too positive, as Ciana also points out that demand for crude may fall during the summer.With Tuesday's drop, oil prices have now sunk 19 percent year to date, largely thanks to supply issues related to OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Ciana does see $45.50 being a key level to reach and hold for oil, meaning that the commodity would need to rally 4 percent for some of the concerns to subside. Additionally, stocks could also be in trouble if crude falls.

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Elizabeth Warren hates big banks. But none more so than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Her displeasure with the California-based bank is understandable given that Wells Fargo spent the last decade and a half opening fake accounts for customers in order to artificially inflate its performance and thereby maximize its executives' annual bonuses. The latest example of Warren's ire was on display Monday, when she sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen calling for the removal of 12 members of Wells Fargo's board of directors -- for the record, that'd leave only three. ""The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo customers millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and damaged many of their credit scores,"" the senator wrote, according to CNBC, which first reported on the letter. ""The scandal also revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices -- problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" Senator Elizabeth Warren. Image source: Senator Warren's official website. Wells Fargo's executives deserve the blame and vitriol that have been heaped on them since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau disclosed the scam last year. While they make millions of dollars a year, the customers they preyed on were among the most vulnerable citizens in the country -- retirees living on fixed incomes and recent immigrants. To make matters worse, the company then retaliated against employees who sought to blow the whistle on the scam. Under the watch of Wells Fargo's executives and the board's oversight, the 160-year-old bank's once-sterling reputation has been deeply sullied. Given this, it's hard to disagree with Warren's assessment of Wells Fargo. The board was ultimately responsible for policing these types of risks and behaviors. The fact that they didn't, and that the scam was in many ways an indispensable element of Wells Fargo's business model, is prima facie evidence that they bear culpability for it. At the same time, one might find it worth acknowledging that Wells Fargo's directors were deceived in a sense, too. Prior to the fallout, the board's principal liaison with the bank's operating committee was John Stumpf, who at the time, though no longer, was both its chairman and CEO. As the company wrote in its 2015 proxy statement: Mr. Stumpf, with over 33 years of experience at Wells Fargo, has the knowledge, expertise, and experience to understand and clearly articulate to the Board the opportunities and risks facing the Company, as well as the leadership and management skills to promote and execute the Company's vision, values and strategy. The Board believes that Mr. Stumpf, rather than an outside director, is in the best position, as Chairman and CEO, to lead Board discussions regarding the Company's business and strategy and to help the Board respond quickly and effectively to the many business, market, and regulatory reform issues affecting the Company and the rapidly changing financial services industry. This description is laughable in hindsight, but Stumpf and his predecessor Dick Kovacevich had purposefully cultivated such a pristine image by then that few people would have questioned them. Image source: The Motley Fool. There's also value to keeping some of these directors around. They made an enormous and egregious mistake, but one can hope that they learned a lesson in their failure to perform their oversight duties. And that lesson, if it indeed has been learned, could very well make Wells Fargo a stronger organization. That may or may not be a fair assessment, but assuming that it is, there's value to their continued presence on the board. It's like the story of Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, who learned of an employee's mistake that cost the company $1 million. Watson not only refused to fire the employee, but he even rejected the employee's letter of resignation. ""Fire you?"" Watson responded. ""I've just invested one million dollars in your education.""

Image source: Getty Images. The fundamental challenge facing the banking industry is that the core product is a commodity. At its most basic level, every bank offers the same standard bank account, car loan, mortgage, and so on. Thus a bank's ability to provide other services and features that keep their customers coming back is paramount to retaining deposits and making profitable loans. Below, we'll explore the nine banks ranked most highly on customer loyalty as measured by Brand Keys, from first to the worst. Image source: Company. The largest bank by assets in the United States, JPMorgan has its hands in virtually everything related to banking and finance. The company boasts that it has a relationship with 60 million households in the United States. Its Chase credit card unit scores highly among everyday spenders and the affluent alike, receiving high marks for rewards and customer service, which gives it the No. 1 position in cards. Image source: Company. Unlike the others in the Big Four U.S. banks, Citi is really a global banking institution. It operates out of the world's largest metropolitan areas and has only a modest presence in smaller cities in the U.S. Yet it has remarkable reach into consumer spending through its credit cards business, which recently won a partnership with Costco, giving it the ability to tap into the wallets of the wholesale retailers' 53 million members with its highly rated Costco co-brand card. Customers love its cards' Price Rewind feature, which enables its cardholders to get a refund automatically when a product is advertised at a lower price within 60 days after purchase. Image source: Company. When Brian Moynihan took the job as Bank of America's chief executive officer, he made the customer experience paramount in rebuilding the bank's image -- and its profitability. Bank of America has invested heavily in its mobile and online banking services to improve customer satisfaction even as it has reduced the number of branches across the United States. The investment has paid off handsomely in the form of increased customer loyalty and approval ratings. Customers processed 108 million checks through the mobile app versus 170 million deposits in one of its branches last year. The bank brought private banking services to all of its clients with a banking-by-appointment feature so that its customers never have to wait in line to speak to a representative. Image source: Company. Bank of New York is hardly a traditional bank. It operates as a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides the back-end accounting services to keep everything running smoothly. Custody banks have inherently loyal customers due to the fact that moving billions of dollars of assets to another custodian is no easy task, and because the bank benefits from scale that enables it to manage its customers' assets at a price other banks would struggle to match. Image source: Company. Like Bank of America, PNC is ahead of the curve in creating products that are more convenient for customers while being more profitable for the bank. Thanks to investments in its online and mobile banking products, it recently reported that 60% of its customers use its ""non-teller channels"" for the majority of their transactions, up from 40% just three years ago. Its Virtual Wallet service enables its customers to make a budget, manage bills with the help of a calendar, and quickly see how they spend each and every dollar that flows into their accounts. Image source: Company. Once a pure-play credit card issuer, Capital One has become a bona fide banking operation that offers everything from checking and savings accounts to auto loans and even commercial banking services. The bank made inroads with consumers when it acquired ING Direct in 2011, which brought the bank more than 7 million customers who used its online banking services. Capital One has built on its ING Direct acquisition with an online banking service that its customers love -- a recent presentation notes that its mobile applications score the highest ratings in the iOS App Store. The bank also offers some of the highest-yielding money market accounts of any bank on this list, which certainly helps to keep its customers' loyalty. Image source: Company. Once known as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC is a worldwide banking operation that operates primarily as a corporate bank and credit card issuer in the United States. The company makes its ""internationally minded"" customers its priority through HSBC Premier, which provides banking and wealth management services to the mass affluent who live in large cities spanning from Seattle to New York City. With 2.4 million customers in the U.S., it has the smallest domestic operation of any of the banks on this list, given its focus on wealthier, international customers. Image source: Company. Calling itself ""America's Most Convenient Bank,"" TD Bank provides retail banking services to 9 million customers through approximately 1,300 branches along the East Coast. Its TD Select Savings Account offers free ATM services and reimburses customers for ATM fees charged at non-TD ATMs around the country. The company has mastered campaigns designed to promote customer loyalty, famously turning its ATMs into ""Automated Thanking Machines"" to deliver gifts to its customers -- cash, a trip to Trinidad to see a family member, and a unique experience throwing out a first pitch at a Blue Jays home game, for example. Image source: Company. Known colloquially as ""America's largest community bank,"" Wells Fargo has always operated as a simple retail banking institution. Convenience is key to customer loyalty, and Wells Fargo has the largest retail branch network of any U.S. bank, providing service to its customers through 6,200 banking locations and 12,000 ATMs scattered from coast to coast. Thanks to its large mortgage servicing business, it also has a relationship with millions of homeowners who aren't located near one of its branches. ","

John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you follow bank stocks and big bank stocks, in particular, you should get acquainted with the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks. I refer to it frequently when I write, and therefore want to give readers a brief overview of exactly what it is, and why investors should care about it. The best way to think about the KBW Bank Index is to analogize it to the S&P 500, which tracks shares of 500 publicly traded companies with the largest market capitalizations in the United States. But instead of being industry agnostic, as the S&P 500 is, the KBW Bank Index focuses on only large-cap banks -- 24 of them, to be precise. These are banks that you've no doubt heard of, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). These are the four biggest banks in the country. They're also -- with the exception of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), the best-run big bank in the country -- the four that are weighted most heavily on the KBW Bank Index. The index weights its components according to a measure of market capitalization, adjusted for a bank's share price. This helps to explain why, as you can see in the table below, Citigroup carries the greatest weight on the Index, even though it has a smaller market capitalization than JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, respectively. Name Weight on KBW Bank Index Citigroup 8.82% Bank of America 7.85% JPMorgan Chase 7.83% US Bancorp 7.83% Wells Fargo 7.68% State Street 4.54% Bank of New York Mellon 4.30% Northern Trust 4.03% PNC Financial 3.97% M&T Bank 3.97% SunTrust Banks 3.87% KeyCorp 3.81% BB&T 3.76% Fifth Third 3.63% Citizens Financial 3.52% Capital One 3.48% Regions Financial 3.30% First Republic Bank 2.86% Huntington Bancshares 2.75% Comerica 2.47% SVB Financial 1.80% Zions Bancorporation 1.65% New York Community Bancorp 1.25% People's United Financial 1.06% Source: Invesco. There's one side note that's worth pointing out when it comes to the KBW Bank Index. That is, not all of these banks have the same business model. Some are universal banks, which operate both investment and commercial-banking operations. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup fall most comfortably into this category. A second group consists of so-called custodial or trust banks. The three banks on the list that most naturally fall into this category are State Street, Northern Trust, and Bank of New York Mellon -- and I consider the latter to be a particularly interesting bank. These banks focus less on making loans and taking deposits and more on the administration of fixed-income securities for institutional investors like hedge funds, university endowments, and insurance companies. The final group are pure-play commercial banks, specializing in taking deposits and making loans. When most people think about a bank's business model, this is what they have in mind. The largest among these is Wells Fargo, followed by U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial, and Capital One Financial, respectively. Image source: Getty Images. An index like this is important for investors because it allows you to see whether a particular stock is in line with its peer group. Viewed in isolation, it's impossible to say whether a particular bank stock is cheap or expensive -- or efficient or inefficient -- or whatever metric it is that you're trying to tease out. But if you have a control group against which to compare a bank's valuation, profitability, or efficiency, then you can get a much better idea of its relative value or performance, which explains why I can confidently say that U.S. Bancorp is the best-run big bank in the country. This is what the KBW Bank Index enables one to do. And it's why I recommend that investors have a general understanding of what it is and how to use it. ","

Christy Bieber,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chase announced recently that its Sapphire, Sapphire Preferred, and Sapphire Reserve cardholders would be eligible for 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points if they obtained a mortgage with Chase bank by Aug. 6, 2017.  The offer was available only for current cardholders and only for a new purchase, not a refinance. It was not the first offer of its kind -- Capital One also made an offer of free mileage last year, and Wells Fargo has offered rebates for mortgage loans in the past -- but it was a generous offer, with rewards points worth around 2.1 cents per point. While getting points or other rewards for taking out a mortgage loan seems attractive if you're thinking about buying a home anyway, there are three big reasons why it's unwise to go with a particular mortgage lender just to earn miles or other credit card rewards. Image Source: Getty Images. Chase made its announcement in May and stipulated that cardholders who want the points would have to apply by the deadline on Aug. 6. This is a very limited amount of time to do your research into the mortgage terms offered by different lenders. Most incentive deals that mortgage lenders offer have deadlines, which puts artificial time pressure on you. Your mortgage will likely be the biggest debt you carry during your lifetime. You need time to carefully compare the different fees, interest rates, mortgage points, and other terms various lenders will offer you. The process shouldn't be rushed, and you shouldn't try to move faster than you're comfortable with just so you don't miss out on credit card points, airline miles, or other incentives. Your credit card points will be spent within a matter of months, while airlines miles earned for taking out a loan last only a trip or two. A mortgage is an obligation lasting 15 to 30 years. If you buy a house before you're ready because you don't want to miss out on a mortgage incentive, you'll be stuck with a real estate commission, transfer tax, and a host of other expensive costs if you need to sell the home. Unless you have all of your ducks on a row -- like a 20% down payment at the ready, as well as an emergency fund to cover maintenance and repairs -- you could also end up having to pay for private mortgage insurance or fall into debt if something unexpected happens. If you jump into a loan too fast, you may also feel the need to refinance a few years down the road in order to get better terms. Refinancing is a costly process, as you have to pay for a new appraisal and the closing costs of the new loan. Getting out of one mortgage loan and into another is also a time-consuming process that requires you to produce lots of paperwork. Banks may make up the cost by charging a slightly higher mortgage loan rate -- Chase's rates as of late May were 3.875% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan, while Bankrate had some lenders offering rates as low as 3.750% -- or they may charge more than other lenders for various costs like the credit check, home appraisal, loan origination fee, or underwriting fee. Even a small difference in interest can make a big difference in payments. A $200,000 loan at 3.750% would cost you $926 per month, and the total loan cost would be $333,443. By comparison, the same $200,000 mortgage at a 3.875% interest rate would come with payments of $940 per month, and the total cost of the loan would be $338,571. That tiny difference in the interest rate would cost you an extra $5,000 over the life of the loan -- and odds are the rewards you earned wouldn't come close to that value. Don't cheat yourself out of thousands of dollars by falling for a gimmick. Wait until you're ready to buy a home, carefully research different lenders with good reputations, and choose the best overall deal. If you just happen to get a reward from that lender, that bonus will be icing on the cake. ","
      
    3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Open a Mortgage to Get Rewards -- The Motley Fool

If you're in the market for a bank stock, then valuation is one thing you should keep in mind. Holding all else equal, the cheaper you can buy a stock, the bigger your return is likely to be. It's for this reason that I intermittently check bank stock valuations on the KBW Bank Index, the leading index of large-cap bank stocks headquartered in the United States. The average stock on the index trades for 15.5 times the bank's projected earnings per share over the next 12 months. That's not cheap, but it's far from expensive when you consider that the average stock on the S&P 500 is valued at 35 times forward earnings. But while bank stocks in general are valued at a lower multiple to earnings than the typical large-cap stock, some banks are still cheaper than others. Based on the forward P/E ratio, here are the five cheapest big bank stocks right now: Stock Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) 10.6 Citigroup (NYSE:C) 12.5 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 12.9 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 13.0 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 13.1 KBW Bank Index average 15.5 Data source: YCharts.com. Aside from Capital One, which is heavily concentrated in credit card loans and thus exposed to elevated credit risk, as credit card loans tend to default at higher rates than other types of loans, the four other cheapest big bank stocks have something in common: They're the largest banks in the country. Citigroup is the smallest of the four, yet it still has $1.8 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is the largest, overseeing $2.6 trillion in assets. And Bank of America and Wells Fargo fall in between these two. Why would these banks trade at lower valuations than smaller banks? It seems to me that there are four reasons. First, under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, global systemically important banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup can't operate with as much leverage as their smaller, simpler peers can. This is because they're subject to higher capital requirements, which necessarily reduces leverage and profitability. Second, all of these banks are effectively shut out of the market for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo each hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Therefore, they're prohibited under federal law from acquiring other banks. Citigroup doesn't face the same constraint, as its depositary base is weighted more heavily toward international deposits. But given the New York-based bank's strategy over the past few years of shrinking its balance sheet as opposed to growing it, it's safe to say that Citigroup is not in the market to acquire other banks, either. The net result is that these four banks are all largely confined to organic growth, which could weigh on their returns in the future relative to banks that aren't similarly prohibited from merging with or acquiring other banks. Image source: Getty Images. The third reason is that these four banks are especially difficult to analyze. Much of this comes from their sheer size and the extent of their operations. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup are all universal banks, meaning that they run both investment and commercial banking businesses. Commercial banking is straightforward, consisting of taking deposits and making loans. This yields recurring revenue that doesn't fluctuate widely on a quarterly or annual basis. Investment banking operations are much harder to understand and forecast into the future. This is primarily because an investment bank's top line is influenced by volume and volatility in the credit markets, both of which are all but impossible to predict in advance. Finally, while I've touched on this already, the biggest banks in the country are all subject to much more robust regulatory requirements than smaller banks. Their compliance exams are more intense. They face additional hurdles on the annual stress tests. And the way they structure their balance sheets is much more closely scrutinized by industry overseers. Does this mean you should avoid buying shares of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup? Not necessarily because, remember, while they may face more headwinds than smaller banks, their shares can also be picked up at much lower valuations. That said, as I've written in the past, given the towering heights of the stock market today, I think investors have more to gain than lose from waiting for a potential pullback in the market before diving deeper into stocks.

When I think about banks, I often think about Citigroup (NYSE:C) as being in a league of its own. It isn't because of its performance, which has left a lot to be desired over the past decade. It's rather because of its emphasis on international banking. There are a number of ways to show this, but one of the most obvious is to look at the distribution of Citigroup's deposits. More than half of the New York-based bank's deposits are held in offices outside the United States: Data source: regulatory filings. Chart by author. Even a cursory glance at this chart shows how different Citigroup is from the three other megabanks that sit atop the financial-services industry. JPMorgan Chase, which also has a large international presence, only has 17% of its deposits held in overseas offices. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo and Bank of America both come in at less than 10%. This goes to the core of Citigroup's business model. It was roughly a century ago that the bank became one of the first in the United States to establish a global banking presence, gaining footholds throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America, in addition to its operations in the United States. Citigroup not only has offices in other countries, but its operations abroad also pivot around consumer banking, the primary purpose of which is to attract deposits. This distinguishes it from the three other banks in the chart, whose international operations focus more on investment banking, as is the case with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America in particular. The purpose of investment banking is to help global corporations issue debt and equity, manage risk, and move money around the world. Image source: Getty Images. Citigroup's extensive overseas presence is a double-edged sword. While it serves to distinguish the $1.8 trillion bank from its peers, it also introduces another layer of risk. In the lead-up to the Great Depression, for instance, Citigroup gained notoriety for selling toxic Latin American bonds to its customers in the United States. And throughout the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, Citigroup came within a hair's breadth of failure because of overexposure to soured bonds issued by the likes of Brazil and Argentina. In an effort to reduce risk and simplify its business model since the financial crisis, Citigroup has pared down its operations abroad. In 2008, for instance, it sold its Japanese trust banking unit to Mitsubishi UFG Trust and Banking. Citigroup followed that up a year later by selling its retail brokerage business in Japan. And six years after that, it did the same with its retail banking operations in the East Asian country. These moves have simplified and streamlined Citigroup's business model. They've also helped the bank raise capital and de-risk its operations. But even though they represent a retreat for Citigroup in terms of its long-term focus on global banking, it's clear from the chart that the bank continues to distinguish itself from its peers in terms of the size and reach of its international footprint.

Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","

John Maxfield and Gaby Lapera,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Last week, the Financial CHOICE Act, a hulking 600-page piece of legislation regarding the banking industry, made its way through the House of Representatives. A full transcript follows the video. John Maxfield: It's going great, Gaby, how are you doing? Lapera: I'm doing pretty good. I had an exciting weekend. I was volunteering at Pride with The Motley Fool, so that was really exciting, and I went rock climbing. What a fulfilling weekend. Maxfield: Nice, that is a really fulfilling weekend. I basically spent the weekend mediating disputes between my five-year-old twin sons. [laughs] That's kind of like the referee in a boxing ring. Lapera: [laughs] Oh my gosh, I'm very impressed. My brother also has twins, and they are young and also a handful. You have the patience and energy of a saint. Talking about patience and energy, let's turn to Congress. Today, we're going to talk about the CHOICE Act, which stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs. Another in a long line of acronyms that are kind of just jammed in together to try to make something that's fun to say. The CHOICE Act just passed the House on Friday. The whole thing with the CHOICE Act, the reason that we're talking about it on the show, is that it's basically there to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is what was regulating all of the banking stuff that we've been talking about for literally, what, two years now, Maxfield? Maxfield: Yeah. Or five years. You and I have been talking about it for two years now. One of the ways that I think is really helpful to think about the Financial CHOICE Act is that, in all industries, particularly banking, you can look at it through the lens of cycles, different types of cycles -- the business cycle, the credit cycle, cycles in consumer confidence. But another cycle that you can use to think about, not only in the financial services sector, but in all sectors, is the regulatory cycle, specifically in terms of whether the industry has more power, or the regulators have more power, at any particular point in time. And after the financial crisis, when the Dodd-Frank Act was passed on largely partisan lines, basically just supported by the Democrats, that shifted a lot of power away from the industry over to regulators. And basically what the Financial CHOICE Act does is it reverses that. And it was passed in the house, like we said last week, on largely partisan lines, but the partisan lines were different: This time, it was Republicans supporting it and Democrats not supporting it. What it tries to do is take that power that Dodd-Frank gave to the regulators and give it back to the industry. Lapera: Yeah. The bill is sponsored, unsurprisingly, by a man named Jeb Hensarling, who is a Republican. As with most things political, things are falling along party lines. I want to take an opportunity to say that Maxfield and I are going to do our best to stay unbiased throughout this discussion, but everyone is a person and we all have opinions, and our opinions don't necessarily reflect that of The Motley Fool, but we're going to try to give you an informed, as objective as possible, discussion. My anthropology roots tell me that there is no way to have a completely unbiased discussion, so I'm going to leave it at that and talk a little bit more about the philosophy behind the CHOICE Act. Basically, a lot of people don't like Dodd-Frank. They think it puts too much pressure on the banks, it's too hard for them to make money the way that Dodd-Frank is structured. There's a few different parts to it, the big parts of the Financial CHOICE Act. But I think the one that a lot of people focus on is, the Financial CHOICE Act is looking to end ""too big to fail."" Maxfield: Right. To your point, Gaby, about the partisan basis, I want to address that before I jump into the too-big-to-fail part. The one thing to keep in mind is, even though Dodd-Frank was passed on partisan basis, and the Financial CHOICE Act made it through the House on a partisan basis, the fact of the matter is, almost everybody agrees, most knowledgeable sources agree, that Dodd-Frank went too far. And I'm somebody who thinks that there needs to be a robust regulatory framework around the banking systems, just because banks are so highly leveraged, and because they play a role in the monetary system of the United States and they're kind of, to a certain extent, an extension of the federal government. So you can't let banks go out there and do what they want, because they are acting, in a sense, on the part of taxpayers. So I think that's some good context to keep in mind. But Dodd-Frank, almost everybody would agree that it did go too far. So now the question is, how far do you tailor it back? Lapera: Yeah. And to get into that about being an extension of the government, it's not just that with the systemically important financial institutions. It's not just our country -- it's the entire world is tied into these financial systems. So people get concerned that if they fail, it's going to be -- to borrow a term from the Vietnam era -- a domino effect with other people's economies. So there is a lot of feelings riding on this, and a lot of this depends on how you view economic theory. I think 90% agree with you that Dodd-Frank potentially went too far. I don't know that the CHOICE Act is the answer, either. We'll see what happens. We'll get a little bit more into it. Let's talk a little bit about the actual components of the Financial CHOICE Act, and what they look like, what they mean in terms of existing legislation. Like I said earlier, too big to fail -- that's one of the big key components, ending too big to fail, of the Financial CHOICE Act. Maxfield: Right, if we go back to the financial crisis, here's an overarching way to think about this too-big-to-fail component. You had Citigroup, Bank of America, and AIG, you had your Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns -- these very large financial institutions. These financial institutions hold trillions of dollars in assets on their balance sheets, and oversee a large chunk of the deposits that you and I and everyone else deposits. So if one of those were to fail, it could cause catastrophic damage to the economy. In fact, if you go back to the Great Depression, the thing that caused the Great Depression, or transformed it from a typical recession into the Great Depression, was the failure of a bunch of banks. So that informed this whole too-big-to-fail idea where, even though it's extremely unpalatable to go in and bail out these huge firms with these executives that make tens of millions of dollars a year, and basically save them from their own mistakes, even though that's very unpalatable on almost every level, it does save the U.S. economy. What the CHOICE Act does is it tries to reduce the ability of regulators to step in and bail these banks out. Let me be clear. There is a very solid theoretical framework behind that, because the thought process is, if you go in and bail out these big banks and they know you're going to bail them out in the future, they have much less incentive to act responsibly. That's that whole thought process. If you go back to the financial crisis, the term -- I'm pulling a blank on the term -- but if you go back to the financial crisis, this was one of the main arguments that they asserted. So what Hensarling's act tries to do is dial that back, and it does it in a couple of different ways. No. 1, it removes the regulator's authority to take over these organizations that are troubled and liquidate them in an orderly way, and it transfers that authority over into the bankruptcy code. Lapera: Just a quick side note for listeners, this is called the Orderly Liquidation Authority, that's OLA, which you might see floating around if you're reading about this online. That's actually codified into law, and it's the way the government stepped in and made sure there was an orderly liquidation during the most recent financial crisis of banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Maxfield: Right. Also, the term I was thinking about earlier was moral hazard. That's the hazard that, if you're going to step in and bail someone out -- an institution -- that institution has less incentive to act responsibly. And like I said, that's grounded in theory. Lapera: And it's actually really funny, because earlier you were talking about spending the weekend refereeing between your two children. This is almost just a parenting concept, that if you reward that behavior, you're going to keep getting bad behavior. Maxfield: Exactly, that's exactly right. And all parents can understand that. Another important thing it does in that too-big-to-fail context is that it seeks to restrict the Federal Reserve's discount window lending to what's known as Bagehot's dictum. Lapera: There's a lot of words in there. What is a discount-window lending? I mean, what is discount-window lending? I sound like an old person... ""What is the Facebook?"" What is discount window lending? Maxfield: Discount window is, when a bank gets into trouble, one of the things that will happen is, its depositors will know it's in trouble, so they will all run on the bank at the same time to withdraw their deposits. That's known as a bank run. The problem with a bank run is, because banks are so leveraged, and they only hold a small amount of actual cash in terms of relative to deposits that they have, that can cause them to be completely illiquid. They can run out of cash trying to satisfy their depositors. What the discount window does is it allows banks to take some of its assets on its balance sheet, go to the Federal Reserve, use those assets as collateral, and then get cash from the Federal Reserve to satisfy depositors, to thereby stop or prevent a bank run. Maxfield: It happened with... the name of the bank is escaping me right now, but it happened with a major bank that was based in California during the financial crisis. And it was actually that bank that was taken over and turned into OneWest, which was the institution that was associated with Steven Mnuchin, who's now the Treasury Secretary. But it does still happen, but it's much less frequent because there is FDIC deposit insurance now, as well, that reduces the incentive for people to have to feel like they need to run on the banks and take their deposits out, because the FDIC will be there to stand behind the banks, anyway. So what Bagehot's dictum does is it says that the Federal Reserve should only allow banks to access the discount window -- or it says that the way the Federal Reserve could use the discount window is to lend freely and early in times of crisis, which is what happened last time -- but it should only do so to ""solvent firms and against good collateral at high interest rates."" It's that high-interest rates part that's really significant, because the idea there is, if you were using a punitive interest rate, banks are going to be less inclined to use the discount window. And if they're less inclined to use the discount window in times of crisis, the thought is that, ahead of time, they will be much more careful about the quality of the assets they put on their balance sheets, and the ability to turn those into cash in the public markets as opposed to having to go to the discount window of the Federal Reserve. Lapera: And you have just revealed the disconnect between Democrats and Republicans -- which is that Republicans believe that banks can be forced to be responsible enough to take care of themselves, and Democrats do not, and that's why they're pushing for all this extra regulation. Right now, that falls along partisan lines. Whatever you think is up to you. That's basically what's going on. Maxfield: I will say, to take politics out of this, I studied banks pretty intensely for a number of years, and I will tell you that in history, the thing that we know is that you need a strong and independent central bank, you need it at all times, but particularly in times of crisis. So you do want to be really careful in terms of both the authorities you give to a central bank in that situation and, in this case, the authorities that you take away from it. But again, this is something that, it will get worked out, and the pendulum swings back and forth between regulators and industry. And right now, this is a bill that swings at way back on the other side. I would say, just like Dodd-Frank went too far swinging the pendulum into the favor of regulators, Hensarling's act seems to me to go too far in the other direction. Which makes sense, given that Dodd-Frank was partisan on the Democratic side and the Financial CHOICE Act is partisan on the Republican side. Lapera: Yeah. Actually, you gave me a good segue earlier to kind of slide into this next big thing that the act is going to do, which is that it's going to significantly cut down on the authority of regulatory agencies. I think one of the most important things to note is that they're going to subject financial Regulatory agencies to the REINS Act. The REINS Act basically says that any agency that wants to impose a rule that costs more than $100 million a year needs to run it by Congress first, and if Congress fails to approve a rule within 70 days after it's been proposed, then the rule would go away -- it would be null and void. Which is hard, because if you have partisan control of committees, rules that would go against whatever the nature of that committee is at the moment can just sit for 70 days and never even get heard, and then it just doesn't happen, and that means that regulation is going to happen much more slowly. Maxfield: Right. The way it works now is that the Federal Reserve, the FCC, the CFPB, all these different regulatory agencies -- and this isn't just in the financial services arena, this is across all regulatory agencies and all industries, that in order to regulate their industries, they are given the authority to pass rules that, like, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to pass rules about appropriate products that can be marketed to customers. And those rules, there is a long process where they get insight from the industry and other interested parties. But then those regulatory agencies have the power to put those rules into place and require the industry to follow them. What the Financial CHOICE Act would do is add another layer in that step, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but here's the problem. That additional layer is Congressional approval of these rules. And you can imagine that that really adds a lot of complications to that whole process. It's not like you're just adding just one more hurdle. You're adding an extremely high hurdle that, depending on who is in control of Congress and the Senate at any particular point in time, these regulatory agencies may not be able to jump over. Again, I think that's probably the whole point of subjecting them to the REINS Act, which passed earlier this year. Lapera: Right, it's to reduce the amount of federal legislation that exists, that's really what the point of it is. But it's hard because, yes, maybe regulatory agencies shouldn't be making up rules without Congressional approval, but on the other hand, Congress takes a really long time to do things sometimes. Sometimes, agencies come up with stuff to protect people or help people, and then it gets codified into law, but until then, they're just responding quickly to the needs as they see them. So it's this really hard to push-and-pull thing that you have with government. Let's talk a little bit also about the Fed, which you mentioned is going to be affected by this act. It's hard, because the Fed has also been subjected to the REINS Act, as well. Maxfield: Right. There's one other piece to this. It's not only the REINS Act that they're subjecting the regulators to. They also subject the regulators to the appropriations process. That's a really important thing. Right now, let's take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is actually an agency within the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve is an independent agency. So you have multiple layers of independence. But one of the principal pieces of independence is that, in the case of the Federal Reserve, it is a profit-making entity -- it has a huge balance sheet full of assets that earn interest in time. So it doesn't have to go to Congress to get money to operate, which gives it independence from Congress. The same thing is true with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- don't quote me exactly on this -- since it was put into operation, and in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it has issued a total of something like $11 [billion] to $12 billion worth of fines to the industry, and it can use those fines to do, among other things, fund its own operations. So it, too, is kind of detached or insulated from that political process that is a part of the appropriations process. And what the Financial CHOICE Act does is, it would take away that independence and require these institutions to go to Congress for the funding, which would have a significant impact on them. Lapera: Yeah. And that's one of the big criticisms of the CFBP, that its critics levied at it, is that the CFPB might start just issuing fines just because it has a financial incentive to, as opposed to doing it because the fines really need to be issued. So that's kind of where that Financial CHOICE Act section, that's what it's trying to get at. Maxfield: Right. Then, to your point about going straight at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve is one of those institutions that, people either don't know anything about it, or they love it or hate it, or they don't know anything about it, and they love or hate it. And one of the things that people tend to think about when they think about the Federal Reserve is that it's some sort of conspiratorial entity that controls the money supply and does so for the economic elites, and things like that. And one of the reasons that these conspiracy theories are able to grow take on the forms that they're able to take is because it's a relatively non-transparent organization, particularly when it comes to managing the money supply. Another main principle of the Financial CHOICE Act is to increase the transparency of the Federal Reserve, both in terms of its overall operations and in terms of the way it manages the money supply. And what I mean by managing the money supply is, when it decides to raise or lower interest rates, because that's the lever that causes the money supply to expand or contract. Lapera: Yeah, and it's not just that. For example, the stress tests, no one is 100% sure what's in them. Maxfield: Exactly. So the stress tests right now, these happen once a year for large banks. The purpose of them is to see how they would perform in a hypothetical economic scenario that is analogous to the financial crisis. This is actually a very good piece of the regulatory pie in the banking industry, because it keeps bankers' eyes on making sure that the assets they put on the balance sheets aren't going to submit them to massive losses if, and when, the economy turns down, like it inevitably will. But the issue with the stress tests is that, when the banks submit all the information to the Federal Reserve for the stress test, when the banks are going through their planning process, in terms of structuring their balance sheets and their operations in a way that will help them make it through the stress test, is that the Federal Reserve doesn't actually give them the exact model that the Federal Reserve is using in the course of the stress test. So the banks are flying blind in this regard. If you talk to bankers, most all of them will say that they think the stress tests are a good thing. I'm talking about the bankers, the CEOs of the very large banks in this country, those are the ones under the most stringent stress-test requirements. They will almost universally say that they think the stress tests are a good thing, but they will also almost universally complain about the fact that the Federal Reserve doesn't share the models it uses in the course of the stress test, so banks are just flying blind. Lapera: Yeah. That actually is kind of paired with another aspect of the CHOICE Act, which is that they are proposing that if banks hold a certain amount of money on their balance sheet, essentially as an emergency fund, that they won't be subject to quite as much regulation as they are now. Maxfield: Right. One of the main narratives that emerged from the financial crisis was that the reason the crisis was able to metastasize the way it did was because banks were overleveraged, they were undercapitalized. Which means, a typical bank will hold $1 worth of equity for $10 of assets. At the time, you had, like, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and companies like that -- Lehman Brothers, at certain points, was leveraged by something like 30:1. What that means was, if its assets fell by just 3%, if the value of its assets fell by just 3%, it would render it completely insolvent. In the wake of the financial crisis, all of these additional capital rules came in to require banks to not only hold more capital, but dictated the type of capital that they were supposed to hold. What the Financial CHOICE Act does is say, ""Look, let's do away with all these complicated capital rules,"" and these capital rules are incredibly complicated, ""and let's replace them with a simple leverage ratio where banks, all you do is compare how much equity or capital a bank has to its assets, and just use that simple ratio."" And if banks meet the threshold laid out in the Financial CHOICE Act, then they can be exempt from all of these additional regulations that Dodd-Frank is imposing, particularly on large banks. So the thought process is, look, if you just make them hold more capital, they're safer, so they don't have to do all these other things. Lapera: So the thing that the Financial CHOICE Act offers for banks that do this, in particular, that's probably very valuable for them is that, right now, really large banks have to go to the Fed before doing stuff like issuing a dividend or changing their business plan. And in theory, if they meet this leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they won't have to ask for permission to do any of that stuff anymore. Of course, it's really interesting, because when you say a simple ratio with assets, just like with people, there are assets that are really easy to move and there are assets that are really hard to move. So I don't know, I personally need a little bit more clarity around what that ratio actually looks like. It's a lot harder to sell a house and get that cash than it is to have cash to pay, and that analogy also holds for banks. They have some assets that are really hard to offload and some that are really easy to offload, so how did they end up calculating that ratio? The reason I don't know the answer to this yet is that I have not actually read all 600 pages of this act yet. I'm working on it, I'll do it eventually. So one of the reasons I haven't read all of it yet is because, it's passed the House and it's about to go to the Senate, and the Senate, in my opinion, is not going to let this pass as originally written. There's probably going to be quite a few amendments, and the language is probably going to change quite a lot, if it passes at all. Maxfield: And here's another really important point. They're saying that, if a bank holds enough capital to satisfy this simplified leverage ratio under the Financial CHOICE Act, they're calling that an off-ramp -- the off-ramp being, you get off the highway with all these other regulations. Well, one of the really interesting regulations that it's looking like the Financial CHOICE Act is trying to attack and would allow these big banks, in particular, to avoid -- and let me read this from the executive summary of the Financial CHOICE Act. It says it will ""exempt banking organizations that have made a qualifying capital election from any federal law, rule, or regulation that provide limitations on mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions of assets or control ... "" So what does that mean? Through the 1970s-1980s, the banking industry deregulated. It allowed banks to open up house, operate branches, and allowed banks to operate across interstate lines, which is something that, in the past, they generally weren't allowed to do. Well, the quid pro quo in that case was that they were going to allow these banks to grow and do all these things and have more flexibility in terms of their operations, but on the other side of that, they wanted to stop these things from getting so enormous that if one of them were to fail, it would basically wipe out all the wealth of the United States. So they did that by saying, ""If you hold 10% or more of the nation's deposits, you are not allowed to then acquire another depository institution."" And right now, there are three banks that fit that -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. So right now, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, they cannot go out and buy any other banks, they're not allowed to because each one of them holds more than 10% of the nation's deposits. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, if I'm reading it correctly, it's saying that, as long as those banks hold enough capital to meet that threshold in the act, they would then be free to merge together or buy other banks. So you could theoretically, in this case, see a merger between JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two biggest banks in the country. And I really doubt that that would happen because their branch bases completely overlap each other, so there would be too much redundancy in doing that. But people should think about, is that something we want to do? Do we want each individual bank to hold, say, 25% or 50% of the nation's deposits? Is that a direction we want to go in, given the fact that since the Civil War, more than 17,000 banks have failed? So it's a good thing to keep in mind. Lapera: Yeah, no, that's a really overwhelming thing to think about. We need to wrap up because we've been here for a while. It's partially because there's just so much stuff in this act to discuss. There's so many little things that could end up having really big impact. We'll continue to track the progress of the bill. Like I mentioned earlier, I really, really do not think this is going to get through the Senate completely unchanged. We'll talk about that more when we know more. Was there anything else you wanted to say, Maxfield? Maxfield: No, I think that's it. The only other thing is, it would dramatically impact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We could talk about that on a different show because that deserves its own conversation. But again, to leave off on the same point I made at the very beginning, the Financial CHOICE Act, like the Dodd-Frank Act, is neither good nor bad. It's just a reflection of the swing of the pendulum back and forth between regulators and industries. We've seen this many times in the past. And generally, when the pendulum swings, regardless of the direction in which it swings, it goes too far. Dodd-Frank went too far. The Financial CHOICE Act went too far. So to your point, Gaby, when this goes through the Senate, it's likely that they're going to tailor it back. Lapera: Yeah. That seems very likely, especially given everything that we've seen during this Administration so far. Who knows what'll happen? Things in D.C. either move at breakneck pace, or very, very slowly. We'll keep you guys up to date, don't worry. If you guys have any questions, definitely email us at industryfocus@fool.com, or by tweeting us @MFIndustryFocus, and let us know what you'd like to hear about next. If you tweet us @MFIndustryFocus, I am actually now in charge of our Twitter feed, so yeah, that will actually be me responding to you. Thank you, Austin, for listening to this very long episode about financial regulation. [laughs] Austin Morgan: Of course. Lapera: He's looking at me like, ""You owe me one, bud."" Maxfield: He's asleep, yeah. Morgan: Just another Monday. Lapera: [laughs] As usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I hope everyone has a really great week. I hope that your week is less stressful than mine. I get stressed out every time we talk about politics on this show, so I'm going to go take an antacid and eat some lunch. Everyone, have a great day! ","
      
    What's the Deal with the Financial CHOICE Act? -- The Motley Fool

  "
John Maxfield,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big bank stocks have surged over the past eight months, yet they still look relatively cheap when compared with regional bank stocks. Is this a sign you should buy the former and sell the latter? Not necessarily. The easiest way to see the difference in valuation between banks based on size is to compare the median valuation on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks the two dozen biggest banks in the country, with the KBW Regional Banking Index, which tracks 50 banks with between $5 billion and $40 billion worth of assets on their balance sheets. Index Median Forward Price-to-Earnings Multiple Median Price to Book Value Median Price to Tangible Book Value KBW Bank Index 14.88 1.36 1.92 KBW Regional Banking Index 17.41 1.66 2.18 Data source: YCharts.com. It doesn't matter which of the three primary valuation metrics you use: Regional banks such as Glacier Bancorp (NASDAQ:GBCI) and Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK) generally trade at a higher multiple compared with big banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Based on earnings, which is the metric that should take the lead in an analysis today, the median regional bank on the KBW Regional Banking Index trades for 17.41 times earnings per share over the next 12 months. The figure on the KBW Bank Index is 14.88. The story is the same when you look at valuation as a function of book value. The median regional bank stock trades for 2.18 times tangible book value, while the median big bank trades for a multiple of 1.92. Investors need to appreciate that these figures alone don't mean big banks are better buys than regional banks. A better interpretation of the difference is that regional banks have more opportunities to grow. Regional and community banks are growing like weeds. Image source: Getty Images. There are two ways to grow in the bank industry. The first is through organic growth -- attracting new customers through marketing efforts and gaining more of each customer's overall financial business, be it a mortgage, credit card, car loan, whatever. The second avenue is through mergers and acquisitions. Holding all else equal, a bank that can use both avenues can grow faster than a bank that can use only one. Herein lies the difference in valuation between the nation's biggest banks, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and regional banks, such as Glacier Bancorp and Bank of the Ozarks. As I've discussed in the past, the nation's three biggest banks, which are weighted heavily on KBW's large-cap bank index, are all shut out of the acquisition game, at least insofar as other depository institutions are concerned. That's because Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo each already hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits. As such, these three banks are legally prohibited from acquiring other banks. Regional banks aren't similarly proscribed. Because none of the banks on the KBW Regional Banking Index come even close to the 10% deposit threshold, they can still merge with or acquire other banks, thereby supercharging growth. That's exactly what they've been doing. To cite just two examples, Glacier Bancorp has acquired nine banks since the beginning of 2009, and that's on top of 15 other deals it has completed since 1990. The same is true at Bank of the Ozarks, which has purchased a total of 16 other banks since the financial crisis. OZRK Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. The net result is that these two banks have seen their balance sheets expand rapidly over the past decade. Bank of the Ozarks went from $2.5 billion in assets 10 years ago to more than $19 billion today. And while Glacier Bancorp's recent ascent hasn't been as steep, the Montana-based bank has nevertheless more than doubled in size over the same stretch. Thus, the reason big bank stocks seem cheap is that their ability to grow is tightly constrained compared with their smaller, simpler counterparts in the regional banking space. ","

Dan Caplinger,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Exchange traded funds have made it easy for investors to drill down on specific types of investments, and Sector SPDR ETFs have become one of the most popular ways to invest in specific sectors of the stock market. Sector SPDRs track 10 different sectors in the S&P 500, with each Sector SPDR ETF delivering performance equal to that of the component stocks within the target industry. The investments have relatively low costs and offer diversification while letting you tailor your portfolio in line with your beliefs about the future of particular parts of the market. Sector SPDR 10-Year Average Annual Return Consumer Staples (NYSEMKT:XLP) 10.26% Consumer Discretionary (NYSEMKT:XLY) 10.25% Technology (NYSEMKT:XLK) 9.97% Health Care (NYSEMKT:XLV) 9.51% Industrials (NYSEMKT:XLI) 7.88% Utilities (NYSEMKT:XLU) 6.47% Materials (NYSEMKT:XLB) 5.06% Energy (NYSEMKT:XLE) 1.53% Financials (NYSEMKT:XLF) (0.72%) Real Estate (NYSEMKT:XLRE) N/A Data source: SPDR. N/A = not applicable; the Real Estate Sector SPDR began trading in October 2015. The Sector SPDR ETFs break up the S&P 500 into 10 separate indexes. Like any ETF, the Sector SPDRs trade throughout the trading day on the NYSE Arca exchange. As index funds, the investment objective for the ETFs is to match the share-price performance and dividend income of the underlying sectors that they track. Sector SPDRs have anywhere from 25 to 85 individual stock holdings in their portfolios, depending on the number of S&P 500 members in each respective industry. Consumer discretionary currently has the most stocks, while the materials sector comes in last. Image source: Getty Images. Just looking at the range of returns on the Sector SPDRs reveals the utility of having these ETFs available. Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has had a total return of about 7%, and the chart above shows that half of the sectors have outperformed that figure while the other half have underperformed. Finally, even if you want to own the whole market, Sector SPDRs give you the opportunity to get some tax benefits. In a rising market, simply owning the S&P 500 ETF as a single holding doesn't give you chances to reap any tax-loss benefits. However, even when the overall market rises, you'll generally find that some sectors lose ground. By using tax-loss harvesting strategies, you can collect tax losses on those underperforming sectors while deferring tax on rising sector ETFs until you sell them well into the future. There are a couple ways in which Sector SPDRs aren't the perfect investment. First, even with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.14%, they're still more expensive than broader-based market ETFs. For instance, you can find ETFs tracking the entire S&P 500 for as little as 0.04%. The other major problem is that like most ETFs, you have to pay brokerage commissions to trade Sector SPDRs. Even those brokers who offer commission-free ETF trading typically don't include the Sector SPDRs, with some instead offering their own proprietary sector-based ETFs. With low commissions available from many brokers, the costs of owning Sector SPDRs doesn't have to be prohibitive, but it is somewhat of a drag on performance. Nevertheless, for investors looking to make plays on specific parts of the market, Sector SPDRs are a good option to consider. With a long history behind them, Sector SPDRs will remain popular ETFs far into the future. ","

Saefong,06222017,MarketWatch,06152017,"Published: June 16, 2017 2:23 p.m. ET U.S. output is higher now than when prices traded in triple digits By Don’t expect oil prices to climb into the triple digits soon. “$100 per barrel oil remains a pipe dream,” for a market suffering from “massive overproduction,” said John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo, in a recent note. Global oil producers have said that crude production “should crater with prices around $40-$50 per barrel, [but] they are having a hard time restraining themselves from producing,” he said. That’s particularly true for the U.S., which is producing more petroleum today, with West Texas Intermediate oil prices

A chart from Wells Fargo shows that U.S. crude-oil and liquid-fuels production stands around 15.5 million barrels a day. It was at just over 14 million barrels a day in mid-2014: Prices of $80 a barrel are likely unattainable as well, “until the world’s oil producers stop overproducing,” said LaForge. Read: Why global oil production looks set to grow in 2018, despite OPEC-led output cuts “We continue to hear that big cutbacks are on the cusp of happening,” he said. “The evidence, however, implies otherwise. And the longer oil prices remain low and range-bound, the harder it will be for prices to bounced above $60—as production costs have dropped significantly since 2014, which keeps more producers in the game.” And each time prices do bounce toward $60, the “temptation to overproduce,” may be “overwhelming for those countries that rely heavily on oil revenues to sustain their economies and social programs,” LaForge said. Given all of that, “we are not expecting the price of WTI crude oil to climb anywhere near $100 per barrel over the next few years,” he said. Instead, Wells Fargo expects it to remain low and range-bound, bouncing between $30 and $60 per barrel. Still, “there is the possibility that the WTI crude-oil price finds its way into the high $30s to low $40s” at year’s end and if that happens, “we could become bullish in the short term,” LaForge said.

                                   on track for the biggest price and percentage gain since Dec. 18, 2014. The previous record close was Wednesday’s close of $46.33, while the previous all-time intraday high of $46.99 was reached on March 16. Don’t miss: Oracle leaps to record as cloud transition hits turning point. Oracle’s results prompted no less than 22 of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet to raise their stock-price targets. The new average target of $53.64 is 6.6% above current levels, and 11%, above the average target of $48.32 the day before the results were released. Analyst Steve Koenig at Wedbush Securities raised his price target to $56, which is 11.3% above current levels, from $44, which was 5% below Wednesday’s close of $46.33. That prompted Koenig to upgrade the stock to an outperform rating, after being at neutral since at least September 2014. Koenig said his new bullish outlook was based on improved software-as-a-service visibility, as Oracle’s applications business “gets over the ‘hump’ of its transition to cloud,” as well as to robust bookings activity and solid database licensing activity. He wrote in a note to clients that he sees potential for “sustained follow-through on positive price action as long-only investors adjust their [Oracle] weightings.” BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman boosted his stock price target to $57 from $48, citing one of Oracle’s “strongest quarters in years,” while J.P. Morgan’s Mark Murphy lifted his target to $55 from $51, saying he believes “this quarter will mark a turning point in investor sentiment.” Benchmark’s Yun Kim lifted the target to $62 from $55, saying the results indicate Oracle has reached the “critical scale” in its cloud business, making the stock “one of the best ways to play the current cloud computing trend.” Kim’s new target ties him with Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White for the second-highest on the Street, according to FactSet, just behind Wells Fargo’s Philip Winslow’s target of $62.50.
