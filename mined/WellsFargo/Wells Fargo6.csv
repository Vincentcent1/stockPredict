,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc have both expressed interest in acquiring a significant part of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s assets, two people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday. News of competing interest in some of Murdoch’s assets broke even though the U.S. Justice Department was preparing a lawsuit to block AT&T Inc, the largest pay-TV provider in the United States, from buying Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, according to a source. This raised questions about the U.S. government’s willingness to allow large media industry mergers. The Fox assets that buyers have expressed interest in  include Fox’s movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic, and international assets such as the Star network in India, and the European pay TV provider Sky Plc. These units have also been the subject of recent talks between Fox and Walt Disney Co, one of the sources said. Fox shares jumped nearly 8.0 percent in after-hours trading after the Wall Street Journal first reported the news.        Shares of Viacom Inc and CBS Corp also rose more than 2.0 percent, a sign investors may see them as potential targets also. Comcast has approached Fox about its interest, and talks are in early stages, the source added, requesting anonymity. There is no guarantee that talks between the companies will result in a deal. Fox, Comcast and Verizon declined comment. After Comcast first bought a stake in NBCUniversal in 2011, buying the Fox assets would give Comcast, the largest cable provider in the United States, an international distribution footprint through ownership of Sky and Star in India. Comcast has steadily boosted its ownership of content over the years and acquiring Fox’s assets would further position Comcast as a diversified conglomerate to rival Disney, analysts said. The deal would bulk up its NBCUniversal unit, which acquired Dreamworks Animation for $3.8 billion last year, as well as increase its ownership stake in video streaming service Hulu. Verizon is also in the early stages of exploring a deal, one of the sources said. A deal could give the U.S. No. 1 wireless phone carrier ownership of movies and TV shows to stream to its mobile subscribers. Acquisition of a movie studio and cable channels would be a departure for Verizon, which has focused its media deals around advertising technology and internet properties. Verizon spent $4.48 billion acquiring the core business of Yahoo, which it merged with AOL this year to form a venture called Oath. Led by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, Oath owns more than 50 brands including HuffPost, TechCrunch and Tumblr. Roger Entner, an analyst of Recon Analytics, said, “It is undeniable that there is a trend of combining content with distribution.” Verizon, which has said it is launching a new streaming service, could have more targeted advertising with a vertically integrated platform, he added. Traditional cable television networks have been struggling with faster-than-expected subscriber erosion in the competition with streaming services like Netflix Inc  and Amazon.com Inc. To increase its scale, Fox tried to buy Time Warner Inc. three years ago and last year announced its intention to buy the rest of Sky beyond the 39 percent it already owns. The moves also come after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday voted to remove key roadblocks to increased consolidation among media companies, potentially unleashing new deals among TV, radio and newspaper owners as they seek to better compete with online media.

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc shares were up 3 percent in trading on Friday after sources said both Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc were interested in buying parts of its studio and TV operations. A week after reports of interest from Walt Disney Co in buying out much of Rupert Murdoch’s U.S. film and television empire, the sources hinted at the prospect of a battle between other media suitors for the assets. Buyers have expressed interest in Fox’s production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic, and international assets such as the Star network in India and Sky Plc, sources told Reuters on Thursday. “Either Disney or Comcast would be a good fit, but its always about price and neither has to be a strategic buyer, only opportunistic,” said JBL Advisors analyst Jeffrey Logsdon. Shares of other media companies which could be dragged into a round of consolidation of U.S. film and TV production and distribution were largely unchanged. Comcast, the largest cable provider in the United States,  has steadily boosted its content ownership over the years and buying Fox’s assets would give it an international distribution footprint and strengthen its position against Disney. Traditional media companies have been struggling with subscriber declines as streaming service Netflix has gained traction with younger audiences that shun traditional cable and satellite offerings. Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser remains uncertain as to whether the Murdoch family is seriously entertaining offers. Wieser surmised that all the interest in Fox by other companies probably came after they heard something regarding Disney’s potential interest that was at least enough to take a meeting. “Previously, no-one would have guessed that such a meeting would have ever occurred. That’s enough for other companies to get their bankers working on something to attempt to get a meeting of their own,” he said. Verizon shares were up 1.4 percent, while Comcast and Netflix shares were down about 1 percent. Fox and Disney are partial co-owners of Hulu, a streaming service that offers on-demand and live TV packages. Hulu is also partially owned by Comcast and Time Warner Inc. “I think if Time Warner doesn’t end up being bought by AT&T - it looks like that’s going to get blocked - that would be an interesting combination... Time Warner-Fox or Disney-Fox,” Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin told Reuters. Although acquisition of a movie studio and cable channels would be a departure for wireless carrier Verizon, its interest in Fox assets was likely piqued by rival AT&T’s bid for HBO and CNN owner Time Warner, which is awaiting regulatory approval. “(I am) skeptical of a Verizon deal, creative businesses are very tough to manage for an outsider,” Logsdon said. Fox’s other assets include Fox television network, Fox News Channel and Fox Entertainment Group, which owns the popular movies studio 20th Century Fox. Fox shares have gained about 9 percent in value in the last six months. ","

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape. FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a Dec. 14 meeting on his plan to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities. The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content. The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price. It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “roll back these core protections.” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a “power grab” by Obama. The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday. Pai said his proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “inherently an interstate service.” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers’ equal access to internet content. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,” Pai added. Tom Wheeler, who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules, called the planned repeal “a shameful sham and sellout. Even for this FCC and its leadership, this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights.” AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing. Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.” Verizon said it believed the FCC “will reinstate a framework that protects consumers’ access to the open internet, without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation.” The Internet Association, representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook, said Pai’s proposal “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans.” “This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans’ ability to access the entire internet,” it said. Pai’s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content. Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers, Pai said. The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “anticompetitive” or violated antitrust rules. The FCC received more than 22 million comments. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments. A U.S. appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom. The group praised Pai’s decision to remove “antiquated, restrictive regulations” to “pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades.” The FCC’s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition, saying the agency “has launched an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet.” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law. Pai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman, is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials. The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies. Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web. The FCC granted initial approval to Pai’s plan in May, but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct. His plan would eliminate the “internet conduct standard,” which gave the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices. ","

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is set to consider a major cellphone privacy case later this month, but leading players in the wireless industry that is at the center of the closely watched dispute are keeping their distance. The case, to be heard by the justices on Nov. 29, involves whether a warrant is required for authorities to obtain cellphone location information that could implicate criminal suspects, the latest in a string of Supreme Court cases on privacy rights in the digital age. It has become the latest example of how American phone carriers have been reluctant to engage in data privacy disputes — especially those that may pit them against the U.S. government — despite their role as custodians of customer data, legal experts and privacy advocates say. Of the four major U.S. mobile phone carriers — Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc, Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc — only Verizon has taken a stand in the case. Verizon joined a legal brief with technology companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google and Apple Inc calling for stronger protections for the privacy of customer data. Wireless industry trade group CTIA has shied away from the case, the most significant in years on phone privacy. Digital right advocates have criticized the industry’s hands-off approach. “Few private actors have been more involved in the erosion of Americans’ privacy than the telecoms, particularly over the last 15 years,” said Alex Abdo, a senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York, which filed a brief supporting expanded privacy rights in the case. “They have been silent for almost all that time.” Despite massive growth in the amount and types of customer data stored by phone and tech companies, U.S. law on how to treat that information has barely changed during that period. Some tech firms have urged reforms that would ensure privacy protections for customer data. Microsoft and Google both opposed the government’s attempts to obtain customer data stored on foreign servers, a central issue in the other major tech case currently before the Supreme Court. CTIA, AT&T and T-Mobile declined to comment on the current case. Sprint spokeswoman Lisa Belot said the company had not taken a position on it. Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the case “highlights the ever-existing need to find the right balance between law enforcement and privacy, and raises tough questions about how to apply old statutes and legal doctrines to modern technologies.” Although the legal fight is about location information, “the Supreme Court’s decision is likely to impact how the government obtains other sensitive types of information from many other types of providers,” Young added. The Supreme Court twice in recent years has ruled on how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement authorities. Cellphone location records are becoming increasingly important in criminal investigations, with authorities routinely requesting and receiving this data from wireless providers. The four major wireless carriers handle thousands of requests from law enforcement annually for this data. Such data shows which local cellphone towers that phone users connected to when they made calls. Police can use past data to determine if a suspect was in the vicinity of a crime. The justices will hear an appeal by a man named Timothy Carpenter who was convicted in armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan. Police helped establish Carpenter was near the scene of robberies at Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores by securing past cell site location information from his cellphone carrier, MetroPCS, now owned by T-Mobile. Carpenter’s American Civil Liberties Union lawyers argued that police need “probable cause,” and therefore a warrant, in light of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Based on a provision of a 1986 law called the Stored Communications Act, the Justice Department said probable cause was not needed, but rather the lesser “reasonable grounds,” to show that records are “relevant and material” to an investigation. Civil liberties groups said that law did not anticipate the way mobile devices would become huge data depositories. A ruling favoring Carpenter would set a precedent that could be applied to other forms of data. Investigations on a range of issues, including public corruption and identity theft, would be threatened if Carpenter wins, the National District Attorneys Association said in a legal brief. Unlike internet firms, telephone providers require government licenses to operate and many have signed contractual agreements that mandate cooperation with the government on legal processes, said Albert Gidari, a lawyer who represented phone and internet companies on surveillance issues for 20 years. Digital rights activists said this fact makes U.S. carriers reluctant to pick privacy fights with the government. “On these issues,” Gidari said, “it does not serve them to be very vocal.” ","

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday approved the use of new technology that will improve picture quality on mobile phones, tablets and television, but also raises significant privacy concerns by giving advertisers dramatically more data about viewing habits. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 to allow broadcasters to voluntarily use the new technology, dubbed ATSC 3.0, which would allow for more precise geolocating of television signals, ultra-high definition picture quality and more interactive programming, like new educational content for children and multiple angles of live sporting events. The system uses precision broadcasting and targets emergency or weather alerts on a street-by-street basis. The system could allow broadcasters to wake up a receiver to broadcast emergency alerts. The alerts could include maps, storm tracks and evacuation routes. The new standard would also let broadcasters activate a TV set that is turned off to send emergency alerts. Current televisions cannot carry the new signal and the FCC on Thursday said it was only requiring broadcasting both signals for five years after deploying the next-generation technology. Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc last month called the new standard “the Holy Grail” for the advertiser because it tells them who is watching and where. But Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan said the new technology “contemplates targeted advertisements that would be ‘relevant to you and what you actually might want to see.’ This raises questions about how advertisers and broadcasters will gather the demographic information from consumers which are necessary to do targeted advertisements.” [nL2N1N11R0] Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said the new technology would force consumers to buy new televisions. “The FCC calls this approach market driven. That’s right — because we will all be forced into the market for new television sets or devices.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai defended the proposal, calling concerns about buying new devices “hypothetical.” He added five years is “a long time. We’ll have to see how the standard develops.” One issue is whether broadcasters will be able to pass on the costs of advanced broadcast signals through higher retransmissions fees and demand providers carry the signals. The National Association of Broadcasters, which represents Tegna Inc, Comcast Corp, CBS Corp, Walt Disney Co, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and others, petitioned the FCC in April 2016 to approve the new standard. “This is game-changing technology for broadcasting and our viewers,” the group said Thursday. Many companies have raised concerns about costs, including AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. Cable, satellite and other pay TV providers “would incur significant costs to receive, transmit, and deliver ATSC 3.0 signals to subscribers, including for network and subscriber equipment,” Verizon said. Many nations are considering the new standard. South Korea adopted the ATSC 3.0 standard in 2016. ","

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is poised to vote on Dec. 14 to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by former President Barack Obama. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal would repeal rules that bar internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content. Here are some questions and answers about net neutrality and the FCC’s plans. What is in the proposal and what happens next? The FCC, an independent U.S. government agency that regulates interstate and international communications by radio, TV, wire, satellite and cable, has three Republican commissioners including Pai and two Democrats and is all but certain to approve Pai’s proposal. That would undo regulations put in place in 2015 at Democrat Obama’s urging that treat ISPs like public utilities to guarantee the open nature of the internet. It would also roll back the FCC’s significant oversight over the providers and their conduct. Pai’s proposal would require ISPs to disclose if they allow content blocking, slowing though so-called throttling, or paid prioritization in which a third-party owner pays an ISP to have their content move more quickly. It would also eliminate the internet conduct standard that gives the FCC broad discretion to bar ISP practices it deems improper. The new rules could into effect as early as January, although a court challenge is expected. What does this mean for consumers? Consumers could see changes, but any shift would likely take a long time. A major concern raised by consumer advocates is that ISPs could block or slow traffic to websites or services of their choosing, playing an outsized role in what users can and cannot access. Providers could also give preferential treatment to their own content or websites that pay extra fees, consumer advocates said. ISPs could impede video streaming services and consumers’ ability to make free or inexpensive phone calls over the internet, advocates said. The nonprofit Consumers Union said a repeal could lead to higher consumer prices for existing internet access and speeds. The telecommunications industry trade group USTelecom, which represents some leading ISPs, disputed that idea and said broadband prices in the United States had been trending downward before the Obama-era rules, and repealing the regulations would allow that to continue. What businesses support the repeal? ISPs including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc favored a repeal. USTelecom said Pai’s move would boost broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades. It said the 2015 rules applied utility-style regulations designed for the 1930s telephone system to ISPs but no other internet companies. It said repealing the rules would strengthen consumer protections by giving authority regarding the internet to a single U.S. regulator, the Federal Trade Commission. What businesses oppose the repeal? The Internet Association, representing major technology firms, had urged the FCC to retain the 2015 regulations. The group includes Google parent Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, video streaming service Netflix Inc, Microsoft Corp, ride-hailing company Uber, reviews business Yelp Inc, payments company PayPal Holdings Inc and others. The group said the 2015 rules protect a “virtuous circle” of innovation that helps the broader U.S. economy as businesses turn to cloud-based technology. It added that Pai’s plan would subject startups to discrimination from ISP-owned or preferred content. The group said paid prioritization would cause a “cable-ization” of the internet in which businesses that provide content, application or services would have to negotiate carriage deals on ISP networks.

On Sunday, analysts at Wells Fargo lifted their rating on VZ to outperform from market perform, applauding the New York City-based company’s significant investment in fiber as it prepares for the 5G era. Wells Fargo’s Jennifer Fritzsche increased her price target to $50 from $48, suggesting that “much of the bad news is behind the stock in terms of wireless service revenue declines.” (See also: Sprint Now Offering Free Hulu Service.) Last month, Verizon posted fiscal Q3 results in which profit came in flat at $0.89 per share and revenue grew 2.5% year-over-year (YOY) at $31.7 billion. Wireless, the company’s largest business segment, slumped 2.4% while its wireless service business fell 5.1%. Moving forward, Wells expects a “more rational” pricing environment in wireless as benefiting Verizon the most out of its competitors. She noted that wireless accounts for 68% of the telecommunications conglomerate’s total revenue. Further, Fritzsche sees opportunity in Verizon’s continued investments in fiber technology, which should “generate material cost savings” and reduce the cost of constant customer acquisition as the company is forced to replace old customers lost to churn. “We think Verizon is an attractive yield play, with its 5.3% dividend yield nearly 100 basis points above its long-term average,” wrote the Wells analyst. “We expect Verizon to grow free cash flow nearly 6% in 2018 as working capital headwinds from device purchases moderate, service revenue stabilizes and pension funding requirements drop.” (See also: Verizon Needs Growth To Drive Stock Price Higher.)

Comcast is interested in the same set of assets that Disney approached Fox about earlier this year, sources said. Also of interest to Comcast is acquiring the international assets of Fox, given that the Philadelphia-based company is heavily concentrated in the U.S. CNBC reported last week, citing sources, that 21st Century Fox has been holding talks to sell most of the company to Disney, leaving only an entity focused on news and sports. A Comcast-Fox deal would have the same regulatory issues that Disney would have in acquiring the Fox assets, the sources said. Disney under U.S. rules could not own two broadcast networks. And that would be the same case with Comcast. Neither company is talking about purchasing all of Fox, sources told CNBC. Any deal by Comcast or Disney would also likely exclude Fox's news and sports programming assets for fear of running foul of antitrust laws. Fox shares jumped more than 6 percent in after-hours trading. Comcast shares rose about 0.75 percent, while Disney shares were mildly lower. CNBC reported Friday that while the Disney and Fox talks were not ongoing, a deal was not totally dead. Verizon Communications is also interested in acquiring parts of Fox, Dow Jones reported after the bell Thursday.

Rich Smith,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. 2017 has not been a great year for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) shareholders. Verizon stock has lost 15% of its value since the year began, and with barely a month remaining in the year, there's not much time left for Verizon to make up for lost ground. Next year, however, could be another matter. Earlier this morning, investment banker Wells Fargo announced it is upgrading Verizon stock to outperform and assigning the stock a $50 price target over the next 12 months. If the analyst is right, 2018 could see Verizon make up much of its losses from 2017, and deliver a 10% profit -- and Verizon's generous 5.2% dividend yield on top of that. Here are three things you need to know. Operator? Wells Fargo would like to place a call -- to buy Verizon stock. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon reported its fiscal Q3 earnings numbers last month. Revenue inched up only 2.5% year over year to $31.7 billion, and profits were flat at $0.89 per diluted share. Within the company's two main business segments, however, results differed wildly. Things were both better, and worse, in Verizon smaller wireline business (landlines and Fios). Here, Verizon boasted a 1.1% revenue growth rate, but profits declined 11% year over year, and wireline still remains mired at a minuscule 0.8% operating profit margin. In short, the news was not great at Verizon last quarter. And yet, according to Wells Fargo, now that Q3 is in the rearview mirror, ""much of the bad news is behind the stock."" In Wells' opinion, the wireless business is in a trough right now. But going forward, Wells Fargo believes that more ""rational pricing"" among competing wireless providers will boost revenue in Verizon's wireless division. If Wells is right about that, the strong profit margins that Verizon earns in wireless should yield substantial profit growth as revenue resumes growing. As TheFly.com explains today in a note on Wells Fargo's upgrade, however, the analyst sees the greater opportunity for improvement in Verizon's wireline division. According to the analyst, Verizon's continued investments in fiber technology should ""generate material cost savings"" for the company. Fiber may even reduce Verizon's costs of constantly acquiring new customers to replace old customers lost due to customer churn. Earlier this month, J.D. Power and Associates surveyed more than 26,000 cable and internet users and concluded that Verizon's television and internet services are ""Highest Ranked by Customers for Residential Internet and Television Service Satisfaction in the East."" Polling customers on such subjects as network performance and reliability, cost of service, billing, communication, customer service, and programming choices, J.D. Power found that even in an industry as disliked as cable television, customers at least seem to prefer Verizon over alternatives such as Comcast, Cox, and Charter. (For the record, and to be fair, both Charter and Cox topped J.D. Power's rankings in the American South and West regions, respectively. In the North, AT&T trumped all comers. But in the one region where Verizon was allowed to compete head to head with these rivals, it came out on top.) On top of all this, Wells Fargo also argues that with its 15% decline in share price since the year's beginning, Verizon's valuation is looking more attractive today -- but it's here that I fear Wells Fargo's reasoning breaks down. Wells Fargo starts off by describing Verizon as an ""attractive yield play"" based on the company's 5.2% dividend yield -- well and good. The problem is that Wells Fargo then goes on to praise Verizon for its improved free cash flow, and arguing that this, too, is a mark in Verizon stock's favor. But it isn't. Over the past four reported quarters, Verizon has earned just over $15.9 billion in reported net income under GAAP, resulting in an enticingly low (-seeming) P/E ratio of just 11.7. Problem is, Verizon's free cash flow number entirely fails to back up that reported profit. Cash from operations at Verizon over the past year has amounted to $22.2 billion. Unfortunately, minus $16.9 billion in capital expenditure, that leaves free cash flow of only $5.3 billion for the period. Divided into Verizon's $185.3 billion market capitalization, this results in a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 35 -- much more expensive than the stock's low P/E ratio makes it appear. Whatever the prospects for a revival of revenue growth at Verizon's wireless division, and whatever Verizon's chances of pulling its wireline operating profit margin back above 1%, I simply don't believe these prospects are great enough to justify paying 35 times free cash flow for Verizon stock today. If you ask me, Verizon Communications stock simply costs too much. Wells Fargo is wrong to recommend it. ","

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) each reported lower revenue through the first nine months of 2017. Yet investors have had dramatically different responses to recent operating trends for these companies. McDonald's stock is outpacing the broader market's by a wide margin, Coke is underperforming, and Verizon is deep in negative territory with a 15% loss. Below, we'll stack these Dow giants against each other to see which might make the better buy for investors today. Metric Coca-Cola McDonald's Verizon Market capitalization $195 billion $135 billion $185 billion Operating profit margin 20% 40% 25% Dividend yield 3.2% 2.4% 5.2% Performance year to date 10% 37% (15%) Profit margin is for the trailing 12 months. Stock performance is through Nov. 17. Data sources: Company financial filings, YCharts. McDonald's is the clear winner in this matchup when it comes to operating momentum. The fast-food giant's customer traffic trends are improving across each of its geographies today, including in the critical U.S. segment. This rebound allowed Mickey D's to post a 6% spike in comparable-store sales in late October to mark just a slight slowdown from the prior quarter's 6.6% jump. Image source: Getty Images. Coke's results look tame in comparison. The beverage titan's sales volume is flat so far this year after having risen by 1% last year and by 2% in 2015. Verizon brings up third place on this metric, as its wireless revenue is down 3%. The communications giant has managed a slight uptick in its customer base, but that improvement is being overwhelmed by lower average monthly payments. The same general story applies to profit growth. Sure, Coca-Cola is set to raise its operating margin through a refranchising initiative that's spinning bottlers out of its business. And Verizon has aggressive cost-cutting plans that should see it remove $10 billion from its expense burden over the next four years. Yet McDonald's has the brightest outlook for improving profitability -- and that was true even before its recent uptick in sales growth. The fast-food titan is busy reducing its share of company-owned locations to just 5% from the 15% it controlled at the end of 2016. That refranchising strategy is lowering reported earnings. In fact, sales are down 6% so far this year. But in exchange, CEO Steve Easterbrook and his team get a higher proportion of those steady, repeatable, and highly profitable franchise fees. The shift has already produced a spike in operating margin up to 38% of sales from 33% a year ago. Management is targeting further gains on this metric with profitability reaching the mid-40s by late 2019. VZ Operating Margin (TTM). Data by YCharts. The fact that these companies operate in different industries limits the usefulness of direct comparisons between their valuations. Still, it's fair to say that Verizon is the cheapest of the bunch. Its price-to-earnings ratio is less than half the 25 times an investor would have to pay to buy either Coca Cola or McDonald's today. Verizon is also valued well below the broader market average. Investors seeking a conservative stock purchase -- with an unusually high yield -- might consider Verizon a solid bet. Just keep in mind that this dividend has only grown for 11 consecutive years, compared to 56 for Coke and 42 for McDonald's. In my view, the fast-food giant makes the best all-around purchase today, though, due to its healthy operating trends and improving profitability. Sure, Mickey D's 2.4% yield is the lowest of the group. Yet that payout should grow quickly since it is the main avenue by which management is planning to send  $23 billion to shareholders in the next few years. ","

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has been on a tear over the last few years, winning the lion's share of postpaid phone net subscriber additions in the industry. Those gains have come largely at the expense of AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). T-Mobile has been extremely aggressive with its Un-carrier moves, many of which have been extremely attractive to consumers but harmed industry economics like its move to unlimited data plans. As a result, its EBITDA margin sits well below those of AT&T and Verizon. Management has big plans to grow free cash flow over the next few years. But in order to do so, it has to take care of its biggest disadvantage. ""Our disadvantage all along has been scale,"" CFO Braxton Carter told investors at a recent conference. ""And to achieve the margins that are possible to be achieved in the U.S., we have to have that scale."" Image source: T-Mobile. As of the end of the third quarter, T-Mobile had about 33 million postpaid phone subscribers and 20 million prepaid subscribers. In comparison, AT&T has about 64 million postpaid phone subscribers and 14 million prepaid subscribers. Verizon doesn't break out postpaid phone subscribers, but has nearly 110 million postpaid connections on its network and nearly 6 million prepaid subscribers. Despite its recent success, T-Mobile is still small compared to the two market leaders. That's why it's repeatedly shown interest in merging with Sprint (NYSE:S), which is even smaller than T-Mobile. Over the last couple years, T-Mobile has taken steps to improve its network, expanding it into markets where it doesn't even have a retail presence. This year it's rapidly building out retail locations in new markets. Carter says the effects of these new storefronts can take up a year to show up in terms of subscriber additions. T-Mobile is also dead last in terms of enterprise customers. AT&T has nearly twice as many business subscribers as it does consumer subscribers, and the gap is growing wider as the business segment cannibalizes consumer customers. Carter says T-Mobile will apply similar Un-carrier initiatives to the enterprise market as it did for the consumer market to drive subscriber growth. With the wireless service market in the United States near saturation, T-Mobile's growth will have to come from somewhere, especially now that a merger with Sprint is off the table. AT&T and Verizon are most likely to cede customers to T-Mobile simply because that's where most customers are today. But Carter noted that scale would allow T-Mobile to become less aggressive with its consumer pricing and promotions. After all, T-Mobile needs to expand margins in order to show the significant cash flow growth it's aiming for over the next couple years. That means less margin pressure on AT&T and Verizon as well. While a merger with Sprint would have been more beneficial for AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile already seems to have plans to reduce margin pressure going forward. AT&T seems resigned to sacrificing low-margin subscribers to T-Mobile, and Verizon has managed to withstand the onslaught of pressure from T-Mobile relatively well recently. Considering AT&T's concentration of enterprise customers, investors can expect that trend to continue as T-Mobile shifts its focus to enterprise customers. But improving scale at T-Mobile should produce better profits for the entire industry. ","
      
    This Is T-Mobile's Biggest Disadvantage -- The Motley Fool

It shouldn't be a big surprise that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is still winning over more customers from its competitors than it's losing. But CFO Braxton Carter gave some details about how much better T-Mobile is doing in the fourth quarter versus Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Sprint (NYSE:S) than it did last quarter. ""So far, in the fourth quarter, our porting ratios are up significantly,"" Carter said at a recent investors conference. ""We ended the third quarter at a porting ratio of 1.53. We're now 1.73 on porting ratios to date this quarter. And our porting ratios are up against every carrier."" So, what exactly continues to drive higher porting ratios for T-Mobile -- the ratio of customers moving their phone number to T-Mobile over the ratio moving their number away? Carter pointed to two key factors: the new iPhone release and its decision to bundle Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) with its unlimited plans. Image source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile was the last of the four major carriers to start offering the iPhone to its customers. As a result, its base of iPhone users is relatively small, especially compared to AT&T and Verizon. So, whenever a new iPhone comes out, it's a big opportunity for T-Mobile to win over new subscribers as they upgrade their phones. In the past, T-Mobile has been ultra aggressive in offering discounts on the iPhone. But its offer was much more moderate this year after it found its competitors copying its promotions, practically nullifying any positive impact. Carter views the higher price of the iPhones, particularly the iPhone X, as a factor that could cause consumers to really evaluate their carrier options. Considering T-Mobile has positioned itself to provide one of the best values in wireless service, it's well positioned to capitalize on consumers looking to offset higher device prices. Around two-thirds of all iPhones in the United States are models from more than two years ago. Nearly all of those devices should be paid off or close to it if they were on equipment installment plans. That represents millions of potential customers. If just a few extra thousand switch to T-Mobile when making their decision, it could have a big impact on the company's porting ratios. Unlike AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile is a stand-alone wireless carrier. It doesn't have any services it can bundle. Since acquiring DirecTV, AT&T has been able to offer a nationwide service bundle for its wireless and television business. This year, it's taken bundling a step further, offering free HBO to its wireless subscribers and offering discounts for its various television packages. Verizon also has a small wireline business it can bundle with wireless in the regions where it operates video and home internet service. T-Mobile responded in September by offering free Netflix to its subscribers. Netflix has over 51 million paid subscribers in the United States as of the end of the third quarter. It's very likely the majority of households are paying for Netflix. So, T-Mobile isn't pushing something its customers probably don't want to boost revenue; it's picking up the tab for something customers are already paying for out of pocket. Bundling Netflix is producing better user retention for T-Mobile, according to Carter. There's now a switching cost for customers thinking about leaving T-Mobile, just as there is if a customer wants to ditch AT&T's bundle of wireless, TV, and HBO. Sprint recently copied the strategy, offering its customers free Hulu. Hulu doesn't have quite the same demand as Netflix, so it likely won't have as strong of an effect as offering Netflix does. T-Mobile is off to a strong start this quarter. And as we head into seasonally strong periods for both the iPhone and Netflix, it could get stronger as the quarter progresses. ","

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone X has made waves in the tech sphere not only for its impressive specs but also for its price tag. Without a carrier deal, the 64GB iPhone X is going to cost you $999 from Apple, while the 256GB iPhone X is going to cost $1,149. This redesigned 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone was first released on Nov. 3, and includes an edge-to-edge OLED screen, a TrueDetect camera system to enable Face ID unlocking, and Animoji to create animated emojis. If you want to have the latest and greatest but don't want to break the bank, you might be able to swing it with a trade-in deal. The new iPhoneX has a less alarming price tag if you sign a deal at one of the four major carriers: Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sprint (NYSE:S), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), or AT&T (NYSE:T). The new iPhoneX has a less alarming price tag if you do a trade-in deal at one of the four major carriers. If you want the short answer, Sprint has the all-around cheapest deal if you want an individual unlimited data plan and the new iPhoneX. While the other three major carriers offer $300 off the iPhoneX with a trade-in deal, Sprint offers a generous $350 off the device if you trade in an eligible phone. Sprint is also tied for the lowest price on an unlimited data plan for one line: $60 per month for a plan that includes HD video and mobile hotspots. AT&T also offers $60 per month for its Unlimited Choice plan, but it has slower speeds, no HD video, and no mobile hotspots. AT&T's premium Unlimited Plus plan goes for $90. Finally, Verizon's lowest unlimited data plan for one line is $75, while T-Mobile's is $70. If you want a more detailed look at what the combo would cost at each carrier, keep reading. Lowest possible iPhone X cost: $699.99 ($300 off) Unlimited for one line: $75 per month If you want $300 off the 64GB $999.99 10th anniversary iPhone X from Verizon, you will need to follow these three steps: 1. Purchase the iPhone X with monthly payments of $41.66 spread out over two years. The discount will be paid back to you over the two years, so you have to commit to the phone and the unlimited plan for at least 24 months. 2. Sign up for a Verizon unlimited plan if you're not already on it. 3. Trade in your old phone. The discount on the iPhone X is dependent on the phone you have to trade in. The iPhone 6S or a later version will get you $300 off. The iPhone 6 series will get you $200 off, and the iPhone 5 series will get you $100 off. You can visit their website for more details on eligible phones from other companies. Lowest possible iPhone X cost: $699.99 ($300 off) Unlimited for one line: $70 per month If you want $300 off the $999.99 iPhone from T-Mobile, you need to pay $279.99 upfront and then $30 per month for 24 months. You will get the $300 back over two years in monthly installments of $12.50.

In AT&T's latest earnings call, CFO John Stephens said the company believed it was in a good position to compete with the other big carriers without offering aggressive promotions on the new iPhones released this fall. ""And as you can see, our margins are very solid and the performance has been great,"" Stephens said. ""But we believe we can compete and win based on our product offerings and that promotional activity of an extensive nature is not necessary."" However, customers can still use the company's regular trade-in program to get credit to apply for new iPhones. This means for each phone that costs more than $20, you can get $200 in credits to put toward the iPhone X so long as your used device is in good physical and working condition, an AT&T rep said. However, if you have a newer device, such as the iPhone 6, iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, then you can get $300 in credits.

Altaba (NASDAQ:AABA) just published an update on the focused investing company's financial health. The company formerly known as Yahoo! is a very different beast since it sold its operations to Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and refocused on the management of a few investments overseas. The company owns 14.7% of China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and a 35% stake in former subsidiary Yahoo Japan, an online search and marketing service in the land of the rising sun. How have these core investments treated Altaba since the July update? Let's have a look. Investment Fair Value as of Sept. 30, 2017 Fair Value as of June 16, 2017 Change Alibaba $66.2 billion $51.8 million 28% Yahoo Japan $9.6 billion $8.7 billion 10% Total Altaba Investments $84.8 billion $74.2 billion 14% Data source: Altaba SEC filings. Beyond the two flagship holdings, Altaba holds $5.5 billion of corporate bonds, $1.6 billion in certificates of deposit, and another $1.2 billion in an assortment of smaller investments. The Excalibur IP operation, which holds the licensing rights to Yahoo!'s portfolio of technology patents, did not move over to Verizon, and accounts for $675 million of Altaba's asset value today. But 78% of Altaba's total investment portfolio consists of Alibaba shares. Alibaba's stock has gained 39% since Altaba was formed, and Altaba shares followed along with a 37% gain. Over the same period, Yahoo Japan offered a 5% return, and the S&P 500 index gained 6%. Image source: Alibaba. Altaba is not a very active trader. The company has neither sold not bought a single share of Alibaba or Yahoo Japan in its (admittedly short) history, and also leaves most of its smaller holdings untouched. The company did unload a $69.3 million stake in Snap (NYSE:SNAP) in September, but that's  a rounding error next to its pair of multibillion-dollar holdings. As always, Altaba shares are trading roughly 30% below the combined value of its investment assets. As my fellow Fool Frank DiPietro has explained, that's due to the tax costs that would be involved in moving those international funds back to American soil. If Altaba ever finds a way to wind down its Asian assets without triggering a large payment to Uncle Sam, share values should rise closer to the firm's net assets value. Under a $5 billion share repurchase program, Altaba has bought back $3.3 billion of its own shares as of Nov. 16. The program is sure to be reapproved with a new multibillion dollar target, since Altaba has promised to return all its cash and holdings to shareholders over time.

It shouldn't be too big of a surprise that Warren Buffett has soured on IBM (NYSE:IBM). The Oracle of Omaha has been unloading his position in Big Blue all year. But IBM isn't the only stock Buffett's been reducing in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. He's also been selling Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and, a bit more surprisingly, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Are the best days behind these stocks? Big ships can't turn on a dime, and IBM is a freighter. Plans to reshape IBM back into a growth company are taking forever, and apparently, Warren Buffett's done waiting. He's been steadily selling Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in IBM all year. IMAGE SOURCE: MOTLEY FOOL. IBM was once one of his biggest positions -- he owned over 80 million shares -- but he sold 17 million shares in Q1, nearly 10 million shares in Q2, and another 17 million shares in Q3. As of September 30, he only has 37 million shares left. I suspect that number is even lower now. IBM was formerly a technology powerhouse, but declining demand for its legacy technology solutions hasn't been fully offset by growing demand for its strategic-imperatives businesses. As a result, its year-over-year revenue has declined in 22 straight quarters. During the past three years, trailing 12-month sales have fallen from more than $100 billion to less than $80 billion, despite its investments in the fastest-growing parts of its business, such as cloud computing. IBM's sales only fell 0.4% from one year ago in Q3, but flat isn't very inspiring. Until strategic-imperatives revenue represents a large enough share of sales to return this company to growth, IBM's shares are likely to remain under pressure. Those businesses produced $34.9 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, representing 45% of IBM's total revenue, and sales grew 11% year over year in Q3. IBM's heading in the right direction, but there's still work to be done. Could IBM become a bargain-basement buy at some point? Maybe. It's typically been smart to buy IBM when its trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is about 9.5. It's about 12.4 right now, so share prices will need to fall further, or we'll have to see some significant earnings expansion to get to that level again. Until then, it's hard to argue that there aren't better investment ideas out there. It seems Buffett agrees. IBM PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett added Charter Communications to his portfolio in 2014, and over the past three years, he's more than doubled his money. Apparently, that gain is a bit too much for Buffett to pass up because he sold 10% of his Charter Communications stake in the third quarter. Charter Communications has been on a roll since 2016 when it completed its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House. Share prices got an additional boost earlier this year when rumors emerged that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) had approached it about an acquisition, too. However, Charter Communications has given back some of its gains since CEO Tom Ruttledge dashed takeover speculation in September, saying the company's fine going it alone. Perhaps Charter Communications' decision to stay single is enough of an incentive for Buffett to want to book his profit. He still owns 8.5 million shares, so we'll need to see what happens in the fourth quarter before we know for certain that he's moving on to other stocks. In the meantime, I don't see much reason to buy Charter Communications following the past year's rumor-fueled run-up. IMAGE SOURCE: WELLS FARGO. Let's face it... Wells Fargo has lost some of its allure since admitting that workers opened millions of fake accounts to meet heavy-handed sales goals. But that doesn't mean that Buffett's bailing on his second-largest holding. Yes, he did finish last quarter with 3.8 million fewer shares than he began the quarter, but his selling was only to keep Berkshire Hathaway's ownership below 10% so that he could avoid Berkshire Hathaway being classified as a bank holding company. Since Wells Fargo has a big buyback program that's continuously reducing its share count, Warren Buffett has to trim his position every quarter just to maintain it at his target 9.8% ownership level. Although Buffett hasn't soured on Wells Fargo, you might want to. Despite industry tailwinds, including a strong economy and rising interest rates, Wells Fargo's adjusted earnings fell year over year, to $1.04 per share. Its net interest income was flat and its net interest margin, or the spread between how much it pays to fund loans and how much it collects in interest, declined to 2.87% quarter over quarter. Noninterest income, mortgage banking income, and total loans also dipped sequentially. Overall, there's no denying that Wells Fargo will remain a banking giant, but I expect its growth from here will be more tepid than it's been in the past. If so, investors might do better buying a different bank stock. Warren Buffett's famous for his disciplined investment approach. His ability to turn over stones and thoroughly understand opportunities and risks allows him to ride out a stock's inevitable downturns more easily than others. Given his penchant for patience, his selling of shares in IBM and Charter Communications should give investors in those two stocks pause. At a minimum, it suggests going back to your investment diary to make sure the reason why you bought shares still is valid. As for Wells Fargo, it's a different story. Buffett seems committed to keeping his ownership in the bank just underneath the crucial 10% mark. As long as this is true, he won't be propping up Wells Fargo's price by buying more shares. Instead, Wells Fargo is going to trade higher or lower based on its ability to move beyond its account scandal, boost its loan growth, and increase its profit. There's an opportunity for it to do that, but that doesn't mean that it's the best bank stock for new investors to be buying. ","
      
    Why Warren Buffett Is Selling These Stocks -- The Motley Fool

"Jamal Carnette, CFA",11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're like most people, you could use more income. With U.S. salary and wage growth continuing to barely outpace inflation, it's prudent to look for ways to augment your paychecks. One sensible way to do that is by investing in dividend-paying stocks. First, dividends are generally taxed at a lower level than your wages. For qualified dividends (which most of yours are likely to be), the tax rate tops out at 20%, while the marginal tax rates on added wages can run as high as 39.6%. Second, dividend stocks are relatively attractive in the current low-yield interest rate environment. Right now, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields 2.4% and the average 5-year certificate of deposit pays 1.5%, while the broader S&P 500 currently has a dividend yield of 1.9%. Third, in recent history, dividend stocks have the best track record of outperforming inflation. Over the last year, the S&P 500 has increased its cumulative dividend payout by 6.9%, more than double the pace of wage increases. Many fixed-income products have higher current yields but do not increase their annual payouts, and inflation can eat into income-based returns. Image Source: Getty Images One of the most basic techniques of income investing is to purchase high-yielding dividend stocks. The dividend yield is simply the ratio of the current price per share of a company to the dividends per share paid out over the past 12 months. The logic behind buying high-yield stocks is simple: As a shareholder, you are entitled to the dividend, so paying the lowest cost for the largest relative dividends (i.e., the highest yields) would seem to be preferable. However, this may be one of the more dangerous ideas in investing. There are a few significant risks with using dividend yield as your primary criterion for making an investment decision. While it's smart to evaluate a company's past dividend payouts, investors should put more emphasis on how probable it is that the company will be able to continue them. When a large segment of investors become skeptical of a company's prospects due to industry changes, poor management, or economic conditions, they will sell their shares of the company. This depresses the stock price, which has the perverse effect of making the dividend yield more attractive in the short run. This is referred to as a yield trap: If  (or more likely) when the company eventually cuts its dividend payout, the factor that induced you to buy it will be gone. Recently, this was the case with General Electric, which cut its dividend from $0.96 per share to $0.48 per share, a 50% decrease. That said, high-yielding stocks of companies that can turn things around often outperform the greater stock market as investors recognize them to be safer prospects with outsize yields. A mistake many investors make when evaluating a company's ability to pay its dividend is using the common dividend payout ratio (dividends per share/net income per share) and the dividend yield as their only evaluative metrics. However, dividends are paid from cash generation, which can vastly differ from accounting earnings in both the short and long terms. The main discrepancy between net income, (aka, accounting earnings) and cash-flow generation is depreciation, as this is not a cash expense but rather a method of expensing costs of long-term assets like factories or buildings. A much better measure of a company's ability to continue to pay (or raise) its dividend is the free-cash-flow payout ratio, which replaces net income with the free-cash flow (cash from operations minus capital expenditures). This measures the true cash the company is generating versus what it's paying out to shareholders. Additionally, it's a good idea to pay attention to a company's net cash position, as companies with a lot of cash can continue to pay their dividends even the event of temporary operational weaknesses. Data as of Nov. 13, 2017 Within the S&P 500, the current top-yielding stock is CenturyLink. The company's core businesses are in the competitive broadband and telecommunications industries, and it owns a lot of assets in the declining wireline subsegment. CenturyLink does not have the scale of larger competitors like AT&T, Charter Communications, Comcast, and Verizon. Investors continue to have low expectations about its ability to continue servicing the dividend. Recently, the company completed its acquisition of Level 3 Communications, a business and government focused service provider, which should give CenturyLink significant scale that it can use to focus on the enterprise. Management has made defending its dividend a priority, as CEO Glen Post III noted: CenturyLink's management and board of directors see our quarterly cash dividend as an important part of our value proposition for shareholders. Upon completion of the Level 3 acquisition, we anticipate generating nearly a billion dollars in cash synergies, as well as significant cash tax savings from the accelerated recognition of Level 3's net operating losses. These cash savings, along with our focus on profitable growth, are expected to drive increasing free cash flow per share, enhance our financial flexibility and improve our dividend payout ratio. Image Source: Getty Images Like CenturyLink, Macy's is also facing questions about its business model. The department store chain's stock fell more than 50% over the last year, and many investors are quite skeptical of how the business model of traditional retail with fare under intense competition from e-commerce players like Amazon. In the last two years, more than 20 retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection, including Sports Authority, Toys R' Us, and Payless ShoeSource. Many analysts have tried to predict which chain with be next to drop, but my colleague Adam Levine-Weinberg feels it won't be Macy's. He argues that its cash flow can support its dividend, at least in the near term; free cash flow is roughly double what the company paid out in dividends last year. The company is in the midst of restructuring the business, selling less-productive assets to pay down debt and increase operating margins. If the company executes on those plans successfully, investors could strongly benefit, given the current exceedingly bearish outlook the market has on it. In a recurring theme, the third highest-yielding stock in the S&P 500 also faces questions related to its business model. Seagate Technology is a large manufacturer of hard disk drives (HDDs). However, most computers now use solid-state drives (SSDs) for storage, as their performance is better and HDD's cost advantage continues to shrink. Last year, Seagate's primary contender Western Digital acquired SanDisk to pivot to SSD manufacturing, while Seagate remains mostly tethered to HDD technology. Seagate's shares rallied after it reported third-quarter earnings. Sales fell 6%, but the company has been cutting its expenses as well, which helped it produce earnings per share growth. However, the company reported a year-over-year free cash flow decline of 75%, which is a metric long-term income investors should strongly consider before buying shares for the dividend. Everybody wants more income, but it's important to avoid taking unwise risks. Looking for high dividend yields is a good starting point, but on its own, its a poor strategy for picking stocks to deliver long-term income. Do your proper due diligence, and evaluate a company's cash flow, its economic environment, and the probability of a dividend cut before you buy its shares.  ","
      
    What Investors Need to Know About High-Yield Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Motley Fool Staff,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. First, it was Disney (NYSE:DIS) looking to buy the lion's share of Fox's (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) entertainment assets. Now it's Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) talking acquisition -- and, worth noting, whichever wins takes majority control of Hulu. Then, they break down their views on why ever-expanding payment platform specialist PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has decided the consumer loans aren't what it wants to be in. It may be less an issue of a business direction choice and more a balance sheet maneuver. A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: Comcast is the parent company of NBC, Telemundo, Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Animation, and apparently, Matty, they're looking for even more content, because Comcast is talking to 21st Century Fox about buying most of Fox's assets, including the movie studio division and National Geographic, and FX Networks. And Disney was in talks with Fox as well. Where is this going? Matt Argersinger: You used to be able to clean the categorize the media entertainment industry into two categories. You had content and you had distribution. And there was kind of a nice marriage relationship there for decades. But because of the success of Netflix, because of the threat that Amazon represents, I think the older legacy media companies have realized that you have to have both. There was always a little bit of overlap, but now we want to actually control both. I think that's why you saw Comcast buy DreamWorks, NBC Universal in recent years. You have the AT&T, Time Warner merger that may or may not happen. And now you have Disney and Comcast, and apparently Verizon as well, looking at Fox's assets. I think, in the mix here, it's mentioned but not really one of the headlines, is that Hulu is part of this deal. Fox owns 30% of Hulu. So, if Disney or Comcast get control of Fox, they now have a majority position in Hulu. And I think that makes that platform much more competitive against Netflix and Amazon. I think a deal is going to happen here. There's just too much interest in those assets. I expect, by the end of the year, there's probably going to be some official acquisition plan in place. Jason Moser: I would not undervalue that Hulu assets. We have that skinny bundle that they offer now. They're still working out some kinks, but I tell you, it's a really great way to cut the cord so to speak and still get a lot of content at a very affordable price. I think they're onto something there. Hill: It's interesting. We hear all the time that content is king. And clearly Fox has looked at their entire portfolio and said, ""We just want to do news and sports."" Shares of PayPal up this week after the company announced it is selling its entire consumer loan portfolio to Synchrony Financial. You tell me, Jason, why doesn't PayPal want to loan me money anymore? Ron Gross: [laughs] It's just you, Chris. Hill: It's just me. Moser: This is more of a shoring up the balance sheet thing. I think, honestly, in the simplest terms, this is a deal that just lets two companies focus on doing what they do best. Synchrony, at its core, is a bank offering credit products, and PayPal is a financial services company that more or less serves as the median through which money is exchanged in this mobile age. So, as you said, it takes a credit portfolio that PayPal used to own in the form of a lot of receivables and basically unloads that onto Synchrony's balance sheet, which is more in line with what they do. It's about $5.8 billion that represents that receivables portfolio. So, the general thinking is, this gives PayPal's management, it frees up a lot of cash that they can then invest back into the business in other forms of products and services they want to bring to market that complement their offerings in anyway. So, put it in context, PayPal currently uses about 50% of their free cash flow annually to fund this credit portfolio. So, this is really going to free up a lot of free cash for them, which I think is ultimately a good thing, and that's why you saw the market react so positively to the news. ","

,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"Pai, a Republican named by President Donald Trump to head up the FCC, unveiled plans last week to scrap the 2015 landmark  net neutrality rules, moving to give broadband service providers sweeping power over what content consumers can access. “When it comes to an open internet, Twitter is part of the problem,” Pai said. “The company has a viewpoint and uses that viewpoint to discriminate.” He pointed to Twitter’s refusal to let Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, advertise a campaign video with an anti-abortion message. “To say the least, the company appears to have a double standard when it comes to suspending or de-verifying conservative users’ accounts as opposed to those of liberal users,” Pai said. A spokesperson for Twitter said that at no time was Blackburn’s video censored and that her followers would have been able to still see it. “Because advertisements are served to users who do not necessarily follow an account, we therefore have higher standards for their content,” the Twitter spokesperson said. Twitter in October declined a campaign video advertisement by Blackburn, who announced she is running for the U.S. Senate, saying that a remark by Blackburn about opposing abortion was inflammatory. Twitter later reversed its decision. Trump is a prolific user of Twitter, often posting his unvarnished thoughts on the news of the day. He used Twitter throughout his presidential campaign to circumvent traditional media and talk directly to voters. Pai has also been a frequent user of the website - acknowledging during the speech, “I love Twitter” - to push his case in favor of the rule changes. On Tuesday afternoon, he even posted a link to his remarks critical of Twitter on his own Twitter account. Following Pai’s remarks on Tuesday, at an event organized by the libertarian-leaning R Street Institute, two other FCC commissioners said they would support his proposal when they vote on Dec. 14. The rules prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others. “So when you get past the wild accusations, fear mongering and hysteria, here’s the boring bottom line,” Pai said. “The plan to restore internet freedom would return us to the light touch, market-based approach under which the internet thrived.” ","

Pai defended the change as a way to remove heavy-handed internet regulations. “The internet and companies like Twitter, which signed the letter, thrived under the pre-2015 light-touch regulatory framework that governed Internet access.

 ,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"A majority of the U.S. Supreme Court justices seemed prepared Wednesday to impose new limits on the government's ability to track cellphone users through records kept by their wireless providers. ""Most Americans, I still think, want to avoid Big Brother,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the most outspoken in expressing concern about an invasion of privacy. ""A cellphone can be pinged in your bedroom. It can be pinged at your doctor's office. It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life,"" she said. But the justices did not divide along traditional lines, with both the court's liberals and conservatives expressing their reservations. Thousands of times a year, the nation's local police departments get phone company records allowing them to plot the movements of individual customers. The issue before the court Wednesday was whether access to that data should require a search warrant issued by a judge. When a cellphone is used for calls or text messages, it signals the closest antenna tower to connect with the telephone network. As the user travels, the call is handed off to successive towers, and the cellphone companies keep records of the phone numbers routed through each tower to sort out such things as roaming charges. Related: What you’re giving away with those home DNA tests Nate Wessler, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who appeared before the court, called those records ""digital bread crumbs"" and said they can be highly revealing. ""Access to these historical location records presents the government with a veritable time machine, the ability to press rewind on someone's life and learn where we've been far into the past,"" Wessler said. The case involves a challenge brought by a Michigan man, Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted of robbing a string of Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores after FBI agents used three months of cellphone records to show that he was near each store at the time of the crimes. Because the FBI did not get a search warrant, Carpenter said that evidence should be thrown out. In past cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that people have no privacy interest in the checks they write or the phone numbers they dial from landlines, because it's understood the information will be used to conduct business — for financial transactions or to generate phone bills. Related: 'Hey Alexa, how secure are voice-activated assistants like you?' Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben told the court that no search warrant was needed, because cellphone customers have the same understanding, aware that the phone company will keep records of their calls, and willingly give up any claim of privacy to it. ""There is an element here of voluntariness in deciding to contract with a cell company, just like there's an element of voluntariness in getting a landline phone and making calls,"" Dreeben said. ""And there's an element of voluntariness in signing up for a bank account and using a debit card to purchase everything in your life."" But Chief Justice John Roberts questioned how voluntarily people surrender that information. ""You really don't have a choice these days if you want to have a cellphone."" After listening to the 80-minute courtroom argument, many legal experts predicted the government would lose the case. ""This is probably the most significant privacy ruling the court would make for the last 10 years, because it would finally put a barrier to the government getting intimate details about people in criminal cases,"" said Mark Rasch, a former Justice Department computer crimes prosecutor. In recent years, the justices have shown a willingness to extend digital-age privacy protection, ruling that police need warrants to search through the contents of smartphones or to attach a GPS tracking device to a car.

 ,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"WASHINGTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday takes up a major test of privacy rights in the digital age as it weighs whether police must obtain warrants to get data on the past locations of criminal suspects using cellphone data from wireless providers. The justices at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) are due to hear an appeal by a man named Timothy Carpenter convicted in a series of armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan with the help of past cellphone location data that linked him to the crime locations. His American Civil Liberties Union lawyers argue that without a court-issued warrant such data amounts to an unreasonable search and seizure under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment. Law enforcement authorities routinely request and receive this information from wireless providers during criminal investigations as they try to link a suspect to a crime. Police helped establish that Carpenter was near the scene of the robberies of Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores by securing from his cellphone carrier his past “cell site location information” tracking which cellphone towers had relayed his calls. The legal fight has raised questions about the degree to which companies protect their customers’ privacy rights. The big four wireless carriers, Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, receive tens of thousands of these requests annually from law enforcement. Verizon was the only one of those four companies to tell the Supreme Court that it favors strong privacy protections for its customers, with the other three sitting on the sidelines. There is growing scrutiny of the surveillance practices of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies amid concern among lawmakers across the political spectrum about civil liberties and authorities evading warrant requirements. The Supreme Court twice in recent years has ruled on major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. Two years later, the court said police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest. Carpenter’s bid to suppress the evidence failed and he was convicted of six robbery counts. On appeal, the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his convictions, finding that no warrant was required for the cellphone data. The ACLU said in court papers that police need “probable cause,” and therefore a warrant, in order to meet Fourth Amendment requirements. Based on a provision of a 1986 federal law called the Stored Communications Act, the Justice Department said probable cause is not needed to obtain customer records. Instead, it argues, prosecutors must show only that there are “reasonable grounds” for the records to be provided and that they are “relevant and material” to an investigation. President Donald Trump’s administration said in court papers the government has a “compelling interest” in acquiring the data without a warrant because the information is particularly useful at the early stages of a criminal investigation. Civil liberties groups said the 1986 law did not anticipate the way mobile devices now contain a wealth of data on each user. A ruling is due by the end of June. ","

 ,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"(Reuters) - A Canadian accused by the United States of helping Russian intelligence agents break into email accounts as part of a massive 2014 breach of Yahoo accounts is expected to plead guilty next week, according to court records. Karim Baratov, who earlier this year waived his right to fight a U.S. request for his extradition from Canada, is scheduled to appear in federal court in San Francisco on Tuesday for the plea hearing, according to a court calendar seen on Friday. Baratov, a 22-year-old Canadian citizen born in Kazakhstan, was arrested in Canada in March at the request of U.S. prosecutors. He later waived his right to fight a request for his extradition to the United States. Andrew Mancilla, Baratov’s lawyer, declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Justice Department announced charges in March  against Baratov and three other men, including two officers in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), for their roles in the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts. Prosecutors said that the FSB officers, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, directed and paid hackers to obtain information and used Alexsey Belan, who is among the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation’s most-wanted cyber criminals, to breach Yahoo. When the FSB officers learned that a target had a non-Yahoo webmail account, including through information obtained from the Yahoo hack, they worked with Baratov, who was who paid to break into at least 80 email accounts, prosecutors said. The individuals associated with the accounts they sought to access included Russian officials, the chief executive of a metals company and a prominent banker, according to the indictment. At least 50 of the accounts Baratov targeted were hosted by Google, the indictment said. Tuesday’s proceedings before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria are scheduled as a “change of plea” hearing. Baratov, the only person arrested to date in the case, previously in August pleaded not guilty to conspiring to commit computer fraud, conspiring to commit access device fraud, conspiring to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.

Karim Baratov pleaded guilty to charges returned by a grand jury in the Northern District of California in February for hacking email accounts and selling the passwords to an agent of Russia’s intelligence agency, the department said in a statement. Baratov, a 22-year-old Canadian citizen born in Kazakhstan, was arrested in Canada in March at the request of U.S. prosecutors.

The Justice Department announced charges in March against Baratov and three other men, including two officers in Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, for their roles in the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts. Following the charges, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the idea that FSB employees could have been involved in the Yahoo hack. Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. wireless operator, acquired most of Yahoo Inc’s assets in June. Prosecutors said the FSB officers, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, directed and paid hackers to obtain information and used Alexsey Belan, who is among the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s most-wanted cyber criminals, to breach Yahoo.

He and his clients own shares of VZ.) Could 2018 be the year that Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) breaks out of its nearly five-year period of going nowhere? The options market is suggesting that shares of Verizon could rise almost 18% in 2018, while the technical setup would indicate that an increase over $50.50 would trigger a technical breakout. Should a technical breakout occur, the stock could rise towards $56.00 in 2018, an increase of just over 18% from the current stock price around $47.35. (For more, see also: Verizon Stock Is Ready to Break Out of Its Slump.) Over the past five years, even with the dividend, Verizon has delivered a total return of only 38%, versus an S&P 500 that has risen by nearly 86% and the S&P 500 Total Return Index, including dividends, of almost 106%. Surely the poor performance of Verizon shares have been disappointing and not worth owning over the past five years. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts Some traders are making a bet that the outlook will start improving in 2018 for the telecom giant using the call options set to expire on January 18, 2019. The strike prices ranging from $45 to $55 have a notional value of roughly $15.5 million in total open interest. This is no small bet, especially considering the time decay of the options due to the length of time. The $55 call options trade at a price of approximately $0.86, implying the price of Verizon's stock needs to rise to $55.86 just to break even. (Interactive Brokers) Due to the length of time until expiration, the options carry an expensive premium. This is because as time moves forward, the value in the options will decline, meaning the premium for the options will decrease due to time decay. It makes betting on a stock that has gone nowhere in nearly five years a risky bet to a buyer of the calls. (For related reading, see: Why Verizon May Need to Buy CBS and Viacom.) Should shares of Verizon rise above $50.50, it would trigger a technical breakout in the stock. The stock has traded in a range between $44 and $54 since 2012. However, shares have been trending lower since June of 2016. A rise above $50.50, taking the stock above that downtrend, will lead to the breakout. This would send shares higher up towards $54.50—an old resistance level. But this time around it would seem possible for shares to rise above resistance on towards the previous highs of $56. Perhaps things are looking up for Verizon in 2018, but there is a long way to go. At least for now, the technicals and the traders are suggesting shares will rise.

Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) stock dropped 9% this year, underperforming the S&P 500's 17% gain by a wide margin. The telecom giant struggled with earnings misses, its first-ever decline in core wireless subscribers, free cash flow issues, and a murky outlook for its $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo's internet business. That's why analysts expect Verizon's revenue and earnings to respectively dip 1% and 3% this year. But in fiscal 2018 (which starts in calendar 2018), Wall Street expects Verizon's revenue to rise 2%, and for its earnings to grow 3% -- solid growth rates for a stock that trades at just 12 times forward earnings. Let's take a look at what investors should expect from Verizon next year. Image source: Getty Images. In June, Verizon launched Oath, a new subsidiary that merged AOL (which it acquired in 2015) with Yahoo's internet business. Oath's portfolio includes over 50 media and technology brands, including HuffPost, Yahoo Sports, AOL.com, and TechCrunch. Oath's ecosystem reaches over a billion people per month and generated $2 billion in revenues last quarter, but Verizon hasn't fully explained how it will integrate Oath into its core wireless, wireline, and TV businesses. During last quarter's conference call, CFO Matthew Ellis stated that Verizon ""will provide additional information on Oath in future quarters"" as it integrates the business. However, one Oath strategy that was already revealed is Verizon's upcoming online TV service. Oath CEO Tim Armstrong has been assigned to integrate Oath's ad placement system (which is currently used in its network of websites) into the upcoming platform, which Verizon claims will launch in the spring. Armstrong is also responsible for fixing Go90, Verizon's mobile streaming video platform, which flopped due to competition from entrenched players like YouTube. However, both platforms still face intense competition from rival services, which include AT&T's (NYSE:T) expanding DirecTV ecosystem, Dish Networks' Sling TV, and Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Xfinity X1. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T's planned purchase of Time Warner will likely force Verizon to make a comparable acquisition in the escalating battle of controlling both the pipes and the content. That's why recent reports indicate that Verizon and Comcast are both interested in buying parts of 21st Century Fox. If Verizon buys Fox's media assets, its business model could become more similar to Comcast's, which is split between its ISP business and NBCUniversal. Over the past two years, Verizon acquired Telogis and Fleetmatics to boost its presence in telematics for connected cars. It also bought drone operations company Skyward. These acquisitions are expanding Verizon's wireless reach beyond the highly saturated smartphone market. Last quarter, Verizon added 274,000 wireless phone subscribers and 91,000 tablet subscribers. However, it also added 238,000 ""other"" wireless devices, led by connections for wearables. This expansion into other devices -- which include cars and drones -- could eventually offset any declines in phone subscriptions. Earlier this year, Verizon acquired Straight Path and XO Communications to strengthen its fiber assets ahead of its 5G fixed broadband rollout next year. Verizon also recently teamed up with AT&T in a joint partnership with Tillman Infrastructure to build hundreds of new towers. Verizon's aggressive expansion plans caused its long-term debt to hit $115.3 billion last quarter, up from $105.4 billion at the end of 2016. Just $2.2 billion of that total matures within the year, but Verizon will likely divest some non-core businesses to reduce its debt load. It's already sold data centers, its cloud businesses, and landline assets over the past two years to focus on the expansion of its digital ecosystem and 5G networks, so investors should expect additional divestments in 2018 as its spending accelerates. Verizon, like many of its telco peers, is slowly evolving. Its growth might seem glacial, but its investments in online advertising, streaming videos, and adjacent wireless markets will likely pay off over the next few years. Until that happens, investors should sit back, relax, and collect its generous forward yield of 5%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 59%. Verizon has hiked that dividend annually for ten straight years. ","
      
    What to Expect From Verizon Communications Inc. in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

The stock market has rallied under President Trump's administration: The S&P 500 has gained more than 21% since the election. As of this writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has produced 60 new closing record highs this year alone. Unfortunately, investors in telecommunications companies have not experienced any benefit, as both Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have both seen their stocks fall since the 2016 presidential election. Data by YCharts. To this point, stock-market ebullience based on politics mostly has been an exercise in faith. Trump's four-pronged business agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, Obamacare repeal, and infrastructure spending has been stymied, for the most part. Paradoxically, it appears the biggest movement on the deregulation front may aid these telecommunications giants, which have not participated in the rally. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is moving forward with a plan that could increase the profits of all internet service providers (ISPs), and give a boost to dividend giants like Verizon and AT&T. Image Source: Getty Images In 2015, Obama-era FCC chairman Tom Wheeler designated ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the telecommunications act after earlier attempts to apply net neutrality were stymied by the courts. When new FCC chair Ajit Pai assumed leadership, he immediately called the regulations ""heavy handed"" and promised to undo the classification. This month, Pai outlined his repeal plan, the ""Restoring Internet Freedom"" order; it's expected to pass next month. Not satisfied with a simple repeal, Pai appears to have gone even further. The FCC also announced its intent for federal pre-emption, blocking states that want to enforce their own regulations from doing so, and agreeing with AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast, which all lobbied for federal restrictions on state-level regulators. With one move, Pai essentially guaranteed that net-neutrality rules never would be applied to ISPs in the United States. AT&T and Verizon could use the help: Both are facing diminishing prospects in other business lines. Wireline telephony continues to suffer as wireless has become the de facto communication method. Recently, wireless telephony has seen profit stagnate under pricing pressures from T-Mobile and Sprint via unlimited data plans. Subscription TV has also been under pressure due to streaming-based substitutes and cord-cutters. The only true growth area has been ISP. Meanwhile, both AT&T and Verizon have large needs for cash. In addition to the need to pay to maintain and upgrade the networks listed above, both have large commitments to financial stakeholders. Between bondholders, dividend payouts, and capital expenditures, Verizon paid $31.6 billion in the last 12 months, while AT&T paid $40.5 billion. While free cash flow is currently supportive of both companies' dividends, the combination of large cash payouts, declining prospects in most business lines, and higher interest rates in the future has led to concerns about each company's ability to continue servicing its dividends in future years. Many ISPs shocked observers when they noted they agreed with the broad tenets of net neutrality. Comcast even crafted a heavily trafficked blog post addressing the subject -- while speaking out against Title II designation. Critics counter that Comcast has broken promises to regulators before, and it's different when profit is concerned. In fact, as CEOs have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders, it's almost a dereliction of their duty to not at least look into fully monetizing their assets. Net neutrality made their ability to monetize their Internet assets more difficult. Once it's repealed, the companies are legally free to block, meter, or slow traffic as they wish, with potential losers being everybody that depends on content delivered on the internet. Not to take full advantage of this is doing a disservice to their shareholders. Whether or not ISPs will do so is anybody's guess for the time being. It appears, however, that the executive branch of the federal government no longer considers this an issue worthy of regulation. ","

If you're an income-focused investor, no doubt Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have popped up on your radar. While the broader S&P 500 has a dividend yield of 1.9% and the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond of 2.3%, Verizon and AT&T yield 5.3% and 5.8%, respectively. It's not just high dividend yields. Shares of AT&T and Verizon currently trade for forward price-to-earnings ratios of 11.4 and 11.7, respectively, versus the S&P 500's 21 forward multiple. It's clear Wall Street doesn't have high expectations for these companies. As of this writing, year to date, shares of Verizon and AT&T have lost 15% and 19%, respectively, while the overall market has advanced by 16%. You must ask if these companies are good yield plays that will continue paying their dividend for years to come or if they're yield traps -- companies that lure investors in with high yields only to cut them or substantially underperform the market. Image source: Getty Images. At the heart of AT&T and Verizon's issues are problems with their core business of wireless communications. While Big Red and AT&T are the two largest carriers in the United States by subscriber count, the business is becoming highly competitive. Led by T-Mobile's Uncarrier program, the industry has endured lower prices and more consumer-friendly terms, at the same time requiring huge capital expenditures to build out and maintain the network. Both are also in the subscription-based television industry, with Verizon's FiOS offering and AT&T's purchase of DIRECTV. The subscription television business faces many of the same issues that affect wireless communications, including high capital expenditure requirements in a competitive market. In addition, the subscription television market is facing competition in the form of streaming-based substitutes and from a shift in consumer behavior as more ""cut the cord"" and forgo the service entirely. Verizon Communications can be partially absolved for its high debt sins. In 2013, the company engaged in the largest corporate debt offering ever, selling $49 billion. The company was forced to do so to buy its most lucrative business, Verizon Wireless. In 1999, before anyone had an idea just how important the wireless industry would become, Verizon (then GTE and Bell Atlantic) announced a joint venture with Vodafone to create a wireless company, with Verizon owning 55% and Vodafone owning 45%. By the time Verizon was able to repurchase Vodafone's minority stake, it was worth $130 billion, forcing the company to take on large sums of debt to fully own its namesake wireless business. However, Verizon could not have had worse timing, as T-Mobile's Uncarrier program began in earnest shortly after the deal closed, eventually forcing Verizon to reoffer unlimited (and margin-lowering) data plans. AT&T has also been active in the debt markets, selling $17.5 billion -- the then third-largest offering -- to buy DIRECTV. AT&T is also looking to take on $40 billion in more debt as it hopes to buy Time Warner. The combined company is expected to have $175 billion of total debt on its books. As of now, the federal government is challenging the merger, which may be good news for investors concerned about the company's balance sheet. Verizon is committed to defending its dividend. At a September Goldman Sachs conference, CEO Lowell McAdam noted that the company has a target of $10 billion in cost savings over the next four years to pay the dividend through 2022. This was less than a week after the company raised its dividend for the 11th year in a row. Not to be outdone, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson remarked at the same conference: Our owners expect the cash return, the dividend return, and we are committed to that. We've been a public company for over 30 years. We've increased that dividend every single year. And so, we are committed to the dividend. We think that's very, very important. But then the third use of cash obviously will be the debt pay down. So those are kind of the priorities that I think through the next three years. Currently, both AT&T and Verizon are generating enough cash to pay their dividends. Over the past five fiscal years, AT&T produced enough free cash flow (cash from operations minus capital expenditures) to pay its dividend; Verizon did so in four of the five. However, with financial leverage ratios of 3.5 and 9.5, respectively, free cash flow can rapidly swing negative with small decreases in revenue or operating margins. While I wouldn't go as far as calling either AT&T nor Verizon yield traps, I do think both are reasonably priced considering their high debt piles, large payout commitments, and huge capital expenditures. Even if these companies don't cut their dividend, I predict dividend raises will come less frequently or on a much smaller incremental basis. ","

For Americans it's easy to be bearish on tobacco companies as the number of U.S. adults smoking continues to decline, but there is plenty of global growth remaining. Imperial has exposure to some of the biggest and most lucrative markets in the world, and a couple advantages. One is that Imperial Brands is the leader in Cuban cigars, which could be a boost to its financials as relations between the U.S. and Cuba slowly improve. Another benefit has been the progress of plain-packaging legislation in countries around the world. The goal of these laws is to require tobacco packaging to be uniform in color and presentation, without branding, logos, or other promotional elements. While plain packaging will reduce demand, as intended, Imperial is known for its value brands and wouldn't suffer as much as larger competitors powered by more recognizable brands. Finding a company dishing out a dividend yield higher than Verizon isn't easy. However, Imperial Brands offers a solid dividend with global growth prospects, potential catalysts, and competitive advantages that make it worth considering when looking for income stocks. Danny Vena (Iron Mountain): Iron Mountain may not be a household name like Verizon, but the company is the global leader in records storage and information management solutions. It occupies more than 85 million square feet of space in the 1,400 facilities it operates, in 53 countries around the world. The company counts 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies as clients, and has a total of 230,000 organizations as customers worldwide. Those customers tend to stick around. A full 50% of the boxes Iron Mountain stored 15 years ago are still stored today. Iron Mountain operates as a real-estate investment trust (REIT), which requires it to pay out at least 90% of its profits as dividends. This results in an above-average payout, as the company currently sports a 5.8% dividend yield, for a higher income stream than even Verizon. Iron Mountain expects to grow its dividend from $2.20 per share in 2017 to $2.54 per share by 2020. The company plans to fund that dividend by growing its revenue by 5% annually over the next three years, and its adjusted funds from operations by 9% annually through 2020, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Iron Mountain will continue its strong history of buyouts, which it expects will fuel growth, with an estimated $450 million to $600 million in acquisitions anticipated between 2018 and 2020. The company will then apply a proven template of cost-cutting and margin improvement. With a 25-year history of revenue growth and strong dividends, this company is king of the mountain. Jeremy Bowman (AT&T): Verizon isn't the only juicy dividend play in the telecom sector. Rival AT&T is also generous when it comes to sharing the wealth with investors, and is a better dividend pick than Verizon for a number of reasons. AT&T offers a higher yield, at 5.6%, and unlike Verizon, Ma Bell is a Dividend Aristocrat, as it's paid increasing dividends for the last 33 years. By comparison, Verizon paused its dividend hikes for much of the first decade of the century. AT&T's dividend hikes have been modest over the last several years; the payout has increased by just a penny each year, or a little more than 2%, as the company's profit growth, like Verizon's, has been modest. AT&T has also pursued acquisitions more aggressively than Verizon, which could better position it as the telecom and media industries continue to consolidate. In 2015, AT&T closed on a $49 billion takeover of DIRECTV, the leader in satellite TV, and the company is now hoping to merge with Time Warner, though that deal will need to pass regulatory muster first. Since Time Warner and AT&T aren't direct competitors, many expect some version of the deal to eventually go through. Elsewhere, AT&T is narrowing the gap with Verizon in network quality, and would have a much stronger bundle if even part of the Time Warner deal is approved. With a higher dividend yield and a strong record of dividend hikes, AT&T looks like the better choice for dividend investors. ","
      
    3 Dividend Stocks That Pay You Better Than Verizon Does -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR), it has become a question of when, not if, the company runs out of money. The internet, phone, and cable provider has been steadily sinking since it spent $10.5 billion on Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline businesses in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). That deal was an attempt by the company to gain the scale it needed to compete with its bigger rivals. The problem is that Frontier's purchase has coincided with a general decline in the cable business as cord cutting accelerated. Making matters worse is that telco or wireline providers have not been compensating for their pay-television losses with broadband gains. Frontier has been steadily losing video customers. Image source: Getty Images. Since its Verizon deal closed in April 2016, Frontier has lost subscribers in every quarter. These losses have been in both cable and internet, and they show no signs of stopping -- nor even slowing down. Frontier made the CTF purchase in order to give it the size it needed to operate efficiently -- and in that respect, the deal delivered; the company has slashed its operating costs by over $1 billion annually, and more savings are expected. The problem is the steady decline in subscribers. That has left the company in a cash crunch, which it has met partly by creatively restructuring debt and partly by slashing its dividend. Frontier's fiscal woes also sank its share price so low it was forced to engage in a reverse stock split to avoid being delisted. On the positive side, Frontier has slowed its losses in both customer count and dollars. CEO Daniel McCarthy celebrated that in the company's third-quarter earnings release. ""Our third quarter results highlight the ongoing stabilization across our business as we focus on executing our strategy,"" he said. ""During the quarter, we were pleased with the continued improvement in subscriber trends and churn in our California, Texas and Florida markets, ongoing stabilization in our commercial business, and continued operating efficiencies."" Data source: Frontier. *There was a one-time impairment charge in Q2 2017. It does look as though the numbers are improving, but Frontier is fighting two negative trends. Cord cutting has sped up, with major pay-TV providers losing a total of around 1.4 million paying customers through the first three quarters of 2017, after dropping 795,000 in all of 2016. Second, as noted above, while broadband has been growing, that growth has gone to cable providers, not telephone companies, which is the technology Frontier uses. McCarthy may manage to hold off the end. He has proven adept when it comes to cutting costs and managing obligations. It's even possible that there is a bottom for cord cutting, and that perhaps Frontier may stabilize. The problem is that the company can't grow. A stable Frontier may find some companies willing to acquire it, but not at much of a premium, if any. This isn't a potential growth stock: It's a survival play. McCarthy may deliver survival -- and that's certainly better than bankruptcy -- but he can't change the nature of this market, and that puts a pretty hard cap on Frontier's upside. ","

Adam Levy,11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it seemed like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) were on course for a successful merger agreement last month, I wrote that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) would be two of the biggest beneficiaries if a deal went through. Fewer competitors means more profits to go around for the players that remain. But with Sprint's dwindling hopes of a buyer swooping in and snatching it up, it may be forced to refocus on its bottom line instead of attracting new customers at any cost. A shift in focus would benefit competing carriers, including its former suitor, T-Mobile. That's the crux of the argument posed by analyst Craig Moffett, who writes, ""All players will benefit if Sprint, as seems likely, adopts a less promotional pricing posture as they attempt to balance the competing priorities of debt service and network reinvestment."" Indeed, there's no longer a clear buyer for Sprint, and the company is being forced to become self-sustaining. Sprint could struggle to differentiate its product and attract new subscribers without its extremely low pricing. That leaves more subscribers on the table for T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T. Image source: Sprint. Sprint has run several major price promotions over the last couple years. To its credit, the promotions have done a good job of winning new customers from competitors, but it hasn't helped grow the top line. Over the last two years, Sprint has added nearly 1.7 million postpaid phone subscribers and 1.1 million total postpaid connections. Its prepaid and wholesale and affiliate connections, meanwhile, have fallen considerably. Overall, service revenue fell from $6.9 billion in the second quarter in 2015 to just under $6 billion last quarter. While Sprint is attracting more customers, it's not able to hold onto them. Its postpaid subscriber churn rate climbed from 1.54% in the second quarter of 2015 to 1.72% last quarter. That churn rate is significantly higher than all three of its main competitors. That may be due to customers falling off Sprint's promotional pricing. All this is to say: Sprint is attracting more and more gross additions thanks to its pricing promotion. But those gross customers are largely coming from competitors. If Sprint offers fewer price promotions, it should see churn rate continue to climb for several quarters while gross additions decline. That means net additions at competitors should climb in aggregate. If Sprint is forced to reduce its promotional offers, it seems like Verizon and T-Mobile are likely to benefit the most. AT&T is weighed down by its pay-TV business and loads of debt, while Verizon's wireline business is considerably smaller, and T-Mobile is purely a wireless service provider. Moffett offers a similar conclusion. All three offer slightly differentiated services. Verizon's differentiation strategy of maintaining its premium network quality and its strong brand provide it one of the better competitive advantages in the industry. AT&T is leveraging its wireline assets to bundle high-value customers, and T-Mobile is working to provide a more customer-friendly service. T-Mobile has managed to win most net additions in recent years, but Verizon is starting to show signs of life after introducing its unlimited plan at the beginning of the year. AT&T, meanwhile, continues to struggle to attract new customers. Look for that trend to continue, and the gap between AT&T and its competitors could grow even wider if Sprint slows on the promotions. Sprint isn't planning to give up competing on price. But its recent vow to beat any competitor's price on new devices like the iPhone X is much less aggressive than in years past when it was more active in slashing prices. Sprint's new policy allows competitors to be less aggressive in their promotions, a factor we've already seen play out this year. As Sprint refocuses on the bottom line, it's good news for everyone in the industry, but especially T-Mobile and Verizon. ","
      
    Could the Failed T-Mobile-Sprint Merger Be Good for Wireless Carriers? -- The Motley Fool

"Anders Bylund, Chris Neiger, and Jordan Wathen",11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's nothing quite like a good, solid oil dividend, right? Anyone looking for a strong dividend payout backed by torrential cash flows must surely be impressed by ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield and 34 years of uninterrupted annual dividend increases. Exxon is indeed a great income stock, but there are many dividend stocks out there that offer even better policies than the oil giant. You don't even have to stick within the energy market. A panel of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool has put together a handful of stocks with better yields than ExxonMobil. Read on to see how Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) can beat the big oil stocks from the perspective of a dividend hunter. You can do better than Exxon. Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (Spirit Realty Capital): Shares of this retail-focused REIT are too cheap to ignore. Though the company has struggled under the weight of its largest single tenant, Shopko, investors are pricing the stock as if its portfolio were filled to the brim with similarly weak tenants. That's not the case, in my view. To be sure, Shopko is a large tenant for Spirit Realty, making up about 7.8% of contractual rent, compared with 2.6% and 2.4% for its second- and third-largest tenants, respectively. But the portfolio, which includes more than 2,400 properties, is generally leased on a triple-net basis to high-quality restaurants, pharmacies, convenience stores, and movie theaters, all of which derive benefits from proximity to their customers (they can't just move to lower-cost locations). I suspect that an upcoming spin-off that will push Shopko assets into a new REIT will help investors better understand the value of the remaining assets, particularly its triple-net lease portfolio. With a current yield of 8.5%, the company yields nearly twice as much as other triple-net lease REITs, including Realty Income Corporation and National Retail Properties. The market is pricing Spirit as if there are several more Shopkos to come. At the current share price, I think it makes sense to take the other side of the trade. Chris Neiger (Verizon): It's nearly impossible to put together a list of dividend stocks with high yields and not mention Verizon. The telecom giant currently has a trailing annual dividend yield of 4.9% and has a 10-year history of raising it every year. The company's wireless business drives its top line, and increasing competition from its rivals has kept Verizon on its toes lately. Wireless revenue of $21.6 billion fell more than 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2017, but there isn't much for investors to worry about over the long term. Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    3 Dividend Stocks With Better Yields Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

"Chris Neiger, George Budwell, and Neha Chamaria",11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chevron Corporation should be at the top of any dividend investor's short list right now, considering that it pays its investors an enviable 3.7% yield. But as good as that is, the oil and gas company isn't the only stock that's pushing the boundaries of dividend yields. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP), and AT&T (NYSE:T) all cut bigger checks than Chevron, and each have a compelling reason for dividend investors to give them serious consideration. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. George Budwell (GlaxoSmithKline): With a current yield of 5.75%, British pharma stalwart GlaxoSmithKline easily offers one of the richest payouts within its large-cap peer group. And Glaxo's sky-high yield even exceeds that of that the dividend aristocrat Chevron at present. Glaxo's monstrous yield does come with a big catch, though. The pharma titan's high yield, after all, directly stems from the company's inability to restock its aging product portfolio with new high-value growth products -- especially in the pharmaceutical space, where its top-selling asthma medication, Advair, has been gradually on decline for some time now. As a result, Glaxo's shares have now shed nearly a quarter of their value over the past three years, and this downward trend has only been accelerating heading into 2018. In fact, Glaxo's recent talk of doling out up to $10 billion for Pfizer's consumer healthcare unit stoked fears among investors that the drugmaker may be forced to suspend its top flight dividend altogether. The good news is that Glaxo does have a number of green shoots, so to speak, on the pharma and vaccine sides of its business that could save its dividend, and perhaps usher in a new era of strong top-line growth. As a prime example, the company just grabbed a key regulatory approval for its two-drug HIV therapy known as Juluca that appears primed to be a big winner from a sales standpoint. And its newly approved shingles vaccine, Shingrix, should also eventually achieve blockbuster status as well. All told, Glaxo's rather enticing dividend could indeed evaporate if the company's newly installed management does expand deeper into the consumer healthcare space. But there are some compelling reasons to believe this exceptional yield may be spared from the chopping block as well. Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Infrastructure Partners): As a Dividend Aristocrat, Chevron's popularity among income investors isn't unwarranted. However, there are other stocks that are not only cutting higher yields than Chevron but also giving income investors encouraging dividend goals to look forward to. Consider Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, an asset managing company that acquires high-quality, distressed assets across key sectors like utilities, transport, energy, and communications, and turns them around profitably. Now, Brookfield doesn't boast a dividend track record like Chevron since the company was established as late as 2008. Brookfield's dividend yield of 4% is also only slightly higher than that of Chevron's, but you just have to see the following chart to understand how the stock has trumped the oil giant in the past decade, thanks to its rapidly growing dividends. Image source: YCharts. Brookfield has done a tremendous job in the past decade, growing its funds from operations more than ten-fold. I consider Brookfield a gold mine for income investors: It has grown its dividends at a compounded average rate of 12% since 2009 and has a long-term goal of 5% to 9% annual dividend growth. It's difficult to get such visibility from Chevron's dividends. That means as a Brookfield shareholder, you can not only expect high dividend yields of around 4%, but also watch your dividends grow year after year. When you factor in the relative resilience of its business compared to Chevron's, Brookfield's dividend checks could easily be much bigger in the long run. Chris Neiger (AT&T): Dividend investors should be absolutely in love with AT&T's 5.5% dividend yield, not to mention the fact that the company has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. The telecom gian has built out a connectivity empire that includes its core wireless business, DirectTV services, and its wireline services that all brought in a total of $39.7 billion in the third quarter 2017. AT&T has managed to keep pace with wireless rival Verizon and hold its own as the nation's second-largest carrier. AT&T is also looking ahead to the coming demand for 5G wireless; it has already conducted tests of the technology and plans on launching a commercial 5G network by 2020 or 2021. AT&T has more opportunities outside of wireless as well. The company's $108 billion bid for Time Warner would give the company HBO, CNN, and all of Warner Bros.'s content -- and allow AT&T to keep pace with Verizon as it focuses its attention on more content offerings as well. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is fighting that deal right now on concerns that AT&T could have too much pricing power when it controls bundled content and how that content is delivered to customers. But even if the DOJ ends up stopping AT&T's purchase of Time Warner (or restricts part of the deal), the carrier is already so firmly established in its wireless business and its other home connectivity services that investors have little to worry about. The company's current wireless position and future opportunities in 5G, as well as its expanding customer base with DirecTV (it added 300,000 net customer additions in the third quarter), should be enough for investors to give AT&T strong consideration. Add to all of that the fact that AT&T's shares are trading at less than 12 times the company's forward earnings, and AT&T looks like a solid bet for dividend investors -- and with an enviable yield to boot.

Motley Fool Staff,11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When news broke that Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) (NASDAQ:FOX) was in discussions with Disney (NYSE:DIS) to part with its valuable movie and TV properties, along with certain cable channels and overseas businesses, the entire entertainment industry jumped to attention. A full transcript follows the video. Vincent Shen: Our next topic is actually pretty similar in that it revolves around the potential acquisition of media assets. In this case, it's from 21st Century Fox. There have already been several weeks of talks or interest reported from companies like Walt Disney, Comcast, Verizon and Sony. Dan, can you tell us more about what parts of the business Fox might be looking to part with, and what the various suitors seem most interested in acquiring? Shen: We'll first focus on Disney, because they were reported as being the initial party to approach Fox regarding these deal discussions. There's a lot to like in terms of what Disney can get out of this deal. As you mentioned, the film and television studios, plus some of those cable networks, that will definitely bolster Disney's own media networks and their own studio businesses. Kline: Absolutely. Hulu is also rolling out its live TV streaming, which for Disney, which is losing homes with ESPN, ABC and all its cable networks, controlling Hulu and being able to make its own channel as a key part of that live streaming package would also be another plum. Shen: Yeah. The last thing I want to speak to is some of the international assets. There's a 39% stake in Sky that Fox currently holds. Sky is currently based in the U.K. It's the largest pay-TV player in Europe. Fox actually has a $15 billion bid right now to acquire the remaining stake of Sky. I believe, right now, that's in a bit of a regulatory mire. The prospects of that coming out with an approval are basically going down by the day. Kline: And some of that is due to Fox itself. So there might be a better chance of Disney making that deal if they want to. Shen: And some of the history between those entities, absolutely. Then, there's also control of Star India, for example. This is media company in India that would be another asset I think would really help Disney expand its international reach. Those are two properties that I think Comcast would also very much be interested in in terms of expanding some of its international business. Shen: I do want to focus in on 21st Century Fox's business, give listeners an idea of the revenue breakdown. For the cable network's business, about $16 billion, or 56% of their top line. Film studios coming in at $8 billion, or about 30% of the top line. Then, their broadcast TV, which would not be included in the asset sales that are being discussed here, about $5.6 billion in the most recent fiscal year. The company currently has a market cap of $55 billion. So even a partial buyout would be a huge deal in the media and entertainment industry. I think the acquiring company is ultimately going to face some regulatory issues here similar to what we talked about in the last segment on  AT&T and Time Warner, in that any way you cut it, whoever the acquiring company ends up being, there are assets and properties that will compete directly with either the content-focused rivals like Disney, or on the distribution side with Comcast. So there's some of that to consider, as well. Kline: I think the reality is, any of the three potential suitors would be willing to sell off FX if it meant they could have access. This is really an intellectual property deal. Everything else is icing on the cake, it's gravy, it's wonderful. But if you are Disney or Comcast, you're looking at your theme parks, you're looking at your movie studio, your ability to fill in these streaming services, and that's what they would be buying. All of these other things -- if Disney bought this, yes, they want distribution in Europe. They have, obviously, animated films and other things that travel the globe. Marvel characters are globally dominant. But if they had to sell the stake in Sky to make this happen, I don't think that's an impediment. I think this would be a relatively easy negotiation, in terms of, ""There are some regulatory concerns here."" Shen: Yeah. The only thing I would say now with negotiation is, there's no deal on the table yet, no official price tag that I've been able to find anywhere. But if Fox ultimately comes to an agreement with one of its suitors, definitely get a better price with the various companies now circling and expressing interest in the assets. The early talks with Disney stalled, because they couldn't agree on terms. And with a potential bidding war among interested parties, I think Fox will definitely come out with a more favorable deal than it would have otherwise. My last point, if we can step back a little bit and take a 10,000 foot few of not only this Fox news but the AT&T-Time Warner deal, I think consolidation among the content creators and distributors in this industry is likely to continue as they try and diversify their businesses and get a little bit more leverage to compete and build these big portfolio-style companies. Netflix ultimately has thrown the industry through a loop. They started with DVD mailers, now they've evolved into a streaming service and a powerhouse with dozens of original movies and TV series. So companies like Disney and Comcast are grappling with cord-cutting, they're seeing weaker growth and hits to their bottom line with customers changing how they consume entertainment. I think this model of combining distribution with the creation, in terms of the content, I think it's only going to become more prevalent barring some type of regulatory interference. ","

 ,11302017,MarketWatch,11232017,"A majority of the U.S. Supreme Court justices seemed prepared Wednesday to impose new limits on the government's ability to track cellphone users through records kept by their wireless providers. ""Most Americans, I still think, want to avoid Big Brother,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the most outspoken in expressing concern about an invasion of privacy. ""A cellphone can be pinged in your bedroom. It can be pinged at your doctor's office. It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life,"" she said. But the justices did not divide along traditional lines, with both the court's liberals and conservatives expressing their reservations. Thousands of times a year, the nation's local police departments get phone company records allowing them to plot the movements of individual customers. The issue before the court Wednesday was whether access to that data should require a search warrant issued by a judge. When a cellphone is used for calls or text messages, it signals the closest antenna tower to connect with the telephone network. As the user travels, the call is handed off to successive towers, and the cellphone companies keep records of the phone numbers routed through each tower to sort out such things as roaming charges. Related: What you’re giving away with those home DNA tests Nate Wessler, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who appeared before the court, called those records ""digital bread crumbs"" and said they can be highly revealing. ""Access to these historical location records presents the government with a veritable time machine, the ability to press rewind on someone's life and learn where we've been far into the past,"" Wessler said. The case involves a challenge brought by a Michigan man, Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted of robbing a string of Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores after FBI agents used three months of cellphone records to show that he was near each store at the time of the crimes. Because the FBI did not get a search warrant, Carpenter said that evidence should be thrown out. In past cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that people have no privacy interest in the checks they write or the phone numbers they dial from landlines, because it's understood the information will be used to conduct business — for financial transactions or to generate phone bills. Related: 'Hey Alexa, how secure are voice-activated assistants like you?' Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben told the court that no search warrant was needed, because cellphone customers have the same understanding, aware that the phone company will keep records of their calls, and willingly give up any claim of privacy to it. ""There is an element here of voluntariness in deciding to contract with a cell company, just like there's an element of voluntariness in getting a landline phone and making calls,"" Dreeben said. ""And there's an element of voluntariness in signing up for a bank account and using a debit card to purchase everything in your life."" But Chief Justice John Roberts questioned how voluntarily people surrender that information. ""You really don't have a choice these days if you want to have a cellphone."" After listening to the 80-minute courtroom argument, many legal experts predicted the government would lose the case. ""This is probably the most significant privacy ruling the court would make for the last 10 years, because it would finally put a barrier to the government getting intimate details about people in criminal cases,"" said Mark Rasch, a former Justice Department computer crimes prosecutor. In recent years, the justices have shown a willingness to extend digital-age privacy protection, ruling that police need warrants to search through the contents of smartphones or to attach a GPS tracking device to a car. The court will issue its decision by late June. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL ",Supreme Court prepared to narrow police ability to track cellphone users

Lower courts have upheld the practice, likening location data to business records that banks and landline phone companies maintain about customer transactions, which police can seize without warrants under Supreme Court precedents from the 1970s. The high court reasoned then that individuals had voluntarily revealed their financial transactions or numbers they dialed to a third party—the bank or phone company—and so had forfeited any privacy interest in that information.

 ,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A proposal driven by President Donald Trump to overhaul the country’s tax system is moving through U.S. Congress, lifting the overall stock market and raising hopes that corporate earnings will get a boost. The S&P 500 .SPX rallied this week as the drive to push sweeping tax legislation through the U.S. Senate gained momentum, although gains were tempered by a report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that before taking office Trump had directed him to make contact with Russians. Senate Republicans said on Friday they had gathered the votes needed to pass a sweeping tax overhaul. While negotiations are ongoing, the legislation could cut the corporate tax rate to as low as 20 percent from 35 percent. UBS strategists project that overall S&P 500 earnings would rise by 6.5 percent should the corporate tax rate fall to 25 percent and increase by 9.5 percent should the rate go to 20 percent. But certain stocks could benefit more than others from the Republican-led plans. “It will be favorable to companies with primarily domestic business that are paying close to the full tax rate,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. Investors appear to have already rotated into some of these tax-sensitive areas. Some market watchers caution about generalizing winners, noting big differences in effective rates between companies in the same sectors. But strategists point to industries with a concentration of companies poised to benefit, particularly from a lower corporate tax rate. (For a graphic on industries that stand to win from corporate tax cuts, click reut.rs/2zVJls9) (For a graphic on sector benefits from a corporate tax cut, click reut.rs/2AMn9AU) (High tax stocks underperform in 2017: reut.rs/2AMdrP5) Of the major S&P sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates. Brian Klock, managing director in equity research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who covers large regional banks, expects tax cuts to add 16 percent to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18 percent in 2019. “We’re assuming whatever the benefit is will drop right to the bottom line,” Klock said. “They won’t give up on loan pricing or put any big investments in. With the increased capital they’ll return it to shareholders.” Transportation ranks among the top industries expected to receive a big earnings boost from a lower corporate tax rate, according to UBS. Railroads would benefit from provisions allowing them to expense their capital expenditures in one year as opposed to over time, lowering their taxable income, Schoonmaker said. “We’ll see what comes out as far as the ability to depreciate immediately, but that certainly would be beneficial because they are all big capital spenders,” Schoonmaker said, noting that railroads spend 18 percent to 20 percent of revenue on capital expenditures. Domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services would likely benefit more from tax rate reductions than pharmaceutical and medical device companies that sell their products overseas. “Healthcare services is one of the most taxed industries and would be a big beneficiary of reductions in corporate tax rates,” Lance Wilkes, an analyst at Bernstein, said in a recent note. According to Leerink analyst Ana Gupte, a corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent could boost health insurer earnings by about 20 percent to 40 percent, but some of those gains would be expected to be passed through to employer and individual customers. Department stores head the list of retailers that will benefit because they have among the heaviest U.S. exposure, said Bridget Weishaar, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. “Retail companies will benefit from paying a lower tax rate,” Weishaar said. “Consumers hopefully will have additional cash, which will help consumer discretionary spending.” “They’re domestically focused companies with a very high percentage of their employee base in the U.S. and significant amounts of investments in U.S. infrastructure,” said Amir Rozwadowski, telecom equity analyst at Barclays. “Therefore they’re predisposed to benefit from tax reform.” AT&T has climbed 4.9 percent this week, while Verizon has surged 9 percent.

Fred Imbert,12072017,CNBC,11302017,"Mark Fisher, one of the most well-known traders on Wall Street, has put together an alternative index to the 120-year-old Dow Jones industrial average. Fisher, CEO of MBF Clearing, launched the ""Essential 40"" index earlier this year,  an index that includes Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Visa and UnitedHealth, among others. KKM Financial launched a mutual fund on Monday, the Essential 40 Stock Fund (ESSIX), which tracks the index. ""It's today's version of the Dow Jones,"" Fisher told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Tuesday. ""It's the 40 most essential names to the way you live."" ""Without these names your life is blank,"" he said jokingly. Below is a chart of the 40 stocks in the Essential 40 index and how they have performed in 2017: Throughout its history, the Dow has been the go-to benchmark of the U.S. stock market for Main Street market watchers. The biggest difference between the Dow and Fisher's Essential 40 index — aside from the number of stocks in them and how long they've been around — is how they are weighted. The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning stocks with a higher price will have a bigger sway on the index's overall direction. Stocks in the Essential 40 index, meanwhile, all have a 2.5 percent weight on the index. Fisher is one of the most wildly followed commodities traders on Wall Street, being known for making calls on oil and energy. He has also worked with the likes of legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. Oil prices are up about 7 percent in 2017, following a year where they shot up 45 percent. But at current levels, Fisher thinks crude is ""trapped."" ""I think the upside is limited to $60-$63 and the downside is capped around the high $40s,"" he said. ""I think that, if we go up much more, what will happen is you'll see a lot more rigs come online."" Fisher also said that a lot of people in OPEC and Russia are comfortable with crude trading at these levels. U.S. oil gained 0.37 percent to trade at $57.68 per barrel on Tuesday. Fisher also said he likes shares of Barrick Gold here on the dip. The stock is down 14 percent for the year. ",Legendary trader Mark Fisher launches a 'modern day' version of the Dow average

Leo Sun,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) stock dropped 9% this year, underperforming the S&P 500's 17% gain by a wide margin. The telecom giant struggled with earnings misses, its first-ever decline in core wireless subscribers, free cash flow issues, and a murky outlook for its $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo's internet business. That's why analysts expect Verizon's revenue and earnings to respectively dip 1% and 3% this year. But in fiscal 2018 (which starts in calendar 2018), Wall Street expects Verizon's revenue to rise 2%, and for its earnings to grow 3% -- solid growth rates for a stock that trades at just 12 times forward earnings. Let's take a look at what investors should expect from Verizon next year. Image source: Getty Images. In June, Verizon launched Oath, a new subsidiary that merged AOL (which it acquired in 2015) with Yahoo's internet business. Oath's portfolio includes over 50 media and technology brands, including HuffPost, Yahoo Sports, AOL.com, and TechCrunch. Oath's ecosystem reaches over a billion people per month and generated $2 billion in revenues last quarter, but Verizon hasn't fully explained how it will integrate Oath into its core wireless, wireline, and TV businesses. During last quarter's conference call, CFO Matthew Ellis stated that Verizon ""will provide additional information on Oath in future quarters"" as it integrates the business. However, one Oath strategy that was already revealed is Verizon's upcoming online TV service. Oath CEO Tim Armstrong has been assigned to integrate Oath's ad placement system (which is currently used in its network of websites) into the upcoming platform, which Verizon claims will launch in the spring. Armstrong is also responsible for fixing Go90, Verizon's mobile streaming video platform, which flopped due to competition from entrenched players like YouTube. However, both platforms still face intense competition from rival services, which include AT&T's (NYSE:T) expanding DirecTV ecosystem, Dish Networks' Sling TV, and Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Xfinity X1. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T's planned purchase of Time Warner will likely force Verizon to make a comparable acquisition in the escalating battle of controlling both the pipes and the content. That's why recent reports indicate that Verizon and Comcast are both interested in buying parts of 21st Century Fox. If Verizon buys Fox's media assets, its business model could become more similar to Comcast's, which is split between its ISP business and NBCUniversal. Over the past two years, Verizon acquired Telogis and Fleetmatics to boost its presence in telematics for connected cars. It also bought drone operations company Skyward. These acquisitions are expanding Verizon's wireless reach beyond the highly saturated smartphone market. Last quarter, Verizon added 274,000 wireless phone subscribers and 91,000 tablet subscribers. However, it also added 238,000 ""other"" wireless devices, led by connections for wearables. This expansion into other devices -- which include cars and drones -- could eventually offset any declines in phone subscriptions. Earlier this year, Verizon acquired Straight Path and XO Communications to strengthen its fiber assets ahead of its 5G fixed broadband rollout next year. Verizon also recently teamed up with AT&T in a joint partnership with Tillman Infrastructure to build hundreds of new towers. Verizon's aggressive expansion plans caused its long-term debt to hit $115.3 billion last quarter, up from $105.4 billion at the end of 2016. Just $2.2 billion of that total matures within the year, but Verizon will likely divest some non-core businesses to reduce its debt load. It's already sold data centers, its cloud businesses, and landline assets over the past two years to focus on the expansion of its digital ecosystem and 5G networks, so investors should expect additional divestments in 2018 as its spending accelerates. Verizon, like many of its telco peers, is slowly evolving. Its growth might seem glacial, but its investments in online advertising, streaming videos, and adjacent wireless markets will likely pay off over the next few years. Until that happens, investors should sit back, relax, and collect its generous forward yield of 5%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 59%. Verizon has hiked that dividend annually for ten straight years. ","
      
    What to Expect From Verizon Communications Inc. in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

  "
Adam Levy,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The U.S. wireless industry is dominated by AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The two telecom giants account for about 70% of wireless customers and an even larger share of industry profits. But with pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint in the recent past, both have struggled to grow revenue. Still, investors looking to get into the telecom space may be attracted to AT&T and Verizon due to their scale and dividends. But which stock makes a better buy: AT&T or Verizon? Image source: Getty Images/ Since acquiring DIRECTV, AT&T became one of the largest pay-TV service providers in the country on top of its dominant status in the wireless industry. Now, it's trying to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), which would further expand the company both horizontally and vertically. But both the wireless and pay-TV businesses are bleeding thousands of their most valuable subscribers every quarter. Last quarter, AT&T lost 97,000 postpaid phone subscribers and 89,000 video subscribers, including 385,000 DIRECTV satellite and U-Verse subscribers. Both the mobility and the entertainment segments showed year-over-year declines in revenue. AT&T has aimed to boost its wireless service margin by cutting costs. Pricing pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint, however, has resulted in steadily declining revenue per user. AT&T has been most aggressive in bundling its wireless service with its pay-TV service in order to offset the pressure from lower-priced competitors. Still, it's losing subscribers and sacrificing margin on its pay-TV business. The Time Warner deal would provide AT&T with yet another avenue to generate revenue, but there's not much for AT&T to gain from the deal. Perhaps its content expense and its existing ""HBO for life"" promotion costs would decline a bit, but the economics don't make sense to limit any Time Warner content to AT&T's distribution channels. Meanwhile, the deal would simply add to AT&T's ballooning debt load. Verizon has also struggled to grow its business. Wireless service revenue declined 11 straight quarters before finally making a sequential improvement last quarter. Total operating revenue for the wireless segment continues to fall year over year every quarter. Likewise, average revenue per account is falling despite an increasing number of connections per account. Verizon's wireline business is performing somewhat better than AT&T's, maintaining its revenue and TV and internet subscriber bases. Margins for the business are also improving, as Verizon has sold off its underperforming assets in the segment. Overall, Verizon's business looks in much better shape than AT&T's. It's starting to add new postpaid phone subscribers again, following the introduction of its unlimited plan. Its service revenue is starting to climb again, which should lead to year-over-year revenue growth in 2018. And it's not bogged down by a giant, lower-margin, struggling pay-TV business. AT&T and Verizon both trade for similar valuations. AT&T's enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.6 is just below Verizon's 6.8. That's not a big enough discount on its own to consider AT&T over Verizon considering the broader risk the company faces with its massive pay-TV segment. AT&T's dividend yields 5.6% compared to Verizon's 5.3%. That said, AT&T's dividend payout ratio is slightly higher than Verizon's, making Verizon's dividend a bit safer. The competitive environment and the large debt loads at both companies have resulted in minimal dividend growth for both stocks in recent years, though. Each increased their dividend about 2% this year. At these prices, Verizon looks to be the better buy compared to AT&T stock. The former is already in the midst a turnaround in its wireless business, while AT&T is still struggling. Trading at a comparable value and with a comparable dividend yield, Verizon makes sense for most investors over AT&T. ","

Though the company has struggled under the weight of its largest single tenant, Shopko, investors are pricing the stock as if its portfolio were filled to the brim with similarly weak tenants. That's not the case, in my view. To be sure, Shopko is a large tenant for Spirit Realty, making up about 7.8% of contractual rent, compared with 2.6% and 2.4% for its second- and third-largest tenants, respectively. But the portfolio, which includes more than 2,400 properties, is generally leased on a triple-net basis to high-quality restaurants, pharmacies, convenience stores, and movie theaters, all of which derive benefits from proximity to their customers (they can't just move to lower-cost locations). I suspect that an upcoming spin-off that will push Shopko assets into a new REIT will help investors better understand the value of the remaining assets, particularly its triple-net lease portfolio. With a current yield of 8.5%, the company yields nearly twice as much as other triple-net lease REITs, including Realty Income Corporation and National Retail Properties. The market is pricing Spirit as if there are several more Shopkos to come. At the current share price, I think it makes sense to take the other side of the trade. Chris Neiger (Verizon): It's nearly impossible to put together a list of dividend stocks with high yields and not mention Verizon. The telecom giant currently has a trailing annual dividend yield of 4.9% and has a 10-year history of raising it every year. The company's wireless business drives its top line, and increasing competition from its rivals has kept Verizon on its toes lately. Wireless revenue of $21.6 billion fell more than 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2017, but there isn't much for investors to worry about over the long term. Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    3 Dividend Stocks With Better Yields Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Keith Noonan, Chris Neiger, and Daniel Miller",12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With the stock market at record highs, many investors are paying premiums for companies that appear capable of delivering big earnings growth over the long term. That sets them up with a potentially dangerous risk-reward dynamic. But you can still find growth stocks trading at significant discounts relative to their potential, if you know where to look. To give readers some leads on big growth opportunities that can be had on the cheap, we assembled a team of top Motley Fool investors and asked each one to profile a growth stock that they view as well worth the price of admission at current levels. Read on to see why they selected U.S. Concrete (NASDAQ:USCR), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Under Armour (NYSE:UA)(NYSE:UAA). Image source: Getty Images. Daniel Miller (U.S. Concrete): Finding growth stocks at deep value prices when markets have been consistently blowing through record highs is no simple task. However, in my view, U.S. Concrete fits that description. The company has bounced back from a 2010 bankruptcy and posted years of top- and bottom-line growth, but its market cap doesn't yet reflect its potential. USCR Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts After exiting bankruptcy protection and shedding its low-margin precast business, the company has been growing through bolt-on acquisitions -- a strategy it looks likely to continue using. Since 2014 alone, U.S. Concrete has completed 29 acquisitions in the ready-mixed concrete and aggregates space. Those new additions generated 40% of the company's adjusted EBITDA for the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30. This could prove to be a opportune time for investors to jump in. Management believes the country is still in the early innings of this construction cycle, and that the administration's regulatory and business-tax-cutting agendas, along with the possibility of increased federal infrastructure spending, could make the cycle more lucrative for companies in its segment. U.S. Concrete holds a top-three position in the markets where it does business, is a top supplier to major commercial projects in those regions, and has a successful track record of acquisitions. And most important for those seeking growth stocks at deep value prices, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15 (per Morningstar.com) makes U.S. Concrete worth a look. Chris Neiger (Verizon): Verizon is looking a little rough around the edges right now. The company's share price is down about 3% this year, compared the S&P 500's nearly 19% gains, and its stock is trading at just 14 times estimated forward earnings. Verizon lost ground to rivals T-Mobile and AT&T in part because they've made gains on wireless network speed and reliability, and also because it was late to offer unlimited plans when its competitors were jumping into them. But the telecom giant's management has worked to right this ship, even if its share price doesn't reflect the results yet. Its postpaid phone subscribership grew by 274,000 in the third quarter, and by 358,000 in the quarter before that. That's worth noting because in the U.S. telecom space, the only way a carriers can grow significantly is by stealing customers away from others. Verizon is also making the wise move of cutting $10 billion from its budget between now and 2021, which should result in a stronger balance sheet. That should help as the company focuses some effort on building out its content offerings via AOL and the recently acquired Yahoo!. The 50 or so content brands under its new subsidiary, called Oath, offer new opportunities for Verizon to grow beyond its wireless business. But even if its content hopes don't pan out quite as expected, investors should still be bullish on the telecom's wireless position (it still holds a 36% share of the subscription market) and its opportunity to grow that business with its new 5G technologies. The company has conducted 5G wireless tests across U.S. cities this year, and has plans to roll out fixed 5G broadbroad connections next year. Verizon doubtless aims to capitalize on its first-mover advantage in the 5G space as it did with its early investments in 4G and LTE, which kept the company ahead of its competitors in the past. This stock's performance may not have been pretty lately, but Verizon still has a strong core business, and it's making big moves in the next  evolution of wireless. Add in the company's content opportunities -- and its 4.7% dividend yield -- and the stock starts looking much more attractive. Keith Noonan (Under Armour): A market darling just a few years prior, Under Armour has fallen out of favor due to a slew of setbacks and challenges. Its North American growth story has hit the skids, and there are concerns that the brand simply isn't cool with young people anymore -- a terrifying prospect for a fashion-based business. Downward sales and earnings revisions have replaced management's touting of its former quarterly double-digit revenue growth streak -- a contextual backdrop that explains why shares lost more than 60% of their value over the last three years. That's a truncated version of Under Armour's current woes, but, for investors willing to shoulder some risk and stake out a contrarian position, its stock could present deep value at current prices. With its brand struggling amid a broader slowdown in the American sports apparel market, Under Armour's foreign growth is more important than ever. The good news is that the picture overseas looks pretty promising. Last quarter, international sales climbed roughly 56% year over year, and operating income climbed 64%. With the North American retail environment under pressure, the company is also focusing more on making direct-to-consumer sales online, and on reducing its operating expenses. Those initiatives should help keep earnings steady as the company broadens its global sales base. Under Armour shares are trading near their five-year lows. While the company's forward P/E of roughly 68 is steep, the company is valued at just 1.2 times its trailing 12-month sales. This stock could wind up looking quite cheap at current prices if the company continues to deliver big international growth. ","
      
    3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices -- The Motley Fool

  "
Leo Sun,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. 2017 was a dismal year for AT&T (NYSE:T) investors, who watched their stock drop 14% as the S&P 500 rallied 17%. The stock was weighed down by four straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines and ongoing losses in video subscribers. Analysts expect AT&T to finish fiscal 2017 with a 2% sales decline and 3% earnings growth. For 2018, both figures are expected to stay roughly flat. This doesn't make AT&T look like an exciting investment for the foreseeable future, but investors shouldn't overlook the four big moves that it will likely make next year. Image source: AT&T. AT&T is already America's second largest wireless carrier, top wireline services provider, and biggest pay TV provider thanks to its purchase of DirecTV in 2015. If it closes its planned $85 billion takeover of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), it will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world. The merger would introduce major bundling opportunities between its wireline, wireless, video streaming, and pay TV businesses. Those bundles could help AT&T counter cord cutters at its pay TV business, widen its moat against Netflix, and lock in more wireless customers. AT&T claims that the acquisition would become accretive to its adjusted earnings and free cash flow within the first year. However, the US Department of Justice recently sued to block the merger, on the grounds that it would create an anti-competitive ecosystem which would limit consumer choices and hurt streaming video providers. AT&T's top priority for 2018 will be to clear these regulatory hurdles and seal the deal. If it fails to do so, its stock could stumble. AT&T will also invest heavily in new towers to expand its pre-5G and 5G network capabilities across the 700 MHz, AWS-3, and WCS spectrums. Earlier this year, Barclays estimated that AT&T would deploy equipment on up to 50,000 towers, and build about 2,000 more new towers to upgrade its infrastructure and launch the FirstNet public safety network. AT&T also recently teamed up with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in a joint partnership with Tillman Infrastructure to build hundreds of new towers. Verizon has also been aggressively expanding its fiber assets -- via its purchases of Straight Path and XO Communications for nearly $5 billion -- ahead of its 5G fixed broadband rollout next year. AT&T's acquisitions of spectrum licenses, DirecTV, and Time Warner are causing its debt levels to skyrocket. Its long-term debt hit $154.7 billion last quarter, up from $113.7 billion at the end of 2016. If the Time Warner deal closes, that figure could rise above $180 billion. AT&T has already been selling various non-core assets -- including certain cell towers, wireline operations, and data centers -- to extinguish some debt. But AT&T will likely need to sell more assets to further reduce that figure. Two possible divestments include its Digital Life home security business, which could net $1 billion in a sale, and its Latin American pay TV assets (excluding Mexico), which could be sold for $8 billion. It might also consider selling CNN to gain regulatory approval for the Time Warner deal. AT&T added three million wireless subscriptions (2.3 million in the US and nearly 700,000 in Mexico) last quarter. However, a growing number of those new subscriptions aren't for smartphones -- they're used to link tablets, wearables, drones, and connected cars to the internet with stand-alone connections. AT&T stated that it connected almost 100,000 vehicles last quarter, and that the auto market represented a ""real opportunity"" as infotainment and navigation devices rely more heavily on constant connections. AT&T's growth across these markets could diversify its business away from the saturated smartphone market. AT&T, like many of its telco rivals, will try to expand its digital ecosystem, upgrade its infrastructure, reach new wireless markets, and reduce its debt in 2018. That's a tough balancing act to pull off. However, AT&T's stock remains cheap at 13 times forward earnings, and it pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 5.3%. Therefore, investors looking for a cheap income play could consider buying this beaten-down stock -- as long they don't expect a big rebound over the next few quarters. ","
      
    What to Expect From AT&T, Inc. in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Jamal Carnette, CFA",12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely considered the next big thing in technology. Research firm IDC expects worldwide spending on the IoT to reach $1.4 trillion by 2021. Overall, networking communications provider Cisco expects the IoT to be a $19 trillion opportunity. Unsurprisingly, the Internet of Things requires an internet connection, and not just any internet connection. The sheer volume of devices that will now be connected to the internet will require lightning-fast data transfer, especially as the number of internet-connected devices proliferates. To accomplish this, wireless service providers will need to build out their networks to fifth-generation (5G) technology to provide the data-transfer speeds needed to fully support the IoT. The future of the IoT and 5G will most likely include autonomous cars. Image source: Getty Images. Morgan Stanley notes telecommunication providers like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are somewhat lukewarm on building out their 5G capability. This is significant because 5G is considered the backbone of the IoT. As Asha Keddy, general manager of mobile standards of Intel, said: The 2G networks were designed for voice, 3G for voice and data, and 4G for broadband internet experiences. With 5G, we'll see computing capabilities getting fused with communications everywhere, so trillions of things like wearable devices don't have to worry about computing power because network can do any processing needed. The report noted that telcos are somewhat apprehensive to move quickly on a 5G buildout because of 4G -- after spending a combined $275 billion on a rollout and densification of the current transfer standard, the industry has not seen significant returns on the investment. Instead, under pressure from T-Mobile, mobile continues to adopt policies like unlimited data and voice with strong price competition. While these policies are great for consumers, they are decidedly less so for wireless providers. Morgan Stanley notes that 5G will be different. First, the industry will spend less on the build-out and the rollout will take longer. From 2019 to 2040 the industry is estimated to spend $225 billion on 5G capital expenditures with the larger spend coming in the outer years. Additionally, Morgan Stanley expects the first 5G enabled smartphone will come to market as early as 2020, but real adoption and spending could take decades. Another factor that may delay 5G adoption is high debt levels. Verizon and AT&T are highly leveraged, and while both can service their debt easily, adding more obligations to highly leveraged balance sheets could result in downgrades and higher debt-servicing costs. Although mobile provider Sprint has a tremendous asset in the form of a 2.5GHz spectrum, the company has approximately $16 billion of debt maturing in the next three years. That's the equivalent of 85% of its total market cap, which will make it difficult to build out its 5G capabilities. Compounding 5G adoption is competing for business interests. Verizon now has Oath, its digital media business formed from its acquisition of Yahoo, AOL, and The Huffington Post. Both have wireline telephony and subscription-based television delivery, with Verizon FiOS and AT&T's recent DirecTV purchase. The latter two require high capex layouts that may compete for 5G spend. In the long run, the opportunity from the IoT is simply too big to ignore. The savings and value creation from automation and productivity increases should be world-changing. However, it's possible for the process to be delayed until mobile ISPs determine a compelling business case exists to build out 5G. It appears IPS's are at least starting the process. In Verizon's last quarterly call CFO Matt Ellis said Verizon was ""prepositioning"" for its 5G network. Sprint and T-Mobile have noted their intentions to launch a network in 2019, and AT&T is working on a 5G network as well. If the opportunity is as compelling as Cisco and IDC expect, it's possible for 5G buildout to occur faster than Morgan Stanley notes. ","
      
    Is This a Setback for the Internet of Things? -- The Motley Fool

  "
Jason Hall,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Surprisingly enough, a huge portion of that value is derived from a very small group of companies. Of the thousands of publicly traded companies operating today, the 30 largest ones are worth almost $10 trillion -- about one-third of the entire market's value. Here is a closer look at each of the 30 biggest companies on the stock market. (Note: All market data as of Nov. 30, 2017.) Apple's iPhone X is just the latest tech marvel from the world's most valuable -- and profitable -- company. Image source: Apple. With a market capitalization of $868.8 billion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made for one of the greatest investing stories in history. And not once, but twice. Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, the early success of its Apple I, Apple II, and Macintosh computers made it a huge financial success for anyone who invested in the company after its 1980 IPO. But a number of challenges and a power struggle led to the departure of Jobs in 1985. After years of steady loss of market share to another company on this list, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple brought Jobs back in 1997, when the company was on the brink of failure. Following his return, Apple went on to develop the iMac, iPod (and subsequently iTunes), and the product that has made it the most valuable public company on Earth: the iPhone in 2007. The company is on track to ship 30 million of its new iPhone X smartphones in the current quarter. Given their price of $999 to $1,149 each, the company should command more than $30 billion in sales this quarter from this single product. Image source: Google. The parent company of Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is worth $720.8 billion. But unlike Apple, which makes a living selling high-end tech devices, Alphabet doesn't charge its users much or anything at all for most of its services. YouTube, Google search, Gmail, Google Drive cloud storage, and Documents productivity software are all free at their basic levels, while some premium services -- like additional storage and ad-free content on YouTube -- are available for a modest fee. And Alphabet uses those massive profits to invest in even more innovation. The company is a leader in self-driving vehicle technology, clean energy, and connecting more of the world to the internet. Image source: Microsoft. Like Apple, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) played a big role in the advent of affordable personal computing. But while Apple developed a fully integrated software and hardware system, Microsoft is all about software. It also was a big reason why Apple lost the home PC wars in the late 1980s, while Microsoft, with its ""Wintel"" duopoly with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) (which is also on this list) went on to command virtually the entire personal computer market for decades. However, Microsoft has all but missed out on the smartphone revolution, with its Windows Phone never really garnering much commercial success. However, this lack of success with handheld devices hasn't kept Big Softy from being wildly profitable and still a growth company. After all, the company's operating systems and other software are still critically important to running the infrastructure that powers much of the world's computing power. Microsoft has become a major player in cloud computing, a huge growth market. The company increased its market share last year, growing segment revenue 14% to $7 billion last quarter alone. Microsoft may have lost out to Apple in mobile computing, but it's not going to miss out on the cloud. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of few companies to emerge from the late 1990s tech bubble a success. And with a market cap of $560 billion, it easily qualifies as the biggest. Started by Jeff Bezos as an online bookstore, Amazon sells just about everything today, and tens of millions of people subscribe to its Prime membership program for free shipping, free TV, and free movie streaming. Prime members count on Amazon as their first -- and often only -- stop for online shopping. The company's sales are growing strongly: Last quarter alone, revenue was up 34% to $44 billion. E-commerce isn't the only nascent industry Amazon is dominating, either. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the company's cloud computing provider, and Amazon commands substantial market share in this space as one of the lowest-cost providers. Last quarter, AWS generated almost $1.2 billion in operating income for Amazon, and it's set for potentially years of growth to come. Image source: Getty Images. The dominant social media platform, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), is worth $508.9 billion. Founded by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and several other Harvard students in 2004, it was initially available only to fellow Harvard classmates and then a few other colleges. More than 26% of humanity regularly uses Facebook. That's a stunning figure, but it also means about three-fourths of us don't. Facebook's management would tell you that's room for growth. Image source: The Motley Fool. Led by legendary investor and CEO Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) is worth $468.4 billion. Since Buffett took over the company 50 years ago -- it was a struggling textile manufacturer at the time -- and converted it into a holding company for his various other investments, Berkshire has created enormous wealth for tens of thousands of shareholders. Today, Berkshire is a sprawling conglomerate, with subsidiaries engaged in insurance, railways, candy making, manufacturing, electricity production, and too many other businesses to name here. Much of Berkshire's value also owes to its stock portfolio, which includes a number of the other companies on this list. At last count, Berkshire's stock holdings were worth about $180 billion, an amount that's likely to grow for years to come. Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma. Image source: Alibabagroup.com. Alibaba Group has rocketed up the top 30 list on expectations that its growth is just getting started. This year, the stock price has climbed 90%, even after a recent 9% drop. With China's middle class on track to crack 500 million people within a few years, Alibaba's best days could well be ahead. Image source: Johnson & Johnson. More than 130 years after its founding, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is still one of the biggest innovators in the healthcare industry, as reflected by its $375 million market value. Best-known for consumer brands including Band-Aid and Tylenol, the healthcare giant is also a major medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturer. Last quarter, its pharmaceutical segment generated almost half of sales, while medical devices were worth twice as much revenue as the consumer-goods segment. Looking ahead, JNJ's management is banking on the need for more healthcare spending as a significant portion of the world's population gets older. Life expectancies are increasing, but it will require significant medical support to care for a growing aging population. Even after 130 years of success, the company's future still looks bright. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has its roots as far back as 1799, with the founding of one of its predecessors, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. After dozens of acquisitions and mergers in the many years since, today's JPMorgan Chase is America's biggest bank, and one of the world's largest by total assets. It's worth $360 million at recent share prices. Since the Great Recession, JPMorgan Chase, under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, has built up a fortress-like balance sheet and developed some of the most conservative lending practices in the industry. So, even as one of the biggest banks out there, it is also considered one of the safest for investors to own. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $348.6 billion, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is similar to JPMorgan Chase in that it's a product of numerous acquisitions and mergers over the years. It also has its roots in the early days of the American oil industry, directly descended from multiple companies that were part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. A true integrated ""supermajor,"" ExxonMobil participates in every aspect of the oil and gas value chain, including exploration and production, distribution, refining and chemical manufacturing, and selling refined products. Last quarter, this generated $66 billion in sales and $4 billion in profits -- better than recent quarters thanks to higher oil prices. But at the same time, there are growing concerns that the advent of cheaper renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles will start making fossil fuels irrelevant sooner than many expect. Image source: Bank of America. With a market cap of $295.7 billion, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) is second to JPMorgan Chase among the most valuable U.S. banks. It's also the nation's second-biggest bank by assets as well. Unlike many of its megabank peers, Bank of America's roots aren't in New York: The company started with the founding of the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in 1904 to serve the large immigrant community in the city, which faced discrimination by other banks at the time. By the late 1920s, Bank of Italy was renamed Bank of America and Italy, and it would merge with another California-based bank named -- you guessed it -- Bank of America. Now headquartered in North Carolina, B of A was one of the banks hit hardest by the financial crisis, with two major acquisitions -- Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch -- leading to billions of dollars in losses, as well as tens of billions in fines and penalties related to Countrywide's mortgage practices. But today, Bank of America has emerged strong and profitable under the solid leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Wal-Mart stores. Even as e-commerce becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the pie, brick-and-mortar behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) remains a retail giant, with a market cap of $289.8 billion. Founded by Sam Walton in the early 1960s, Wal-Mart now operates more than 11,600 stores, it sold $486 billion in merchandise last year, and it employs 2.3 million people around the world. And don't count the discount retailer out of the retail future, either. The company has aggressively invested in growing its e-commerce business, and it's paying off. Last quarter, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales increased 50%, helping drive total sales up 4.2%. The ""death of retail"" may be grossly exaggerated, at least when it comes to Wal-Mart. Image source: Wells Fargo. The third bank to make the first half of our top 30, Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) makes the list at $279.3 billion. Founded in 1852 in San Francisco early during the gold rush, it not only offered banking services, but also express service to deliver gold and other valuables quickly. And while the modern Wells Fargo is the product -- like almost every big bank -- of numerous mergers and acquisitions over the years, its success has generally been a product of conservative management and lending practices that have kept it out of trouble during the numerous banking crises over the past 150-plus years. But that story may be changing. More recently, Wells' results have trailed its peers' as the effects of the fake accounts scandal play out. Last quarter, Wells was the only big bank to report a decline in its revenue, and it also saw earnings per share fall more than 10% from the year-ago quarter. In short, there's evidence that customers are avoiding Wells, and choosing instead to bank with its competitors. Over time, it's likely that this will change as long as the company can get its act together. But in the meantime, its tarnished reputation is hurting its bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $271.9 billion, Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B) is the second-most valuable public energy company on the U.S. market, behind only ExxonMobil. Also like ExxonMobil, Shell is an integrated supermajor, engaging in the full range of oil and gas industry businesses. But Shell is a bit different from ExxonMobil in its strategy. Following its acquisition of BG Group in 2016, management launched a strategic shift toward natural gas, where it sees greater long-term demand growth versus oil. The company has also made reducing debt -- which ballooned to over $95 billion at the peak -- and expenses a priority, as well as taking steps to increase the return on its investments. Shell has only just begun chipping away at its debt, but over the past year, profits and cash flows have surged on improved operating results, as well as higher oil prices. Shell is still exposed to many of the same risks as ExxonMobil when it comes to disruption from renewables, but that's one of the reasons management has prioritized natural gas, which produces fewer emissions and serves more industrial uses than oil. Image source: Visa. It may surprise you to know that electronic payments network giant Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), with a market cap of $249.8 billion, has only been a public company for about 10 years. Started in 1958 as part of Bank of America and called BankAmericard, it would not become a separate company until 1970, and even then, it was largely under the control of the many banks that issued BankAmericards. In 1968, it would formally change its name -- and the name of the cards issued on its network -- to Visa, but it would remain privately held until finally going public in March 2008. Visa's IPO, which was for half of the company's shares, raised $19.1 billion, making it the biggest-ever IPO at the time. Even with its massive size, Visa still has strong growth prospects. Electronic payments are only a small fraction of global transactions, but that's quickly changing as mobile computing and the global middle class converge. As a trusted name that merchants, financial institutions, and customers all count on, Visa is positioned for many more years of growth. Image source: Procter & Gamble. With a market cap of $226.8 billion, Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG) is one of the most valuable makers of branded consumer products in the world. There's a  good chance you have at least one P&G product in your home right now -- and more likely several. The company's most recognizable brands include Bounty, Crest, Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Vicks, but that's just a handful of the more than 60 brands the company makes and sells in over 180 countries. Founded in 1837, the company has spent the past 180 years developing and acquiring products that people use in their daily lives, many of which were major innovations at the time. More recently, the company has struggled to grow, having already expanded into just about every global market, and also facing stiff competition in many of its core segments. This has led management to streamline its brands and focus more intently on its most important businesses. Since 2013, the company has reduced its brand portfolio by more than half. Sales have fallen almost $15 billion since then, but earnings have improved since bottoming out in 2015. This is helping the company continue its track record of dividend growth. P&G has increased its dividend annually for 61 straight years. Image source: Anheuser-Busch Inbev. Image source: Getty Images. The biggest and most valuable telecommunications company on the U.S. market, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is worth $224 billion. When Alexander Graham Bell founded AT&T in 1885, he probably didn't have any idea how much his company would transform over the next 130 years, while also staying remarkably the same. AT&T is still the largest provider of fixed-line telephone access in the U.S., but it's also the second-largest cellphone cellphone service provider, and the largest pay-TV operator in the U.S., through its U-Verse cable and DirecTV satellite subsidiaries. The company is looking to get even bigger, with a pending acquisition for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) in the works. However, the U.S. Department of Justice is threatening to sue over the proposed acquisition, creating some uncertainty (and a lot of drama thanks to the political implications). Image source: Getty Images. The third integrated super-major on this list, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is worth $222.6 billion. The company's roots go all the way back to 1879, with the founding of Pacific Coast Oil Co. in San Francisco and developing some of the state's earliest oil discoveries in Southern California. Coast oil would be acquired by Standard Oil in 1900 and consolidate its operations and take the Standard name in 1906. In 1911, it once again became a separate company when the federal government's antitrust suit led to the breakup of Rockefeller's Standard Oil behemoth. Following decades of growth and expansion both in the U.S. and abroad, the company finally changed its name to Chevron in 1977 as part of its move to merge six domestic operations into one. Today, Chevron is solidly profitable, but its earnings and cash flows are still far below its historical levels, as it just isn't getting the same kinds of returns on its investments at recent oil prices. However, its results have improved over the past year as oil prices have risen. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $216 billion, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is the second-most valuable healthcare company and the most valuable health insurer and managed care provider in the United States. Founded in 1974 as Charter Med Incorporated, UnitedHealthCare Corporation was created in 1977 as the parent company and taken public in 1984. In the 40 years since its founding, the Minnesota-based healthcare giant has steadily grown by expanding into new markets and acquiring companies in markets it wanted to enter. It also expanded its services to include prescription management and mail-order services, among others. At last count, the company insures 49 million people, and it generated more than $50 billion in revenue and $4.1 billion in operating income in its most recent quarter. Image source: Pfizer. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is the third-most valuable healthcare company on this list, with a $215.8 billion market cap. Founded by Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in New York City in 1849, Pfizer found early success as a so-called ""fine chemicals"" maker for most of the first century of its existence. In the early 1950s, Pfizer scientists would discover and develop the antibiotic Terramycin, one of the first steps that began shifting its focus to research and development of pharmaceuticals. Over the past couple of decades, Pfizer has largely grown via acquisition of competitors including Warner-Lambert in 2000 and Wyeth in 2009, both of which have produced mixed results. Going forward, management continues to consider acquisitions to help augment its in-house R&D pipeline for new medicines. Image source: Roche. The third healthcare company in a row on this list, Switzerland-based Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY), is worth $214.5 billion. Founded in 1986 by young entrepreneur Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, Roche's roots are in the industrial manufacture of medicines. Fast-forward 130 years, and Roche is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the pharmaceutical industry, with a major pipeline of potential cancer treatments, including immunotherapies. Roche is also one of the biggest R&D spenders in the healthcare space, having spent nearly $9 billion to develop new medicines and treatments last year alone. Image source: Getty Images. With nearly 875 million subscribers on its network, China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:CHL) is easily one of the world's biggest wireless providers, and it's worth $208.9 billion. One would expect it to carry a higher value, perhaps, due to its size and potential for growth. However, China Mobile -- and its biggest competitors -- are pretty much controlled by the Chinese government, which heavily regulates the wireless market in the country. Even with that reality, China Mobile is likely to grow in value as China's middle class continues to expand and mobile use becomes more prevalent. Mobile data consumption is also likely to increase across both consumer and business customers in the coming years, and that could be a catalyst for further growth for the Chinese wireless giant. Image source: Getty Images. Founded in 1979 with the opening of two stores in metro Atlanta, Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) is worth $207 billion, only trailing Wal-Mart for U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers in market value. It's also very different from Wal-Mart and other general merchandise retailers, with many of the products it sells being highly resistant to infringement from e-commerce. This includes products like lumber, which carpenters and builders often prefer to hand select, as well as items customers want to choose in person, such as tile, flooring, paint, cabinets, fixtures, and other big-ticket items you have to live with every day. It's certainly played out that way. While many other big-box retailers struggle just to keep the doors open, Home Depot's sales have increased 6% so far this year, and earnings are on track to grow 14%. Image source: Intel. The other half of the ""Wintel"" duopoly with Microsoft that dominated personal computing for more than two decades, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was founded in 1968 and is worth $205.7 billion today, making it the the most valuable stand-alone semiconductor manufacturer in the world. Also like Microsoft, Intel has had middling success in mobile computing while remaining incredibly strong in the data centers that drive cloud computing and corporate infrastructures. However, there's some concern that the company's fortress-like competitive position in the data center could be weakening. If that proves to be true, and competitors start taking market share, that would seriously crimp Intel's future prospects. But with a half-century of successful innovation in microprocessors, and one of the biggest R&D budgets in the space, I wouldn't count Intel out just yet. Image source: Getty Images. Like Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM) is a leader in the manufacture of microprocessors, and it has a similar market value of $204.4 billion. However, it's also a very different company, since Intel designs and develops nearly all of the processors it makes, while Taiwan Semiconductor primarily contracts with so-called ""fabless"" semiconductor designers -- companies like Apple -- to manufacture chips for them. The upside is the company doesn't have to spend nearly as much on R&D -- it spent $11 billion less than Intel over the past year -- and instead focuses on high-quality, low-cost manufacturing while its customers invest in chip design. The downside? Maintaining a competitive advantage to keep those fabless chip designers coming to you for chip fabrication. It's certainly worked well for Taiwan Semiconductor, which has seen its earnings and market value grow more than 250% over the past decade, better than Intel over the same period. Image source: Verizon. With a market cap of $203.6 billion, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is the second-biggest telecommunications company in the U.S. behind AT&T. Verizon leads the U.S. wireless market with 149 million customers, and it also has one of the biggest land-line operators. The company has also increased the size of its wireline internet business in recent years and says it now has 5.8 million customers using its Fios fiber-optic internet service. But where Verizon trails AT&T is in pay-TV subscribers, a gap that's likely to grow even wider when AT&T completes its acquisition of Time Warner. Will Verizon make an acquisition of its own to narrow the gap? It's unclear, but the company is certainly investing in next-generation wireless technology, with plans to begin testing a 5G network in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Business software specialist Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is worth $202.4 billion. Like almost every other tech company that's been successful for many years, Oracle has spent decades out-innovating (or sometimes acquiring) its disruptors. In recent years, this has included a shift to subscription models for software -- something Oracle is still working through -- and now the company is facing stiff competition from the likes of Amazon and other cloud-computing providers. Going forward, Oracle may have to prove its mettle all over again in the ever-important enterprise database segment it has dominated for years. The early results offer promise, but it's in the very early innings as the company's customers -- almost 40% of the market for enterprise database software -- begin to compare in-house systems to cloud-hosted alternatives. Image source: Citigroup. With a market cap of $198.4 billion, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is the last bank in the top 30 and the fourth-most valuable bank behind JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. With over 200 million global customers and 219,000 employees, Citigroup does business in 160 countries around the world. With its roots in the founding of City Bank of New York in 1812, it underwent a series of name changes over the next 160 years before finally becoming Citibank in 1976. The current Citigroup was formed when Citicorp -- Citibank's holding company -- merged with Travelers Group in 1998. Citigroup was one of the hardest-hit banks during the subprime crisis and Great Recession, with its significant exposure to bad mortgages -- both directly through its lending and through its investment in collateralized debt obligations -- which led to substantial losses, and eventually required federal government intervention to keep the bank from failing. This intervention and investment essentially wiped out investors in the company. Even after a pretty big recovery in the past decade, Citigroup investors from right before the financial crisis are still down about 75%. On the other side of the coin, anyone savvy -- or lucky -- enough to have invested in the company in March of 2009 and held their shares has seen a fourfold return on their investment. Image source: Novartis. Another Swiss pharmaceutical company on the list, Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) rounds out the top 30 with a market cap of $198.2 billion. But unlike Roche, which was founded more than a century ago, Novartis is the result of multiple corporate mergers, though several of its legacy companies do date back to the 1800s. However, Novartis is similar to Roche in several regards. The company spent $7.9 billion on pharmaceutical research and development last year, second only to Roche in pharmaceutical R&D investment. Much of that spending is on development of biologics and immunotherapies, two of the areas of medicine with the most promise for treatments with fewer side effects and better results. With expectations that the company will file for approval of five new molecules in 2018, Novartis's R&D investments seem to be paying off. ","

The cities are all expected to be outside Verizon’s existing landline footprint in the Northeast. The company said more details, such as its price, would be unveiled later. The wireless giant will use fifth generation, or 5G, technology, which is capable of delivering significantly faster internet speeds than existing 4G technology, also known as LTE. Customers will likely have to place a box in their windows that will convert Verizon’s wireless signals into Wi-Fi inside the house. If the technology works, and users adopt it, it could result in more competition in the home internet market. Many Americans only have access to one broadband provider, often a cable company. By selling outside its existing footprint, Verizon could enter cities as a new competitor.

Representatives from Verizon and the NFL declined to comment on the financial terms of the deal but the No.1 U.S. wireless carrier said the deal will go into effect in January with streaming of NFL playoff games on Yahoo and Yahoo Sports, in addition to the go90 streaming platform and the NFL mobile app. The partnership will also include mobile access to jointly-developed original content, Verizon said. Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a research note that the deal shows how Verizon is trying to expand its mobile advertising platform. In June, Verizon bought Yahoo’s core assets for $4.48 billion and combined it with AOL to form its Oath business. “With the recent consolidation of these properties in the Oath division, we would expect this to take on more of a growing focus for (Verizon) in 2018,” Fritzsche said. Verizon estimates that it reaches more than 200 million U.S. monthly unique mobile and digital users. The company has said its goal for Oath is to contribute $20 billion in revenue by 2020.

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted along party lines on Thursday to repeal landmark 2015 rules aimed at ensuring a free and open internet, setting up a court fight over a move that could recast the digital landscape. The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and hands them power over what content consumers can access. It also is the biggest win for Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations since taking over at the agency in January. Democrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content. The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers. The meeting, held amid protests online and in front of the FCC headquarters in Washington, was evacuated before the vote for about 10 minutes due to an unspecified security threat, and resumed after law enforcement with sniffer dogs checked the room. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the  administration “supports the FCC’s efforts. At the same time, the White House certainly has and always will support a free and fair internet.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in a statement he will lead a multi-state lawsuit to challenge the reversal. Shares of Alphabet, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp moved lower after the vote. The FCC said the rules would take effect in a few months after the White House Office of Management and Budget formally approves them. Pai has argued that the 2015 rules were heavy handed and stifled competition and innovation among service providers. “The internet wasn’t broken in 2015. We weren’t living in a digital dystopia,” he said on Thursday. Consumers are unlikely to see immediate changes but smaller startups worry the lack of restrictions could drive up costs or lead to their content being blocked. Internet service providers say they will not block or throttle legal content but may engage in paid prioritization. They argue that the largely unregulated internet functioned well in the two decades before the 2015 order. Republican FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly noted that self-driving vehicles and remotely monitored medical procedures may require internet service and that their needs could be given priority “over cat videos.” O’Rielly said it is unlikely any internet provider would voluntarily submit to a “PR nightmare” by “attempting to engage in blocking, throttling or improper discrimination. It is simply not worth the reputation cost.” Still, Democrats have pointed to polls showing a repeal is deeply unpopular and say they will prevail in protecting the rules, either in the courts or in U.S. Congress. Immediately after the vote, Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat, said he and 15 other senators planned to introduce a resolution to undo the FCC action and restore the net neutrality rules. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said in a written dissent released on Thursday that the decision grants internet providers “extraordinary new power” from the FCC. “They have the technical ability and business incentive to discriminate and manipulate your internet traffic,” she said. “And now this agency gives them the legal green light to go ahead.” Several state attorneys general said before the vote they would oppose the ruling, citing issues with the public comment period. Other critics have said they will consider challenging what they see as weaker enforcement. The 2015 rules were intended to give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband providers from favoring their own content. Those practices are now allowed as long as they are disclosed. The broadband industry cheered the move. USTelecom, a lobbying group representing internet providers and broadband companies said after the vote they had “renewed confidence” to make network investments, particularly in rural communities. On the other side, the trade group Internet Association, whose members include content providers Alphabet, Facebook and Pandora Media Inc, said “the fight isn’t over” and that it was weighing legal options in a lawsuit against the FCC order. A University of Maryland poll had found more than 80 percent of respondents opposed a repeal. The survey of 1,077 registered voters was conducted online by the Program for Public Consultation from Dec. 6-8. ","

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission plans to turn over oversight of internet service providers to another federal agency as it plans to vote on Thursday to revoke the landmark 2015 “net neutrality” rules. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month unveiled plans to repeal the rules that prohibit internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content. The 2015 rules bar broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to web content. On Monday, the FCC and Federal Trade Commission said they plan to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to coordinate efforts under the new rules. The agencies said the  proposal will “return jurisdiction to the FTC to police the conduct of ISPs.” Pai said Monday in a statement the agencies “will work together to take targeted action against bad actors.” Under Pai’s proposal, the FCC would no longer bar any specific internet provider practice but require companies to disclose if they block, throttle or offer paid prioritization of internet traffic. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said the agreement “is a confusing, lackluster, reactionary afterthought: an attempt to paper over weaknesses in the chairman’s draft proposal repealing the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules.” The FTC will investigate if internet providers fail to make accurate disclosures or if they engage in deceptive or unfair acts or practices. “The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers,” said Acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said “FTC enforcement would happen long after the fact — many months, if not years, after consumers and businesses have been harmed.” Chris Lewis, vice president of advocacy group Public Knowledge, said the FCC is “joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public. This gives free reign to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you.” The new rules are expected to take effect in January and draw court challenges.

Don't show this again Two official trials have begun for AirGig, technology to send internet data along power lines and into your home. AT&T's AirGig technology sends data along antennas mounted to power line towers or poles. Sure, you can dig trenches across the land and fill them up with fiber-optic cables, but AT&T has begun testing what it says is a promising alternative called AirGig that relies on radio signals instead. Unveiled last year, AirGig sends data from one antenna to another along power lines in rural, suburban or urban areas. It also sends data to nearby buildings at speeds of about 1 gigabit per second -- something like 15 times faster than the average US broadband data-transfer rate. AT&T now has two trials underway, one a suburban test in an undisclosed country outside the US, and another in partnership with Georgia Power in a more rural location, the company announced Tuesday night. ""If these trials and our continued research and development turn out the way we intend, we'll take a big step toward bringing hyperfast connectivity to people everywhere,""  Andre Fuetsch, president of AT&T Labs and the company's chief technology officer, said in a statement. Hyperfast internet access sounds hyperbolic, but there's our appetite for network data is insatiable and growing, so any new technology can help. In practice, we're likely to be served by new short- and long-range radio links, ever-faster data links on traditional phone and cable TV lines to our homes, and fiber optic lines, too. Indeed, AT&T's broadband business is stringing fiber along phone lines in several cities around the US. The tests are going well in both the rural and suburban areas, a sign that it's meeting its potential, AT&T said. The tests will last months, but it's not yet clear when AT&T will commercialize the technology. AirGig has the potential to stretch to some rural areas where expensive and pokey satellite-based broadband is the only practical option. But even though AT&T says it takes only minutes for trained operators to install the antennas, hardware and labor costs will add up over the miles. AirGig also could serve as something of a backbone for the 5G mobile networks expected to arrive starting in 2019, AT&T said. Today's phones use fourth-generation (4G) mobile network technology called LTE, but 5G is expected to boost speed and reliability, especially in crowded areas.

 ,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc has started trials in Georgia state and a non-U.S. location to deliver high-speed internet over power lines, the No. 2 wireless carrier said on Wednesday, marking its latest push to offer faster broadband service to more customers. AT&T aims to eventually deliver speeds faster than the 1 gigabit per second consumers can currently get through fiber internet service using high-frequency airwaves that travel along power lines. While the Georgia trial is in a rural area, the service could potentially be deployed in suburbs and cities, the company said in a statement. “We think this product is eventually one that could actually serve anywhere near a power line,” said Marachel Knight, AT&T’s senior vice president of wireless network architecture and design, in an interview. She added that AT&T chose an international trial location in part because the market opportunity extends beyond the United States. AT&T said it had no timeline for commercial deployment and that it would look to expand trials as it develops the technology. “Potentially, it can be a really big deal,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “You need the power company to play ball with you. That’s the downside.” AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, have also been testing 5G internet services in which the last leg of the connection is delivered via a radio signal to homes using high-frequency airwaves known as millimeter wave spectrum. Verizon said in November it would launch the faster broadband service in three to five U.S. markets in 2018. ","

Late on Tuesday, the court appeared to dismiss his opinion, saying in a brief filing that “Dr. Page’s submission does not appear to be meaningfully relevant to the issues in this case.” Trump criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and has repeatedly attacked the reporting of Time Warner’s CNN news network. Page said in an interview with Reuters that he had not been in contact with the White House about the filing. The U.S. Department of Justice sued AT&T in November to block its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, saying the deal could raise prices for rivals and pay-TV subscribers while hampering the development of online video. A trial is set for March 19. Both AT&T and the Justice Department declined to comment. “This market power concentrated in the hands of a few dominant mega corporate telecommunications-media conglomerates encourages extreme levels of journalistic recklessness and impropriety since it allocates considerable resources to the media outlets under their control,” Page said in the court papers. Page, who traveled to Russia twice in 2016, has testified to   congressional committees investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In that testimony and elsewhere, he has argued that he has been the subject of unfair and inaccurate media coverage. Page, who described himself as a “junior, unpaid, informal adviser” to the Trump campaign, also argued that it would provide an incentive for the big media outlets to exclude viewpoints it does not like.

 ,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'B'/'RR4' rating to Windstream Services, LLC's new 8.75% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2024. The new 2024 notes are pari passu to the company's existing unsecured notes and are being issued in exchange for a portion of 7.75% senior notes due 2021 and 7.50% senior notes due 2022. On Dec.12, 2017, Windstream announced results for debt exchange offers announced on Nov. 28, 2017. Approximately 86% ($538 million) and 85% ($232 million) of 2021 and 2022 noteholders, respectively, have accepted the exchange offers as of the early settlement date. The debt exchanges would entail higher incremental interest cost for Windstream, but the lower maturity wall in the intermediate term would help improve the liquidity position. The new 2024 notes are subject to a mandatory redemption of $150 million, 75 days after the initial settlement date. The covenants restrict payments to the parent, Windstream Holdings, Inc., if leverage is equal or greater than 3.5x, with carve-outs for master lease payments by parent to Uniti Group Inc. and certain administrative and tax payments. Windstream also announced 2023 exchange offer, where it offered to exchange 7.50% senior notes due 2023 for 6 3/8% notes maturing in 2023. As of the early settlement date, 57% ($68 million in aggregate principal) of the note holders had tendered to exchange, lower than the minimum $90 million required per 2023 exchange conditions. The company has extended the deadline until Dec. 26, 2017. Windstream's ratings are on Negative Watch after the company received a notice of default from Aurelius Capital Master Ltd., a noteholder on its 6 3/8% bonds. Windstream is defending the allegations and has filed a legal proceeding on the matter. Windstream has obtained the consent solicitations for waiver of the alleged defaults from a majority of 6 3/8% noteholders. Fitch will resolve the Watch following the resolution of the pending litigation. KEY RATING DRIVERS Near-Term Pressures: Including the EarthLink merger and Broadview Networks acquisition (the transactions), Windstream continued to experience pressure in its wholesale segment, as well as the small/medium business incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) segment through the third quarter of 2017 (3Q17). The enterprise segment remains weak due to effects of legacy revenue declines. Competitive local exchange (CLEC) consumer and small business has shown stabilization in 3Q17, benefitting from acquisition-related segment revenue. Pro forma for the transactions, Fitch's base case assumes revenues continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. Revenue Mix Changes: Windstream derives approximately two-thirds of its revenue from enterprise services, consumer high-speed internet services and its carrier customers (core and wholesale), providing the best prospects for stable revenues in the long term. Certain legacy revenues remain pressured, but Windstream's revenues should stabilize gradually as legacy revenues dwindle in the mix. Leverage Metrics: Fitch estimates total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will be 5.8x in 2017, including the transactions. Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline to the mid-5x range by the end of 2019 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. In calculating total adjusted debt, Fitch applies an 8x multiple to the sum of the annual rental payment to Uniti plus other rental expenses. Cost Synergies Support EBITDA Stabilization: Windstream anticipates realizing more than $180 million of annual run-rate synergies three years after the close of the transactions: $155 million in operating cost savings and $25 million in capital spending savings. Windstream expects to realize approximately $180 million in run-rate synergies by the end of 2019. In its base case assumptions for Windstream, Fitch has assumed moderately lower cost savings to be realized by the end of three years following the transactions. Fitch expects EBITDAR margin improvement in the range of 100bps-200bps by the end of 2019. Integration Key to Success: Fitch believes there are potential execution risks to achieving the operating cost and capital expenditure synergies following the close of the transactions. Initial savings are expected to be realized from reduced selling, general and administrative savings as corporate overheads and other public company cost savings arise. Over time, the company is expected to realize the benefits of lower network access costs as on-network opportunities lower third-party network access costs. Finally, cost savings are expected to be realized by IT and the billing system. Fitch estimated $20 million of these savings in 4Q17. DERIVATION SUMMARY Windstream has a weaker competitive position based on scale and size of its operations in the higher-margin enterprise market. Larger companies, including AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative), Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable), and CenturyLink, Inc. (BB/Stable), have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. In comparison to Windstream, AT&T and Verizon maintain lower financial leverage, generate higher EBITDA margins and FCF, and have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification. Fitch also believes Windstream has a weaker FCF profile than CenturyLink including the LVLT acquisition, as CenturyLink's FCF will benefit from enhanced scale and LVLT's net operating loss carryforwards. Although Windstream has less exposure to the more volatile residential market compared to its wireline peer, Frontier Communications Corp. (B+/Stable), it has higher leverage than Frontier. Within the residential market, incumbent wireline providers face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators with facilities-based triple play offerings, including Comcast Corp. (A-/Stable) and Charter Communications Inc. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, CCO Holdings, LLC, BB+/Stable). Cheaper alternative offerings such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline providers have had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats. As of year-end 2016, roughly 60% of Windstream's footprint overlapped with a national cable operator. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Revenue and EBITDA include the EarthLink merger as of Feb. 27, 2017 and the acquisition of Broadview on July 28, 2017. --Revenues total $5.9 billion for 2017 and remain almost flat in 2018. Fitch expects organic revenue to continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. --2017 EBITDA is expected to benefit from synergies achieved from acquisitions and other cost savings. Fitch expects EBITDA margins to expand by roughly 70bps in 2018 as additional cost synergies are realized. --Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline from 5.8x at year-end 2017 to the mid-5x range by the end of 2019 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --The company sustains total adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 5.0x-5.2x. --Revenues and EBITDA would need to stabilize on a sustained basis. --Fitch would also need to see progress by Windstream on executing the integration of its recent transactions. --Material reduction in leverage on a sustained basis following any asset sales repayment of debt could also benefit the rating. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --A negative rating action could occur if total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is 6.0-6.2x or higher for a sustained period. --The company no longer makes progress toward revenue and EBITDA stability due to competitive and business conditions. --Evidence of deterioration in liquidity, including lack of positive run-rate FCFs and declining FCF margin. --Any negative developments related to the outcome of the receipt of notice of default. Fitch intends to resolve the Rating Watch once it can be sufficiently determined that the allegations under the notice will not affect Windstream's credit profile. LIQUIDITY The rating is supported by the liquidity provided by Windstream's $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). At Sept. 30, 2017, approximately $129 million was available (pro forma for the recently completed debt exchanges, approximately $410 million is available under the revolver). The revolver availability was supplemented with $56.5 million in cash at the end of 3Q17. The $1.25 billion senior secured RCF is in place until April 2020. Principal financial covenants in Windstream's secured credit facilities require a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75x and a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5x. Outside of annual term loan amortization payments, Windstream does not have any material maturities until 2020. The recent debt exchanges helped Windstream extend the maturities, improving the liquidity profile. Windstream utilized the proceeds from new money 2025 senior secured notes to repay $250 million under the revolver and $140 million under term loan tranche B6. Pro forma for the debt exchanges, and repayment of revolver, maturities in 2020 total approximately $1.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Fitch estimates post-dividend FCF in 2017 will range from negative $100 to negative $200 million, including integration capex, $50 million of spending related to the completion of Project Excel and other cash non-operating expenses. Fitch expects capital spending to return to normal levels in the 13%-15% range after 2017 and for the company to return to positive FCF in 2018, with FCF margins in the low single digits over the forecast. RECOVERY The recovery analysis assumes that Windstream would be considered a going concern in a bankruptcy and that the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated. Fitch has assumed a 10% administrative claim. Windstream's going concern EBITDA is based on LTM EBITDA as of Sept. 30, 2017, pro forma for acquisitions and synergies. The going-concern EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level, upon which Fitch bases the valuation of the company. A lower going-concern EBITDA factors in the competitive dynamics of the industry that result in account losses and pricing pressures. The overall decline also considers Windstream's cost cutting efforts as an offsetting factor. This leads to a post-reorganization EBITDA estimate of approximately $1.2 billion that is 20% below pro forma LTM EBITDA as of Sept. 30, 2017. The current network lease with Uniti is expected to remain unchanged. An EV multiple of 4.5x is used to calculate a post-reorganization valuation. Comparable market multiples in the industry range from 5.4x-8.7x and recent acquisition multiples range from 3.8x-6.6x. There are two bankruptcy cases analyzed in Fitch's TMT bankruptcy case study report - Fairpoint and Hawaiian Telecom - both of which filed bankruptcy in 2008 and emerged with multiplies of 4.6x and 3.7x, respectively. Both were also sold in recent acquisitions for 5.9x and 5.6x. The recovery multiple takes into account Windstream's weaker competitive position in the industry and the company's exposure to legacy assets. Fitch's multiple for Windstream's recovery analysis also considers dependence on legacy revenues that will decline in future, aided by revenue from recent acquisitions in cloud and connectivity space. The revolving facility is assumed to be fully drawn upon default. The waterfall analysis results in a 100% recovery corresponding to a 'RR1' Recovery Rating for the secured debt including the first-lien credit facility and revolving facility; and the newly issued senior secured notes. The senior secured tranche of Windstream's capital structure benefits from a first-priority lien on all assets and capital stock of its subsidiaries (subject to regulatory approval) and a guaranty from Windstream's material direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (except for subsidiaries of PAETEC Holding Corp and subject to regulatory approval). The waterfall also indicates an 'RR4' (41%) recovery for senior unsecured notes. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has maintained the following ratings: Windstream Services, LLC --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B'; --$1.25 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2020 at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior secured term loans at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior secured notes due 2025 at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior unsecured notes at 'B/RR4'. The ratings remain on Rating Watch Negative. Contact: Primary Analyst Salonie Sehgal Associate Director +1-312-368-3137 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

 ,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - La Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones de Estados Unidos votó el jueves en favor de rechazar las históricas reglas aprobadas en 2015 para asegurar un internet libre y abierto, poniendo en marcha un pulso judicial por una decisión que podría redibujar el panorama digital. La aprobación de la propuesta del presidente a la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC por sus siglas en inglés), Ajit Pai, significó una victoria para proveedores de servicios en internet como AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp y Verizon Communications Inc, ya que les da poder sobre los contenidos a los que pueden acceder los consumidores. Los demócratas, Hollywood y compañías como Alphabet Inc -matriz de Google- y Facebook Inc habían pedido a Pai, un republicano nombrado por el presidente Donald Trump, que mantuviera el reglamento de tiempos de Barack Obama, que prohíbe a los proveedores de servicios bloquear, ralentizar el acceso o cobrar más por determinados contenidos. Asociaciones de defensa de los consumidores y grupos comerciales que representan a proveedores de contenidos planean poner en marcha un reto legal para preservar estas reglas. La reunión fue evacuada durante unos 10 minutos antes de la votación, debido a una amenaza de seguridad no especificada, y se reanudó después de que perros entrenados revisaron la sala. La demócrata Mignon Clyburn, comisionada de la FCC, dijo antes de la votación que los republicanos están “entregando las llaves de Internet” a “un puñado de corporaciones multimillonarias”. Pai argumentó que la legislación de 2015 es muy dura y complica la competencia y la innovación entre los prestadores de servicios. Los miembros de la FCC votaron por 3-2 en favor de rechazar las reglas, en línea con sus partidos afines. Los proveedores de servicios por internet aseguran que no bloquearán ni acelerarán contenido legal, aunque sí podrían optar por una priorización pagada. Asimismo, aseguran que los consumidores no experimentarán cambios y argumentan que internet funcionó bien en las dos décadas previas a la orden de 2015, cuando estaba bastante desregulado. ","

 ,12142017,Reuters,12072017,ネット通信を巡る環境は、ＦＣＣが中立性規則導入に合意した２年前から劇的に変わろうとしている。パイＦＣＣ委員長が主導してきた中立性規則撤廃により、ネット接続事業者（ＩＳＰ）は特定コンテンツへのアクセス遮断や速度制限、ないしは消費者への料金上乗せといった行為が禁止されなくなる。今後ＩＳＰは公益業ではなく、より監督が緩い情報サービス業に分類されるからだ。 来年初めから実施される中立性規則撤廃は、ＩＳＰがアクセス遮断や速度制限をする場合は、その情報を開示することが前提となる。各企業の情報開示が正確かどうか監視し、正確性を確保する任務は連邦取引委員会（ＦＴＣ）が担う。 ＦＣＣは２０１５年にネット中立規則をまとめ上げる前、２つの業界から起こされた訴訟で敗北した。昨年には連邦控訴裁が、ネット中立性規則の正当性を支持した一方、ＩＳＰの具体的な分類はＦＣＣの権限に属するとの見解を示した。 このように司法判断が揺れ動いているため、議会にもネット通信規則のあり方をはっきり定めろという圧力がかかっている。マイク・コフマン下院議員のような一部の共和党員さえ、議会が関連法案を策定するまでＦＣＣに中立性規則撤廃案の採決を待ってほしいと要請した。上院では共和党のジョン・スーン商業科学運輸委員長がこの問題に取り組んでいるところだ。 １４日のＦＣＣの採決でパイ氏とともに中立性規則撤廃に賛成したマイケル・オライリー委員は、恐らく議会だけが白黒をつけて、決まったことを恒久化できると発言した。それまでネット規制を巡る情勢はしばらく曲折があるだろう。 ●背景となるニュース ＊ＦＣＣは１４日の採決で、２０１５年に導入したネット中立性規則撤廃を正式承認した。５人の委員のうち、パイ委員長を含めた共和党の３人が賛成した。 ＊中立性規則撤廃により、ＩＳＰはより厳しい規制を受ける公益業ではなく、情報サービス業に分類される。 ＊筆者は「Reuters Breakingviews」のコラムニストです。本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。 ＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。 ,"

Deborah DSouza,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On July 17, Internet companies took part in a protest that was meant to highlight how the Federal Communications Commission chief Ajit Pai's proposal to remove net neutrality regulations would hurt consumers. The organizers of the ""Day of Action"" called net neutrality the basic principle that protects free speech on the internet. At the time, many thought that the FCC got the message, until Pai announced that the FCC would be holding a vote to roll back net neutrality rules on December 14, so here we go again. Since the word ""free"" often has a positive connotation, the other side hasn't wasted time calling for more freedom either. The FCC says its proposal is a step toward restoring internet freedom. A free and open internet is what internet service providers (ISPs) claim to want, too. For example, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) filed comments with the FCC detailing its support for the agency's commitment to ""restoring, protecting, and maintaining a free and open internet."" It looks like everyone wants the same thing. However, net neutrality opponents argue that the classification of ISPs as public utilities creates regulatory uncertainty, which stifles investment and innovation in the telecom industry. Pai says just the possibility of rate regulation prevents companies from investing in advanced networks because they are ""unsure of whether the government will let them compete in the free market."" Comcast calls the current rules an ""outdated regulatory regime"" that harms investment and innovation. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) worries about the scope of the government's authority and it wants policymakers to ""catalyze innovation"" and ""encourage investment."" AT&T Inc. (T) paints a bleak picture for an America under the current rules: ""Less broadband investment in turn means fewer jobs, lower productivity and lost opportunity, particularly in rural America where broadband investment is needed the most."" But has net neutrality really slowed down investment and innovation? As anyone who has dealt with statistics knows, it depends on whom you ask because the same data can be used to create different stories. Ajit Pai cites studies by the USTelecom Association and economist Hal Singer when he says that broadband capital spending has been decreasing after net neutrality. ""The key to realize our 5G future is to set rules that maximize investment in broadband,"" he said at the Mobile World Congress in February. Singer has previously prepared white papers and written testimony for AT&T and Verizon in the past, according to his bio on the Department of Justice website, and he is a principal at Economists Incorporated, which counts both those companies as clients. But the Internet Association, which counts giants like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Facebook Inc. (FB) as members, cites studies that show spending by publicly traded telecom companies increased following net neutrality. What gives? For starters, in their respective calculations, USTelecom Association and Singer did not include Sprint’s leased-equipment capital investments – approximately $2 billion – and public interest group Free Press, whose study IA cited, said, ""That’s nonsense. Sprint purchasing and leasing smartphones is no different from cable companies purchasing and leasing set-top boxes, which USTA does count as investment."" The USTelecom Association and Singer also subtracted $2 billion from AT&T’s reported capital spending to account for the company’s acquisition of DirecTV and Mexican wireless operations. Free Press also notes that while AT&T and a few other publicly traded ISPs may have reduced spending after net neutrality, twice as many increased their investment levels. Pai also cited a study by Free State Foundation, a conservative think tank backed by the telecom industry, which said Title II net neutrality rules cost the U.S. $5.1 billion in broadband capital investment. A look at the methodology reveals it used USTelecom data, which includes the adjustments mentioned before, and established a trend line from 2003 to 2016 to calculate what broadband investment should have been. This is similar to a paper from George Ford, an economist at a D.C. think tank with anonymous donors that was cited by Comcast on its website. Ford wrote, ""the threat of reclassification reduced telecommunications investment by about 20% to 30%, or about $30 to $40 billion annually."" Ford's analysis is counterfactual: the period he looks at is from 2010, when the threat of net neutrality rules first emerged and then estimates what would have been the annual investment had there been no such threat. Comcast in its filing with the FCC said that paid prioritization would have uses in telemedicine and self-driving vehicles that may need to communicate with each other. The Verge pointed out that automated cars don't use broadband at all. They rely on the exchange of data wirelessly over an unlicensed spectrum called the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) band. Moreover, paid prioritization in telemedicine would mean low-income groups would lose its benefits. Since it is hard to quantify whether innovation has been depressed, the Internet Association has taken to using patent application statistics. The organization used government data from 2010 and 2012 to show a 58.4% increase in telecom patent applications at a time when federal regulators were looking to use the 2010 policy to protect net neutrality. Patents granted under code H04W or ""wireless communication networks"" increased 10.66%, and patents granted under H04L or ""transmission of digital information"" increased 5.25% in 2016 from the year before, according to IFI CLAIMS Patent Services. AT&T was among the top 50 companies that received the most patents that year and also saw its patents increase from 2015. It seems like the government is determined to roll back net neutrality rules, and there's very little internet companies or consumers can do about it now. Although the FCC chair argues that net neutrality has led to lower investment, he is relying on industry consultants, think tanks and trade associations to make this claim, which certainly weakens his position. While it is possible ISPs may invest in more advanced networks if the rules are repealed, it is difficult to find evidence for this, and the companies have reportedly been telling investors they haven't affected investment. The greater question is at what and whose cost will net neutrality be rolled back? Investment in companies dependent on high speed internet is likely to drop if internet providers are free to discriminate between users, and MIT Technology Review has reported this has already begun. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings told Recode in May that net neutrality is not the company's primary battle anymore, because it's big enough to get the deals it wants, but it's crucial for startups.

For starters, in their respective calculations, USTelecom Association and Singer did not include Sprint’s leased-equipment capital investments – approximately $2 billion – and public interest group Free Press, whose study IA cited, said, ""That’s nonsense. Sprint purchasing and leasing smartphones is no different from cable companies purchasing and leasing set-top boxes, which USTA does count as investment."" The USTelecom Association and Singer also subtracted $2 billion from AT&T’s reported capital spending to account for the company’s acquisition of DirecTV and Mexican wireless operations. Free Press also notes that while AT&T and a few other publicly traded ISPs may have reduced spending after net neutrality, twice as many increased their investment levels. Pai also cited a study by Free State Foundation, a conservative think tank backed by the telecom industry, which said Title II net neutrality rules cost the U.S. $5.1 billion in broadband capital investment. A look at the methodology reveals it used USTelecom data, which includes the adjustments mentioned before, and established a trend line from 2003 to 2016 to calculate what broadband investment should have been. This is similar to a paper from George Ford, an economist at a D.C. think tank with anonymous donors that was cited by Comcast on its website. Ford wrote, ""the threat of reclassification reduced telecommunications investment by about 20% to 30%, or about $30 to $40 billion annually."" Ford's analysis is counterfactual: the period he looks at is from 2010, when the threat of net neutrality rules first emerged and then estimates what would have been the annual investment had there been no such threat. Comcast in its filing with the FCC said that paid prioritization would have uses in telemedicine and self-driving vehicles that may need to communicate with each other. The Verge pointed out that automated cars don't use broadband at all. They rely on the exchange of data wirelessly over an unlicensed spectrum called the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) band. Moreover, paid prioritization in telemedicine would mean low-income groups would lose its benefits. Since it is hard to quantify whether innovation has been depressed, the Internet Association has taken to using patent application statistics. The organization used government data from 2010 and 2012 to show a 58.4% increase in telecom patent applications at a time when federal regulators were looking to use the 2010 policy to protect net neutrality. Patents granted under code H04W or ""wireless communication networks"" increased 10.66%, and patents granted under H04L or ""transmission of digital information"" increased 5.25% in 2016 from the year before, according to IFI CLAIMS Patent Services. AT&T was among the top 50 companies that received the most patents that year and also saw its patents increase from 2015. It seems like the government is determined to roll back net neutrality rules, and there's very little internet companies or consumers can do about it now. Although the FCC chair argues that net neutrality has led to lower investment, he is relying on industry consultants, think tanks and trade associations to make this claim, which certainly weakens his position. While it is possible ISPs may invest in more advanced networks if the rules are repealed, it is difficult to find evidence for this, and the companies have reportedly been telling investors they haven't affected investment. The greater question is at what and whose cost will net neutrality be rolled back? Investment in companies dependent on high speed internet is likely to drop if internet providers are free to discriminate between users, and MIT Technology Review has reported this has already begun. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings told Recode in May that net neutrality is not the company's primary battle anymore, because it's big enough to get the deals it wants, but it's crucial for startups.

Brian Stoffel,12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Telecoms are the bread and butter of solid retirement portfolios. Because the capital requirements to building out nationwide networks are so onerous -- and the service these companies provide so necessary -- they make for protected money-printing machines once established. That means outsized dividends. The two communications companies we're focused on today, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL), have such payouts -- yielding 4.7% and 14.7%, respectively. For investors, it might seem like money actually is growing on trees. Image source: Getty Images. But which of these two is the better buy today? That's impossible to say with 100% certainty. But by comparing them on a series of three key aspects of their stocks, we can get a better idea of what we're getting when we buy shares. Here's how they stack up. If you're a long-term, buy-to-hold investor -- and that's what we think you should be here at the Motley Fool -- there's nothing more important to investigate than the sustainable competitive advantages -- otherwise known as ""moats."" In the most basic sense, a moat is what keeps customers coming back to you year after year while holding the competition at bay for decades. One key moat all telecoms benefit from is very high barriers to entry. Because of the costs associated with setting up a telecom company -- laying down the wire, building or leasing towers, etc. -- this isn't a terribly crowded field. But because both of these companies are already established, it really isn't a differentiator. Instead, we can simply look at market share and the different approaches each company is taking toward the future. According to Statista, Verizon is the largest wireless subscription provider in the United States, with a 35.7% share. In addition, the company is making moves to become a more robust media player. This includes the acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!. That gives Verizon more flexibility moving forward. CenturyLink, on the other hand, doesn't even move the needle on a nationwide scale when it comes to market share. Instead, its future is intertwined with the recently completed merger with Level3 communications. As a Tier One provider of internet services via this move, CenturyLink has become one of the largest internet providers in the country, helping it to secure a recent contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that sent shares soaring. In the end, it's too close to call a serious winner. As wireless contracts become progressively weaker, market share matters less for Verizon. And it's simply too early to tell if the Level3 merger will produce lasting and sustainable benefits for CenturyLink shareholders. Clearly, investors in these two companies would like to see any and all excess cash returned to them. But that's not the most prudent approach over the long run. That's because every business, at one point or another, is going to face difficult economic circumstances. Those with cash on hand can often emerge even stronger. This strength comes in three forms: being able to buy back shares on the cheap, acquiring distressed competitors, or -- most importantly -- outspending rivals or undercutting their prices to gain long-term market share. Here's how these two stack up in terms of financial fortitude, keeping in mind that Verizon is valued at 12 times the size of CenturyLink. Company Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Figures rounded to the nearest whole number. Net income and free cash flow presented on a trailing-12-month basis. While leverage is common in telecoms, CenturyLink's debt-to-cash ratio is eight times that of Verizon. That means that while a downturn wouldn't necessarily help either of these companies, CenturyLink would be far more vulnerable. Finally, we have the strange alchemy of valuation. While there's no one metric that can tell you how cheap or expensive a stock is, I like to consult several data points to get a more holistic picture. Here are four of my favorites when it comes to dividend payers. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Whether because of one-time events or not, I'm not a fan of either company with such high price-to-free cash flow ratios. Not only does it mean buying a company that's richly valued, but one that has paid out far more in dividends over the past 12 months than it has taken in. Overall, I consider both to have an unfavorable valuation, but CenturyLink's is more so given its sky-high payout ratio. So there you have it: I don't like either company very much, but I dislike Verizon less. I think there are better deals for you in the market, even if you're after high dividend payers. That's why I don't own either of these stocks nor have I indicated that they'll be outperformers in my own CAPS profile. ","

Steve Symington,12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. You read that right. In contrast to its previous live-streaming arrangement, which was exclusive to Verizon subscribers, Big Red's new deal applies to NFL viewers regardless of whether they're part of the Verizon network. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. It seems likely that the terms of this agreement were heavily influenced by Yahoo, which Verizon acquired for $4.48 billion this past June then subsequently merged with its existing AOL business into a new media and tech brands subsidiary dubbed ""Oath."" This also means Verizon will lose its status as the country's exclusive mobile carrier for NFL games. But it's taking full advantage of its new reach. Through the new NFL partnership, Verizon will be able to live-stream all national preseason, regular-season, and playoff games, as well as the Super Bowl nationwide on its entire portfolio of digital and mobile media properties. That starts with the NFL playoffs next month on Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, and go90, as well as the NFL mobile app. According to Verizon, this means a prospective audience of over 200 million monthly unique mobile digital viewers in the United States. In addition, Verizon will work with individual NFL teams on ""Smart Stadium"" technology to improve stadium operations. It will also provide mobile access to NFL highlights, coverage of the league throughout the year, and ""a robust set of jointly developed original content."" ""We're making a commitment to fans for Verizon's family of media properties to become the mobile destination for live sports,"" stated Verizon chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam. ""The NFL is a great partner for us and we are excited to take its premier content across a massive mobile scale so viewers can enjoy live football and other original NFL content where and how they want it."" To be clear, financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. But according to anonymous sources speaking with Reuters, Verizon will pay roughly $2.25 billion to the NFL over the next five years for its new broad-reaching rights -- a princely ransom that more than doubles the estimated $1 billion price of its previous four-year deal. At the same time, that's nothing considering Verizon generated net income of $3.7 billion last quarter alone. And keeping in mind that Oath generated revenue of roughly $2 billion in Verizon's most recent quarter, as well as the fact that Yahoo turned profitable just prior to joining Verizon,  the company will also work to recoup its cost through incremental advertising. ""We believe that partnerships like this are a win for fans,"" elaborated McAdam, ""but also for partners and advertisers looking for a mobile-first experience."" In the end, one thing remains clear: This is an unmistakable bet by Verizon on the central role of mobile streaming as the future of sports viewership. And I think investors and football fans alike should be elated as Verizon paves the way to that end. ","

"Keith Noonan, Chris Neiger, and Daniel Miller",12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With the stock market at record highs, many investors are paying premiums for companies that appear capable of delivering big earnings growth over the long term. That sets them up with a potentially dangerous risk-reward dynamic. But you can still find growth stocks trading at significant discounts relative to their potential, if you know where to look. To give readers some leads on big growth opportunities that can be had on the cheap, we assembled a team of top Motley Fool investors and asked each one to profile a growth stock that they view as well worth the price of admission at current levels. Read on to see why they selected U.S. Concrete (NASDAQ:USCR), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Under Armour (NYSE:UA)(NYSE:UAA). Image source: Getty Images. Daniel Miller (U.S. Concrete): Finding growth stocks at deep value prices when markets have been consistently blowing through record highs is no simple task. However, in my view, U.S. Concrete fits that description. The company has bounced back from a 2010 bankruptcy and posted years of top- and bottom-line growth, but its market cap doesn't yet reflect its potential. USCR Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts After exiting bankruptcy protection and shedding its low-margin precast business, the company has been growing through bolt-on acquisitions -- a strategy it looks likely to continue using. Since 2014 alone, U.S. Concrete has completed 29 acquisitions in the ready-mixed concrete and aggregates space. Those new additions generated 40% of the company's adjusted EBITDA for the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30. This could prove to be a opportune time for investors to jump in. Management believes the country is still in the early innings of this construction cycle, and that the administration's regulatory and business-tax-cutting agendas, along with the possibility of increased federal infrastructure spending, could make the cycle more lucrative for companies in its segment. U.S. Concrete holds a top-three position in the markets where it does business, is a top supplier to major commercial projects in those regions, and has a successful track record of acquisitions. And most important for those seeking growth stocks at deep value prices, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15 (per Morningstar.com) makes U.S. Concrete worth a look. Chris Neiger (Verizon): Verizon is looking a little rough around the edges right now. The company's share price is down about 3% this year, compared the S&P 500's nearly 19% gains, and its stock is trading at just 14 times estimated forward earnings. Verizon lost ground to rivals T-Mobile and AT&T in part because they've made gains on wireless network speed and reliability, and also because it was late to offer unlimited plans when its competitors were jumping into them. But the telecom giant's management has worked to right this ship, even if its share price doesn't reflect the results yet. Its postpaid phone subscribership grew by 274,000 in the third quarter, and by 358,000 in the quarter before that. That's worth noting because in the U.S. telecom space, the only way a carriers can grow significantly is by stealing customers away from others. Verizon is also making the wise move of cutting $10 billion from its budget between now and 2021, which should result in a stronger balance sheet. That should help as the company focuses some effort on building out its content offerings via AOL and the recently acquired Yahoo!. The 50 or so content brands under its new subsidiary, called Oath, offer new opportunities for Verizon to grow beyond its wireless business. But even if its content hopes don't pan out quite as expected, investors should still be bullish on the telecom's wireless position (it still holds a 36% share of the subscription market) and its opportunity to grow that business with its new 5G technologies. The company has conducted 5G wireless tests across U.S. cities this year, and has plans to roll out fixed 5G broadbroad connections next year. Verizon doubtless aims to capitalize on its first-mover advantage in the 5G space as it did with its early investments in 4G and LTE, which kept the company ahead of its competitors in the past. This stock's performance may not have been pretty lately, but Verizon still has a strong core business, and it's making big moves in the next  evolution of wireless. Add in the company's content opportunities -- and its 4.7% dividend yield -- and the stock starts looking much more attractive. Keith Noonan (Under Armour): A market darling just a few years prior, Under Armour has fallen out of favor due to a slew of setbacks and challenges. Its North American growth story has hit the skids, and there are concerns that the brand simply isn't cool with young people anymore -- a terrifying prospect for a fashion-based business. Downward sales and earnings revisions have replaced management's touting of its former quarterly double-digit revenue growth streak -- a contextual backdrop that explains why shares lost more than 60% of their value over the last three years. That's a truncated version of Under Armour's current woes, but, for investors willing to shoulder some risk and stake out a contrarian position, its stock could present deep value at current prices. With its brand struggling amid a broader slowdown in the American sports apparel market, Under Armour's foreign growth is more important than ever. The good news is that the picture overseas looks pretty promising. Last quarter, international sales climbed roughly 56% year over year, and operating income climbed 64%. With the North American retail environment under pressure, the company is also focusing more on making direct-to-consumer sales online, and on reducing its operating expenses. Those initiatives should help keep earnings steady as the company broadens its global sales base. Under Armour shares are trading near their five-year lows. While the company's forward P/E of roughly 68 is steep, the company is valued at just 1.2 times its trailing 12-month sales. This stock could wind up looking quite cheap at current prices if the company continues to deliver big international growth. ","

Adam Levy,12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) announced a $1.5 billion buyback on Wednesday morning. That $1.5 billion is well below what many analysts were expecting after T-Mobile's bid for Sprint fell through. Analysts' estimates for the buyback reached as high as $17 billion over three years. The current $1.5 billion authorization expires at the end of next year. But CFO Braxton Carter expects that $1.5 billion won't make it to the end of next year. T-Mobile is being very conservative with its authorization as it simply tests the waters. Carter expects T-Mobile to repurchase between 2% and 3% of shares outstanding with the authorization. In that same regard, COO Mike Sievert says management's focus is now on unlocking the value it accrued over the last five years of growth. That means a larger focus on free cash flow and capital returns, although there's not much interest in a dividend right now. Image source: T-Mobile. Significantly, T-Mobile isn't going to need to take on debt to fund its capital return program. It wouldn't make much sense if it did. Its credit rating still sits below investment grade at BB+, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, and net debt has creeped up to $27.5 billion from less than $20 billion after the first quarter last year. Carter noted it will ""delever organically,"" and management is aiming to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio of 3 to 4. T-Mobile expects free cash flow to greatly surpass the $1.5 billion repurchase authorization next year. It's already brought in $1.6 billion in the first three quarters of 2017. By 2019, management expects to produce about $4.5 billion in free cash flow. That's more than enough to support $1.5 billion returned to shareholders. T-Mobile expects its free cash flow to increase between 45% and 48% per year in 2018 and 2019. Investors don't expect that rate to slow too much in the next decade, either. Rapidly increasing free cash flow, as a result of greater scale and lower investment needs, should provide much more room to increase the share repurchase authorization. T-Mobile should produce over $3 billion in free cash flow next year based on its outlook for 45% to 48% compound annual growth through 2019. So it's going to return less than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. For reference, AT&T paid out over 70% of its free cash flow as dividends. It's slowed its repurchasing activity since going on an acquisition spree. Verizon Communications paid out more than 80% of free cash flow as a dividend last quarter. It's also authorized to buy back 100 million shares by 2020, which is currently about $5 billion. Granted, AT&T and Verizon are generating significantly more cash flow than T-Mobile at this point in time. But with the company's biggest investments in its network and retail footprint slowing down and its customer base continuing to grow, free cash flow should have several more years of strong growth. The excess cash flow can go right back to shareholders as T-Mobile morphs from a growth company to a cash flow story. As such, the capital returns ought to significantly outpace the growth in free cash flow, which is already expected to boom. ","
      
    A $1.5 Billion Buyback Is Just the Start for T-Mobile -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. 2017 was a dismal year for AT&T (NYSE:T) investors, who watched their stock drop 14% as the S&P 500 rallied 17%. The stock was weighed down by four straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines and ongoing losses in video subscribers. Analysts expect AT&T to finish fiscal 2017 with a 2% sales decline and 3% earnings growth. For 2018, both figures are expected to stay roughly flat. This doesn't make AT&T look like an exciting investment for the foreseeable future, but investors shouldn't overlook the four big moves that it will likely make next year. Image source: AT&T. AT&T is already America's second largest wireless carrier, top wireline services provider, and biggest pay TV provider thanks to its purchase of DirecTV in 2015. If it closes its planned $85 billion takeover of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), it will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world. The merger would introduce major bundling opportunities between its wireline, wireless, video streaming, and pay TV businesses. Those bundles could help AT&T counter cord cutters at its pay TV business, widen its moat against Netflix, and lock in more wireless customers. AT&T claims that the acquisition would become accretive to its adjusted earnings and free cash flow within the first year. However, the US Department of Justice recently sued to block the merger, on the grounds that it would create an anti-competitive ecosystem which would limit consumer choices and hurt streaming video providers. AT&T's top priority for 2018 will be to clear these regulatory hurdles and seal the deal. If it fails to do so, its stock could stumble. AT&T will also invest heavily in new towers to expand its pre-5G and 5G network capabilities across the 700 MHz, AWS-3, and WCS spectrums. Earlier this year, Barclays estimated that AT&T would deploy equipment on up to 50,000 towers, and build about 2,000 more new towers to upgrade its infrastructure and launch the FirstNet public safety network. AT&T also recently teamed up with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in a joint partnership with Tillman Infrastructure to build hundreds of new towers. Verizon has also been aggressively expanding its fiber assets -- via its purchases of Straight Path and XO Communications for nearly $5 billion -- ahead of its 5G fixed broadband rollout next year. AT&T's acquisitions of spectrum licenses, DirecTV, and Time Warner are causing its debt levels to skyrocket. Its long-term debt hit $154.7 billion last quarter, up from $113.7 billion at the end of 2016. If the Time Warner deal closes, that figure could rise above $180 billion. AT&T has already been selling various non-core assets -- including certain cell towers, wireline operations, and data centers -- to extinguish some debt. But AT&T will likely need to sell more assets to further reduce that figure. Two possible divestments include its Digital Life home security business, which could net $1 billion in a sale, and its Latin American pay TV assets (excluding Mexico), which could be sold for $8 billion. It might also consider selling CNN to gain regulatory approval for the Time Warner deal. AT&T added three million wireless subscriptions (2.3 million in the US and nearly 700,000 in Mexico) last quarter. However, a growing number of those new subscriptions aren't for smartphones -- they're used to link tablets, wearables, drones, and connected cars to the internet with stand-alone connections. AT&T stated that it connected almost 100,000 vehicles last quarter, and that the auto market represented a ""real opportunity"" as infotainment and navigation devices rely more heavily on constant connections. AT&T's growth across these markets could diversify its business away from the saturated smartphone market. AT&T, like many of its telco rivals, will try to expand its digital ecosystem, upgrade its infrastructure, reach new wireless markets, and reduce its debt in 2018. That's a tough balancing act to pull off. However, AT&T's stock remains cheap at 13 times forward earnings, and it pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 5.3%. Therefore, investors looking for a cheap income play could consider buying this beaten-down stock -- as long they don't expect a big rebound over the next few quarters. ","
      
    What to Expect From AT&T, Inc. in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

Eric Volkman,12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. One of the many benefits of owning stocks is the chance to receive small chunks of a company's profit in the form of regular checks. We're talking about dividends, of course, and a great many companies pay them every quarter. Dividend policies are not set in stone, though, so there's no guarantee that a particular company will keep shoveling them into shareholders' hands. Image source: Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is about much more than its namesake sugary drink. In fact, the company produces 21 brands with over $1 billion in annual worldwide sales. With that kind of volume, Coca-Cola can't help but make loads of money -- its net profit margin nearly always lands well in double-digit percentage territory, while it rakes in billions of dollars in cash flow every year. Although it's struggled a bit lately due to a shift in consumer preferences toward healthier products, the company is still immensely profitable. Coca-Cola is one of the all-time dividend champions, having raised its payout at least once every year for 55 years in a row. Image source: McDonald's. Elsewhere in big food and beverage, classic fast-food purveyor McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) regularly serves up a quarterly dividend in addition to its Big Macs and shakes. Similar to Coca-Cola, the company struggled in the wake of the healthier-eating trend earlier this decade. However, McDonald's seems to have rediscovered its mojo, delivering strong sales and earnings growth with popular new offerings -- all-day breakfast, for example, and sensible efficiency measures like kiosk ordering. McDonald's is famous for utilizing the franchise model, and most of the company's restaurants are managed in this way. This keeps profit margins relatively high for the company and provides plenty of cash for the shareholder payout, which was recently extended to 41 consecutive years with a 7% increase. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Unlike Coke and McDonald's, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) isn't necessarily a household name among American consumers. But it's a big part of their lives, as the consumer-goods giant controls a great many brands that we find throughout the house. This product lineup includes, but is nowhere near limited to, Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razors and accessories, and Pampers diapers. In recent years, Procter & Gamble has slimmed this selection a bit, jettisoning a host of underperforming brands. This hasn't yet resulted in meaningful bottom-line improvement, and cash flow has narrowed. Regardless, the company still has a significant presence in stores and possesses more than enough money to pay its shareholders. It's got one of the longest dividend-raise streaks on the market, having boosted its payout 61 years in a row. Image source: Lowe's. A vibrant housing market is supporting the business of home-improvement stores, few moreso than Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). In fiscal 2016, the company booked $65 billion in sales, for growth of over 10% year over year. More impressively, net income rose 21%, to hit nearly $3.1 billion. Americans are getting out their hammers and building things, a trend that very much favors a big home-improvement chain like Lowe's. Lowe's has paid a dividend in every single quarter since it listed on the stock exchange in 1961. Its dividend-raise habit stretches back nearly as far -- 54 years, to be exact. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) likes to boast that it passes its savings onto its customers. Another thing the company is fond of handing over is a quarterly dividend to shareholders: These days, it doles out $0.51 per share. The company has done fairly well, considering that online shopping is taking a toll on traditional retailers like itself. In recent years, neither revenue nor net profit has eroded too badly, and Wal-Mart still has plenty of cash on hand for the payout. In fiscal 2017, for example, its total spend on the dividend was less than 50% of its earnings. With a dividend-raise streak that's now 44 years long, Wal-Mart is one of the most durable raisers in the retail industry. Image source: Target. Elsewhere in big retail, Target (NYSE:TGT) also is holding its own against the onslaught of e-tailers. What helps is that the company makes a great effort to lure customers into its stores. A recent initiative, known as Drive Up, is currently being tested in Minnesota. Drive Up would allow Target shoppers to make their purchase online and pick up the goods at a designated area at the store. The service, which is currently being tested, is appealing for people within range of a store who don't want to wait a day, or several, for an e-tailer to ship them their purchases. Target has one of the highest-yielding dividends in the retail sector, at 4.4%. Like Wal-Mart, the company has a four-decade-plus stretch of annual dividend increases. Image source: Costco Wholesale. Our dividend-paying retailer tour stops at the entrance of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), the popular warehouse club. The company seems to be barely struggling at all against e-tailing, perhaps because customers can best discover deals and funky products by actually visiting the store. In its most recently reported fiscal year, Costco booked almost $130 billion in sales -- a pleasant 9% improvement over the previous year -- while net profit rose by 11%. There are few signs of the dreaded retail apocalypse at this retailer. In April, Costco declared an 11% raise in its regular quarterly dividend, to $0.50 per share. It has hiked its payout every year since 2005. Image source: Tootsie Roll Industries. Nearly every American is familiar with Tootsie Roll candy, but many are unaware that the company behind it -- Tootsie Roll Industries (NYSE:TR) -- owns a host of confectionery brands. Among these are DOTS, Junior Mints, and Charleston Chew. This concentration on sugary goods doesn't fit into the healthy eating/drinking trend (see slide No. 1), and Tootsie Roll Industries has seen revenue declines because of it. Still, the company's wares are common sights on supermarket and convenience-store shelves -- one reason it's been consistently profitable. For over half a century, Tootsie Roll has been raising its dividend as reliably as it's produced those tasty pellets of chewy chocolate. At present, that quarterly payout amounts to $0.09 per share. Image source: Getty Images. A vibrant U.S. housing market is thickening the financials of paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), which has been doing its thing since 1866. Not long ago, the company decided to bulk up through the splashy, $11 billion buyout of fellow paint manufacturer Valspar, a deal that closed earlier this year. This bolt-on acquisition helped Sherwin-Williams grow its revenue an impressive 37% on a year-over-year basis in its Q3. Meanwhile, cost savings from operational overlap should help the company improve its already healthy profitability. Sherwin-Williams is a longtime dividend payer and raiser. It began lifting its payout way back in 1979, and hasn't stopped yet. Image source: Aflac. Perhaps best known for its duck mascot and quirky TV ads, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) is a leading provider of supplemental health insurance. This is a niche, yet profitable, segment, as evidenced by the company's habit of landing consistently in the black. Aflac operates in two highly developed markets, the U.S. and Japan, and currency movements in the latter can affect results at times -- such as the company's Q3, in which it saw a slight dip in revenue. For the most part, though, Aflac operates a very stable and steady business. This is reflected in the company's quarterly dividend, which has been on the rise for over 30 years straight. On an annual basis, Aflac currently pays $1.80, which yields 2.1%. Image source: ExxonMobil. The largest oil producer in the U.S., mighty ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has managed to keep itself well in the black on the bottom line lately, despite a serious drop in oil prices earlier this decade. ExxonMobil has done a good job maintaining profitability: In its latest reported quarter, it took advantage of recent improvements in prices and expanded its bottom line by almost 50%, to just under $4 billion, on $66.2 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the company's cash flow remains more than sufficient to pay its steadily increasing dividend. Said payout has been flowing through the pipes of ExxonMobil and its predecessor companies for over a century. More recently, the company has increased it annually for 35 years running. Image source: McCormick. This dividend cleverly hides in your pantry or spice rack. If any company is most readily identified with spices and food seasonings, it's longtime purveyor McCormick (NYSE:MKC), which has a commanding presence on supermarket shelves. Over the years, the company has managed to build itself into a powerhouse, with over $4.4 billion in annual sales, and its organic improvements have been complimented by acquisitions. Its revenue growth tends to outpace the rise in its costs, making it a steady and reliably profitable operator. McCormick just declared a raise in its quarterly dividend -- by 11%, to $0.52 per share -- marking the 32nd year in a row it has increased its payout. Image source: Waste Management. Take out your trash and collect a dividend. That's the interesting dynamic at work if you're a customer and shareholder of top U.S. rubbish-hauler Waste Management (NYSE:WM), which makes a lot of coin disposing of unwanted material. The company has been in business in its present form since 1968 and has grown to the point where it books nearly $14 billion in annual revenue. It's almost always profitable on an annual basis, and throws off more-than-enough cash to fund its dividend. Said payout has been headed north for over a decade: Waste Management has increased it every year since 2004. Image source: Microsoft. Generally speaking, tech companies aren't generous dividend payers -- when they pay them at all, that is. The sector requires a great deal of investment in order to bring products to market, which usually doesn't leave much for shareholder payouts. A notable exception is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a famously profitable and cash-rich company that started to hand out a quarterly dividend in 2004 and has never looked back. It's lifted that distribution every year since then, boosting it from the initial $0.08 per share to today's $0.39. Although some critics have faulted Microsoft for not being more generous with the payout, at 2%, it actually yields slightly over the average of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500. Image source: Getty Images. The largest American cellphone-services provider by subscriber count, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is also one of the sector's most reliable dividend payers. Although the company sets aside plenty of capital for investments into its network and infrastructure, it also leaves enough room for a generous shareholder payout. There's enough money for a great many purposes, as Verizon's trailing 12-month net profit amounted to nearly $16 billion, almost twice what the carrier paid out in dividends. Although it doesn't have the longest annual raise streak in its segment -- that honor goes to uber-rival AT&T -- Verizon has had a good run with its increases. In June it declared a raise for the 11th year in a row. ","

,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted along party lines on Thursday to repeal landmark 2015 rules aimed at ensuring a free and open internet, setting up a court fight over a move that could recast the digital landscape. The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and hands them power over what content consumers can access. It also is the biggest win for Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations since taking over at the agency in January. Democrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content. The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers. The meeting, held amid protests online and in front of the FCC headquarters in Washington, was evacuated before the vote for about 10 minutes due to an unspecified security threat, and resumed after law enforcement with sniffer dogs checked the room. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the  administration “supports the FCC’s efforts. At the same time, the White House certainly has and always will support a free and fair internet.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in a statement he will lead a multi-state lawsuit to challenge the reversal. Shares of Alphabet, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp moved lower after the vote. The FCC said the rules would take effect in a few months after the White House Office of Management and Budget formally approves them. Pai has argued that the 2015 rules were heavy handed and stifled competition and innovation among service providers. “The internet wasn’t broken in 2015. We weren’t living in a digital dystopia,” he said on Thursday. Consumers are unlikely to see immediate changes but smaller startups worry the lack of restrictions could drive up costs or lead to their content being blocked. Internet service providers say they will not block or throttle legal content but may engage in paid prioritization. They argue that the largely unregulated internet functioned well in the two decades before the 2015 order. Republican FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly noted that self-driving vehicles and remotely monitored medical procedures may require internet service and that their needs could be given priority “over cat videos.” O’Rielly said it is unlikely any internet provider would voluntarily submit to a “PR nightmare” by “attempting to engage in blocking, throttling or improper discrimination. It is simply not worth the reputation cost.” Still, Democrats have pointed to polls showing a repeal is deeply unpopular and say they will prevail in protecting the rules, either in the courts or in U.S. Congress. Immediately after the vote, Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat, said he and 15 other senators planned to introduce a resolution to undo the FCC action and restore the net neutrality rules. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said in a written dissent released on Thursday that the decision grants internet providers “extraordinary new power” from the FCC. “They have the technical ability and business incentive to discriminate and manipulate your internet traffic,” she said. “And now this agency gives them the legal green light to go ahead.” Several state attorneys general said before the vote they would oppose the ruling, citing issues with the public comment period. Other critics have said they will consider challenging what they see as weaker enforcement. The 2015 rules were intended to give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband providers from favoring their own content. Those practices are now allowed as long as they are disclosed. The broadband industry cheered the move. USTelecom, a lobbying group representing internet providers and broadband companies said after the vote they had “renewed confidence” to make network investments, particularly in rural communities. On the other side, the trade group Internet Association, whose members include content providers Alphabet, Facebook and Pandora Media Inc, said “the fight isn’t over” and that it was weighing legal options in a lawsuit against the FCC order. A University of Maryland poll had found more than 80 percent of respondents opposed a repeal. The survey of 1,077 registered voters was conducted online by the Program for Public Consultation from Dec. 6-8. ","

,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Behind your video stream of a hit like “Stranger Things” is a complicated array of technology and business relationships that will not change very much, at least in the short term, as a result of this week’s repeal of U.S. regulations on internet traffic, industry insiders say. The latest net neutrality rules did not erase these business dynamics, people familiar with the arrangements say. The repeal likely will not either, though scuffles could arise as ISPs seek to take advantage of the rule change in the future. “From the era of having no net neutrality to the era of having it, nothing changed,” said a former video streaming executive on condition of anonymity. To deliver their services effectively and economically, large video streaming companies spend money sending data directly to different broadband networks, and dominant ISPs at times charge for taking on large volumes of traffic. Companies’ “need for someone that sits between their content, whether that’s a website or streaming video, and all the places in the world it needs to go, isn’t going to change,” said Sunil Dhaliwal, founder of venture capital firm Amplify Partners, which has a stake in content delivery network Fastly. There have been conflicts, notably a 2014 dust-up between Netflix and Comcast, that resulted from the dramatic surge in streaming video traffic in recent years. Netflix ultimately agreed to pay Comcast despite complaining in an online blog post that its partner was “double dipping” by also receiving money from home internet subscribers. Yet this arrangement was not unique. YouTube, for example, has also paid ISPs as part of so-called “peering” arrangements by which networks connect to one another to deliver video streams more efficiently, said an industry executive familiar with the practice. In a statement, Netflix said “tolls decreased for us” after the 2015 net neutrality rules were passed - but did not say they disappeared. The company added: “We support strong net neutrality protections, even if we are at less risk because of our popularity, which keeps our relationships with ISPs stable.” Chris Van Noy, a digital media executive formerly with Akamai and streaming service Hulu, noted that ISPs would have no reason to interfere with startups and small firms that send little internet traffic over their networks, with the possible exception of a startup posing a strategic threat. Going after bigger players would not be simple either, he said. “It’s always a tight rope for the ISPs,” said Van Noy. Blocking video services would undermine their sales of fast-download, higher-margin internet plans that are “pure gravy for them.” That is not to say ISPs will not attempt to profit from the regulatory change. They may offer bundled internet deals that include their in-house content but charge extra for Netflix or Hulu, experts said. “They can frame it as a positive. ‘We’re not hurting Netflix. We’re just giving our subscribers a benefit of something we already own,’” said Alan Wolk, lead analyst for TV industry publication TV[R]EV. But any action that changes how consumers access the internet must be disclosed under the new FCC rules and may face regulatory scrutiny - a possible deterrent. “I don’t think anyone is going to do anything crazy that will upset public opinion,” said Eric Hippeau, a managing partner of Lerer Hippeau Ventures and former CEO of The Huffington Post. “This is a highly politically charged area.” ","

,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors saddled in 2017 with the market’s worst performers, including Under Armour and General Electric, may do well to remember as December draws to an end that lumps of coal sometimes turn into diamonds. As investment advisors rebalance clients’ portfolios in the final weeks of the year, the instinct to dump stocks that have been left behind in surging markets - or that fall out of favor with analysts - can be self-destructive. With the S&P 500’s rally pushing price/earnings multiples to highs not seen since 2002, laggards overlooked by a rush to own technology and other high-growth stocks may attract bargain-hunting investors heading into 2017. “A contrarian strategy of buying beaten-up names might have a good year,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Kroger has lost 20 percent year to date and it recently traded at 14 times expected earnings, compared to its five-year average of 27. “Grocery is local; it’s not an internet play. And Kroger has the footprint to not even notice that Amazon is around,” Dollarhide said. Underscoring the fallibility of analysts, four of the 10 S&P 500 worst-rated stocks at the end of last year are on track to finish 2017 with annual increases above the index’s 20-perent gain. 2017's diamonds and lumps of coal: tmsnrt.rs/2BhvwkC ","

,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'B'/'RR4' rating to Windstream Services, LLC's new 8.75% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2024. The new 2024 notes are pari passu to the company's existing unsecured notes and are being issued in exchange for a portion of 7.75% senior notes due 2021 and 7.50% senior notes due 2022. On Dec.12, 2017, Windstream announced results for debt exchange offers announced on Nov. 28, 2017. Approximately 86% ($538 million) and 85% ($232 million) of 2021 and 2022 noteholders, respectively, have accepted the exchange offers as of the early settlement date. The debt exchanges would entail higher incremental interest cost for Windstream, but the lower maturity wall in the intermediate term would help improve the liquidity position. The new 2024 notes are subject to a mandatory redemption of $150 million, 75 days after the initial settlement date. The covenants restrict payments to the parent, Windstream Holdings, Inc., if leverage is equal or greater than 3.5x, with carve-outs for master lease payments by parent to Uniti Group Inc. and certain administrative and tax payments. Windstream also announced 2023 exchange offer, where it offered to exchange 7.50% senior notes due 2023 for 6 3/8% notes maturing in 2023. As of the early settlement date, 57% ($68 million in aggregate principal) of the note holders had tendered to exchange, lower than the minimum $90 million required per 2023 exchange conditions. The company has extended the deadline until Dec. 26, 2017. Windstream's ratings are on Negative Watch after the company received a notice of default from Aurelius Capital Master Ltd., a noteholder on its 6 3/8% bonds. Windstream is defending the allegations and has filed a legal proceeding on the matter. Windstream has obtained the consent solicitations for waiver of the alleged defaults from a majority of 6 3/8% noteholders. Fitch will resolve the Watch following the resolution of the pending litigation. KEY RATING DRIVERS Near-Term Pressures: Including the EarthLink merger and Broadview Networks acquisition (the transactions), Windstream continued to experience pressure in its wholesale segment, as well as the small/medium business incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) segment through the third quarter of 2017 (3Q17). The enterprise segment remains weak due to effects of legacy revenue declines. Competitive local exchange (CLEC) consumer and small business has shown stabilization in 3Q17, benefitting from acquisition-related segment revenue. Pro forma for the transactions, Fitch's base case assumes revenues continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. Revenue Mix Changes: Windstream derives approximately two-thirds of its revenue from enterprise services, consumer high-speed internet services and its carrier customers (core and wholesale), providing the best prospects for stable revenues in the long term. Certain legacy revenues remain pressured, but Windstream's revenues should stabilize gradually as legacy revenues dwindle in the mix. Leverage Metrics: Fitch estimates total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will be 5.8x in 2017, including the transactions. Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline to the mid-5x range by the end of 2019 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. In calculating total adjusted debt, Fitch applies an 8x multiple to the sum of the annual rental payment to Uniti plus other rental expenses. Cost Synergies Support EBITDA Stabilization: Windstream anticipates realizing more than $180 million of annual run-rate synergies three years after the close of the transactions: $155 million in operating cost savings and $25 million in capital spending savings. Windstream expects to realize approximately $180 million in run-rate synergies by the end of 2019. In its base case assumptions for Windstream, Fitch has assumed moderately lower cost savings to be realized by the end of three years following the transactions. Fitch expects EBITDAR margin improvement in the range of 100bps-200bps by the end of 2019. Integration Key to Success: Fitch believes there are potential execution risks to achieving the operating cost and capital expenditure synergies following the close of the transactions. Initial savings are expected to be realized from reduced selling, general and administrative savings as corporate overheads and other public company cost savings arise. Over time, the company is expected to realize the benefits of lower network access costs as on-network opportunities lower third-party network access costs. Finally, cost savings are expected to be realized by IT and the billing system. Fitch estimated $20 million of these savings in 4Q17. DERIVATION SUMMARY Windstream has a weaker competitive position based on scale and size of its operations in the higher-margin enterprise market. Larger companies, including AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative), Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable), and CenturyLink, Inc. (BB/Stable), have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. In comparison to Windstream, AT&T and Verizon maintain lower financial leverage, generate higher EBITDA margins and FCF, and have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification. Fitch also believes Windstream has a weaker FCF profile than CenturyLink including the LVLT acquisition, as CenturyLink's FCF will benefit from enhanced scale and LVLT's net operating loss carryforwards. Although Windstream has less exposure to the more volatile residential market compared to its wireline peer, Frontier Communications Corp. (B+/Stable), it has higher leverage than Frontier. Within the residential market, incumbent wireline providers face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators with facilities-based triple play offerings, including Comcast Corp. (A-/Stable) and Charter Communications Inc. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, CCO Holdings, LLC, BB+/Stable). Cheaper alternative offerings such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline providers have had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats. As of year-end 2016, roughly 60% of Windstream's footprint overlapped with a national cable operator. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Revenue and EBITDA include the EarthLink merger as of Feb. 27, 2017 and the acquisition of Broadview on July 28, 2017. --Revenues total $5.9 billion for 2017 and remain almost flat in 2018. Fitch expects organic revenue to continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. --2017 EBITDA is expected to benefit from synergies achieved from acquisitions and other cost savings. Fitch expects EBITDA margins to expand by roughly 70bps in 2018 as additional cost synergies are realized. --Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline from 5.8x at year-end 2017 to the mid-5x range by the end of 2019 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --The company sustains total adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 5.0x-5.2x. --Revenues and EBITDA would need to stabilize on a sustained basis. --Fitch would also need to see progress by Windstream on executing the integration of its recent transactions. --Material reduction in leverage on a sustained basis following any asset sales repayment of debt could also benefit the rating. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --A negative rating action could occur if total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is 6.0-6.2x or higher for a sustained period. --The company no longer makes progress toward revenue and EBITDA stability due to competitive and business conditions. --Evidence of deterioration in liquidity, including lack of positive run-rate FCFs and declining FCF margin. --Any negative developments related to the outcome of the receipt of notice of default. Fitch intends to resolve the Rating Watch once it can be sufficiently determined that the allegations under the notice will not affect Windstream's credit profile. LIQUIDITY The rating is supported by the liquidity provided by Windstream's $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). At Sept. 30, 2017, approximately $129 million was available (pro forma for the recently completed debt exchanges, approximately $410 million is available under the revolver). The revolver availability was supplemented with $56.5 million in cash at the end of 3Q17. The $1.25 billion senior secured RCF is in place until April 2020. Principal financial covenants in Windstream's secured credit facilities require a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75x and a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5x. Outside of annual term loan amortization payments, Windstream does not have any material maturities until 2020. The recent debt exchanges helped Windstream extend the maturities, improving the liquidity profile. Windstream utilized the proceeds from new money 2025 senior secured notes to repay $250 million under the revolver and $140 million under term loan tranche B6. Pro forma for the debt exchanges, and repayment of revolver, maturities in 2020 total approximately $1.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Fitch estimates post-dividend FCF in 2017 will range from negative $100 to negative $200 million, including integration capex, $50 million of spending related to the completion of Project Excel and other cash non-operating expenses. Fitch expects capital spending to return to normal levels in the 13%-15% range after 2017 and for the company to return to positive FCF in 2018, with FCF margins in the low single digits over the forecast. RECOVERY The recovery analysis assumes that Windstream would be considered a going concern in a bankruptcy and that the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated. Fitch has assumed a 10% administrative claim. Windstream's going concern EBITDA is based on LTM EBITDA as of Sept. 30, 2017, pro forma for acquisitions and synergies. The going-concern EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level, upon which Fitch bases the valuation of the company. A lower going-concern EBITDA factors in the competitive dynamics of the industry that result in account losses and pricing pressures. The overall decline also considers Windstream's cost cutting efforts as an offsetting factor. This leads to a post-reorganization EBITDA estimate of approximately $1.2 billion that is 20% below pro forma LTM EBITDA as of Sept. 30, 2017. The current network lease with Uniti is expected to remain unchanged. An EV multiple of 4.5x is used to calculate a post-reorganization valuation. Comparable market multiples in the industry range from 5.4x-8.7x and recent acquisition multiples range from 3.8x-6.6x. There are two bankruptcy cases analyzed in Fitch's TMT bankruptcy case study report - Fairpoint and Hawaiian Telecom - both of which filed bankruptcy in 2008 and emerged with multiplies of 4.6x and 3.7x, respectively. Both were also sold in recent acquisitions for 5.9x and 5.6x. The recovery multiple takes into account Windstream's weaker competitive position in the industry and the company's exposure to legacy assets. Fitch's multiple for Windstream's recovery analysis also considers dependence on legacy revenues that will decline in future, aided by revenue from recent acquisitions in cloud and connectivity space. The revolving facility is assumed to be fully drawn upon default. The waterfall analysis results in a 100% recovery corresponding to a 'RR1' Recovery Rating for the secured debt including the first-lien credit facility and revolving facility; and the newly issued senior secured notes. The senior secured tranche of Windstream's capital structure benefits from a first-priority lien on all assets and capital stock of its subsidiaries (subject to regulatory approval) and a guaranty from Windstream's material direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (except for subsidiaries of PAETEC Holding Corp and subject to regulatory approval). The waterfall also indicates an 'RR4' (41%) recovery for senior unsecured notes. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has maintained the following ratings: Windstream Services, LLC --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B'; --$1.25 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2020 at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior secured term loans at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior secured notes due 2025 at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior unsecured notes at 'B/RR4'. The ratings remain on Rating Watch Negative. Contact: Primary Analyst Salonie Sehgal Associate Director +1-312-368-3137 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - La Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones de Estados Unidos votó el jueves en favor de rechazar las históricas reglas aprobadas en 2015 para asegurar un internet libre y abierto, poniendo en marcha un pulso judicial por una decisión que podría redibujar el panorama digital. La aprobación de la propuesta del presidente a la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC por sus siglas en inglés), Ajit Pai, significó una victoria para proveedores de servicios en internet como AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp y Verizon Communications Inc, ya que les da poder sobre los contenidos a los que pueden acceder los consumidores. Los demócratas, Hollywood y compañías como Alphabet Inc -matriz de Google- y Facebook Inc habían pedido a Pai, un republicano nombrado por el presidente Donald Trump, que mantuviera el reglamento de tiempos de Barack Obama, que prohíbe a los proveedores de servicios bloquear, ralentizar el acceso o cobrar más por determinados contenidos. Asociaciones de defensa de los consumidores y grupos comerciales que representan a proveedores de contenidos planean poner en marcha un reto legal para preservar estas reglas. La reunión fue evacuada durante unos 10 minutos antes de la votación, debido a una amenaza de seguridad no especificada, y se reanudó después de que perros entrenados revisaron la sala. La demócrata Mignon Clyburn, comisionada de la FCC, dijo antes de la votación que los republicanos están “entregando las llaves de Internet” a “un puñado de corporaciones multimillonarias”. Pai argumentó que la legislación de 2015 es muy dura y complica la competencia y la innovación entre los prestadores de servicios. Los miembros de la FCC votaron por 3-2 en favor de rechazar las reglas, en línea con sus partidos afines. Los proveedores de servicios por internet aseguran que no bloquearán ni acelerarán contenido legal, aunque sí podrían optar por una priorización pagada. Asimismo, aseguran que los consumidores no experimentarán cambios y argumentan que internet funcionó bien en las dos décadas previas a la orden de 2015, cuando estaba bastante desregulado. ","

,12212017,Reuters,12142017,ネット通信を巡る環境は、ＦＣＣが中立性規則導入に合意した２年前から劇的に変わろうとしている。パイＦＣＣ委員長が主導してきた中立性規則撤廃により、ネット接続事業者（ＩＳＰ）は特定コンテンツへのアクセス遮断や速度制限、ないしは消費者への料金上乗せといった行為が禁止されなくなる。今後ＩＳＰは公益業ではなく、より監督が緩い情報サービス業に分類されるからだ。 来年初めから実施される中立性規則撤廃は、ＩＳＰがアクセス遮断や速度制限をする場合は、その情報を開示することが前提となる。各企業の情報開示が正確かどうか監視し、正確性を確保する任務は連邦取引委員会（ＦＴＣ）が担う。 ＦＣＣは２０１５年にネット中立規則をまとめ上げる前、２つの業界から起こされた訴訟で敗北した。昨年には連邦控訴裁が、ネット中立性規則の正当性を支持した一方、ＩＳＰの具体的な分類はＦＣＣの権限に属するとの見解を示した。 このように司法判断が揺れ動いているため、議会にもネット通信規則のあり方をはっきり定めろという圧力がかかっている。マイク・コフマン下院議員のような一部の共和党員さえ、議会が関連法案を策定するまでＦＣＣに中立性規則撤廃案の採決を待ってほしいと要請した。上院では共和党のジョン・スーン商業科学運輸委員長がこの問題に取り組んでいるところだ。 １４日のＦＣＣの採決でパイ氏とともに中立性規則撤廃に賛成したマイケル・オライリー委員は、恐らく議会だけが白黒をつけて、決まったことを恒久化できると発言した。それまでネット規制を巡る情勢はしばらく曲折があるだろう。 ●背景となるニュース ＊ＦＣＣは１４日の採決で、２０１５年に導入したネット中立性規則撤廃を正式承認した。５人の委員のうち、パイ委員長を含めた共和党の３人が賛成した。 ＊中立性規則撤廃により、ＩＳＰはより厳しい規制を受ける公益業ではなく、情報サービス業に分類される。 ＊筆者は「Reuters Breakingviews」のコラムニストです。本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。 ＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。 ,"

Daniel Liberto,12212017,Investopedia,12142017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs China’s biggest smartphone manufacturers are keen to take on Apple Inc. (APPL) in the U.S. after comfortably beating the iPhone maker in their home market, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. are believed to be in talks with U.S. wireless operators about selling their flagship smartphones to American consumers as early as next year. The sources said both companies are negotiating with the likes of AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) two of the largest U.S. wireless networks. Talks are reportedly going well, although an agreement could still fail to materialize, the sources added. If Huawei and Xiaomi are successful in their negotiations, they will suddenly find themselves in an ideal position to challenge Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.’s (SSNLF) hierarchy in the U.S. With the support of carriers, who are responsible for most phone purchases, both companies will be able to extend their presence beyond e-commerce websites to retail stores, carrier websites and TV commercials, reaching millions of new potential customers in the process. Bloomberg’s sources said Huawei, China’s number one phone maker, is keen to sell its flagship line via U.S. carriers, alongside ecommerce channels. Meanwhile, Xiaomi is rumored to be growing frustrated with negotiations and, as a result, is now weighing up whether to start opening its own retail stores in the U.S. The decision by China’s biggest smartphone makers to enter the U.S. market at this particular time makes sense. Since moving toward financing plans, the country’s carriers have stopped subsidizing handsets, making cheaper models more attractive. Apple has emerged as one of the biggest victims of these changes because its phones tend to cost more. Without discounts from carriers, consumers are now having to pay the full price for the iPhone X. While Apple’s latest flagship model retails for over $1,000, Chinese rivals sell handsets at much more affordable prices. The affordability of Huawei and Xiaomi’s phones is one of the main reasons why they continue to beat Apple in their home market. According to IDC estimates, reported on by Bloomberg, Apple has just under 8 percent of the Chinese smartphone market, compared with over 33 percent for Huawei and Xiaomi combined. Apple’s market share has reportedly grown since it launched the iPhone X. However, analysts aren’t convinced that the Cupertino, California-based company has a decent shot of continuing to expand in China because its phones cost much more than rivals. (See also: Is Apple's iPhone X Threatened by Chinese Rivals?) “Apple’s growth this quarter is only temporary,” said Mo Jia, an analyst with researcher Canalys, according to Bloomberg. “The hefty price of iPhone X is going to hurt sales in China.” (See also: Apple, Microsoft Will Drive 2018 Tech Earnings Growth: Moody's.)

Donna Fuscaldo,12212017,Investopedia,12142017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Altaba (AABA), the remnants of Yahoo after its sale of its core internet assets to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), could stand to benefit when the corporate tax rate is lowered if it opts to sell any of its stake in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba Group (BABA). With the tax bill about to land on President Donald Trump’s desk, the corporate tax rate is expected to be reduced to 21%, which could provide upside to Altaba stock to the tune of about $7 a share or around 10%, Susquehanna Financial wrote in a research report this week. Analyst Joseph Stauff predicted in the note, which was covered by Barron’s, that shares should dip more, providing an upside opportunity. “We think it is likely that Altaba will trade at a 21% discount to intrinsic (value) soon after corporate tax reform is passed by year-end,” Stauff wrote in the note. He noted that a lower corporate tax rate would reduce the amount of taxes the company owes if it sold its stakes in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba on the open market. What’s more, bulls think the discount to net asset value should be narrower than the current 26%. It was around 30% about a month ago, noted Barron’s. (See also: Altaba Stock Breaks Out After Verizon Sale.) Altaba started trading under its new symbol in the summer and since then has had a bumpy ride as investors try to figure out what the new company is all about. One of the most attractive aspects of it is its 15% stake in Alibaba, which, according to media reports, is valued at around $341 billion. While the former Yahoo basically looks like a holding company for a stake in the Chinese retailer, it warned in a regulatory filing last year that Alibaba could get hit with a massive tax bill of as much as 36.5% if it tried to buy back the shares. Altaba also owns a stake in Yahoo Japan valued at $7.7 billion, has $12 billion in cash and marketable debts, $130 million in minority investments including in Snap Inc. (SNAP) and a $740 million stake in Excalibur, which is a unit of the new company that holds patents of Yahoo that were not sold to Verizon. (See also: Altaba to Buy Back Up to $5 Billion in Shares.) While Altaba is likely to explore ways to monetize its 35% stake in Yahoo Japan via a tax-efficient strategy that may include selling the stock back to Yahoo Japan, there is more concern about what will happen with the Alibaba stake. According to Barron’s, Altaba bulls think Alibaba will purchase the stake from Altaba in a tax-free exchange. If it did happen, the Alibaba shares would likely be discounted enough that the Chinese e-commerce giant would be interested in the transaction. Barron’s pegs that at an around a 15% discount. If the corporate tax rate is lowered, Altaba will have more leverage in talks with Alibaba since unloading the shares on the open market would now be an option and would result in a lower tax bill than in the past. While Alibaba hasn’t been interested in buying back the shares if there is a chance that 384 million shares can land in the market the Chinese online retailer may make a move.

Among those recommended in their recent cover story are these twelve, with their dividend yields and year-to-date total returns (price appreciation plus dividends): Total return data is through December 14. Barron's story was published on December 16. Barron's top choice for income-oriented investors in 2018 is master limited partnerships (MLPs) related to energy distribution in the U.S., with Enterprise Products Partners as among Barron's top 10 stock picks overall for 2018. Cash flow for the industry is projected to grow in the mid single digits in 2018, and MLP shares look to be trading below historical levels, per Barron's. As oil output rises in the U.S., pipeline MLPs will benefit. (For more, see also: 10 Stocks With 'Significant Upside' in an Overpriced Market.) European companies prefer paying dividends to share repurchases, making this Barron's second most-favored group. Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, trades at a forward P/E of only eight, per Barron's, and shareholders may benefit from a planned spinoff of its truck-making unit. Both Verizon and AT&T trade at forward P/E ratios of around 13, below the overall value of 20 for the telecom sector, Barron's says, adding that Verizon should benefit from an easing of price wars in the wireless market. REITs have lagged the market in 2017, with YTD total returns of around 5% versus about 21% for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), per Barron's. The sector has a low multiple versus the S&P 500 and can generate mid- to high-single-digit returns in 2018, Barron's adds. SL Green, however, has a trailing twelve months P/E ratio of 97, per Barron's. On the other hand, this REIT trades at a discount to its private market value, Barron's says. Fitch Ratings recently upgraded SL Green, which invests primarily in Manhattan office buildings, to a positive outlook with a rating of BBB-, per Business Wire. China Mobile is the dominant wireless player in China, and has the strongest balance sheet among global telecom companies, with cash equal to about 30% of its market value, Barron's indicates.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Telecom derives about 40% of its market value from its 64% ownership position in T-Mobile U.S. Inc. (TMUS), which has improving free cash flow, per Barron's. California-based electric utility Edison International has been beaten down recently over concerns about its potential financial liability over recent wildfires in that state.

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) are the two dominant wireless companies in the U.S., easily passing Sprint and T-Mobile in both subscribers and network size. The position has made them something of a duopoly in the market, which leads to incredibly strong profitability. The question for investors is: Which stock is the better buy? Here's a look at how Verizon and AT&T stack up. Image source: Getty Images. You can see below that AT&T is the bigger company from a revenue perspective, but Verizon has generated more net income over the last few years. VZ Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The big reason for Verizon's better bottom line is its superior gross margin. The company clearly has some pricing power in the market, and is exploiting it today. But that better operating position may not last. Where Verizon and AT&T start to look different to investors is their strategic moves to build a telecommunications company of the future. Verizon bought Yahoo earlier this year for $4.5 billion, which will be added to AOL to create a company called Oath. It could be argued that Oath is just the remnants of an internet that's long lost its value for investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is attempting to acquire Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX.DL) to combine telecommunications and media assets. This would allow AT&T to bundle wireless with TV and internet for millions of customers. And given the FCC's recent decision to overturn net neutrality, AT&T might be able to give its own customers a superior experience with Time Warner content. Strategically, AT&T is making better moves, and is adding adjacent businesses that will give it pricing power in the future. But the right strategic moves now could have costs elsewhere down the line. When we look out 5-10 years to see which company will be able to build the better 5G network to drive the next phase of growth, the strategies I laid out above become important. You can see that both Verizon and AT&T have debt loads around $115 billion after going on buying sprees the last few years. If AT&T's proposed buyout of Time Warner goes through, about half of the $85.4 billion purchase price will be paid for from the balance sheet or new debt. The company said it has a $40 billion bridge term facility to finance the deal, but you can see that the balance sheet will be stretched further. VZ Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) data by YCharts This is important because both Verizon and AT&T are rolling out 5G networks that will drive a new generation of connected devices. It won't just be smartphones using 5G -- cars, VR headsets, and smart cities will use 5G, just to name a few applications. Given Verizon's higher net income and lower net debt (assuming the Time Warner deal is completed), it may have a better balance sheet for building a 5G network going forward. There's no clear-cut winner between Verizon and AT&T, but the stronger margins, net incomes, and better balance sheet are what make me give Verizon the nod today. I like AT&T's strategic direction, but it seems to be adding an awful lot of debt to grow its scale, and that's a risk I don't want to take in the telecommunications business. ","

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has been pointing to its expansion into the enterprise wireless market as a meaningful growth driver for the better part of a year. Indeed, T-Mobile is well behind its competitors when it comes to enterprise customers. At an investor conference last week, COO Mike Sievert mentioned the company only has a 2% to 3% market share. Enterprise represents yet another way for T-Mobile to steal customers away from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). AT&T counts over 87 million wireless connections among its business customers -- 51 million postpaid and nearly 36 million connected devices. For reference, T-Mobile has fewer than 58 million total branded customers. But the real reason T-Mobile is excited about its progress with business customers is because management feels it's a strong leading indicator of consumer behavior. Image source: T-Mobile. Choosing a wireless carrier is a much bigger decision for a business with hundreds of employee phones to service than it is for a consumer household. Not only is the business looking to spend more money, there are significant switching costs to consider. Every employer needs to make the switch. Businesses aren't just going to change carriers to save a few bucks a month because of those significantly higher switching costs. Therefore, they're much more likely to really review what a carrier like T-Mobile has to offer before signing a contract. They want a carrier that can live up to their needs, and if it can save the business a few bucks a month, that's good too. That's why Sievert sees T-Mobile's growing share of the enterprise market as a good sign more consumer customers are still to come. One of the big reasons T-Mobile is starting to attract more enterprise customers is because it only recently completed the rollout of its nationwide network. The network now covers 321 million people, and it boasts average speeds faster than AT&T and Verizon. That kind of coverage is great for businesses because they don't need to worry about network availability in their offices all over the country. Additionally, employees that travel to worksites or customer offices shouldn't have any problems staying connected either. From a retail perspective, there's a bit more work for T-Mobile. To that end, T-Mobile expects to open nearly 1,500 new retail locations this year. It had already completed 1,000 new stores by midyear, but the pace has slowed considerably. With nationwide marketing campaigns, T-Mobile's new retail locations should scale relatively quickly, but there's still work to do with educating consumers in new markets about T-Mobile's presence and network availability. Businesses signing onto T-Mobile is a sign that the network strength and value is there, and it's just a matter of getting customers in the doors in new markets. Enterprise customers are big wins. Business contracts include thousands of new customers that are less likely to change carriers in the near future. What's more, it establishes a customer base in some of T-Mobile's relatively new markets, and those customers can spread the word about T-Mobile's service. As more customers come on board, it seems likely T-Mobile will be able to attract more retail customers as well. As such, it won't have to make as many promotional offers and it can increase its scale, allowing it to establish significantly greater cash flow. And with plans to grow cash flow nearly 50% per year over the next couple years and a new buyback program in place, the ability to more easily attract retail customers is paramount. ","

Kline,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Sometimes it's possible to find value where it appears there isn't any. Maybe that old, scruffy jacket just needs a cleaning. Or an old car buried under a layer of rust is actually a classic waiting to be restored. In those cases, you need to have the vision to see something desirable when the outer appearance screams something else entirely. Those types of situations are common on the stock market, too: a beaten-down company can be a hidden gem about to turn a corner. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) isn't one of those stories. It's a company that's losing money as its customer base shrinks, and has cut its dividend and conducted a reverse split of its stock. There are signs that the company has started to trim its losses, but that will only slow down the inevitable. Cord cutting has accelerated, which has not been good for Frontier. Image source: Getty Images. When Frontier bought Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) in April 2016, the deal made sense. The company was spending $10.54 billion for approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million cable subscribers. That huge expenditure would, in theory, give the company the scale and synergy it needed to compete with larger players. What Frontier didn't count on was that the market was changing. Cord-cutting sped up, and companies offering internet delivered via telephone-based technology saw their subscriber bases drop at the same time. That was a double punch to Frontier, which caused it to lose subscribers and money in each quarter since the Verizon deal closed. *There was one-time impairment charge in Q2 2017. Frontier CEO Daniel McCarthy has done a good job managing the company's finances and did trim Frontier's losses in Q3, both in terms of customers and on a dollar basis. ""Our third quarter results highlight the ongoing stabilization across our business as we focus on executing our strategy,"" said McCarthy in the Q3 earnings release. ""During the quarter, we were pleased with the continued improvement in subscriber trends and churn in our California, Texas and Florida (CTF) markets, ongoing stabilization in our commercial business, and continued operating efficiencies."" These numbers are better, but they're still moving in the wrong direction. It's also worth noting that cord-cutting slowed across the entire industry in Q3, with Frontier's losses being proportional to those of its rivals. Frontier has cut over $1 billion in operating expenses, with plans to save another $350 million more. That's good news, but it does not change the overall long-term prospects for the company. The best-case scenario for Frontier is that it manages to cost-cut its way to breakeven. That's unlikely, but even if it happens, just holding on is not the same as succeeding. Industry trends are working against Frontier. Verizon likely sold these properties because it saw that telco-based cable and internet companies would be hurt by cord cutting without being able to make up the losses on the broadband side. Frontier's stock price is low because the company has little value. It's a wounded animal slowly bleeding to death. It might hold on for a long time, and there's always the chance it gets acquired -- but the company has a failing business model that's unlikely to be fixed. ","

"Timothy Green, Leo Sun, and Steve Symington",12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Many tech stocks don't pay dividends. But that doesn't mean the sector is void of top-notch dividend stocks. We asked three of our Foolish investors to pick a high-yield tech stock worthy of your investment dollars. Here's why they chose International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). Image source: Getty Images. Leo Sun (IBM): IBM has posted annual revenue declines for 22 straight quarters, as its higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" (cloud, mobile, social, security, and analytics) failed to offset the ongoing declines at its older business hardware, software, and IT segments. IBM's turnaround has been so sluggish that even Warren Buffett, renowned for his patience, sold off billions of dollars in shares over the past year. However, IBM is also approaching an inflection point. Big Blue's 0.4% sales decline last quarter was much shallower than its dips in previous quarters, and there's hope that it can finally report positive growth in the near future. Last quarter, IBM's strategic imperative revenue over the past 12 months rose 10% annually, accounting for 45% of its total revenue. That's up from 40% in the prior-year quarter. IBM is also investing in next-gen technologies -- like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing -- which should keep its technology relevant for decades to come. Analysts expect IBM's revenue to fall 2% this year, and for its earnings to rise about 2%. That stable earnings growth -- aided by cost-cutting measures and its ongoing shift toward higher-margin cloud services -- is good news for its forward dividend yield of 3.9%. That dividend, which has been raised annually for 22 straight years, is supported by a low payout ratio of 49%. IBM's stock is also inexpensive at 11 times next year's earnings. IBM remains a cheap income play as the company approaches a potential turnaround. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): After two years of slumping revenue, driven in part by the shift to subscriptions and recurring revenue, networking hardware giant Cisco expects to return to revenue growth next quarter. The stock currently sits right around its 10-year high thanks to this news, but dividend investors shouldn't be scared away. Cisco stock currently yields about 3%. The company has only been paying a dividend since 2011, but it's quickly become one of the best tech dividend stocks. The latest dividend increase came in February, when Cisco boosted the quarterly payout by about 10%. Only 45% of Cisco's free cash flow went toward the dividend in fiscal 2017, leaving some room for further dividend growth even if earnings growth is sluggish. Dividend growth could ramp up even faster if a tax reform bill is passed this year. Cisco has tens of billions of dollars in cash sitting overseas, and it plans to accelerate its share buyback program if it can tap that cash at a reduced rate. That will reduce the share count, allowing for a larger per-share dividend increase. Cisco's revenue and earnings growth probably won't light the world on fire. But a 3% yield and room for dividend growth should have dividend investors interested in this stock. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): Verizon stock has returned a modest 4.6% so far in 2017, lagging the S&P 500's 21% gain. But that's largely because shares of the telecommunications giant are still recovering from its first-ever reported decline in postpaid wireless customers amid intensifying competition earlier this year. Largely thanks to its popular new Verizon Unlimited plan, however, the wireless side of the business has been moving in the right direction since then, including the addition of 603,000 retail postpaid connections last quarter alone. And those customers are exceedingly loyal, with retail postpaid churn during the quarter of just 0.75%. In the end, with shares only recently having broken into positive territory for the year, I think now is great time for opportunistic investors to buy Verizon stock and reinvest its healthy 4.4% dividend.

    3 High-Yield Tech Stocks -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP, Sean O'Reilly, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Matt Frankel (Iron Mountain): Iron Mountain is a real estate investment trust whose primary business is secure document storage. This 6.1% yielder makes about three-fourths of its money from its records and information management business, which it conducts in more than 1,400 facilities around the world. Image source: Getty Images. In addition, Iron Mountain has quietly been getting into the data center business, which could be an excellent long-term growth opportunity. The need for data storage has been growing rapidly and showing no signs of slowing down, and Iron Mountain has the ability to leverage its trusted brand name. Data centers make up a small portion of the company's revenue today, but Iron Mountain plans to grow this area of its business over the coming years. Just recently, Iron Mountain said it would buy IO Data Centers for $1.315 billion, which the company intends to finance with a combination of debt and equity. The market didn't seem to like the news very much, and the stock dropped, which could create an excellent opportunity for long-term investors to get in. Sean O'Reilly (Verizon Communications): ExxonMobil is the quintessential dividend stock. With a long and storied history that stretches back across nearly a century. To trump ExxonMobil's merits as a dividend stock, not only will its 3.7% dividend yield need to be surpassed, but it needs to offer both growth and stability. My nomination for such a dividend stock is none other than Verizon Communications. Verizon is the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. Its wireless division alone generated over $21 billion in the third quarter. True, the division is suffering amid fierce competition from competitors like T-Mobile. And this is what leads us to Verizon's plans for the future. The company still generates lots of cash -- over $17 billion so far this year. It is using this money to invest in becoming a 21st-century media and distribution powerhouse. For example, Verizon just closed a deal to pay the NFL $1.5 billion over the next five years to stream live football games to its subscribers. Naturally, Verizon will be inserting ads during the games. The move is being made to bolster its content-credentials and build up its AOL and Yahoo! sports hub properties. Its cost-cutting initiatives solidify Yahoo!'s chops as a dividend stock. Over the next four years, management has a stated goal of cutting costs by a total of $10 billion. With a juicy 5% dividend, status as the No. 1 mobile carrier in the U.S., and increasingly savvy investments in content, Verizon is a dividend stock that safely pays investors a higher yield than ExxonMobil. Reuben Gregg Brewer (Royal Dutch Shell, plc): Shares of Shell are up 12% this year, while Exxon's are down 8%. And still Shell provides a better yield, currently around 5.75%. That's lower than it was before, but there's good reasons for that...and for income-minded investors to still be interested, here. There have been two notable negatives at Shell in recent years: high levels of debt and poorly executed energy projects. On the debt front, the integrated oil major increased its long-term debt load by 50% in 2016 to fund a major acquisition. It was an aggressive move consummated when oil prices were still relatively weak. However, since that point, Shell has inked deals to sell off nearly $30 billion of non-core assets. Long-term debt, meanwhile, is down around 8% since peaking in late 2016. I don't believe there's a material reason to worry about debt at this point, particularly since oil prices are now more supportive, and Shell recently ended its cash-saving scrip dividend program. As far as execution goes, Shell is turning a corner here, too. Return on invested capital has risen since a nadir in late 2016. Notably, it has begun to close the gap that existed between its performance and Exxon, a perennial leader on this metric. Shell believes that, as it reshapes its business, it can get that metric up to around 10% -- more than twice its current level. So there's reason to be optimistic here, too. I wouldn't call Shell cheap today, but if you are an income investor, it's still a fair price for good company with a hefty dividend yield. ","
      
    3 Dividend Stocks That Pay You Better Than ExxonMobil Does -- The Motley Fool

Brian Feroldi,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Income investors naturally gravitate toward dividend stocks with high yields. However, just because a stock offers a big payout doesn't automatically make it a smart buy. In fact, more often than not, a high yield can actually serve as a warning sign. So are there any high yield stocks that are worth buying today? To answer that question, let's put the 10 highest-yielding stocks today in the S&P 500 to the test. Company Ticker Dividend Yield Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) 26.2% CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) 15.3% Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) 6.4% Macy's (NYSE:M) 5.9% SCANA Corp. (NYSE:SCG) 5.5% AT&T (NYSE: T) 5.4% Navient Corp. (NASDAQ:NAVI) 5% Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP) 4.9% Ford (NYSE:F) 4.8% Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) 4.7% Data source: Finviz, as of December 8, 2017. This list excludes REITs and MLPs. The first metric that I look at when I'm judging a dividend stock is the company's payout ratio. This is calculated by dividing the company's last four quarters of net income by its dividend payment. While this metric has its flaws, it does give investors a quick way to gauge whether or not a company can afford its dividend. Image source: Getty Images. As a general rule, I get nervous when I see this ratio exceed 80%. Anything over 100% is even more dubious, because it means the company is paying out more in dividends than it is earning. That's not sustainable for long. Here's how these 10 companies stack up on payout ratio: Company Payout Ratio Frontier Communications N/A CenturyLink 372% Seagate Technology 95% Macy's 67% SCANA Corp. 77% AT&T 94% Navigant Corp. 35% Helmerich & Payne N/A Ford 55% Verizon Communications 59% Table source: Yahoo! Finance. N/M = not available; these companies reported losses over the past 12 months. Right off the bat, we can eliminate several companies from contention as potential portfolio additions. Frontier Communication and Helmerich & Payne are currently losing money, which I find troubling. CenturyLink's payout ratio of 372% is also highly suspect. I think the smart move is to pass on these stocks. AT&T and Seagate Technology sport payout ratios above 90%. That tells me that they are likely safe for now, but if the companies hit a rough patch, those dividends could be on the chopping block. However, given that they exceed my 80% threshold, I would exclude them from further consideration. How can we quickly get a sense of a company's growth potential? One method is to look at its historic rate of growth, and its projected growth rate over the next five years. Here's a look at how the five remaining companies compare: Company Past 5 Years' Earnings Growth (Annualized) Next 5 Years' Earnings Growth, Estimated (Annualized) Macy's (14.7%) 18.6% SCANA Corp. 4.3% 5.5% Navient Corp. (3.5%) (3.8%) Ford 4.8% (8.3%) Verizon Communications 10.7% 1.3% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Once again, a simple test helps us to refine our list even further. Navient's net income has been under pressure over the last few years, which isn't a good sign. What's more, profits are expected to continue declining over the next five years, which could be related to an ongoing lawsuit that accuses it of predatory lending practices. That provides me with enough reason to steer clear. Turning to Ford, the company's earnings growth over the last few years has been decent, but nothing spectacular. However, analysts are expecting profits to head downhill over the next few years, based on the widespread opinion that we have passed peak auto sales. Factor in the period of disruption the auto industry is heading into right now, and I think the stock is also worth avoiding. Image source: Ford. Verizon Communications is a tougher call. Its payout ratio is low, and it has grown profits at a healthy pace recently. However, market watchers expect Verizon's net income growth to be anemic over the next few years, which makes sense given that T-Mobile continues to woo away its customers. While I don't think this is a bad investment, I'd rather skip Verizon in favor of something that promises faster growth. That brings us to SCANA. This utility offers a strong yield, modest payout ratio, and mid-single-digit growth potential. The fly in the ointment here is that is the company is involved in a messy situation because it recently decided to abandon construction of two extremely costly nuclear reactors. The fallout from that decision forced the company to promise rate reductions to customers, and led to the departure of its CEO and COO. Given the complexities, I think it makes sense to take a pass on SCANA. That leaves us with Macy's, which might give some investors pause since its profits have dropped considerably over the last few years. The wave of store closures and falling comps it has endured isn't surprising given the current state of retail. However, there are a few positive signs right now that the department store chain could be turning the ship around. First, the company is investing heavily in its e-commerce channel. Second, Macy's is rolling out a new loyalty program that could increase customer visits. Third, it owns a lot of valuable property that the market isn't fully valuing. Finally, the carnage in the retail sector could allow the company to capture market share in the long run once the current wave of bankruptcies subsides. Add it all up, and Wall Street believes that Macy's profits will grow in excess of 18% annually over the next few years. Throw in a sustainable dividend yield of 5.9% and you can see why Macy's is the only stock on this list that I think is worth considering. ","

Sprint (NYSE:S) missed out on its opportunity to merge with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and now it's left fighting for itself. That means investing in its network infrastructure. But as CFO Tarek Robbiati noted at a recent investor conference, ""When you invest more money you are having to recoup that investment."" That means price increases. Sprint has already taken a small step toward increasing its pricing. It went from offering five lines of unlimited data for $90 per month to five lines for $100 per month. But Robbiati noted there will be more price increases in due course. That's great news for the rest of the industry. Sprint has continually put pressure on other carrier's service prices. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have seen their service revenues decline over the last couple of years. But the ease in competitiveness could allow those numbers to rise once again. Image source: Sprint. Sprint consistently ranks at the bottom of the competition in terms of network quality. It has the spectrum licenses to build out a better network, but it has limited capital to deploy it. Management has taken to fiscal gymnastics to increase its cash balance, such as selling some of its assets to a sister company and leasing them back. Raising prices is its only option if it wants to remain even modestly competitive. Price is, by far, Sprint's biggest differentiating factor, which is why Robbiati says, ""We will always want to be the price leader."" If it wasn't, it would lose a ton of customers to any of its competitors offering a better deal on a better network. Fewer customers spending more per month may cause some short-term pain. But it's the only option Sprint has to ensure long-term survival without a merger or acquisition. The biggest winners when Sprint decides to raise its prices are its competitors. Sprint has been one of the biggest catalysts for the intense competitive pressure in the industry. Offering competitive price promotions, including low-priced unlimited mobile data service and lower device prices, forced the hands of AT&T and Verizon to offer similar services and promotions, or risk losing more subscribers. Sprint's decision to increase prices means it will be able to increase its average revenue per user. But the decision also means competitors will be able to attract customers with fewer price promotions, and could potentially increase prices themselves. Just as important, Sprint's competitors could see lower subscriber churn, or higher gross additions, as fewer customers flock to Sprint, naturally leading to higher service revenue. Price increases likely mean Sprint will acquire fewer customers going forward. That means more left over for T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T. T-Mobile has already noted it's seen a better ratio of customers switching from Sprint (and everyone else) this quarter than last. Verizon's streak of positive postpaid phone subscriber net additions ought to continue after several disappointing quarters. And AT&T might start to turn things around, as well. Sprint already has fallen to the fourth-place carrier in the United States, and its network isn't improving, either. Management needs to find a better way to differentiate itself other than price because consumers are clearly opting to pay a little bit more for better coverage. Sprint has boatloads of wireless spectrum currently sitting on the sidelines because it doesn't have the capital to deploy it. Most of its unused spectrum is high-band, which requires a more dense network, making it more capital intensive to deploy. The upside is a much stronger and faster network once it's deployed. T-Mobile just went through the process of deploying relatively high-band spectrum, and now has one of the best networks in the country. If Sprint can survive a few years of capital-intensive spending while customers continue to leave, it could put itself in a much stronger position next decade. There's a lot of risk, however, that it might not be able to complete its network upgrades without the benefit of a merger or acquisition. ","

A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: Verizon is renewing its contract with the NFL to live-stream games to its subscribers. Verizon had paid $1 billion over the past four years, and now over the next five years, Jason, they're paying $2 billion. On a percentage basis, that's quite a leap. Jason Moser: That is a leap. When you look, it's a big deal. I think that number begs the question, are they paying too much? And I tend to think that yes, they are, for a few different reasons. No. 1, this isn't an exclusive deal. I think it's going to span carriers. And I do understand that, because this is less about Verizon, per say, and more about the properties that they own in Yahoo and AOL and what not. So, I understand, at least, having that sort of span carriers. But I think you have to look a little further out and think about the NFL and the pressures that we're seeing the league facing right now. It's not to say that the NFL is going away. But in line with the Disney discussion we were having regarding the sporting properties they're getting there, I think the NFL is hitting a point where I don't know that they can continue to command the same type of pricing power in the years to come. When we look at the nature of the sport, the injuries that are taking place, there are a lot of people that have a lot of problems with what's going on right now. And we have to think about the future of the game and how many people are really saying, ""I don't want my kids to be a part of something like that."" That doesn't matter now, but it's going to matter 20 years from now, unless they get their act together. Verizon, they're really good at delivering that information and data to us, providing the content a little bit of a different story. I'm not sure this is really a deal that's going to make a whole heck of a lot of sense for them four or five years down the road. Again, I think we're probably hitting the point where the NFL is particular has hit that point where they can't command much more in the way of pricing. ","

Apple doesn't release unit volumes for the Apple Watch, but estimates are that around 15 million watches have been sold in the last year, and the company is already among the biggest watchmakers in the world by revenue. What makes Apple so intriguing in wearables is that the watch is just the beginning. AirPods can be tied directly into a cellular-connected Series 3 Apple Watch, allowing the user to remain in touch with the world without carrying a smartphone. A product like AirPods may not seem like a wearable, but as a user I find myself wearing them most of the workday, just to have quick access to phone calls, podcasts, or music I'm listening to. In that sense, the combination of Apple Watch and AirPods has become indispensable. We don't know what wearable devices Apple is working on, but I wouldn't be surprised to see the platform expand. Glasses with augmented reality or a full virtual reality headset could be on the horizon, given the technology Apple has already released. What's clear is that Apple's effort to dominate wearables is far from over. Apple is the wearable company with a wide reach, but Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) is a wearable company with more niche applications. Its watches are standard for athletes who run, bike, swim, and do triathlons. Marine, outdoor recreation, and even cameras are also markets that Garmin targets in wearable devices. What's nice about Garmin's wearable business is there are distinct use cases for its products. As an example, doing a triathlon with an Apple Watch is possible, but a Garmin Fenix watch is specifically built for triathlons and is durable and has enough battery life to last for a long race. Owning those niches will give Garmin a valuable position in the wearable market. My surprise wearable pick isn't a wearable company at all (at least not directly). Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is the wireless company that will connect millions of wearables to the world over the next decade. Today, watches from Apple and Samsung are leading the charge to connect watches to wireless networks, but that could be just the beginning. In the future, augmented or virtual reality glasses could stream data directly from 5G wireless networks. We could be wearing medical devices that provide real-time medical data to service providers. Image source: Verizon. It's not really clear what next-generation wearable devices will be released over the next few years, but I think it's becoming obvious that fast wireless networks will be an enabler of new technology. Verizon is a leader in the industry and its investment in 5G networks will help drive wearables to a new level. That's why this is a great investment in the future of wearables. Wearable technology isn't yet as commonplace as a laptop or smartphone, but the segment is growing quickly as products improve. That presents an incredible opportunity to companies that can build wearable products people want to use. Apple and Garmin have strategies that can win in the market, and Verizon is the platform millions will use to connect those devices. That's why they're the wearable stocks I would buy today.

    3 Wearables Stocks to Buy for 2018 -- The Motley Fool

  "
Matthew Cochrane,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS) designs analog semiconductors that power wireless connectivity in a number of different devices like smartphones, wearables, and smart-home systems. Given the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smartphone connectivity, this has been a good business to be in the past few years. Shareholders certainly have nothing to complain about this year. Shares are up 28% year to date, easily outpacing the S&P 500's returns by double digits. That being said, shares have dropped by almost 18% since the company reported its fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2017 results in early November. When a company's stock drops precipitously shortly after earnings are reported, it's healthy for investors to ask what caused the tumble. Sometimes it might represent legitimately bad news indicating that an investor's original thesis for investing in a stock is busted. If this is the case, it might be best for even long-term, buy-and-hold investors to sell. However, it can also be a case of a short-term obsessed market losing sight of the big picture. In the case of Skyworks Solutions, I firmly believe it is the case of the latter and that the recent drop represents a buying opportunity. Skyworks Solutions offers growth at a reasonable price, virtues difficult to find in this bull market. Image source: Skyworks Solutions Inc. A close look at Skyworks' quarter doesn't find too much wrong. The company delivered record revenues of $984.6 million, an 18% increase year over year. Net income came in at $281.3 million, a 14% increase year over year. If the numbers were so bad, maybe the company's guidance was bad? Hardly. The company is calling for revenue to be up 15% to $1.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to rise 19% to $1.91 next quarter. Data source: Skyworks Solutions Inc The company's valuation also appears reasonable. Using Skyworks' full fiscal year non-GAAP EPS of $6.45, the stock is selling at a relatively cheap price-to-earnings ratio of 14.9; even using the company's GAAP EPS of $5.41, the P/E ratio is only 17.8. The company's balance sheet is nearly pristine: It ended the year with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and no long-term debt. While Skyworks' balance sheet is clean, the valuation is reasonable, and the company is growing revenue and earnings at solid rates, what really makes the story compelling is Skyworks' positioning in two major macro trends. Skyworks Solutions is poised to capitalize on the growth of the Internet of Things and the massive 5G wireless network upgrade in the coming years. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. Lest there be any doubt, 5G wireless networks are coming. In late November, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) announced it would be rolling out the next generation in wireless networks in three to five domestic markets next year, beginning with Sacramento, California. The benefits of 5G networks will be incredible. During the company's fourth-quarter conference call, CEO Liam Griffin said 5G networks would provide a ""significant boost in speed"" and that 5G could be up to 100 times faster than 4G networks. Why does this matter to Skyworks investors? Because the chips Skyworks makes for 5G connectivity cost more and are more profitable than the chips for lesser network speeds. In the conference call, transcribed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Griffin said: ""In order to make the leap to 5G, system architectures will require significantly more powerful connectivity engines to ensure the intense performance challenges are realized. This upgrade wave will create an enormous growth catalyst for the entire smartphone ecosystem. ""And as a leader in unwiring the planet, Skyworks is well positioned to capitalize. With extensive technology breadth and depth, strategic partnerships with all leading smartphone and IoT customers, differentiated system solutions enabling unmatched levels of integration and performance, all underpinned by our aggressive investments over the past 2 decades to expand our product portfolio, IP and scale. As a result, we have the profitability, cash flow and balance sheet to extend our leadership position. Our strategic R&D and CapEx investments will be pivotal as the scale and technology requirements around 5G intensify."" There are more connected devices than ever before. Everything from cars and watches to refrigerators and thermostats can be connected these days. Studies back up this observation. Research firm IDC believes total worldwide spending on IoT will increase from $800 billion this year to almost $1.4 trillion in 2021. Business Insider believes there will be 24 billion connected devices by 2020. On the conference call, Griffin said this number could be as high as 75 billion devices by 2025. He also said mobile data usage is expected to increase five times by 2021. Few companies are better situated to capitalize on this undeniable trend than Skyworks. As Griffin pointed out, "" ... by definition, these applications would not be possible without fast, secure, power-efficient connectivity solutions provided by Skyworks."" Later he added that there's going to be a ""massive upgrade cycle in the IoT space as well"" with the onset of 5G. In the short term, the company continues to trade on Apple rumors and speculation, because the smartphone maker is such a huge customer of Skyworks' products. For instance, when news leaks that an Apple supplier factory manager's nephew's former college roommate said they heard that the iPhone X wasn't going to be as big of a supercycle as previously thought, Skyworks shares will often dip that day. But, in the long term, investors need to realize that Skyworks Solutions is going for a reasonable valuation while poised to capitalize on some of the greatest industrial trends in the world today. In today's market, that is about as a good of an investment as you're going to find. ","
      
    Time to Get Greedy With Skyworks Solutions Inc's Stock -- The Motley Fool

  "
Jeff Reeves,12212017,MarketWatch,12142017,"Published: Dec 15, 2017 12:08 p.m. ET Two FAANG stocks figure on Jeff Reeves’ list By The repeal of net neutrality rules was met with outrage and disappointment by many. Those widely considered to be the founding fathers of the modern web say the Federal Communications Commission doesn’t understand the internet. And dissenting democrats like FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn called the ruling a “fiercely spun, legally lightweight, consumer-harming, corporate-enabling Destroying Internet Freedom Order.” But it wasn’t all gnashing of teeth. Anti-regulation Republicans claimed a victory for freedom. And a number of companies, optimistic over that newfound freedom to focus on profits, saw their share prices rise steadily on an otherwise down day for the S&P 500

Instead, I’d like to explore which stocks stand to win or lose from the potentially game-changing ruling that will affect communications and tech companies in the months to come. Here are three big winners and three big losers under the recent net neutrality repeal. Winner — Verizon Verizon

                                   is the largest wireless carrier in the U.S., so it has the most to gain from the idea of “freedom” to runs its networks as it pleases. The company’s so-called “unlimited” plans were already throttling playback quality for many customers, and now it quite literally has nothing to stop it from similar tactics in the future. Read: Why the end of net neutrality isn’t the end of the internet Furthermore, there will be less pressure to keep spending some $15 billion annually on capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain its network. The ability to prioritize data usage and use its existing network better means more cash for things like dividends or buying back shares instead. As the largest wireless-mobile network, any throttling efforts that reduce data usage by even a small amount per customer will add up in a very big way. And if people want faster speeds, of course, Verizon will certainly allow them to pay for that privilege. The icing on the cake is content tie-ins with its Oath brand that contains AOL, the Huffington Post and Yahoo! If ISPs can give certain domains preference over others, it’s pretty obvious which sites Verizon is going to bias toward. Winner — Amazon.com Amazon

                                   CEO Jeff Bezos and other execs have publicly expressed displeasure with the FCC ruling. But, on balance, the end of net neutrality is almost clearly a net positive for the company. For starters, competition for services will more than likely be on the decline, thanks to the notion of “paid prioritization.” Without net neutrality protections, data-rich service providers end up paying higher rates to telecoms to guarantee their content gets there in the way they want. Some companies will pass on this added cost to end users, and others won’t even bother to compete in these “fast lanes” as a result. But Amazon has a long history of putting scale before profits with rock-bottom pricing, so you can expect it to be the discount leader in how it operates as a consumer-facing internet company with its e-commerce operations, its Prime video and just about everything else it offers. Furthermore, the end of net neutrality likely means web hosts may see fees rise, particularly for data-heavy destinations they maintain. Again, Bezos will happily let his Amazon Web Services arm shoulder that cost as it continues to help businesses with storage and content delivery. That’s something Amazon shareholders can deal with in the short term as it waits out the competitors. Silicon Valley, in general, may see a lot of increased costs, but Amazon’s stock thrives in a low-margin world. While startups face higher barriers to entry and more uncertainty, Amazon.com stock has a clear vision and Wall Street’s trust that it will come out ahead. Winner — Citrix Systems Citrix

                                   is an enterprise-tech company with its fingers in many of the pies that are so appetizing to investors these days, including cloud computing and cybersecurity. But of particular note is that roughly a third of the company’s revenue comes from its network-delivery division that includes its NetScaler product. This technology balances the load of data on a company’s site and makes it easier for companies to use their existing servers and work more efficiently, rather than simply paying for more capacity. Read: Why you should care that the FCC has put an end to net neutrality While this is currently a corporate IT offering, the general concept is perfect for an age when data is at a premium for all parties. You can be sure that every e-commerce site or media company is going to think very seriously about their outward-facing metrics as much as internal efficiencies. Page-load times and the “weight” of a site could make it much more difficult to reach customers or operate a business profitably. Who better to help companies navigate this dynamic than an established tech-services company that already offers a robust menu of valuable enterprise tech products? Loser — Netflix Netflix

                                   is one of the obvious losers in the recent vote, but not simply because of the risk of internet service providers (ISPs) throttling streaming video in this new world. Sure, the risk of constant buffering and perpetually unreliable streams are an existential crisis for Netflix’s stock. But the vote couldn’t have come at a worse time than now. The stock is down about 8% from its October highs and struggling mightily to build on past gains. And while investors have had concerns lately about its international growth, it’s important to remember that nearly every penny of profit comes from its domestic business that has seen flat-lining user growth. Thinner margins there would be a most unwelcome development. Adding fuel to the fire is a real fear of competition as media giant Walt Disney

                                   has consumers abuzz with anticipation over its own over-the-top streaming service that will be a direct competitor in many ways. As a diversified media company with deep pockets, Netflix can’t afford to let consumers or investors down in 2018. Sure, Netflix is always the fashionable pick for a victim of net neutrality. But if you recall all those articles about how the service represented over a third of internet traffic back in 2015, it’s easy to understand why. Loser — Frontier Communications If you want a more obvious victim of the FCC ruing than Netflix, it may be Frontier Communications

                                   This is a company that dropped by roughly 10% on the day of the ruling, proof positive that Wall Street is turning negative. And that’s saying something, considering that Frontier is down roughly 85% in the last 12 months already. Of course, there are good reasons for the downside move. Because while the GOP stance continues to be that fewer rules mean more “freedom,” the bottom line is that smaller internet service providers like Frontier simply won’t be able to operate competitively against the ISPs with deep pockets. After all, Verizon and Comcast

                                   can offer slow internet connectivity much cheaper, and premium internet much faster and reliably. Where does that leave the little guy like Frontier? This is a company that already has been chronically unprofitable, just split 1-for-15 after its share price crashed and burned, and is all but certain to eliminate its dividend in the near future. There were already a lot of reasons to be skeptical of Frontier. But now, there’s good reason to be terrified of this stock.

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors saddled in 2017 with the market’s worst performers, including Under Armour and General Electric, may do well to remember as December draws to an end that lumps of coal sometimes turn into diamonds. As investment advisors rebalance clients’ portfolios in the final weeks of the year, the instinct to dump stocks that have been left behind in surging markets - or that fall out of favor with analysts - can be self-destructive. With the S&P 500’s rally pushing price/earnings multiples to highs not seen since 2002, laggards overlooked by a rush to own technology and other high-growth stocks may attract bargain-hunting investors heading into 2017. “A contrarian strategy of buying beaten-up names might have a good year,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Kroger has lost 20 percent year to date and it recently traded at 14 times expected earnings, compared to its five-year average of 27. “Grocery is local; it’s not an internet play. And Kroger has the footprint to not even notice that Amazon is around,” Dollarhide said. Underscoring the fallibility of analysts, four of the 10 S&P 500 worst-rated stocks at the end of last year are on track to finish 2017 with annual increases above the index’s 20-perent gain. 2017's diamonds and lumps of coal: tmsnrt.rs/2BhvwkC ","

Among those recommended in their recent cover story are these twelve, with their dividend yields and year-to-date total returns (price appreciation plus dividends): Total return data is through December 14. Barron's story was published on December 16. Barron's top choice for income-oriented investors in 2018 is master limited partnerships (MLPs) related to energy distribution in the U.S., with Enterprise Products Partners as among Barron's top 10 stock picks overall for 2018. Cash flow for the industry is projected to grow in the mid single digits in 2018, and MLP shares look to be trading below historical levels, per Barron's. As oil output rises in the U.S., pipeline MLPs will benefit. (For more, see also: 10 Stocks With 'Significant Upside' in an Overpriced Market.) European companies prefer paying dividends to share repurchases, making this Barron's second most-favored group. Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, trades at a forward P/E of only eight, per Barron's, and shareholders may benefit from a planned spinoff of its truck-making unit. Both Verizon and AT&T trade at forward P/E ratios of around 13, below the overall value of 20 for the telecom sector, Barron's says, adding that Verizon should benefit from an easing of price wars in the wireless market. REITs have lagged the market in 2017, with YTD total returns of around 5% versus about 21% for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), per Barron's. The sector has a low multiple versus the S&P 500 and can generate mid- to high-single-digit returns in 2018, Barron's adds. SL Green, however, has a trailing twelve months P/E ratio of 97, per Barron's. On the other hand, this REIT trades at a discount to its private market value, Barron's says. Fitch Ratings recently upgraded SL Green, which invests primarily in Manhattan office buildings, to a positive outlook with a rating of BBB-, per Business Wire. China Mobile is the dominant wireless player in China, and has the strongest balance sheet among global telecom companies, with cash equal to about 30% of its market value, Barron's indicates.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Telecom derives about 40% of its market value from its 64% ownership position in T-Mobile U.S. Inc. (TMUS), which has improving free cash flow, per Barron's. California-based electric utility Edison International has been beaten down recently over concerns about its potential financial liability over recent wildfires in that state.

Trump concluded the tweet saying: ""This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas!""

Six of those companies, including brands such as Walmart, Intel and Union Pacific, said it was too early to tell whether they would be raising wages or offering bonuses because of the new tax plan. Sixteen companies, including Amazon, declined to comment. Below is a table of all the companies CNBC contacted in light of the tax bill clearing Congress.

Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) had a lousy year that was rooted in a decision it made in 2016. In April of last year, the company purchased Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida for $10.54 billion. That gave it approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers. It was a move that CEO Daniel McCarthy celebrated at the time. ""This is a transformative acquisition for Frontier that delivers first-rate assets and important new opportunities given our dramatically expanded scale,"" he said when the deal closed. ""It significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" What McCarthy didn't see is that the industry was changing. Cord cutting was going to shrink the cable business, and consumers were leaving telephone-company-based wireline broadband (what Frontier bought from Verizon) for cable-based service. Frontier has been losing cable customers as well. Image source: Getty Images. On the positive side, Frontier did gain some synergies from the deal. It was able to create over $1 billion in annual savings with a path toward creating around $400 million more. That's the only good news the company has experienced since the deal closed. Frontier has lost subscribers and money in every quarter since the Verizon deal closed. Both did lessen in the most-recent quarter, but the trends are still bleak. *There was one-time impairment charge in Q2 2017. To conserve cash, Frontier cut its dividend as of the first quarter of its fiscal 2017. It slashed the quarterly payout from $0.105 per share, where it had been for over two years, to $0.04 per share. The company also, at roughly the same time, conducted a 15-1 reverse split of its stock. That move was made to keep shares above the $1 threshold required to maintain its listing. McCarthy continues to maintain an optimistic outlook. ""Our third-quarter results highlight the ongoing stabilization across our business as we focus on executing our strategy,"" said McCarthy in the Q3 earnings release. ""During the quarter, we were pleased with the continued improvement in subscriber trends and churn in our California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) markets, ongoing stabilization in our commercial business, and continued operating efficiencies."" That's a rosy way to look at things, but even if the chain can stabilize its losses, there's very little reason to believe it can post gains. A best-case scenario for Frontier is that it finds a way to tread water by breaking even while maintaining its customer count. There's very little upside for shareholders aside from the possibility of a sale. Even that is unlikely -- at least at much of a premium -- because the technological reasons that have hurt Frontier would be a problem for any possible purchaser. ","

Sometimes it's possible to find value where it appears there isn't any. Maybe that old, scruffy jacket just needs a cleaning. Or an old car buried under a layer of rust is actually a classic waiting to be restored. In those cases, you need to have the vision to see something desirable when the outer appearance screams something else entirely. Those types of situations are common on the stock market, too: a beaten-down company can be a hidden gem about to turn a corner. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) isn't one of those stories. It's a company that's losing money as its customer base shrinks, and has cut its dividend and conducted a reverse split of its stock. There are signs that the company has started to trim its losses, but that will only slow down the inevitable. Cord cutting has accelerated, which has not been good for Frontier. Image source: Getty Images. When Frontier bought Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) in April 2016, the deal made sense. The company was spending $10.54 billion for approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million cable subscribers. That huge expenditure would, in theory, give the company the scale and synergy it needed to compete with larger players. What Frontier didn't count on was that the market was changing. Cord-cutting sped up, and companies offering internet delivered via telephone-based technology saw their subscriber bases drop at the same time. That was a double punch to Frontier, which caused it to lose subscribers and money in each quarter since the Verizon deal closed. *There was one-time impairment charge in Q2 2017. Frontier CEO Daniel McCarthy has done a good job managing the company's finances and did trim Frontier's losses in Q3, both in terms of customers and on a dollar basis. ""Our third quarter results highlight the ongoing stabilization across our business as we focus on executing our strategy,"" said McCarthy in the Q3 earnings release. ""During the quarter, we were pleased with the continued improvement in subscriber trends and churn in our California, Texas and Florida (CTF) markets, ongoing stabilization in our commercial business, and continued operating efficiencies."" These numbers are better, but they're still moving in the wrong direction. It's also worth noting that cord-cutting slowed across the entire industry in Q3, with Frontier's losses being proportional to those of its rivals. Frontier has cut over $1 billion in operating expenses, with plans to save another $350 million more. That's good news, but it does not change the overall long-term prospects for the company. The best-case scenario for Frontier is that it manages to cost-cut its way to breakeven. That's unlikely, but even if it happens, just holding on is not the same as succeeding. Industry trends are working against Frontier. Verizon likely sold these properties because it saw that telco-based cable and internet companies would be hurt by cord cutting without being able to make up the losses on the broadband side. Frontier's stock price is low because the company has little value. It's a wounded animal slowly bleeding to death. It might hold on for a long time, and there's always the chance it gets acquired -- but the company has a failing business model that's unlikely to be fixed. ","

"Jamal Carnette, CFA",12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Now that the GOP tax bill is a fait accompli, investors should take stock of the bill's effects on their holdings. To date, many analysts have focused on the bill's repatriation provision, declaring Apple the biggest beneficiary. However, repatriation is a narrow issue that will soon be discounted into stock prices. In the long run, it appears industries currently paying high effective tax rates with significant capital expenditures will benefit most from this bill. The industry that best fits this description is telecommunications: Income-hungry shareholders of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) should be thrilled. Image source: Getty Images. As the chart below shows, Verizon and AT&T pay nearly double the effective tax rate. T Effective Tax Rate (TTM) data by YCharts Unsurprisingly, telecoms will benefit significantly from the lower rate. Earlier this month a report from UBS found telecoms would most likely get a boost of 12% in earnings per share, if the bill lowered the tax rate to 25%; in the end, it was lowered to 21%. According to UBS, telecoms will get the highest boost from the plan, with transportation and retail faring almost as well. In the short run, AT&T and Verizon will also benefit from the bill's capital expenditures provision. For the next five years, companies can immediately expense capex for equipment and other short-lived items. This is a great benefit for AT&T and Verizon, which have spent $22.9 billion and $17.5 billion, respectively, on capital expenditures over the last 12 months: VZ Capital Expenditures (TTM) data by YCharts. While certain expenditures will continue to be capitalized (initially recorded on the balance sheet and expensed over time via depreciation), this should also provide tailwinds to investors by lowering the weighted average cost of capital for projects, making them more profitable. This provision couldn't come at a better time for telecommunication firms. Many are grappling on spending large sums of capex on 5G rollout, while questioning the return on their 4G rollout spend. A potential red flag is the new provision that limits interest deductibility, as both Verizon and AT&T have large piles of debt and required interest payments. The new bill limits the deductibility of net interest expense to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the first four years, and at 30% of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) afterward. The chart below shows net interest income, EBITDA, and EBIT for both companies over the prior year: VZ EBITDA (TTM) data by YCharts. Even with the more-stringent EBIT figure, both look sound in the mid- to high teens. But this provision could limit the ability to borrow in the future, especially if further margin compression happens and interest rates increase. AT&T and Verizon have mostly missed out on the stock run since the election of Trump, but seem to be among the biggest beneficiaries of the policies enacted during his administration. This bill, and the overturn of net neutrality, should allow both firms to continue paying those massive dividends while growing revenue and earnings. ","

Matthew Cochrane,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Corning Inc. (NYSE:GLW) enjoyed quite a year in 2017 and, no, that's not a reference to the stock's 32% gain, a rise that easily outpaced the S&P 500's returns. While it's always nice to see the stocks we hold go up in price, long-term minded investors know that a focus on a company's prospects and fundamentals is far more important to sustained investment success than short term price movements. When investors check under the hood of Corning, there is a lot to like. This year Corning received a $200 million investment from the world's biggest company, signed a $1 billion-plus deal with one of the country's largest wireless networks, and announced the development of a new product that might end up being a $4 billion opportunity in a new market. Each of these announcements underlines a different and promising line of business for the company, illustrating how much Corning has transformed itself since being almost solely a display glass manufacturer, with earnings that were notoriously cyclical and often based on glass prices, a factor outside its control. Let's take a closer look at these growing lines of business to better appreciate the great year Corning just had. Data source: Corning Inc. Third-Quarter 2017 earnings press release Corning's Optical Communications division supplies optical fiber to major telecom companies and internet service providers. In April, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) made a commitment to purchase at least $1.05 billion worth of fiber from Corning, good enough to buy about 20 million kilometers worth over the length of the contract. As one can imagine after seeing the details of a massive deal like this, sales in the division are growing nicely, and increased 15% year over year in the company's third quarter. Corning scientists made the first low-loss optical fiber for commercial use in 1970 and the company produced its billionth kilometer of optical fiber during its third quarter. With that type of experience it's no wonder that, during the company's third-quarter conference call, CEO Wendell Weeks revealed Corning was the world's lowest cost producer of the material. Coupled with its great technical prowess and proprietary know-how in the area, that constitutes an impressive economic moat. Weeks said: ""Our dedicated employees have helped us become the world's largest manufacturer of optical fiber, the world's lowest-cost provider, and the home to some of the most precise manufacturing operations of any kind, anywhere in the world. ... We believe that the opportunities ahead of us are much greater than those that are behind us. To capture these opportunities, we're investing to expand capacity, to innovate and to increase our market access ... These investments are paying off. We are growing at more than twice the rate of the telecommunications industry. ... We're well on our way to more than 15% sales growth for 2017, which keeps us on track to achieve $5 billion in optical sales by 2020."" Corning scientists continue to innovate and test the limits of glass to stay ahead of the competition. Image source: Corning Inc. Last May, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook announced Corning would receive $200 million as the first recipient of the company's Advanced Manufacturing Fund, a fund conceived to spur innovation among American manufacturers. The money was going to Corning's manufacturing facility in Kentucky where it makes Gorilla Glass -- its tough, lightweight, and scratch-resistant glass that has been used to cover more than 5 billion devices from 40 different manufacturers, including every iPhone and iPad ever made. Corning's Specialty Materials division, where Gorilla Glass is accounted for, continues to show strong growth. In the company's third quarter, the segment's sales increased 26% and core earnings increased 61% year over year. While Gorilla Glass 5 (GG5), the fifth generation of Gorilla Glass, is now being used by virtually all major smartphone manufacturers, the company is also finding other uses for Gorilla Glass. Many wearable devices are now using Gorilla Glass SR+, a version specifically built for wearables. In the company's third-quarter conference call, Weeks also said Corning was exploring different uses for Gorilla Glass on 25 different automobile platforms. ""On the exteriors of cars, Gorilla Glass laminates are lighter and tougher than conventional auto glass, plus its superior optical quality allows larger, clearer head-up displays,"" Weeks said. ""For interiors, Gorilla Glass makes cars more connected and durable with sophisticated capabilities you come to expect from your smartphones."" Just before the company released its second-quarter earnings this year, Corning announced a new product, Valor Glass, a ""totally redesigned pharmaceutical package."" The new glass packaging is designed to improve glass lamella, what happens when tiny flakes of glass shed on the inside of the package and contaminate the medicine. The problem is so serious that the FDA has previously released warnings on it. Valor Glass packaging ""dramatically reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput."" The product has already been endorsed by major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). ""We believe that our collaboration with Corning is a game changer,"" Pfizer CEO Ian Read said. ""The glass industry represents about $4 billion in expenditures for the pharmaceutical industry, but subsequent issues, potential shards or breakages require strong quality control to ensure that it doesn't get through to patients."" In other words, Valor Glass is a potential $4 billion opportunity for Corning. Corning's year brought new opportunities and strong growth in the company's core competencies and, best of all, there are no signs these developments are about to slow down. Global demand for optical fiber continues to rise, smartphones and other applications for Gorilla Glass abound, and Valor Glass has yet to make any impact whatsoever to Corning's top and bottom lines. In other words, while 2017 was a year to remember for Corning, 2018 might be even better. ","

Matthew Cochrane,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) likes to say it ""is empowering the wireless networking revolution."" While those are heady words, they might not be far from the truth. The company's innovative analog semiconductors enable devices like smartphones, wearables, and smart-home systems to stay connected. The company stands poised to capitalize on huge trends like the jump to 5G and the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT). In its most recent quarter, the company showed strong annual revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) growth, up 18% and 15%, respectively, and guided for more double-digit percentage growth in the quarter ahead. On the surface, at least, Skyworks Solutions seems to have a lot going for it. It might be odd to think of a stock with a seemingly paltry 1.35% dividend yield as an income play, but there is more to dividend growth stocks than just a cursory glance at their yield. Skyworks Solutions grew its dividend by a healthy 14% this year. While double-digit increases are nothing to sneeze at, this year's growth does not reflect the explosive growth Skyworks' dividend has seen in recent years. Since 2015, it has increased its dividend by a whopping 146%! Let's take a closer look at the company's business prospects and fundamentals to see why I believe income investors should not ignore this reasonably priced and fast-growing dividend stock. SWKS Dividend data by YCharts Skyworks Solutions finds itself perfectly situated to capitalize on two huge coming trends: the explosive growth of the IoT and the massive upgrade to 5G wireless networks. Research firm IDC thinks worldwide spending on the IoT could increase to $1.4 trillion by 2021, up from $800 billion this year. In the Skyworks' fourth-quarter conference call, CEO Liam Griffin said there could be as many as 75 billion connected devices by 2025. These devices will include everything from wearables and smartphones to cars and refrigerators. These applications could not be possible without the type of connectivity solutions Skyworks offers. The Internet of Things might consist of 75 billion devices by 2025. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to IoT, wireless networks will begin to be upgraded to 5G as soon as next year. Last month, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) announced it would be rolling out the next generation in wireless networks in three to five domestic markets in 2018. In the company's fourth-quarter conference call, Griffin said 5G networks could be as much as 100 times faster than existing networks. This matters to Skyworks shareholders, because the solutions it designs for 5G networks are more profitable for the company than the chips it designs for networks of lesser speeds. In other words, as 5G wireless networks come online and the IoT continues to develop, Skyworks Solutions will sell more expensive chips in phones and provide more connectivity solutions to an ever-increasing number of devices. That's not a bad place to be for any company! Skyworks Solutions first caught my eye as an income investment in 2015, when it raised its dividend by 100%. It followed up that massive hike with a modest 8% raise in 2016 and a robust 14% increase this year. In this year's third-quarter conference call, transcribed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, CFO Kris Sennesael noted the company's strong balance sheet and said the goal is to give back about 40% to 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchasing shares: I feel good about the balance sheet. We have $1.4 billion of cash and no debt ... I feel really strong about our ability to generate cash. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow margin is approximately 31% ... [I]n terms of returning cash to the shareholders, our stated goal is that we want to return 40% to 50% of the free cash flow back to shareholders using our dividend program and share buyback program ... We are very active with our share buyback program. Last quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares, $129 million. And we have our dividend program which we announced today, that we increased it by 14%, increasing the dividend from $0.28 per share to $0.32 per share. Even though Skyworks has increased its dividend every year since initiating it in 2014, it still sports a low payout ratio. In its 2017 fiscal year, Skyworks reported $5.41 in EPS (on a GAAP basis), and it's projected to pay out $1.28 in dividends per share this year at the current quarterly rate of $0.32 per quarter. This means its payout ratio is only 24%! That leaves plenty of room for the company to buy back shares, reinvest for growth, and raise the dividend in the future as long as the company does not suffer a sudden and dramatic decrease in earnings. Given its position to benefit from 5G networks and the growth of IoT, such an event seems remote, to say the least. While Skyworks Solutions offers a below-average dividend yield, I believe it will be able to grow its dividend quickly as its earnings increase. Given its low payout ratio, this should not be an issue even in years it misses guidance or shows low growth. The company is still reasonably priced, too: On a GAAP basis, it is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.5, well below the S&P 500's average. On a non-GAAP basis, it's a downright bargain with a P/E of only 14.6. In a bull market getting long in the tooth, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a company showing strong growth, selling at a reasonable price, and featuring a dividend that has lots of room to grow in the years ahead.

But there are indicators from 2017 that point pretty strongly to what we can expect to see in the technology sector next year. While many of us think of technology in a very specific sense of the word (i.e., smartphones, drones, etc.) this tech trends list also includes more complex technology ideas like robotics, laser-transmitted internet, decentralized medical record systems, and other ideas a little bit off the well-worn tech path. If even half of these trends expand beyond where they're at right now, then we're in for a very exciting year. Image source: Getty Images. Blockchains are digital ledgers that can be shared and accessed by anyone to keep track of transactions between two parties. The term received lots of attention in 2017 because the cryptocurrency bitcoin uses one decentralized blockchain to keep track of all of its transactions. But the tech can be used far beyond Bitcoin. Some people want blockchains to be used for things like medical records, where a person's patient data would be stored in a cryptographic database that accepts information from multiple different medical databases and software programs. The benefit here is that a patient's personal medical history could be kept in one safe, decentralized location, and accessible to different doctors' offices and medical centers, without those offices or their software having to coordinate with each other to update the records. Image source: Getty Images. There's a lot of talk about artificial intelligence these days, but the real benefit for companies in 2018 will be the adoption of algorithms and computer intelligence that are good at doing one very specific task, which is commonly referred to as narrow artificial intelligence (AI). Narrow AI differs from general AI (think autonomous robots trying to take over the world) and allows computers to complete specific tasks, like driving a car, very well. Narrow AI is used in everything from language translation apps to content curation in Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Newsfeed, and in 2018, it's likely we'll see more companies use it to make their businesses more efficient and productive. Image source: The Boring Company. At the very end of 2016, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that we was starting a new company that would attempt to help solve the well-known traffic problems in Los Angeles, California. And last year, Musk's new Boring Company drilled a 500-foot long tunnel to test out a new underground system of moving passengers along high-speed tracks. The company could potentially use two types of underground transportation, the first being a track system that could move more than a dozen passengers between cities at up to 150 mph. The other is Musk's Hyperloop concept, which consists of pods that travel in a near-vacuum tube at up to 700 mph. The Boring Company is currently working on a 6.5-mile proof-of-concept tunnel in Los Angeles that, if it gets approval from the city, could eventually turn into an underground tunnel system in California. The company also began digging in Maryland toward the end of 2017 for another test track that could eventually become a underground transportation system between Washington, D.C., and New York City. The test tunnels won't be done in 2018, but we're certain to here much more about them in the coming year. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) began testing wireless 5G broadband in 2017, and in 2018, both companies say they'll launch limited commercial availability for the new service. Unlike 4G and LTE, 5G will mainly be used for home internet connections at first, allowing the telecoms to provide multiple-gigabit speeds via wireless connections to homes. For context, 1 gigabit speeds are 15 times faster than the average home broadband connections in the U.S. Not only are the speeds faster, but 5G offers less congestion for home internet connections as well (think of how slow it gets when you and your neighbors are all streaming movies on the same night) and has lower latency (it can send information very fast) than traditional cable internet connections. Verizon will bring 5G to Sacramento, California, and four other yet-to-be announced markets in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin's massive price gains toward the end of 2017 got the attention of investors and the general public, and we're likely to see more of the same in 2018. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that allows its owners to make purchases safely and anonymously, and as of this writing, the value of one bitcoin has jumped nearly 2,000% in 2017. Bitcoin is now accepted by some retailers, like Home Depot and Overstock.com, and it's likely that more retailers will jump on board next year, particularly if the value continues to rise. But bitcoin is still highly volatile, and its online exchanges (where you buy and sell bitcoin) are often the targets of hackers. All of this means we're probably just as likely to see bitcoin's value slide in 2018 as we are to see its price rise to new heights. Either way, expect to hear much more about the cryptocurrency in 2018. Image source: Apple. In 2017, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made some huge moves to bring augmented reality to its millions of iPhone and iPad users when it released iOS 11 with augmented reality capabilities. The tech giant now allows developers to create their augmented reality (AR) apps, like IKEA's Place app, which allows users to scan rooms in their home and add virtual furniture into it to see what it looks like. Facebook also took steps in 2017 to pave the way for more AR use on its platform next year as well. The company's new AR Studio allows developers to create filters and camera effects (think augmented reality masks for selfies) for its Facebook and Messenger apps, and it has expanded the use of AR filters in its Instragram app. The focus on mobile AR by Apple and Facebook is part of the reason an estimated 1 billion smartphone users are expected to create AR content on their phones next year, according to research from Deloitte. Image source: Waymo. Automakers and tech companies have been testing driverless cars for years, but in 2018, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) self-driving car company, Waymo, will make even more headway. Waymo has been testing its self-driving vehicle fleet in Phoenix, Arizona, for the past few months, but the company said recently that in a few months, it will launch a driverless car service in the city. That means Waymo's vehicles will pick up people on-demand, drop them off at destinations, and drive themselves around town without a human in the driver's seat. That's a big step forward for Waymo, and driverless car tech as a whole, and it means the company is a few years ahead of its competition. Most automakers and tech companies are targeting their self-driving car services for 2021. Image source: Getty Images. In 2017, a group of MIT scientists began work on a new type of solar panel technology called hot solar cells. These cells can be up to two times more efficient at converting sunlight into energy than typical photovoltaic solar panels because they use more advanced materials and have a superior process for capturing light. The hot solar cells essentially funnel light into carbon nanotubes, which then causes them to heat up to about 1,000 degrees Celsius, and then transfer than intense heat back into a focused light toward the solar cells. The process makes the cells much more efficient at turning light into energy than traditional solar panels, and it also offers the ability to siphon off some of the heat to be stored and converted into energy later. The hot solar cell research is still in its infancy, but it could help advance solar panel technology beyond conventional panels in the years to come. Image source: Amazon. Voice-enabled smart speakers like Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo (with its Alexa virtual assistant) have been around since 2014, but at the end of 2017, they started to gain much more traction -- and that's likely to continue into 2018. These speakers can field questions about the weather, order online products, search the web, and even do things like order an Uber or have a pizza delivered. They can also be paired with other smart home products, like a thermostat, so users can control devices around the home using just their voice. The number of Americans who have used these types of devices has spiked nearly 130% from 2016 to 2017, and by 2020, more than half of U.S. households will have at least one smart home speaker, according to Juniper Research. All of which means that it's likely we'll see even more adoption of these voice-enabled smart speakers next year. Image source: Getty Images. Quantum computing is a difficult idea to understand, but the simplest explanation is that it uses the laws of quantum mechanics to allow computers to process information as both 1s and 0s at the same time, whereas conventional computers can only process information as either a 1 or a 0. This allows the computer to figure out multiple outcomes at once, instead of processing answers in a sequence. Because quantum computers can process information in this way, it makes them much more powerful than conventional computers. Google made some big strides in this space at the end of 2017, and it now offers free, open-source quantum computing software to chemists and material scientists. While current quantum computers are still in their early stages, companies believe they could soon be used to figure out the problems of climate change and make new medical discoveries. Google, IBM, Microsoft, and others are already knee-deep into quantum computing, and Google's latest software is compatible with IBM and other companies' quantum computers, which paves the way for more adoption of this tech next year. Image source: Getty Images. For years now, Intuitive Surgical has had a hold on the surgical robotics market. Its da Vinci robot has been in use since 2000, but the company's patents are about to expire, and that's leaving the surgical robotics market wide open for other tech companies and major medical companies to step in. Surgical robots don't perform surgeries on their own, but are instead controlled by surgeons and enable to perform their work more precisely, in some cases. But these robots are also getting smarter. The Economist recently pointed out that Google has teamed up with Johnson & Johnson to release internet-enabled surgical robots, through a joint company called Verb Surgical, that will share data and video with other surgical robots like it, and then use machine learning to improve how surgeries are performed. With more companies jumping into this market, and Google helping to expand how these bots assist surgery, 2018 is sure to bring even more advancements. Image source: EHang. Many companies have been bullish about their ability to launch autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV) in big cities, but a China-based company called EHang is actually making the idea a reality in 2018. The company already has one-person prototype flying taxi right now, and it says it will start mass-producing flying taxis capable of carrying up to two passengers in 2018. The EHang E-184 looks like a large drone with a human-sized cabin on top, and can fly to pre-set destinations at up to 62 miles per hour and for up 25 minutes on its electric batteries. EHang already has a contract to bring the taxis to Dubai in 2018, and it is also in talks with cities across Europe. It's still unclear how common these flying taxis will become, but it looks like 2018 may be the year they actually become a reality. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's X research division is selling some of its high-tech laser beam technology to India's government next year so it can provide high-speed internet to millions of citizens. The devices use what's called ""space optical technology,"" and it consists of boxes that send and receive laser signals to each other to transmit internet signals, instead of using copper wire or fiber optics. The final internet signal is then sent to users via Wi-Fi or cellular signals. Since it uses light to send the signals, and nothing else, it's the ultimate wireless signal. A recent Reuters article said Alphabet will provide 2,000 of space optical boxes spaced about 12 mile apart from each other on rooftops and poles, capable of sending internet signals at 20 gigabits per second. Space optical technology typically suffers from weather-related obstacles (it doesn't like rain or fog), but Alphabet says its technology is already addressing some of these problems. Image source: Getty Images. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the phrase used for devices that have sensors, collect data, and connect to the Internet so the information they produce can be analyzed or used for automation. These devices can be anything from smartwatches like the Apple Watch to industrial machinery that sends a signal to a computer to tell it that a specific part is about to fail. There were 6.4 billion IoT devices used in 2016, and that number will reach 11.2 billion in 2018. As these devices increase and start taking over more industrial and enterprise systems, they need to become more secure and more easily updated. This is why it's likely that we'll see much more IoT platform software and improved security in the coming year. Many of these devices are small and inexpensive, which means cloud-based software and network-based security (directly from the cellular connections themselves) could be the key to a growing IoT market. Research firm Gartner says that starting in 2018, we should see much more higher-volume and lower-cost devices that will be used for everything from connected security systems to smart LED lighting. Image source: Magic Leap. Google debuted its augmented reality glasses, called Google Glass, back in 2012, but the device eventually crashed and burned among public scrutiny (they weirded people out), and after it failed to be useful enough for use by the general public. But Google has since released a newer version of its Glasses for enterprise use, and an augmented reality company it's backing called Magic Leap will launch its own pair of ""mixed reality"" glasses in 2018 as well. Magic Leap's glasses are called Lightwear, and they can be used to browse the internet, make conference calls, or play games. There's no price tag for the glasses yet, and they're intended to be purchased by software developers so that they create content and apps for the glasses. Magic Leap has received $1.9 billion in funding so far, and the debut of the much-anticipated Lightwear glasses is likely the first of many AR glass headlines we'll see in 2018. Of course, there's no way to know which of these tech trends, if any, will truly take off in 2018. But each of the above trends builds on current technological innovations, which means they're already more than just flash-in-the-pan ideas. If I had to bet on a few right now, I'd expect driverless cars, augmented reality, the expansion of IoT, and in-home virtual assistants to gain the most traction in the coming year. Just keep in mind I'm making these predictions sans a crystal ball. ","
      
    15 Tech Trends to Watch in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

  "
Rich Duprey,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The latest financial maneuvers by Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ) are being spun as a way to give the failing retailer some breathing room to get its house in order, but in reality, they indicate just how dire its predicament is. Worse, they could put the retailer's retirees at even greater risk. Sears announced it was taking out additional loans totaling $607 million, with the proceeds being to be used to make a payment towards its pension obligations and for general corporate purposes. It also negotiated an extension to an existing loan that will see its repayment stretched out to next year, and possibly as far as mid-2019. Image source: Getty Images. One analyst wrote, ""Sears appears to be working very hard to prove that the company has the liquidity to pay their vendors,"" which seems to be an exceedingly charitable way of saying the retailer's not generating enough in sales on its own to pay them, so it has to take out loans to do so. That's not an encouraging development. Last quarter, same-store sales plunged by mid-teen rates at Sears and Kmart, an acceleration of the decline it's experienced over the past few years. While it narrowed its losses somewhat during the period, they still exceeded half a billion dollars. The Christmas season is typically the biggest for retailers, and Sears is no exception, but that's all relative, and having to arrange to have sufficient liquidity on hand after the holidays indicates Sears thinks more suppliers will want to break ties with them, as has happened over the past two years. While there's enough room for conjecture on whether taking out new loans to pay the bills is good for Sears or not, the financial gymnastics should have Sears retirees worried. Data source: Sears Holdings quarterly SEC filings. Chart by author. In March 2016, Sears entered into a five-year agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp (PBGC) to protect the retailer's pension plans. In exchange for the PBGC not initiating an involuntary termination of its plans, Sears agreed to have the agency ""ring-fence"" various assets, or place a lien on them, to protect their value. One of those assets was Craftsman tools, and Sears had to get a waiver from the PBGC to allow it to sell the brand to Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) for $900 million. To do so, Sears agreed to use a $250 million payment it will be getting from Stanley three years after the deal closes for its pension contribution that would be counted towards its obligations for 2017, 2018, and 2019, and it would also contribute to the pension the 15-year stream of revenue it negotiated from Stanley. Sears pension plan is massively underfunded by some $1.5 billion as of the end of 2016. The retailer estimated that it would have to make a contribution to the plan of $312 million this year and $297 million next year. While it's uncertain how much of this year's obligation Sears has paid so far, the deal it just made with the PBGC will require it to make a $407 million payment to the pension plan, after which it won't have to make another one for two more years (it will need to make a $37 million payment this month and a $20 million supplemental payment in the second quarter of 2018). Earlier this year, Sears sought to ""de-risk"" its pension plan by transferring $515 million in pension liabilities to MetLife (NYSE:MET) by purchasing an annuity contract. Some 51,000 retirees will receive their full pension benefits from the insurance company rather than from Sears. It did it again in August when it purchased a second annuity contract for $512 million worth of liabilities that will have MetLife paying future benefits for 20,000 retirees. Other companies such as J.C. Penney, Kimberly-Clark, General Motors, and Verizon have made similar de-risking moves. While this relieves Sears of the obligations for the pension, improving its financial condition since pension contributions consume a large percentage of Sears available cash -- it has made $4.5 billion in pension contributions since merging Sears and Kmart -- it's not necessarily in the best interest of retirees since the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) no longer governs the benefit, and the PBGC no longer ensures it. Instead, various state agencies now oversee it. There is a good argument to be made that retirees who were switched over to MetLife are better off than those remaining at Sears since the insurer is a far healthier institution than is the retailer. Yet Sears is still effectively kicking its remaining pension plan can down the road for several years, during which time it will be selling off or further leveraging properties that are the assets financing the pension plan. Although it has, indeed, given itself some breathing room, all of those problems will come back with a vengeance when the time clock expires. Because its business is not improving but rather deteriorating more rapidly, assuming Sears is even around in two years, it will have to resort to further financial gymnastics to put out the new brush fires that will flare up. The retailer is taking out ever more loans to juggle its payments, but the fuse on its pension obligations is still burning as Sears runs out of both customers and cash. What Lampert has chosen to do is leverage the company with debt to buy it time, but at some point, the weight will become too heavy. When it collapses, it will be the retirees who are standing in the rubble. Rich has been a Fool since 1998 and writing for the site since 2004.

                                    are using Facebook ads to deter older workers from applying, according to a ProPublica and New York Times investigation. The ads reportedly target millennials specifically. In a statement, Rob Goldman, a Facebook vice president, said age-based targeting for employment purposes is an accepted practice, because if “used responsibly,” it helps employers recruit and find people of all ages. Other tech companies, like Google and LinkedIn, also allowed age-targeted job ads, ProPublica found.

Age discrimination can be hard to prove on the job, but during the hiring process, it’s even more difficult — the line isn’t as visible under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Employers can easily say they decided to go another way, or simply not reach out after receiving an application or resume, and there’s little evidence to show that it was because of a person’s age or graduation year. Why the disinterest? There are misconceptions about older workers, such as they will soon experience cognitive decline, which would affect their work, they are only looking for something temporary to fill their time until retirement, or they’re bad with technology, said Julie Ragatz, director of the Center for Ethics in Financial Services and assistant professor at the American College. See:  What to do if you’re an older worker offered a buyout Just how bad is it for older applicants? Displaced workers who are 50 years or older were unemployed for almost six weeks longer than someone between 30 and 49 years old, and more than 10 weeks longer than people between the ages of 20 and 29, according to a federal displaced worker survey from 2014. In one of the largest resume studies to date, with more than 40,000 resumes sent out to 13,000 job postings for retail, administrative assistant and other jobs in 12 cities, Patrick Button, a professor of Tulane University, and two colleagues found older applicants had the lowest level of callbacks, especially older female applicants. As a result, older unemployed Americans are seeing a different picture in the search for a job than others — especially if they’ve been unemployed for a while, regardless the fact there are a record high number of job openings and the unemployment rate is at all-time lows. A third of job seekers 55 and older are considered longtime unemployed (so out of work for more than six months), and the average time they’re unemployed is between seven and nine months. So what can older applicants do? Show off your web skills These days, having a strong online presence, especially for a job at a company with a strong online presence, is critical. At minimum, applicants should have a full and updated LinkedIn profile, said Phyllis Mufson, a career coach in Sarasota, Fla.

                                   and Instagram, but be attuned to the small ways to show you’re savvy on the web. Even something small, like a graphic in your email signature can catch a hiring manager’s eye. “Small things like that create an up-to-date impression,” Mufson said. Don’t take everything off the résumé First, always make sure your resume has a current format with important keywords. Resumes submitted online often go through a machine to check for words that match the job posting. That technology may become more advanced, Button said. He’s seen some people leave high school graduate years off of the résumé, though he’s not sure that’s a good idea — employers may end up asking later on anyway. Accentuate the skills you learned from your years in the workforce, and highlight any experience relevant to the position you’re applying for now. If you feel you must rewrite your resume, elaborate on recent achievements and new or ongoing education, Mufson said. Be attentive to inappropriate questions There are a few questions that flag ageism in the hiring process, according to the Society of Human Resources, such as “Would it be hard working for a boss younger than you?” and “Why would you want this job, given all your experience?” They tend to infer the hiring manager or interviewer assumes you’re too old for the job, or won’t be interested in it for long. Hiring discrimination is hard to document, but can be seen in job postings that ask for workers of specific ages, “recent graduate” or “college student,” or terms like “boy” or “girl,” according to a 1983 report from Stephen McConnell, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging. Other terms during the interview include “overqualified” and forced assumptions about long hours or workloads. Also see: Why a college degree could be one of the worst ways to find a new employee Practice for interviews Talk through potential questions and strong answers with a former colleague or boss, family member or friend, or career coach, and ask for feedback on ways you present yourself, Mufson suggests. Also beat any misconceptions about older workers by being energetic, expressing your interest in staying with the company for years to come and embracing change, Ragatz said. Don’t feel you have to change your physical appearance either, experts said. Remain calm Not everyone shares those misconceptions about working seniors. There are positive assumptions about older employees as well, such as having a good work ethic with good social skills, being loyal to their employers and having flexibility to do the work, Mufson said. Perhaps one of the most important reminders during the job search is to stay positive, Ragatz said. “Don’t be discouraged,” she said. “There is work that needs to be done.” This story was updated on Dec. 21, 2017.

Investors, including the state treasurers of Connecticut and Illinois, had filed a resolution calling on the bank to require an independent board chair.. The investors said the bank needs stronger oversight after it emerged in September that thousands of Wells’ branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ consent to meet sales targets. The scandal led to the departure of former Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf on Oct. 12. President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan replaced Stumpf as CEO, while lead independent director Stephen Sanger became chairman. “We believe formalizing this structure is the right decision at this time for the company and its investors, customers, and team members,” Sanger said in a press release. Wells Fargo reached a $190 million regulatory settlement over the unauthorized accounts, though other government inquiries and investor lawsuits are still outstanding. Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, which represents one of the filers of the shareholder resolution, said investors planned to withdraw it in response to the bank’s action on Thursday. Of the new bylaw, Smith said via e-mail, “We believe this is a best governance practice and empowers the Board in its role of overseeing management on behalf of investors.” A spokesman for Wells Fargo referred questions about the bylaw change to public relations firm Sard Verbinnen, which declined to comment.

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"CANNON BALL/WEST FARGO, N.D. (Reuters) - U.S. military veterans were arriving on Thursday at a camp to join thousands of activists braving snow and freezing temperatures to protest a pipeline project near a Native American reservation in North Dakota. However, other veterans in the state took exception to the efforts of the group organizing veterans to act as human shields for the protesters, saying the nature of the protests reflected poorly on the participants. Protesters have spent months rallying against plans to route the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying it poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites. State officials on Monday ordered activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. Officials said on Wednesday however that they will not actively enforce the order. Matthew Crane, a 32-year-old Navy veteran who arrived three days ago, said the veterans joining the protest were “standing on the shoulders of Martin Luther King Jr and Gandhi” with the their plans to shield protesters. “I bought a one-way ticket,” he told Reuters as he worked to build a wooden shelter at the main camp. “Hopefully we can shut this down before Christmas.” U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said for the first time that he supports the completion of the pipeline. Trump’s transition team also said Trump supported peaceful protests. “We respect all Americans’ first amendment right to peacefully protest, and we hope that local and federal officials continue to give support to local law enforcement so they are able to continue to protect these protesters,” said the Trump transition team’s daily note sent to campaign supporters and congressional staff. Meanwhile in West Fargo, North Dakota, several members of the North Dakota Veterans Coordinating Council, which represents five veterans organizations in the state, held a news conference to decry the involvement of veterans in a protest that has damaged property and asked veterans not to participate in the demonstration. “We agree that it is our constitutional right to assemble and to peacefully protest,” council President Russ Stabler told reporters at the West Fargo VFW Post 7564 building. “However, protests over the last 100-plus days in North Dakota have been less than peaceful. “Participating in this kind of assembly even as a peaceful bystander or participant will only mar the image of the North Dakota veterans and the veterans of our nation,” he added as he stood surrounded by about a dozen veterans from the region. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple on Wednesday told reporters it was “probably not feasible” to reroute the pipeline, but he would try to rebuild a relationship with Standing Rock Sioux leaders. Dalrymple said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and his evacuation order was mainly due to concerns about inclement weather endangering people. Frigid weather makes some aspects of pipeline construction more difficult, engineers interviewed by Reuters said. The Standing Rock Sioux, in a statement on Wednesday, said that because “the Governor of North Dakota and Sheriff of Morton County are relative newcomers” to the land, “it is understandable they would be concerned about severe winter weather.” They said the camp has adequate shelter to handle the cold weather, adding that the Great Sioux Nation has survived “in this region for millennia without the concerns of state or county governments.” The temperature in Cannon Ball is expected to fall to 6 degrees Fahrenheit (-14 Celsius) by the middle of next week, according to Weather.com forecasts. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans, intends to reach North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police, protest organizers said on a Facebook page. The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. Protesters, who refer to themselves as “water protectors,” have been gearing up for the winter while they await the Army Corps decision on whether to allow Energy Transfer Partners to tunnel under the river. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps. On Wednesday, the North Dakota Emergency Commission approved another $7 million to provide support for law enforcement who deployed to deal with protesters. The commission previously approved an additional $10 million in funds to cover the escalating costs of the protests. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - U.S. military veterans were building barracks on Friday at a protest camp in North Dakota to support thousands of activists who have squared off against authorities in frigid conditions to oppose a multibillion-dollar pipeline project near a Native American reservation. Veterans volunteering to be human shields have been arriving at the Oceti Sakowin camp near the small town of Cannon Ball, where they will work with protesters who have spent months demonstrating against plans to route the Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, organizers said. The Native Americans and protesters say the $3.8 billion pipeline threatens water resources and sacred sites. Some of the more than 2,100 veterans who signed up on the Veterans Stand for Standing Rock group’s Facebook page are at the camp, with hundreds more expected during the weekend. Tribal leaders asked the veterans, who aim to form a wall in front of police to protect the protesters, to avoid confrontation with authorities and not get arrested. Wesley Clark Jr, a writer whose father is retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, met with law enforcement on Friday to tell them that potentially 3,500 veterans would join the protest and the demonstrations would be carried out peacefully, protest leaders said. The plan is for veterans to gather in Eagle Butte, a few hours away, and then travel by bus to the main protest camp, organizers said, adding that a big procession is planned for Monday. Protesters began setting up tents, tepees and other structures in April, and the numbers swelled in August at the main camp. Joshua Tree, 42, from Los Angeles, who has been visiting the camp for weeks at a time since September, said he felt pulled to the protest. “Destiny called me here,” he said at the main camp. “We’re committed.” The protesters’ voices have also been heard by companies linked to the pipeline, including banks that protesters have targeted for their financing of the pipeline. There have been violent confrontations near the route of the pipeline with state and local law enforcement, who used tear gas, rubber bullets and water hoses on the protesters, even in freezing weather. The number of protesters in recent weeks has topped 1,000. State officials on Monday ordered them to leave the snowy camp, which is on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land, citing harsh weather, but on Wednesday they said they would not enforce the order. “There is an element there of people protesting who are frightening,” North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said on Thursday. “It’s time for them to go home.” Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier spoke by phone on Friday with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, but assistance for law enforcement and a timeline for a resolution to the situation were not offered, the sheriff’s office said. Lynch said in a statement that the U.S. Department of Justice has been in communication with all sides in an effort to reduce tensions and foster dialogue. She said senior department officials will be deployed to the region as needed. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday he supported the completion of the pipeline, and his transition team said he supported peaceful protests. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said on Wednesday it was “probably not feasible” to reroute the pipeline, but he would try to rebuild a relationship with Standing Rock Sioux leaders. On Friday, Morton County Commission Chairman Cody Schulz said his office has been working in conjunction with the governor’s office to meet with tribal leaders soon. Since the start of demonstrations, 564 people have been arrested, the Morton County Sheriff’s Department said. State officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters, and Dalrymple said his evacuation order stemmed mainly from concerns about dangerously cold temperatures. The temperature in Cannon Ball is expected to fall to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (-16 Celsius) by the middle of next week, according to Weather.com forecasts.

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"NEW YORK, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Banks predict Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) issuance of US$50bn to US$70bn next year, in line with 2016 volume, as the market adjusts to rules that force managers to be on the hook for a portion of their fund’s risk. There was US$65.1bn of CLO issuance this year through November 30, down about 30% from the same time period in 2015, as the market prepared for risk-retention rules that take effect December 24 requiring managers to hold 5% of their deal. Volume in 2017 may continue to be tempered, compared to 2014’s record US$124bn, by the regulation or buttressed by rising interest rates that cause investors to flock to floating-rate products. JP Morgan predicts 2017 US CLO issuance of US$50bn to US$60bn and Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts US$60bn, according to research reports. Citigroup and Deutsche Bank expect US$65bn of volume next year and Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo forecast US$70bn. Monthly issuance of the funds, the biggest buyers of leveraged loans, has been increasing, rising to a 2016 high of US$10.6bn in November from US$8.4bn in October, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral. “We have probably seen some issuance from January and February that was moved into November and December as  try to close deals ahead of the risk-retention deadline,” said Bjarni Torfason, a CLO analyst at Deutsche Bank. “We think January and February may be slower than the average month.” While there is no set time frame between when a CLO prices and its closing, it generally takes three to four weeks, according to Deborah Festa, head of law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy’s West Coast securitization and investment management practices. Invesco priced a CLO December 1 that is scheduled to close December 21, according to LPC Collateral data. “For logistical reasons, I think we can expect to see very few additional CLOs price this year that will target closing dates prior to the US risk-retention rule effective date,” Festa said. FLOATING-RATE REFUGE Steady volume may be supported by investors seeking refuge in floating-rate assets as a hedge to rising rates. CLOs pool loans of different credit quality and sell slices of the fund of varying seniority, from Triple A to B, to investors such as insurance companies. The debt slices pay investors a set rate plus Libor, so as the benchmark rises, those holders’ distributions will increase. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in November 17 testimony before the Congressional joint economic committee that a rate increase could become appropriate “relatively soon.” The largest and most senior piece of the CLO, the Triple A slice, can also offer investors higher coupons than similarly rated investments. CLO Triple A slices paid 142bp November 28 compared to five-year, non-agency Triple A spreads of 57bp, according to Wells Fargo data. LCM Asset Management raised a US$407.6m CLO in November that pays Triple A investors 140bp over Libor, that tied for the tightest spread of a non-static deal this year, according to LPC Collateral data. “There is US and global demand for CLOs, from Triple A through mezzanine debt,” said Maggie Wang, head of US CLO and CDO research at Citigroup. Risk retention, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, has proven a barrier for some managers, with the number of firms issuing deals decreasing by about one-third in the last two years, according to Wang. It may also lead to larger managers issuing fewer CLOs next year. However, President-elect Donald Trump has said he will dismantle Dodd-Frank, which if his actions limit or eliminate risk retention, may bolster CLO volume. “Under Trump, if [risk retention] is going to be relaxed or taken out, we will see issuance or volume boosted to US$80bn, which is a very big ease, but that is assuming the market will get some clarity by mid-next year and that will help manager activities pick up and lead to bigger volumes in the second half of 2017,” said Wang.

Citizens is the third major bank with a wealth management business to sign a deal with SigFig. Wells Fargo & Co and UBS AG’s [UBSAG.UL] U.S. wealth management unit both announced deals with the digital investment platform earlier this year. Citizens will roll out the robo offering in 2017 to clients with $100,000 to $2 million in investible assets. Those clients, classified as affluent and mass affluent, can choose from a handful of pre-selected investment portfolios, which SigFig’s software automatically rebalances according to the market. It is the bank’s bid to get more business from the roughly 52 percent of clients who are considered mass affluent, or have between $100,000 and $500,000 in assets. Those clients will see SigFig’s investment portfolios right alongside checkings and savings account products. “We think bundling this digital platform with deposit products is a powerful combo,” said John Bahnken, Citizens Bank head of wealth management. Bahnken said they chose SigFig because the software’s algorithm is malleable and easy to customize for Citizens’ clients.

Anheuser-Busch InBev’s US$46bn issuance to finance its purchase of SAB Miller - priced in January - is the biggest deal issued so far in 2016. Borrowers piled into the debt markets in 2016, taking advantage of low interest rates and seemingly inexhaustible investor demand to finance acquisitions and stock buybacks as well as refinancing old debt. “We entered the year with lots of debt that needed refinancing, and we got a boost from M&A financing with large deals like AB InBev, Dell and Abbott Laboratories,” said Leo Civitillo, global co-head of fixed income capital markets at Morgan Stanley. Issuance has now risen every year since 2011, when the total was US$741bn, according to IFR data. But with the Federal Reserve widely expected to begin raising rates at next week’s FOMC meeting and a smaller M&A pipeline going into 2017, most market participants expect that record run to end. In a research note published Monday, Wells Fargo analysts projected issuance of US$1.2trn next year, a modest decline on 2016’s figures. “I don’t think we’re going to hit a new record next year,” said Michael Collins, senior investment officer at Prudential Financial. “Rates are going higher, and the most aggressive M&A deals are probably behind us. It’s going to be hard to repeat the level of activity we have seen. “ Civitillo at Morgan Stanley counted around US$75bn less M&A financing in the visible pipeline compared to the same point last year. “However, general business sentiment is strong, and we can see the M&A wave is not going to end here,” he said. “We are just entering 2017 with a much less robust pipeline than 2016.” The election of Donald Trump last month could also keep a lid on corporate bond issuance, if he grants companies a tax holiday when repatriating overseas earnings. “By issuing in dollars, those companies have been able to give the proceeds of foreign profits out to equity investors in the US through buybacks,” said Jason Shoup, fixed income strategist at Legal & General Investment Management America. “But if they can repatriate that cash cheaply, their issuance needs decline because they don’t need to raise that money through the bond markets.” Lower issuance in 2017 is expected to lead to tighter corporate bond spreads, as investors compete for increasingly scarce assets. Average high grade bond spreads were at 135bp as of Monday’s close, 38bp tighter than at the start of the year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. The potential for tightening could be offset if defaults increase, but most signs point to strong performance, said David Knutson, head of Americas credit research at Schroders. “Supply has been so robust that if it shrinks or even just stays neutral, that should be a great tailwind for credit spreads,” he told IFR.

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz’s decision to step down is unlikely to hamper growth at the world’s biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. The company’s shares were down 2.5 percent at $57.02 on Friday as investors worried that the exit of one of Wall Street’s most regarded CEOs would spell trouble for the company. Analysts, however, downplayed these concerns. “Howard can’t be in that position forever,” Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Reuters. Hottovy said the timing of the handoff made sense because the company had a strong management team and Johnson had more retail experience than the market was giving him credit for. Johnson worked with Schultz for nearly two years and has been on Starbucks’ board since 2009. “Johnson appears to have been an important behind-the-scenes contributor to Starbucks’ post-recession turnaround, and his background in technology should position him well,” Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a research note. To be sure, the last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company’s shares had plunged. Schultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company’s annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. “Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz’s previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,” RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. The mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks’ latest quarter was through mobile phones. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note that Schultz’s plans to “premiumize” the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive. The outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world, which analysts said was a worthwhile endeavor. Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. The company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks’ birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. ","

But Bank of America Corporation (BAC) still sees cross-selling as a viable method to grow revenue. According to the Wall Street Journal, some brokers at Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America, will be required to make at least two client referrals to other parts of Bank of America, or the employees may face a 1% pay cut. The ultimatum, which extends to the company's online brokerage platform Merrill Edge and its retail bank, begins next year. (See also: Bank of America CEO Discusses Banking Future.) Brokers who fail to comply with the requirements will either have 1% shaved from their take-home pay or deferred compensation, depending on how much they produce in fees and commissions, reports the Journal. As it stands, brokers are currently required to make one referral. Next year, it will be bumped up to two. But it's not exactly the type of aggressive cross-selling tactics that caused Wells Fargo to get into trouble. Merrill Lynch requires its brokers to make only a referral to another Bank of America unit, giving them credit regardless of whether it generates new business, noted the Journal. Unlike Wells Fargo, which incentivized employees for new account openings, Merrill is requesting only referrals. Bank of America and Merrill Lynch are taking a more creative route toward cross-selling compared with several banks that are scrutinizing their retail sales practices more closely. Last month, PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) removed the words ""cross-sell"" from its financial disclosures following congressional hearings on Wells Fargo revealing that its emphasis on cross-selling led to the fake accounts.

Mark Kolakowski,12082016,Investopedia,12012016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Corporate CEOs have lauded President-Elect Donald Trump's plan to slash corporate income taxes as a reform long overdue. But CEOs of America's biggest banks may be less enthusiastic. While tax cuts would enhance banks' long-term profitability, they also would produce some massive one-time hits to earnings, disrupting stocks and investors alike, according to Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to take biggest write-down, as much as $12 billion. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. (KBW) estimate that Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), also could incur writedowns as large as $4.4 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Wells Fargo (WFC) would have to take no writedowns. These numbers include the benefit from declines in deferred tax liabilities at these banks. Home mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would suffer write-downs of about $10 billion and $5.4 billion, and thus could need fresh infusions of capital from the U.S. Treasury. A corporation that posts a net loss can apply that loss to reduce taxable income in a future tax year. For financial reporting purposes, such accumulated but unused losses are multiplied by the appropriate tax rates and recorded on a corporation’s balance sheet under a heading such as deferred tax assets. If the applicable tax rates go down, as Trump proposes, the value of the asset is reduced and a one-time write-down is made against earnings. This is a significant issue for the biggest U.S. banks, which built up these huge deferred tax assets during the financial crisis of 2008. Citigroup had $45.4 billion of deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016, Bloomberg says, mostly valued at the current 35% federal corporate income tax rate. If that rate is cut to just 25% (the average rate in the 34 OECD countries), Citigroup CFO John Gerspach estimates that the write-down would be $6 billion. The KBW analysts cited above also assumed a 25% rate in their calculations. Citigroup’s deferred tax assets also include significant sums related to unused foreign tax credits. If the Republican Congress succeeds in exempting overseas earnings from U.S. tax, the value of those assets also may evaporate. That would bring the total hit for Citigroup to about $12 billion. On the other side of the ledger, companies with deferred tax liabilities would record one-time extraordinary gains if corporate tax rates fall. AT&T Inc. (T) stands to post a $30 billion windfall and Apple Inc. (AAPL) a $15 billion gain, according to Robert Willens, a tax and accounting expert quoted by Bloomberg.

Graseck notes that financial stocks are likely to outperform the 4% increase that she expects in the S&P 500 for 2017 — thanks in part to tax reforms, infrastructure spending and greater demand for lending services from banks.  “After the recent three standard deviation move in the large cap bank stocks, some investors are asking why not step to the sidelines.

"Scott Hanson, co-CEO of Hanson McClain Advisors",12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Is your employer profiting from the money you've been saving in your 401(k) plan? Incredibly, the recent class-action lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleges that the company has been doing just that — profiting off of their employees' retirement savings. To be fair, Wells Fargo isn't the only company that's been accused of this. It's been suspected that many firms in the financial services industry have been self-dealing, while entities in other sectors, including some prominent universities, have been accused of charging their employees excessive fees in order to keep their own costs down. In theory, an employer offers a 401(k) as a fringe benefit to not only help their employees save for retirement, but also to attract top talent to remain competitive in the marketplace. It would seem reasonable to the average person that workplace benefits are a form of compensation and that some (or all) of the burden of those benefits should fall to the employer. After all, this is what occurs with other benefits, such as health insurance and vision and dental plans. But while many companies pass on some of the costs of their retirement plans to their employees, some companies are actually benefitting financially when their employees participate in their plan. Consider the case of Wells Fargo. As a financial services firm, it manufactures its own line of mutual funds and some of these funds are options within the company's own 401(k) plan. One might argue that Wells Fargo is proud of its funds and is simply giving its employees the chance to invest in a good product. Here's where things get dicey. According to the complaint, one of Well Fargo's target-date mutual funds was a ""default option"" within the plan, and this fund contained fees that were three times that of a low-cost competitor. So, where did these extra fees go? To Wells Fargo. When an employer establishes a 401(k) plan, there are numerous costs that need to be covered, including, but not limited to, start-up fees, compliance costs and ongoing administration. One way that employers have avoided paying some (or all) of these costs is by passing along the expenses to their employees. How have they done this? By stuffing their 401(k) plans with high-cost, often proprietary funds, and then using those additional fees to offset their own expenses. More from Portfolio Perspective: Preparing for the $30 trillion great wealth transferNow you can donate to charity through your IRABond investors are going to have to adjust expectations So how do you know if your employer is making a profit off of your retirement savings? And if it is, is there anything you can do about it? Start by examining the line-up of mutual funds offered within your 401(k) plan. If you notice that some of these funds are manufactured by your employer, this should raise a red flag. Unless your employer is a low-cost investment manager, you're probably best off avoiding these and instead selecting those funds that have very low expenses (assuming you have those options available to you). However, if you're like the majority of people and are not employed by a financial firm, you'll want to check to see if your firm offers low-cost index funds. If not, you have every right to question why it doesn't. Another way companies lessen their costs is by sponsoring 401(k) plans that use expensive insurance contracts or front-load mutual funds. If you notice your plan only contains high-expense funds, that is a pretty clear sign that your employer is passing along the expenses to you. This may not be a big issue for someone who has next to nothing saved in his or her retirement fund, but for a person who has a substantial balance, that person is bearing the costs for not just his or her own retirement fund, but perhaps for those of co-workers, as well. A major problem with the 401(k) system is that we, as workers, are reliant upon our employers to offer us a retirement savings plan. Simply, if you want to save as much as you can for retirement on a tax-favored basis, you're pretty much stuck with your employer's plan. You legally can't defer nearly as much to an individual retirement account, nor, obviously, can you take advantage of the great plan that your next-door neighbor's company offers. So what can you do if your employer's 401(k) plan stinks? First, contact your employer and point out the problem(s). Your employer has a fiduciary responsibility to offer a plan that is in your best interest — not its own. If it doesn't remedy the situation, not only will it have dissatisfied employees, but could find itself in a lawsuit or in trouble with regulators, who can be very responsive to anonymous employee complaints. Second, if your 401(k) plan offers in-service withdrawals (some plans allow this), transfer however much the plan will allow into an IRA, where you'll have full control of your funds. Third, see if it makes sense for you to reduce your 401(k) deposits to the level that will provide a full employer match (get that free money), and then direct the remainder of your retirement savings into a Roth IRA (limited to $5,500 if you are under age 50, and $6,500 if age 50 or older). As an example, let's say you are contributing $8,000 per year into your 401(k), yet your 401(k) only requires you to contribute $5,000 to receive the full company match. In this case, it may be best to reduce your 401(k) contributions to $5,000 per year and then direct $3,000 into a Roth IRA. Finally, petition your congressman or senator to broaden your retirement savings beyond your employer. The only thing that prevents you from saving in an IRA of your choosing versus being stuck with your employer's options is, I'm sorry to say, our outdated legacy tax laws. Saving for retirement is already difficult enough without having to foot your company's bill for the plan. Not only do these fees quickly add up, but good savers should not be held responsible for greedy plan management, nor should they have to pay for coworkers who don't take saving as seriously as they should. ",Is your employer using your 401(k) to rip you off?

Despite those comparisons, the path ahead for the incumbent president may not be as rosy, according to Blitzer: ""Reagan's economic policy — very different than what we have now in a sense — was very tight monetary policy. Paul Volcker was in the Fed. They just crashed down on inflation. And it was still very tight. When Reagan came into office, interest rates were probably 15 percent, 16 percent, which shocks people today. On the other hand, you know, Reagan said he was going to balance the budget.

Patti Domm,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"At least initially, Italy could call the shots for global markets in the week ahead, as the Trump rally begins to show signs of tiring. The dollar, bonds and stocks should continue to take their cue from any hints of policy or plans from the incoming Trump Administration, and there are a few U.S. economic reports like trade data and consumer sentiment. But the whole world is watching Italy's constitutional referendum Sunday to see if it could cause the next Brexit-like tremor for markets. ""Particularly if the focus shifts to Europe, we think that these Trump themes could very well pause here with interest rates arguably up 70 basis points. The rally could very well have been front loaded,"" said Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategist at UBS. Emanuel said the rallies in sectors like industrials and the small caps are showing signs of wear. Even though the Italian referendum is ""very Eurocentric,"" Emanuel said U.S. investors began to shift their attention to the uncertainty around it just as the U.S. stock market rally slowed in the past week. The S&P 500 was down nearly a percent at 2,191 in the past week, its first weekly loss in four weeks. Treasury yields were slightly higher after an extremely volatile week, with the U.S. 10-year at 2.39 percent Friday after nearing 2.5 percent Thursday. Strategists say even though the markets expect a no vote in Italy on Sunday, gauging the immediate reaction has been difficult. ""Italy is the biggest wild card. We'll have to see how the referendum goes and more importantly how do markets in Italy respond to that whether or not there's a big jump in perception of risk among Italian financial names,"" said Boris Rjavinksi, director, rate strategy at Wells Fargo. Italy is also being watched as one of a number of European countries where voters in coming months could favor nationalist themes and populist movements, in the aftermath of the U.K. Brexit vote to leave the European union. Austria, for instance, has an election on Sunday, and the right-wing presidential candidate has been leading in the polls. In Italy, the referendum is not an election but it has turned into a vote of confidence in Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Renzi, a reformer, has proposed constitutional reform that would change the structure of government by reducing the size and makeup of the Senate and centralize more powers. The current system, with votes needing to pass both a large Senate and lower House, has resulted in years of gridlock. Renzi has said he would step down if there is a no vote, but it's not clear whether he would. ""The polls are suggesting a no vote. In contrast, with Brexit and Donald Trump, the polls were suggesting the opposite. The surprise result would be a yes vote, and in that scenario you would expect to see some very big moves in the assets exposed to that. You've seen significant underperformance of Italian banks in recent months, and going into this referendum, you've seen spreads between [Italian bonds] and bunds widen,"" said Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist for BlackRock. Turnill said even though the markets are expecting a 'no' vote, there could still be a reaction. ""I think you'd see it particularly in the Italian banks. I think you'll see it in the spreads of Italian bonds over German bunds, and you could potentially see it in the euro. The lessons of Trump and Brexit is not to overestimate the market reaction,"" said Richard Turnill, ""We really don't see the Italian referendum leading to significant financial contagion, even in Europe."" Marc Chandler, chief fixed income strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said based on this past week's actions, the market response could also turn out to be relatively calm. If Renzi steps down, he said he would be replaced by a technocrat from his own party who would be in office until the next election in 2018. But Chandler said the risks are that the vote could enable the populist Five Star party to gain ground in the 2018 election. That party, led by a former comedian, is opposed to the euro, and if it does succeed, it could be a major upset down the road for financial markets and Italy's banking system. ""Look what happened this week. Italian bonds have done the best in Europe. Italian stocks have done the best in Europe. Italian banks are up 5.2 percent. It means that people think that it's going to be a nonevent,"" he said. The political turmoil comes at a bad time for Italian banks, which need capital. Its most troubled bank, Monte dei Paschi, needs more than $5 billion by year end. Its efforts to raise capital could be stalled by the referendum if the no vote prevails. Its stock has lost 84 percent this year on concerns about its nonperforming loans and capital level. ""Come Monday, nothing's really going to change in Italy. If the prime minister wants to pass a law and he doesn't have support, he passes it by decree. Renzi has had to rule a lot by decree. My suggestion is the new technocrat government would rule by decree,"" he said. Turnill said he is cautious on European stocks because of the uncertainty around political issues. ""Interest rates remain low in Europe and that raises real challenges for particularly the European banks,"" he said. Markets are also watching the European Central Bank's meeting Thursday, where it is expected to announce an extension of its quantitative easing program. ""The real risk in Europe is you get a domino effect over time, [where] there is a path to power for more populist parties,"" said Turnill. That could ultimately strain the euro. ""The forces driving the resurgence in populist parties in Europe remain very powerful and may increase. We have the Austrian election, then the French election."" On Thursday, French President Francois Hollande announced he would not seek a second term. ""I think the biggest single risk event will be the French election, where in the event Marine Le Pen wins the election, I think people would be very nervous about what the implication of that would be for the euro zone going forward. The outcome of the recent primaries appear to have reduced that probability, but I think we've all learned the elections are becoming increasingly unpredictable,"" he said. In the U.S. in the coming week, U.S. economic data includes international trade Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday. There is also China PMI data Monday, trade balance on Thursday and inflation data Friday. ""I think people will start thinking about the upcoming FOMC meeting. That's kind of the road map for the next week. There's some data, but not as high profile as we got this week. I think it's about time for the market to start thinking about positioning for the FOMC. We expect a 25 basis point hike, tempered by fairly cautious language, as far as the forward guidance goes,"" said Rjavinski. The Fed meets the following week and is widely expected to raise the Fed funds target rate by a quarter point on Dec. 14, its second interest rate hike in 10 years. There are a few Fed speakers Monday including New York Fed President William Dudley, who speaks on the economy and also will be on CNBC at 10:30 a.m. ET. The Fed enters the quiet period ahead of its mid-December meeting on Tuesday. With the Italian election ahead of it, the bond market saw some defensive buying Friday. Yields, which move inversely to price, reversed Thursday's steep spike in yields, as traders speculated Friday's November jobs report would be stronger than expected, prompting a faster course of Fed tightening. But the economy added 178,000 payrolls, just as expected, and hourly wages actually declined by a 0.1 percent when an increase was expected. Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow just barely positive at 19,170. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were lower, as some of the hotter moves of the Trump trade unwound and tech remained under pressure. The small cap Russell 2000 was down 2.4 percent for the week, after surging 16 percent in 15 sessions. The S&P industrial sector was flat on the week, and consumer discretionary was down 2 percent. The week's big winner was energy, with West Texas Intermediate oil futures for January up more than 12 percent at $51.68 after OPEC struck a deal to cut production.

Aides did not provide documents to confirm the sales. Trump's potential investment conflicts came to the forefront Tuesday, as he threatened to cancel a Boeing contract for a new Air Force One, saying it was too expensive. Trump previously owned shares of the aerospace and defense giant. When asked about the Boeing shares, Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters Tuesday that Trump ""sold all his stock in June."" Trump's businesses and real estate holdings around the globe leave the potential for unprecedented conflicts of interest during his presidency, which Trump has pledged to address by handing his businesses to his three eldest children. Some legal experts have argued that will not go far enough. His children are helping his presidential transition and daughter Ivanka sat in on a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Trump's stock holdings were one part of his presidential decisions that could have affected his personal fortune. For example Trump's proposals to loosen financial regulations and promote American energy production could have boosted some of the companies in which he invested. For example, Trump's administration could decide on the fate of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, which is operated by Energy Transfer Partners.

Not only that, but they all boast returns that place them in the top 25 percent of the peer group for their particular investment discipline. This list of top-rated female portfolio managers in the United States brings together a diverse group of investment strategies run in locations throughout the country (and a couple outside of it) and available to U.S. investors. The keen-eyed among you will spot the fact that two of the women aren't actually based in the United States, with Nicole Kornitzer working in Paris on Buffalo Funds international equity portfolio and Hermes Fund Managers' Elena Tedesco running her emerging market fund out of London. However, as both run money for U.S. investors and are on funds that are accessible here in the United States, they are included on the list. These portfolio managers are the individuals entrusted with managing large portions of your 401(k) plans. They seek to preserve your capital while making stock decisions that will grow your retirement savings for the time when you need to buy an annuity that will provide income for the rest of your life. As such, the quality of the job they do is paramount to setting you up to live a comfortable, and hopefully long, existence in those golden years. Despite the imbalance in the number of women portfolio managers, we've unearthed no statistical differences in women's ability to make good or bad decisions with your money. Women exhibit the same ability to outperform their chosen market as men, which is the raison d'être of anyone who manages money for a living. Proportionally, women also manage just as much money as their male counterparts. Topping the list is Boston-based Cynthia Clemson, manager of municipal bonds for Eaton Vance. Clemson's focus on the higher-yielding part of the municipal bond market has been the source of much of her outperformance. Municipals have been in a sweet spot over the past five years and are well represented by this group of portfolio managers. At the top of the list with Clemson are Natalie Trevithick, of Payden & Rygel; Nancy G Angell, of GW&K Investment Management; and Catherine Stienstra, at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Clemson's focus on the higher-yielding part of the municipal bond market has been the source of much of her outperformance. Another standout name on this list is Jean Hynes of Wellington Management. In fifth place, she is responsible for running more money than any other woman on the planet. With close to $50 billion of assets under management in mutual funds alone, she is part of an elite group of star portfolio managers. Rather than trumpet her investment views, the pharmaceuticals specialist has quietly gone about her business at Wellington Management. Such is Hynes' quality in this area that she has been drafted by Vanguard and Hartford to manage their assets in this space. More from Portfolio Perspective:  A look at the world's top 20 female portfolio managers Bond investors must adjust their expectations Are your investments really diversified enough? Pharmaceuticals and health care are firmly back on the agenda, in light of the presidential election result. However, Hynes was fairly relaxed about the impact that a Donald Trump presidency will have on both Obamacare and drug prices. Speaking days before the result, she told Citywire: ""We do not believe the Affordable Care Act will be dismantled, nor that we will see meaningful structural change in how drug prices are set in the U.S."" Outside of the top five, the split between broad asset classes is fairly even. Nine of the top 20 run bond portfolios, and 10 are responsible for equity funds. There are even four managers who make the cut from the all-important and notoriously tough domestic U.S. equity market. No area in global investment has had more of a transition from active mutual funds to passive funds, and as such, anyone adding significant value deserves respect. However, ClearBridge Investments' Margaret Vitrano is the only one to manage the prized large-cap equities. Her outperformance has in part been achieved by holding a significant overweight to the health-care sector — 20 percent of the fund. The rest of the U.S. equity managers run funds in the small- and mid-cap sectors, where outperformance is easier. They are Nuveen Fund Advisors' Karen Bowie, Schroder's Jenny Jones, and Elizabeth Jones of Buffalo Mutual Funds. With many industry experts backing the domestically focused companies found within the small- and mid-cap index to prosper under the new administration, the good times might only just be beginning for this trio. Elsewhere, in emerging markets, three managers make the cut. They are Elena Tedesco of Hermes Fund Managers, Patricia Ribeiro of American Century Investment Management and Maria Negrete-Gruson of Artisan Partners. Over the second half of the year, the most popular trade for investment has undoubtedly been into emerging markets. However, unlike the smaller companies, this is an area that could face a tough time against a backdrop of President-elect Trump's more protectionist stance on global trade.

Patti Domm,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"There's a fire sale in the bond market, and the November jobs report could make it burn even hotter. The wild move came amid speculation that Friday's employment report could be better-than-expected and drive interest rates even higher. Interest rates surged Thursday, with the 10-year yield spiking as much as 12 basis points — or 0.12 percentage points — at its peak, to 2.49 percent, the highest yield since June 2015. Yields move inversely to prices and rates snapped higher across the whole yield curve. The 2-year  pressed up against 1.17 percent and the 30-year rose to as high as 3.15 percent. In afternoon trading, some of the selling subsided, and the 10-year yield slipped back to just under 2.44 percent, but 2.50 is being watched as the next psychological line in the sand. ""In order to stay above 2.50, it's got to be a really good number. The way we're going, it's like an unhinged market. It's also going to be counterproductive for things down the road. This is not a healthy adjustment in rates. There's going to be some losses on this,"" said George Goncalves, head of rate strategy at Nomura. The 10-year yield affects consumer loans especially home mortgage rates, which have already risen near 4 percent, slowing borrowing activity. The 2-year is the rate most closely watched as a signal about the market's expectation for Fed rate activity. The Fed is expected to hike rates Dec. 14 but traders have been speculating a stronger economy could force it into a faster hiking cycle next year. Strategists say Thursday's rate spike was driven by a combination of factors and at the same time inexplicable in its scope.  The overriding themes are that the world is moving to a higher interest rate environment and for the first time in years, there could be inflation. OPEC's deal to cut production Wednesday, drove oil prices 15 percent higher in just two days, ramping up inflation expectations that already had been on the rise. President-elect Donald Trump's plans to add stimulus to the economy and cut tax rates for corporations and individuals has added to expectations that an already warming economy could expand even more, and bring higher rates and inflation with it. U.S. data has also been better than expected, with ISM data Thursday showing that manufacturing activity expanded in November more quickly than in any month since last year. The stronger readings in this week's ADP private sector payrolls of 216,000 jobs has also sparked expectations that Friday's government employment report could be better than expected, and also show a bigger-than-expected jump in wages. Economists expect 175,000 jobs were created in November, and average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent. The unemployment rate is expected to hold at 4.9 percent. Goldman Sachs economists Thursday afternoon bumped up their expectations for the jobs report to 200,000 nonfarm payrolls, following the ADP report. ""There's a new psychology in the market. We've spent so long looking to buy rates, we've switched around,"" said Aaron Kohli, interest rate strategist at financial group BMO. The market is watching for a break to 2.50 percent on the 10-year, but strategists say there are not many strong support levels between there and 3 percent. One point strategists are watching is 2.60 percent, as well as 2.75 and 2.80 percent. ""The reality is I'm not sure that tomorrow's (jobs report) can provide enough of a boost to get there,"" said Kohli of the 2.60 level. ""We always tend to focus on the headlines. What's more important this time around is the hourly earnings. You could be adding stimulus into a market where labor conditions have already tightened and wages are moving up."" Goncalves said the market is moving too fast. ""I really think we're getting ahead of ourselves, and people are nervously anticipating tomorrow. I think that matters more than the fundamentals. I think it's more a supply-demand imbalance. I really don't believe that it's just that we have new data to digest and rates have to go higher. It's really more a buyers' strike, and if you're going to come into the market, you're going to want to be compensated for it. We've broken above 2.40 and nobody wants to step up,"" he said. Other factors that affected market psyche were concerns about the European Central Bank ending its quantitative easing program. Reuters reported from unnamed source that the ECB will extend its bond purchases beyond March and decide whether to formally signal after its  meeting next Thursday that it will eventually end the program. That sparked more selling in German bunds, and that activity pressured Treasurys in late morning trading. The market is also watching Sunday's Italian constitutuional referendum, which is expected to fail and result in a change of government. The Treasury market was also seeing hedging interest due to corporate bond issuance. There was a pickup in issuance Thursday, after low activity Wednesday. Companies issued $13.8 billion in investment grade debt Thursday, according Informa Global Markets. Three big banks — Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo — were among the issuers. Strategists said the fact that banks are moving to borrow in a rising rate environment does reinforce the view that managements see rates rising. Reich said corporate investment grade issuance could surpass last year's total of $1.25 trillion Thursday. The bond market also continued to chatter about the fact that Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, said on CNBC Wednesday that the Treasury could consider longer duration bonds as an option. Kohli said the action is welcome. ""We've been waiting for a fire,"" he said, noting its helpful the economy is firming. ""You want yields to be higher because there's expectations for growth ... but you don't want them selling off, or you don't want them up 60 basis points because somebody got squeezed. You want them up on future growth,"" he said. Kohli said the month end trading in November was very telling and marked a turning point. Institutions who trade against a benchmark weren't jumping in to add to their holdings, as they have typically done at month end during the many years of low rates. ""In the past they would have had to go out and buy to match the benchmark. It's dropped off … in the past it made sense to do that because the prevailing direction of rates was lower,"" he said. ""I think any time you violates these bounds usually you get a pullback in yield so you might retrace a bit. We've gotten here so quickly. We got from (10-year yield) 1.70 to 2.50 in very short order. It's been a big shock to the market. I think the immediate knee jerk reaction will be for shorts to take profits,"" said Kohli.

 ,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Apple Watch sales appear to have rebounded for the holidays from mid-year doldrums on a redesign, price cuts and strong promotions, but analysts say long-term demand has yet to be proven. The Watch is Apple's first new product under Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and is seen as a barometer of whether the company can find new sources of revenue to boost sales which now largely depend on the iPhone. Cook told Reuters on Monday that Watch sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high during the first week of holiday shopping. Cook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC that painted a more alarming picture, estimating Watch sales fell 71 percent in the third quarter of 2016. The sharp change in seasonal demand, also revealed in separate data from market research firm Slice Intelligence, amplifies some analysts' concerns that the Apple Watch may not be a formidable hit on the order of the iPhone or iPad. ""Let's see if the demand carries through to the next quarter,"" said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. Data from Slice Intelligence shows sales were tepid in July and August and then jumped in September, when the watch was updated. Slice reported that sales faded somewhat in October and strengthened again in November. Average selling prices of the watch fell to $353.19 in November from $393.39 in October, according to Slice. Apple Watch prices experienced a similar dip last year, hitting $321.63 in December 2015, although the drop this year is notable because it comes in the wake of a product update. Apple, which declined to comment on the Slice data, has cut the retail price of the entry level watch over the last year. The original Apple Watch debuted in 2015 with a starting price of $349, but Apple trimmed the price to $299 in March 2016. It dropped it again to $269 in September, when a new generation of watches was released. Apple also raised the profile of the Watch this holiday season. That effort included a promotional deal with Nike and aggressive advertising. Researcher Market Track said that promotions of Apple watches in retailer circulars have risen to 14 percent of the wearables market this year from 6 percent last year. Apple may also be getting a boost from sales of the original Watch. It no longer sells solely in its own stores, but some third-party retailers, such as Target and Best Buy offer it, often with deep discounts for older models. Some of those same retailers, and Apple itself, offered gift-card based discounts on the newer watches as well on Black Friday. ""Whether Apple can sustain this strength will be the key question and at what impact to margins,"" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote in a note to investors. While Apple has cut retail prices, it has cut costs as well. This year's entry-level 38-millimeter watch cost about $92.78 to make, compared with $98.79 for last year's model, according to an analysis by IHS, a technology research firm. Analyst Kevin Keller said that the difference between retail price and production price still left Apple with a ""substantial amount of money."" Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

John Maxfield,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The headquarters of Bank of America in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is a big bank. But just how big it is surprised me recently when I measured its size in a less common way. Analysts and commentators almost always compare banks based on the total size of their balance sheets -- that is, by the cumulative value of their assets. This makes sense when you consider that a bank's assets are a primary source of revenue. By this measure, there's no question that Bank of America is massive. At the end of the third quarter, it reported just under $2.2 trillion worth of total assets on its balance sheet, split between loans, interest-earnings securities, and a variety of other asset types. Yet, even though that's enormous, it's nevertheless smaller than one of Bank of America's principal competitors: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Going into the financial crisis, JPMorgan was ranked third in terms of assets -- Citigroup was first, followed by Bank of America. Fast forward to today, however, and JPMorgan Chase is now the biggest bank in the United States, with $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet -- click here for the full list of America's 10 biggest banks by assets. But despite JPMorgan Chase's ascent, which was fueled by its 2008 acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, it still lags behind Bank of America if you measure size a slightly different way. Namely, by looking at the quantity of shareholders' equity, or capital, on their respective balance sheets. This is what's left over after you subtract a bank's liabilities from its assets. In layman's terms, it's what a bank is worth according to the bank's own estimate of the market value of its assets and liabilities. (This shouldn't be confused with a bank's market capitalization, which is the total market value determined by investors of its outstanding common stock.) When you measure size in this way, it turns out that Bank of America is actually the biggest bank in the United States. It has $270 billion worth of capital compared to JPMorgan's $254 billion. Citigroup and Wells Fargo round out the four biggest banks by capital, at $232 billion and $203 billion, respectively. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. On the one hand, this is good for Bank of America and its shareholders, as it means that the North Carolina-based bank has more than enough capital to survive even the most extreme economic downturn. On the other hand, given that Bank of America has so much capital relative to assets, it operates with less leverage than, say, JPMorgan Chase or Wells Fargo. Using less leverage may not sound like a bad thing, but it's one of the reasons that Bank of America is less profitable than other banks, as a bank that can buy more assets with a given amount of capital is going to generate more revenue than a bank that's able to buy fewer assets. Thus, while impressive, Bank of America's legitimate claim to being the biggest U.S.-based bank when measured by the quantity of capital on its balance sheet is clearly a double-edged sword.

Eric Volkman,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In one of the largest financial industry spinoffs of the year, annuities and other related financial instruments provider Athene Holding is going public via an IPO. The company is majority-owned by private equity powerhouse Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), which intimated several times previously that it would float Athene Holding in an IPO. That day is almost upon us; here's a brief look at the company. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES Athene Holding is a large company, but its core business is straightforward -- it enters into annuities contracts with its clients, using those deposits to invest in assets that provide a higher return than what it's paying out. It's a good business to be in, and Athene Holding has managed to operate it profitably for years. Its annual bottom line has been in the black since 2012. This year has been a strong one for the company; in the first three quarters of 2016 it managed to nearly double net revenue (to just over $3 billion), while improving available net income by a chunky 37% to $437 million. Strategic acquisitions have helped Athene Holding grow to its present size (roughly $87 billion in assets). In late 2012 it struck a deal to acquire Aviva USA, an arm of big UK-based insurer Aviva, for 1.1 billion pounds (roughly $1.8 billion at the time) -- around one-third of the unit's total book value. Although Athene Holding remains focused on the domestic market, it's made its presence known overseas. Last year, it bought German life insurance provider Delta Lloyd Deutschland, a unit of the eponymous Dutch multinational insurer. Following the IPO, Athene Holding will still be tightly linked to Apollo Global Management and its affiliates, who will collectively own around 45% of the shareholder voting rights in the company. In Apollo's most recently reported quarter, it disclosed that it ""managed or advised"" nearly $72 billion of Athene Holding's assets under management (at the end of September, total AUM for the latter stood at $188 billion). Additionally, said the parent, ""$15.3 billion, or 21%, was either sub-advised by Apollo or invested in funds and investment vehicles managed by Apollo."" We can imagine that this close relationship will continue. Relative to its peers, Athene Holding tends to plow its deposit money into higher-risk investments such as subprime real estate assets. That, plus its level of specialization, means typically higher net profit margins than that of the company's rivals, which for the most part are more diversified insurers such as MetLife and Lincoln National. In terms of price to book value, Athene Holding will be more expensive than its two peers. If it's priced at the very bottom end of its expected IPO price range at $38, the company's price/book will be exactly 1. By comparison, MetLife currently trades at a price/book just under 0.8, while Lincoln Financial's ratio is a bit over 0.9. That seems to   be a fairly good deal, given Athene Holding's higher margins.  Some might be concerned that the tight link with Apollo mainly helps the larger company, but in my opinion it's more benefit than burden; Apollo is a sharp operator that can find offbeat and lucrative investments for its partner. Anyone interested in putting some money on the new company, however, should monitor that relationship going forward. A total of 23.75 million shares of Athene Holding are to be sold in the company's IPO, by a group of selling shareholders (mainly Apollo and its affiliates). The company will receive no proceeds from the sale. The stock, which is scheduled to start trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, will bear the ticker symbol ATH. The IPO price is $38 to $42 per share. The issue's big underwriting syndicate reads like a who's who of American investment banks. It includes Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo Securities, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","

The Roastery and Reserve stores offer a premium assortment of coffees and are meant to be “customer destination venues,” according to comments from Schultz posted on the Starbucks website about the transition. The Seattle Roastery — there is currently only one—achieved a same-store sales increase of 24% last year and delivers a ticket four times the usual Starbucks cafe, Schultz said. The company plans to open at least 20 Roastery locations world-wide by the end of 2019, and at least 1,000 are planned for the years ahead.

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"The ruling crowns a dismal year for the San Francisco lender roiling from a scandal in which bank employees created as many as 2 million accounts without customer authorization. Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf resigned in the wake of that controversy. Tuesday’s ruling means the bank may not establish international bank entities or acquire non-bank subsidiaries, regulators said. On Tuesday, regulators determined for a second time this year that the Wells Fargo “living will” fell short. Wells Fargo may submit an amended living will by March 31. The restrictions may then be lifted if the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation allow. “We believe we will be able to address the concerns raised today in the March 2017 revised submission,” the bank said in a statement. Living wills were conceived in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis when the downfall of several Wall Street banks sent shockwaves through global markets. U.S. taxpayers had to prop up banks that were deemed “too big to fail” and Congress vowed that such a rescue would not happen again. Now that it has failed to satisfy regulators, Wells Fargo is on a regulatory path that could end with the bank being ordered to shrink in two years. The lender will have several chances to harden its business in the meantime and avoid such a measure. Regulators signaled that Wells Fargo’s securities and investment banking unit is an area of concern and they threatened to cap its size if Wells cannot right itself. That business has grown increasingly important at the bank, but still accounts for just a fraction of total revenues. ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"(Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator has questioned Wells Fargo & Co over its accounting for a roughly $20 billion portfolio of troubled loans. In a letter sent in September that became public on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the bank’s controller, Richard Levy, to explain how Wells Fargo went about valuing the portfolio, which it acquired primarily by buying Wachovia. The SEC’s questions, which may represent another headache for Wells Fargo following a sales scandal, relate to assumptions the bank made in determining how to value the loans. On a portfolio of so-called “Pick-a-Pay” mortgages, for example, the discussion focused on metrics such as borrower credit score and loan-to-value. Those valuation assumptions affect Wells Fargo’s earnings in that, when banks acquire distressed assets, they must value them in a way that involves some guesswork about whether the loans will be repaid. The values can rise or fall significantly over time, depending partly on the accuracy of the guesswork, which in turn can lead to gains or losses. In recent months, stock analysts at firms including Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Credit Suisse have raised questions about whether Wells Fargo’s earnings are supported by underlying business growth or accounting maneuvers. In a Sept. 23 note, Credit Suisse’s Susan Katzke said the bank’s “shares were pressured by debatable earnings quality,” even before a sales scandal erupted on Sept. 8, hammering its stock. “There is this sense they are managing earnings and the way you can manage earnings is if you interpret accounting in beneficial ways at the appropriate moments,” said Charles Peabody, analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading. “I don’t think that is necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that when you get on that treadmill it’s hard to get off it.” Wells Fargo’s Levy responded to the SEC’s questions in detail in an October letter. His response included tables showing how and why values changed over time. In correspondence the next month, the SEC’s senior assistant chief accountant, Stephanie Sullivan, said the agency had completed its review. Valuing such loans “is challenging, and that is the answer that Wells Fargo is offering,” said Judy Beckman, an accounting professor at the University of Rhode Island.    Spokesmen for the SEC and Wells Fargo declined to comment.    The SEC regularly questions companies on their earnings reports. The regulator sent 2,905 such letters to companies during the 12 month period ended June 30, according to a report from Ernst & Young. In September regulators ordered Wells Fargo to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle charges its employees created as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without the consent of customers. The bank faced more trouble on Tuesday when it was the only major U.S. bank that failed to convince regulators it could go bankrupt without causing a major market disruption. ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"NEW YORK, Dec 9 (IFR) - US investment-grade bond issuance volumes reached US$1.284trn this week, breaking annual issuance records for the sixth year running, according to IFR data. The previous record set in 2015 saw US$1.269trn of deals issued. Financial sector issuers have dominated issuance by sector in 2016, selling 247 out of the total 801 deals to-date, as banks have sought to print new bonds to meet incoming Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) rules and replace maturing debt. But M&A has also been a big driver and resulted in some of the biggest deals of the year. Anheuser-Busch InBev’s US$46bn issuance, for example, to finance its purchase of SABMiller, is the biggest deal issued in 2016. Borrowers piled into the debt markets in 2016, taking advantage of low interest rates and seemingly inexhaustible investor demand to also finance stock buybacks and to refinance old debt at historically low costs. “We entered the year with lots of debt that needed refinancing, and we got a boost from M&A financing with large deals like AB InBev, Dell and Abbott Laboratories,” said Leo Civitillo, global co-head of fixed income capital markets at Morgan Stanley. Issuance has now risen every year since 2011, when the total was US$741bn, according to IFR data. But with the Federal Reserve widely expected to begin raising rates at next week’s FOMC meeting and a smaller M&A pipeline going into 2017, most market participants expect that record run to end. Wells Fargo analysts project gross issuance of US$1.2trn next year, a modest decline on 2016’s figures. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts forecast a bigger drop, to about US$1.062trn. “I don’t think we’re going to hit a new record next year,” said Michael Collins, senior investment officer at Prudential Financial. “Rates are going higher, and the most aggressive M&A deals are probably behind us. It’s going to be hard to repeat the level of activity we have seen.” Civitillo at Morgan Stanley counted around US$75bn less M&A financing in the visible pipeline compared with the same point last year. “However, general business sentiment is strong, and we can see the M&A wave is not going to end here,” he said. “We are just entering 2017 with a much less robust pipeline than 2016.” BAML forecasts US$90bn of investment-grade M&A bond supply in 2017 - less than half the roughly US$241bn in 2016. Some large M&A deals are under intense scrutiny, such as the merger between AT&T and Time Warner. Abbott Laboratories, meanwhile, is trying to terminate its acquisition of Alere. Bank issuance is tipped to remain strong, with financial borrowers still tapping the market into year-end. US banks including Goldman Sachs, PNC Bank and Citigroup hit the market with opportunistic deals this week, and the Yankee market has also been active. French lender BNP Paribas sold a US$750m Additional Tier 1 trade, the first such capital deal from a Yankee borrower since September. Yet more could come before the year is out. Credit Agricole held calls with investors on Friday for a senior non-preferred TLAC deal - the first of its kind - and that could hit the market next week in either US dollars, euros, or both. Still, US banks are on a strong footing, and many have stormed the market with callable structures in the past few months to help meet TLAC needs. “The money center banks seem to have some more comfort around how much TLAC debt they need to issue,” said a DCM banker. “It feels like they are ahead of their plans.” Wells Fargo analysts estimated US$537bn of supply from financials in 2017. Bankers are also factoring in the potential impact on issuance from the new US administration. President-elect Donald Trump will take power on January 20, and if he grants companies a tax holiday when repatriating overseas earnings, that could also keep a lid on bond volumes. “By issuing in dollars, those companies have been able to give the proceeds of foreign profits out to equity investors in the US through buybacks,” said Jason Shoup, fixed income strategist at Legal & General Investment Management America. “But if they can repatriate that cash cheaply, their issuance needs decline because they don’t need to raise that money through the bond markets.” Repatriation through a one-off tax holiday is very likely given that both the Senate and the House have a Republican party majority, BAML analysts said. Lower issuance in 2017 is expected to lead to tighter corporate bond spreads, as investors compete for increasingly scarce assets. Average high-grade bond spreads were at 133bp as of Thursday’s close, 40bp tighter than at the start of the year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. Hans Mikkelsen, head of US high-grade strategy at BAML, predicts a further 20bp tightening in 2017, which should help offset the impact on borrowing costs from rising rates.

AmEx’s new family benefits include 20 weeks of paid parental leave, reimbursement of adoption or surrogacy expenses of up to $35,000, and a maximum benefit of $35,000 for reproductive and fertility treatments, the company said. The United States lags behind other developed countries in the amount of leave given to employees.

The SHRM said earlier this year that big financial firms, including Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co, had expanded their paid parental leave programs. Increasing corporate family benefits were a part of President-elect Donald Trump’s election campaign agenda, with Trump proposing guaranteed six weeks of paid maternity leave and allowing families to deduct the cost of childcare expenses from income taxes.

Credit Suisse also runs Crossfinder, the No. 2 U.S. alternative trading system and has no plans to close it, the spokeswoman said. Crossfinder is a “dark pool,” where trading information is not displayed, while Light Pool was an electronic communications network that displays its available orders to its clients. Regulatory oversight of alternative trading systems has intensified in recent years, leading to spate of enforcement actions and new rules. Dark pools allow investors to trade anonymously and only make data available after a trade, reducing the chance that others in the market will catch wind of a buyer’s or seller’s intentions and move the price against them. Critics say private trading venues add to the fragmentation of the market, increasing complexity and costs for participants. In November 2015, the SEC proposed rules requiring  alternative trading systems to disclose significantly more information to clients about how they operate. ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"(Reuters) - A 5 percent drop in Brazil's real currency and similar decline in the Bovespa stock index .BVSP since Donald Trump's surprise victory in last month's U.S. presidential election have created a buying opportunity in some Brazilian assets, say a number of emerging market fund managers. The perception that valuations have grown tempting has many investors adding to their holdings even in the face of a widening graft probe within the government. Among the politicians who could be ensnared are President Michel Temer, a primary force behind crucial proposed spending and deficit reforms, and Senate leader Renan Calheiros, essentially the country’s acting vice president. Given that the rally in Brazilian assets that began in March was set off by reports then-President Dilma Rousseff’s days in office were numbered, investors could be excused for again focusing on political risk in Latin America’s largest economy. But some fund managers say the buying opportunity presented by the post-Trump rout outweighs the steady drumbeat of political risk. “We are really allergic to macro-forecasting and event projection,” he said. “We’ve been adding a bit to our positions in Brazil” since the U.S. election. HSBC’s head of emerging markets debt, Nishant Upadhyay, said that with the selloff that followed the U.S. election coming on the heels of Brazil’s worst-ever economic recession, it increasingly looks like the market has bottomed out. “For an economy that has contracted 7 percent over the course of two years, you are going back towards a stabilizing economy and the economy has cheapened up so much you should expect positive returns going forward,” he said. He is also betting on the Brazilian real BRL= and would add to his holdings if the currency weakened further in the next year. He cautioned he expects significant volatility in Brazil's economy and the real even more than in many of the country's commodity-dependent emerging market peers. Not every investor is willing to overlook Brazil’s still rocky political climate. Wells Fargo’s head global market strategist, Paul Christopher, said recent political disruptions have compounded his fears about Brazil. “There’s still a lot of political bad feeling and it’s still possible you could see (politicians) brought up on charges that are murky or gray,” he said. “That could continue for a while.” Still, many are betting that the recent dip in Brazilian asset prices is an opportunity not to be missed. Pointing to the country’s crackdown on corruption, improving commodities prices and the central bank’s recent interest rate cuts, Jamie Anderson, managing principal of Tierra Funds’ Latin America Real Estate ETF, said he sees Brazil in a “secular bull market.” “Those conditions are very attractive for a long-term, patient investor and will create tailwinds in terms of asset appreciation,” he said.

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales barely rose in November and industrial production recorded its biggest drop in eight months, suggesting some loss of momentum in economic growth in the fourth quarter. The weak retail sales and industrial output readings reported on Wednesday, however, were unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates later in the day, against the backdrop of steadily rising inflation and a tightening labor market. The rate hike expectations were reinforced by other data showing producer prices notching their largest increase in five months in November amid a jump in the cost of services. The moderation in retail sales came after two straight months of strong gains. With incomes rising and household wealth at record highs, the cool-off in retail sales is likely to be temporary. ""Consumer spending remains the main engine of growth for the economy,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. ""Solid employment growth and accelerating wage gains will continue to support household spending, a dynamic that should allow the Fed to raise rates today and encourage them to signal a couple of rate hikes next year."" Retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month as households cut back on motor vehicle purchases after rising 0.6 percent in October, the Commerce Department said. Sales were up 3.8 percent from a year ago. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales also nudged up 0.1 percent last month after gaining 0.6 percent in October. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast overall retail sales increasing 0.3 percent and core sales also gaining 0.3 percent last month. In another report, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.4 percent last month, pulled down by a 4.4 percent drop in utilities output as warmer-than-normal temperatures cut demand for heating. The drop in industrial production was the largest since March. Manufacturing production slipped 0.1 percent, held back by a 2.3 percent drop in motor vehicle output. Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent. Mining production surged 1.1 percent amid rising oil and gas well drilling as the drag from last year’s collapse in oil prices fades. Nevertheless, the soft retail sales and industrial production, together with a another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories recording their biggest drop in 11 months in October, implied the economy was slowing in the fourth quarter after growing at a brisk 3.2 percent annualized rate in the July-September period. The Atlanta Fed trimmed its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage to a 2.4 percent rate after the data. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on expectations that the Fed would take a cautious stance on future rate hikes. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose, while stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The U.S. central bank hiked its overnight benchmark interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. A third report from the Labor Department showed its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month, the largest gain since June, after being unchanged in October. In the 12 months through November, the PPI rose 1.3 percent, the biggest gain in two years. The PPI rose 0.8 percent in the 12 months through October. A 0.5 percent increase in the cost of services accounted for more than 80 percent of the rise in the final demand PPI last month. The increase, which followed a 0.3 percent decline in October, was the largest since January. With producer prices pushing higher, overall inflation is expected to steadily move toward the Fed’s 2 percent target. “The prospects of strengthening demand point to upward inflation pressures in 2017,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Last month’s weak retail sales figures came despite consumer confidence rising to cycle highs, leaving some economists to expect that the numbers would revised higher when the government releases December’s report in January. But online retail sales rose marginally last month. There were solid gains in sales at furniture, food and beverage, as well as building material stores. Americans also spent more at restaurants and bars last month. “We are a bit skeptical of this morning’s numbers,” said Michelle Girard, chief economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. “Given anecdotal evidence and the rise in consumer confidence, we suspect the November figures could get revised higher or will be followed by a much improved performance.” ","

Richard Saintvilus,12152016,Investopedia,12082016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Mention the term ""cross-selling,"" and you're likely to get a dirty look at most banks, particularly in the wake of the fake accounts scandal that rocked Wells Fargo & Company (WFC). But Bank of America Corporation (BAC) still sees cross-selling as a viable method to grow revenue. According to the Wall Street Journal, some brokers at Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America, will be required to make at least two client referrals to other parts of Bank of America, or the employees may face a 1% pay cut. The ultimatum, which extends to the company's online brokerage platform Merrill Edge and its retail bank, begins next year. (See also: Bank of America CEO Discusses Banking Future.) Brokers who fail to comply with the requirements will either have 1% shaved from their take-home pay or deferred compensation, depending on how much they produce in fees and commissions, reports the Journal. As it stands, brokers are currently required to make one referral. Next year, it will be bumped up to two. But it's not exactly the type of aggressive cross-selling tactics that caused Wells Fargo to get into trouble. Merrill Lynch requires its brokers to make only a referral to another Bank of America unit, giving them credit regardless of whether it generates new business, noted the Journal. Unlike Wells Fargo, which incentivized employees for new account openings, Merrill is requesting only referrals. Bank of America and Merrill Lynch are taking a more creative route toward cross-selling compared with several banks that are scrutinizing their retail sales practices more closely. Last month, PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) removed the words ""cross-sell"" from its financial disclosures following congressional hearings on Wells Fargo revealing that its emphasis on cross-selling led to the fake accounts.

David Floyd,12152016,Investopedia,12082016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve's interest-rate setting panel, voted unanimously on Wednesday to raise the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 0.5% to 0.75%. Stocks hardly budged as a result: the hike was modest, after all, and so thoroughly expected that fed funds futures were pricing in a 90-plus percent probability going into the decision. It's easy to come away with the impression that investors, savers and consumers should carry on as before. On the other hand, there are good reasons not to be nonchalant. The FOMC signaled three rate hikes in each of the next three years on Wednesday, a faster pace of tightening than it had projected in December, meaning that the target range could be as high as 2.75%-3.00% at the end of 2019. Given that it was 0.00%-0.25% until December 2015, that's a dramatic increase (of course the Fed chronically overestimates the rate of tightening – going by December 2014 estimates, the rate should be four times higher than it currently is). (See also, Fed Projections: Where Do Rates Go from Here?) The federal funds rate is the bedrock of the world's financial calculus. Raising it pushes up the price of money, affecting rates on everything from credit cards to corporate bonds. It pushes up the yield on Treasuries, which stands in for the so-called risk-free rate of return on which every lending decision is based. It sucks capital into the U.S., that is, out of everywhere else. The fed funds rate is so powerful that it has the potential to wreak political havoc not just at home, but also oceans away. All of which means that the list below is far from comprehensive. But it's a start. The Fed's key policy rate only applies to overnight lending between banks out of their reserves held at the Fed. In other words, it doesn't affect consumer or (non-bank) business borrowing directly, but the distinction is academic, because it is so closely linked to rates that do affect these borrowers directly. The prime rate is one. Within hours of the Fed's move, just about every major bank announced that they would raise their prime rates from 3.50% to 3.75%. This rate affects a slew of variable-rate loans, including most credit cards. Mortgages are generally linked to Treasury yields, but these are also rising due to the rate hike: the 10-year Treasury yield shot up nearly 10 basis points to 2.57% Wednesday and is above 2.62% as of 12:15 p.m. EST Thursday. Libor, another common benchmark that serves as the basis for many student loans, for example, rose to its highest level since May 2009 in response to the rate rise. In short, just about every variable-rate lending rate is likely to move more or less in line with Fed actions. Borrowers who can refinance to lock in low rates should consider doing so. Higher borrowing costs also apply to banks, which take loans from savers in the forms of deposits. In other words, the savings account that currently pays out a few bucks a year – if that – will become more generous. But don't hold your breath. Trading gains, fees and other revenue streams aside, banks profit from the spread between the rates they lend at and the ones they borrow at. In other words, they have little incentive to raise the interest they pay on deposits and cut into their profit margins. Following liftoff in December 2015, deposit rates mostly stayed flat. Between the third quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, Bank of America Corp.'s (BAC) average rates stayed at 0.08%, according to SEC filings. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) rose by a rounding error, from 0.14% to 0.15%. Wells Fargo & Co.'s (WFC) rose from 0.11% to 0.16%, but that's still less than $2 earned per $1,000 per year. The three banks held almost $3.9 trillion in combined deposits at the end of the third quarter. At some point deposit rates are likely rise due to competition among banks for customers. But unlike rate changes that make the banks money – like raising the prime rate – it will take longer than a few hours. (See also, How Will Rising Rates Impact the Banking Sector?) As a result of this lag, banks can expect fatter profit margins, and investors are responding accordingly. Bank of America's stock has risen 2.9% to $23.26 from Tuesday's close to 1:49 p.m. Thursday, while JPMorgan's has risen 1.9% to $86.39. Wells Fargo, perhaps due to the ongoing fracas over the debit cards it opened in customers' names without their knowledge, has seen its shares slip slightly. In a webcast on Tuesday, DoubleLine Capital chief investment officer Jeffrey Gundlach linked Fed tightening to rising 10-year Treasury yields, which he said could reach the psychologically important level of 3% in the next year. A sell-off in government debt could accelerate the bear market in bonds, which began to take hold almost immediately after Donald Trump's election victory. (See also, Trump Win Shocks Bond Market With $1 Trillion Loss Globally.) ""We're getting to the point where further rises in Treasuries, certainly above 3%, would start to have a real impact on market liquidity in corporate bonds and junk bonds,"" Gundlach said. He added that equities and housing could also suffer: ""a 10-year Treasury above 3% in my view starts to bring into question some of the aspects of the stock market and of the housing market in particular."" Bond yields move in the opposite direction to their prices; since yields are closely correlated to the federal funds rate, monetary tightening implies a bond rout, particularly when trillions of dollars' worth of government bonds have been bid up to the point that they trade with negative yields. The relationship between the federal funds rate and equity prices is less direct. Since higher rates serve to reign in borrowing and spending, they can impact companies' bottom lines, particularly in industries that depend on discretionary – and often debt-fueled – consumer spending. Higher rates also make it more difficult for companies to borrow, meaning that the pace of hiring, capital investment, acquisitions and stock repurchases slows. Finally, the ability to receive a decent return from safer investments such as Treasuries and even – some day – savings accounts makes the stock market a less appealing destination for capital. (See also, How Interest Rates Affect the Stock Market.) As higher rates make investing in Treasuries and other safe, dollar-denominated assets more attractive, capital floods out of other countries, particularly risky emerging markets. The result is that the dollar gains against other currencies, which can have profound implications for trade and, in a thoroughly trade-skeptical environment, politics. (See also, How Inflation Expectations and the Dollar Can Both Surge.) The value of the euro, for example, decreased by nearly 1.9% to $1.0428 between Tuesday and 2:40 p.m. Thursday, leading to predictions that the two currencies would soon reach parity. While a one-to-one exchange rate is an arbitrary level, observers focus on it because of its psychological importance: since the financial crisis, the eurozone has been buffeted by deflation, high unemployment, dormant growth, sovereign debt scares, the prospect of bank failures – which could potentially set off another financial crisis – the fallout from Brexit and a vocal anti-euro contingent in almost every country (ironically, euroskeptics are increasingly allied across borders, increasing their effectiveness). If a euro can't buy a dollar when French and German voters head to the polls next year, François Fillon and Angela Merkel's prospects will look bleaker, and the single currency's future will be in question. The Fed's hike has driven the dollar up against another key currency, the yuan, by 0.6% over the same period. Behind the European Union and Canada (where the currency has also fallen against the dollar), China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner. It has assumed outsized political importance due to Trump's emphasis on the U.S.'s trade deficit with China and his claim – apparently false – that China is holding down the value of the yuan in order increase the attractiveness of its exports. (See also, Billionaire Kyle Bass Anticipates 30% Drop in Chinese Yuan.) By the same token, the dollar's strength will make American exports more expensive, further squeezing the manufacturing sector that accounts for around 9% of U.S. employment but a significantly larger share of the political conversation.

(SKX) is on a tear, seeing gains almost daily since its earnings report and announced insider purchase. Skechers hadn’t been on investors' radar because it seemed as though it wasn’t doing anything to drive excitement while peers Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas were consistently making headlines. However, Skechers was quietly making strides in International Wholesale and Global Retail, and it appears to have potential for geographic expansion as it increases its exposure in Asia. Last quarter, gross margin increased by 40 basis points. While Skechers suffered from narrower retail margins and a weaker product sales mix, those factors were offset by wider margins in domestic wholesale. On the top line, Skechers delivered a 10.10% year-over-year gain. Earnings declined 2.20%, but Skechers Chief Executive Officer, Robert Greenberg, bought 500,000 shares valued at $11 million. This played a significant role in the stock’s push higher because it indicated insider confidence in the company. If you look at the big picture for Skechers, it’s not a turnaround story because there was nothing to turn around. Consider the revenue and net income numbers for the past three fiscal years:  FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 Revenue $1.85 billion $2.39 billion $3.16 billion Net Income $55 million $139 million $232 million Based on the more recent news, Buckingham analyst Scott Krasik upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral” and raised his price target to $31 from $21. He wrote the following in a note to clients: ""While fundamentals will likely remain under pressure for the next one to two quarters, as we indicated in recent research, Skechers' ability to reduce inventory after 2016 diminishes the risk of another major negative EPS revision in the near-term."" According to CNBC, Sam Poser, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group, rated SKX a “buy” and raised his price target to $30 from $27. He said, “They do a ton of business in novelty kids shoes, brown comfort shoes, work category, women's active, etc. and they're doing well. You've got to do what you do well. I mean you could argue that Nike does a lousy job getting 55-year-old men wanting their comfort shoes. But should they be working on that? Not necessarily.” Poser makes a valid point. Wells Fargo has also initiated coverage on SKX with an ""outperform"" rating and set a price target of $31. SKX is currently trading at $27.54. ",Why Has Skechers Soared? (SKX) | Investopedia
Nick Wells,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Muhtar Kent is in good company. Coca Cola announced Friday morning that its CEO is stepping down, effective May 1 of next year. Kent will remain as chairman of the company; President and CEO James Quincey will take the helm. As of the end of October 2016, 59 chief executives of S&P 500 companies have either retired, resigned or been terminated, effective by the end of the year, according to corporate data firm Equilar. That figure is higher than in recent years. It indicates that in 2016, more than 10 percent of big-cap companies announced turnover at the top level. Put another way, that's more than one announced departure every week. The departing CEOs have left for a variety of reasons. In October alone, we had retirement announcements, voluntary resignations and less-than-voluntary resignations. Hershey's chief John Bilbrey stepped down effective next summer to spend more time with his family. He's been with the company since 2011. Visa head Charlie Scharf stepped down for personal reasons, effective Dec. 1. Wells Fargo chairman and CEO John Stumpf stepped down following the revelation that the bank's community banking division had opened up to 2 million accounts for customers without their knowledge. Caterpillar's Doug Oberhelman will retire in January, after the company's big bet on machinery and equipment didn't pay off. Oberhelman was with the firm for a total of 41 years, including the time before he was chief executive. The average S&P 500 CEO tenure was around 7.4 years as of 2014, according to a previous Equilar study. That's up from 6.6 years in 2005. The next four years will see a reconfiguration of businesses' relationship to politics, and it's anyone's guess how that will affect CEO tenure. Investors reacted to Coca Cola's pre-market news positively on Friday, sending the stock up about 2.5 percent. ","Coke's Muhtar Kent is the latest, but CEO turnover is on the rise"
Diana Olick,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Mortgage rates are now sitting solidly at the highest level in two years and could move even higher in the coming weeks. Granted, December is not exactly the hottest season for the housing market — homes don't top the holiday gift list — but in January, all eyes move to the all-important spring season. This, coming after the Federal Reserve's expected rate increase on Wednesday. Even before a Fed move, the average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage shot up from record lows immediately after the presidential election, as investors piled into the stock market and sold out of the bond market [mortgage rates loosely follow the yield of the U.S. 10-year Treasury]. They then continued to move slowly higher, with the resulting move going from about 3.5 percent to now 4.25 percent. The last time rates moved by that much, in June 2013, home sales suffered and house price gains dropped by half. This time around, however, there is great debate over whether rising rates really matter to housing. After all, increasing rates are indicative of a stronger economy, and a stronger economy favors housing. ""If interest rates are rising because the economy is growing more rapidly, then, typically, incomes also rise, and the rise in incomes offset the increase in the size of the mortgage payment, and housing goes just fine,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae, in a recent interview with National Mortgage News. Income growth is surely a driving factor for homeownership, but buying a home is the most emotional purchase a consumer can make. While a majority of current and prospective homeowners view the U.S. real estate market favorably, there is greater concern about how an increase in the Fed's benchmark interest rate, expected to be announced Wednesday, will hit housing affordability. A report released Tuesday by Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, a real estate brokerage, found 76 percent of current homeowners and 79 percent of prospective homeowners cite increasing interest rates as a challenge impacting today's housing market; those are 16 and 8 percentage-point jumps, respectively, from the same time last year — just before the central bank raised its benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade. The survey also showed an increased number of buyers and owners would feel anxious if rates were to rise further. Perception is everything in housing. ""Mortgage rates remain near historic lows, although it may not seem that way to recent, first-time buyers and those considering a home purchase,"" said Stephen Phillips, president of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. Real estate experts at Redfin, another real estate brokerage, predict that rates will not move that much higher in 2017, in fact no higher than 4.3 percent on the 30-year fixed. They also expect that access to credit will be easier: ""In 2016, large financial institutions such as Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Quicken all introduced mortgages requiring as little as 1 percent to 3 percent down. We expect increases in the availability of low down payment mortgages to draw more millennial buyers into the housing market,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin. Researchers at Zillow, a property listing and analytics company, surveyed consumer housing trends and found that buying a home is less tied to current mortgage rates and more closely linked to a consumer's financial well-being. Life events, such as job changes, promotions or change in the number of people in the household are the precipitating factors for a purchase. ""While those looking to buy a home are understandably concerned about the path of rates ahead, it's important to remember that borrowing costs remain exceptionally low by historical standards,"" said Erin Lantz, vice president of mortgages at Zillow. ""Rising rates may impact the location or size of the home they hope to purchase, but buyers that are fully committed to buying a home are unlikely to be swayed by the FOMC's [Federal Open Market Committee] decision to raise rates."" Still, affordability is weakening for those who want to buy, especially first-time buyers. The number of homes available to the average first-time buyer fell more than 12 percent compared with 2015, according to Trulia, another real estate listing site owned by Zillow. Starter homes make up less than one-quarter of available listings nationwide, while premium homes make up half. In addition, average first-time buyer households will need to spend 39 percent of monthly income to buy a home, which is nearly a 2 percentage-point increase over 2015. The greatest barrier to a robust spring housing market next year is not, however, higher mortgage rates — it is lack of supply. Listings dropped throughout 2016 compared with 2015 and show no signs of improving. While there are some signs of home price gains easing, especially in California, one of the nation's largest and priciest housing markets, sales cannot increase if there aren't more homes to buy. Homebuilders are still operating at well below historical norms, and while they increase production little by little, it is not nearly enough. Sellers are also staying put. ""We've seen housing tenure increase the past few years, and turnover is low relative to historical averages,"" said Richardson of Redfin. ""The typical homeowner stays in their home twice as long as they did 15 years ago. An increase in rates will serve to strengthen this trend towards longer tenure and lock homeowners into their low-rate mortgages."" This happened after the rate jump in 2013 as well, and conditions for sellers are worse today — first and foremost that it's harder to find an affordable trade-up home. There is also more incentive for homeowners to trade up but keep their current home to rent. ""For a homeowner who has the gift of a 3.5 percent (or lower) 30-year fixed rate, it may pay to keep their home as an investment property even if they do decide to trade up,"" added Richardson. ",How rising rates may not matter for housing
Evelyn Cheng,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Stocks have surged so quickly in the past few weeks that a gauge of enthusiasm in the Dow Jones industrial average has hit its highest level in 20 years. And for now, some strategists are on the alert for a near-term pullback in the market. The technical indicator is called the relative strength index, or RSI, and it shows the relative size of gains versus losses for an underlying market index, usually over 14 trading days. Whenever the RSI climbs above a 70 to 75 range that signals the underlying index is getting expensive. For the Dow, its 14-day RSI rose above 80 for several days this month to hit 87.4 on Tuesday, the highest since the 87.8 level hit on Nov. 25, 1996. ""That indicates to me that there are an overwhelming amount of buyers. The fact that it hasn't hit that mark since 1996 just shows you how aggressive these buyers are being,"" J.C. Parets, founder of Allstarcharts, said in an email. ""A correction, either through time or price, is certainly warranted,"" Parets said, referring to a possible 10 percent drop in stocks. He added, however, that ""overbought conditions are a positive, not a negative, from any kind of structural perspective."" Robert Sinche, global strategist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, pointed out that late November 1996 was just days before then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan gave his famous ""irrational exuberance"" speech. His Dec. 5 talk of that year discussed whether stocks were getting too expensive and prone to a sharp sell-off. ""RSI is just an indicator there's a lot of optimism, a lot of enthusiasm in markets, which opened up an opportunity for something to go wrong and a case for a correction. The Fed announcement opened up a correction in many markets,"" Sinche said. The question, he said, is whether the sell-off ""persists."" The Dow's relative strength index held above 80 Thursday as stocks resumed their rise following the Dow's worst day in two months Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve surprised markets by forecasting three interest rate hikes next year. It's worth noting, of course, that after the late 1996 high in the Dow technical indicator and Greenspan's ""irrational exuberance"" comment, the Dow continued to rally for the next three quarters before pausing. ""The strongest markets can stay overbought for long periods of time; thus, we have been treating the stretched indicator as a condition, not a sickness, for much of this rally,"" Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet, said in an email. U.S. stocks rallied to all-time highs on hopes of promised tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation after President-elect Donald Trump won the election. The 30-stock Dow Jones index has leaped more than 8.5 percent since then, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. ""The most probable scenario now is the market continues going up, but at a slower pace,"" said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Strategists' expectations for stock performance next year vary widely, he said, because ""for the first time in a few years, we've got a variety of things that could do really well for stocks or disappoint that could lead to a less rosy outcome.""

"Eric Dezenhall, CEO of Dezenhall Resources",12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump has shown every sign that he will lead as president the way he campaigned — by picking fights on Twitter and in the media.  Specifically, he will likely continue to single out specific businesses and institutions — and their leaders — as he has done in recent days with Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Carrier, Chuck Jones of United Steelworkers 1999, and drug companies. Trump's unilateral cancellation via Twitter of Boeing's $4 billion contract to build new Air Force Ones (Tweet: ""Cancel order!"") was especially potent because its caprice bypassed a long and complex system for the awarding of contracts.  Such an action, if it comes to pass, will have a huge impact on Boeing's business.  And even if the contract remains, Boeing has been thrown into turmoil. I have been hearing the sound of teeth-gnashing from corner offices across the republic because Trump's policy-by-tantrum style presents a crisis for businesses that find themselves in his crosshairs for a simple reason: Big companies hate to be anywhere near controversy.  They prefer to duck and work things out behind the scenes.  (Trump doesn't do anything behind the scenes).  This is because it is well understood — but never acknowledged — that whoever is called front and center to defend their companies in times of controversy is likely to lose their job.  Think JetBlue's David Neeleman, BP's Tony Hayward, Target's Gregg Steinhafel and Wells Fargo's John Stumpf. Trump's antics are effective because they put corporations in a conundrum they've never faced before: Do they defend themselves vigorously and risk angering the president? Do they capitulate and change a business practice to get the heat off?  Or, do they stay quiet and hope the storm passes? Complicating matters is how Trump decides which businesses and leaders are naughty or nice: He chooses his targets in part by who and what he sees on TV and what's said about him. Corporate America has no model for dealing with guerrilla-style attacks from the leader of the free world. Businesses make and sell stuff; they are not qualified to be contestants in reality TV. There are a few things corporations need to consider as they puzzle through the Trump phenomenon. One corporate honcho half-jokingly said to me recently, ""Should I get my CEO to go on TV to flatter Trump in the hope that he cuts us a break?""  The question isn't crazy.  It's worth noting that Boeing is contributing $1 million to Trump's inauguration (as it has in past inaugurations) despite the president-elect's attack on its contract.  Not exactly coming out swinging, is it?  But then again, Boeing has lots of business with the government so capitulation may be the better of their bad options. Nevertheless, under the Trump regime, companies need to revisit their time-tested approach of media avoidance.  After all, in Trump's eyes, you're not a player if you're not on TV. Which brings us to the issue of fighting back.  Former journalists who have come to work for my crisis-management firm are stunned when they realize that some of the largest companies in the world often don't even have one person who is ready and willing to go on TV and defend their company.  Given how high the stakes have become, however, companies now have no choice but to prepare themselves for a reality TV landscape where one presidential sucker-punch can wipe out billions of dollars of wealth in seconds — which is exactly what happened last week when Trump said he planned to go after drug companies over pricing. However, companies probably shouldn't overrespond because it's only a matter of time (perhaps a few minutes) until Trump decides to vaporize another target.  Accordingly, the best response would probably be proportional and medium to medium (TV to TV). Companies need to triage how and whether to respond to a Trump attack.  Perhaps the biggest variable is whether there is likely to be a business impact as there surely will be if Trump cancels Boeing's contract or if he seeks to regulate drug pricing.  If the decision is made to fight back, the next question is who does it?  The CEO?  It's not always wise to ratchet PR battles right to the corner office.  In fact, companies like Goldman Sachs have made effective use of other executives who are simply good at doing media combat.  Then there are surrogates — rank-and-file employees or issue experts that may be harder to demonize than the head honcho.  As a touchstone, in this election cycle, Kellyanne Conway established the gold standard for surrogate performance. The media, historically, hasn't had much affection for big businesses and institutions but many journalists are beginning to view Trump's tactics as a slippery slope of unrestrained bullying and might be more willing to give companies a hearing than in the past. One thing is for certain: Corporations are going to have to expand their communications bag-of-tricks if they're going to survive in this brave, new Trump world. ",Yikes!

Anita Balakrishnan,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"BB&T was the first of a slew of banks that announced Wednesday that it would increase its prime rate to 3.75 percent, effective immediately. JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank, Citi, HSBC, PNC, SunTrust and BMO Harris also announced they would raise their prime lending rate to 3.75 percent, effective Thursday. Bank of America raised its prime lending rate to 3.75 percent, effective immediately. The prime rate is the rate at which individual banks lend to their most creditworthy customers, including large corporations. It is often used as a benchmark for other loans like credit card and small-business loans. The bank announced the change after a decision from the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates for the second time in a decade. The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday raised its target range from 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent to 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. The overnight funds rate currently sits at 0.41 percent. The committee also approved a quarter-point increase in the discount, or primary credit, rate, from 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The Federal Reserve has no direct influence on the prime rate, but the central bank does set the target federal funds rate, to which the prime rate tends to be closely correlated. Raising the short-term borrowing costs for banks can prod them to increase certain other rates. Lending out at slightly higher rates could give a small boost to bank earnings in the coming quarters. The S&P Bank ETF dipped about half a percent after the Fed's decision was released, despite a brief surge immediately after the decision. Variable rate credit cards and adjustable rate mortgages could be affected from the Fed's December rate move, experts told CNBC. Still, a quarter-point rate hike has an almost inconsequential impact on the monthly budget of the average consumer. The rates that most people pay for auto loans or college tuition, and the yields on savings accounts, aren't expected to jump right away, as the Fed's benchmark interest rate has limited influence on those things. After years of the easiest monetary policy in U.S. history, the Fed in December 2015 approved a quarter-point increase in its target federal funds rate. After that, banks like Wells Fargo raised their prime rate to 3.5 percent. It had been at 3.25 percent since 2008, according to the Federal Reserve's weekly surveys of the 25 largest banks. North Carolina-based BB&T and Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp are among the largest financial services companies in the U.S. ",Interest rates: Bank prime rates after the Federal Reserve meeting
Elizabeth Gurdus,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Loosened federal regulations are in focus with Donald Trump about to take office, but the financial sector has been in a government-imposed ""time out"" for far too long, AIG's chief investment officer, Doug Dachille, told CNBC on Thursday. ""The regulation of the banking system was a natural response, because when I think about regulation, it's like disciplining your children, and the financial crisis was like your children doing something really bad,"" Dachille told ""Squawk Box."" Dachille likened the situation to parents coming home to a 17-year-old having burned down their house. A severe response is expected, he said, but a nearly eight-year-long time out becomes excessive and ""extremely inconvenient."" The investment chief acknowledged that bad incentives lead to regulatory consequences, like Wells Fargo's illegal sales practices for which the bank paid a $185 million fine in September. But when the government all but eliminates risk from the financial sector by directing where and to whom big banks can lend, the prospective borrowers who need loans the most, like small businesses, tend to suffer, Dachille said. He said a loosening of Dodd-Frank, which was the government's direct regulatory response to the 2008 crisis, would encourage banks to lend to those who need it, in turn affecting the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy over the coming years. ""I think you have to really rethink what the path of rate policy will be if you actually have banks willing to lend again,"" he said, adding that the Fed would probably only raise rates twice in 2017, as opposed to its three-hike projection.

Jeff Daniels,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Amazon Go's new smart convenience store format designed to eliminate checkout lines is catching the attention of big supermarket chains and could pressure them to redouble in-store innovation efforts. ""I think it's definitely going to make other retailers stand up and take notice,"" said Patricia Orsini, an analyst at eMarketer. ""It's addressing a lot of the pain points that people have in terms of shopping — the amount of time spent and standing in line and that sort of thing."" Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's two largest supermarket operators, have been devoting more resources in the past few years to e-commerce and digital initiatives. However, analysts say Amazon's new store format appears to raise the bar in terms of automated technology by offering a grab-and-go solution that could some day be scaled to larger supermarkets. There's only one Amazon Go location at present and it's in a private beta test currently with only Amazon employees and located around the corner from the company's Seattle headquarters. The company plans to open the store to the public in early 2017. ""The technology has a lot of potential to really be game changing in the way people shop,"" said Joseph Feldman, a retail analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. Amazon Go's brick-and-mortar convenience store utilizes a smartphone app when the shopper enters the location and can detect when they pick up or return items to the store's shelves. It keeps track of purchases using a virtual cart, and when the shopping experience is complete the customer leaves without waiting in checkout lines and gets sent a receipt. ""I don't think there's a huge barrier toward a Kroger to set something like that up,"" said Zachary Fadem, a retail analyst at Wells Fargo. ""Kroger is already far along on kind of the brick-and-mortar technology initiatives."" Mike Schlotman, Kroger's CFO, was asked about the Amazon Go news on Wednesday at a Barclay's investor conference and appeared to downplay the rival firm's news. ""It's another competitor out there and we've certainly done things inside our stores,"" Schlotman said, according to a transcript of the event. ""Our average wait time before you start checking out at a Kroger store is almost three-and-a-half minutes lower than it was a few years ago by a one-time investment in technology."" Kroger declined comment for this story. Amazon Go's automated checkout technology can also reduce the need for cashiers and lower the overall labor costs for retailers. Still, analysts say shrinkage via theft might be a concern with a format such as Amazon Go once it opens to the general public. They point out that self-checkout programs historically produce a greater theft issue for retailers. Indeed, some grocery chains such as Albertson's began eliminating self-checkout lanes in stores several years ago due to theft concerns. The e-commerce giant started working on the Amazon Go concept about four years ago. It follows Amazon's tests of a drive-thru grocery format and a brick-and-mortar bookstore in Seattle. The company also has taken the step of registering the Amazon Go trademark in Britain, according to the Guardian. The Amazon Go store is about 1,800 square feet in size, or roughly the equivalent of an average GameStop store. Amazon already is a major player in the roughly $800 billion annual revenue grocery space through several e-grocery delivery services, including its Amazon Fresh and a faster service known as Prime Now. ""They are serious about grocery,"" said John Blackledge, an industry analyst at Cowen who covers Amazon. ""[Amazon] Go seems like an incredible step up from any kind of convenience store that I've ever seen."" The Wall Street Journal has reported that Amazon could eventually want to have more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar stores but the e-commerce company has insisted that's not the case. ""We have no plans to open 2,000 of anything."" Amazon said in a statement. Not even close. We are still learning."" Yet an industry source not affiliated with Amazon said they've become aware the company met with real estate professionals and is eyeing thousands of sites nationally. ""They're interested in seeing what's available,"" the source said. ""Whether they act on it or not is a different story."" Separately, The Wall Street Journal said, ""We are confident in our sources and stand by our original reporting."" According to Amazon's website, the new smart store offers a ""just walk out shopping experience"" and uses ""the same type of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning."" ""I'm sure Kroger will look at it,"" said William Kirk, an industry analyst at RBC Capital. Cincinnati-based Kroger has conducted tests of a so-called Scan-Bag-Go technology at 15 stores in its hometown and also has curbside pickup available at certain locations in the U.S. Meantime, Wal-Mart has expanded its test of online grocery ordering and store pickup services to include around 600 locations in over 100 markets. Orders are filled from local superstores and use the Arkansas-based retailer's smartphone app and geo-fencing technology that can recognize when customers are arriving to pick up orders. Even the membership stores are introducing out solutions to eliminate the hassle of long checkout lines. Wal-Mart's Sam's Club membership-store chain recently started using a smartphone-based technology known as Scan & Go that allows customers to scan items and leave the club store without waiting in the regular checkout lines.

"Stacy Rapacon, special to CNBC.com",12152016,CNBC,12082016,"More and more lucky workers have the opportunity to really brighten their financial pictures in 2016: They're getting year-end bonuses. Three-quarters of companies plan to give employees a cash bonus this year, up from 67 percent last year, according to a report from staffing firm Accounting Principals. While it may be tempting to treat yourself and blow it all on something fun, you can use the extra income in better ways to maximize the value of your bonus. ""Targeting a big whack of money towards a single goal — like paying down debt, a vacation, retirement — will be more gratifying than the drip, drip of steady saving,"" said Meg Bartelt, a financial planner and founder of Flow Financial Planning in Bellingham, Washington. ""So don't squander the opportunity."" Bartelt recommends first using your windfall to tackle credit-card debt. Not only will you enjoy the budgetary and psychological relief of clearing or chipping away at a balance, you can also save big on interest-rate charges. Next, Bartelt suggests fully stocking your emergency fund, which can prevent you from digging yourself into more debt, if an unexpected cost were to come up. You want to have at least three months' worth of cash to cover necessary expenses. Depending on your personal situation and risk tolerance, you may want to save even more. For example, if you have an unsteady income or you're unsure of your employment status, having more money on hand — up to a year's worth of costs, if you can manage it — is a good idea. You might also want to beef up your emergency fund if the current state of financial markets and the economy makes you queasy. ""More savings — and less spending — in general gives you more money, and money gives you power and flexibility,"" said Bartelt. ""If you're feeling afraid and uncertain, power and flexibility are likely a good antidote."" Once you're square with those first two financial goals, you may want to use your bonus to increase savings for other goals, such as retirement, college funding or buying a house. Where should you stash your cash? For any short-term goals — and your emergency fund — Ken Tumin, a banking expert at DepositAccounts.com, recommends online savings accounts, certificates of deposit and high-yield checking accounts to make the most of your money. These types of deposit accounts offer relatively easy access, as well as generally higher yields than you'll find elsewhere. For example, Ally Bank's online savings account currently offers 1 percent interest. It also has no minimum balance requirement or monthly maintenance fee. By comparison, Wells Fargo's Way2Save Savings account yields  0.01 percent, requires a $25 minimum opening deposit and charges a $5 monthly service fee, unless certain requirements are met. For your long-term goals, consider adding your bonus to your investment portfolio. Putting in a lump sum would net you more than entering the market bit by bit. For all rolling 12-month periods starting each month between January 1926 and August 2014, a lump sum invested in a diversified portfolio performed better a majority of the time compared with dollar-cost averaging over three-, six- and 12-month periods, according to a study by financial services provider TIAA-CREF. ""When people get bonuses at the end of the year, there's a tendency to want to go slowly,"" said Richard Graziadei, managing director with the investment management group at TIAA. ""But particularly for allocated portfolios, you simply tend to do better by putting your money in right away. The more time you spend in the markets, rather than keeping some money in cash, the more money you make."" Of course, going the financially responsible route is not the most fun you can have with your money. ""If you will feel deprived by being prudent with 100 percent of the bonus, and therefore more likely to sabotage your own efforts, then spend some, say 10 percent, on yourself,"" said Bartelt. ""If you put 90 percent to good financial use, you'll be way ahead of the curve."" ",Smart ways to spend your year-end bonus

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The biggest banks in the United States continue to get bigger every year. But just how big they've gotten depends on how you measure size. After discussing the most common way banks are sized by analysts and commentators, I introduce a second way: ranking the biggest banks by the amount of capital on their balance sheets. The traditional way to gauge bank size is by the value of assets on bank balance sheets. This is why so many authors, myself included, often refer to the, say, 10 biggest banks by assets. By this measure, the bank at the top of the industry is JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), with $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. It's followed by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C), respectively, which have assets ranging from $1.8 trillion in Citigroup's case up to $2.2 trillion in the case of Bank of America. But using assets to measure a bank's size can be misleading. This is because banks are highly leveraged companies. That is, they borrow a lot of money -- indeed, pound for pound more than any another industry. In this way, banks are more akin to hedge funds than they are to the prototypical manufacturing or retail company. The big difference, however, is that banks borrow money very inexpensively, by way of customer deposits. You might not think of the money in your checking or savings account as a loan to your bank -- after all, it generates little to no interest income at current interest rates -- but that's exactly what it is. Your bank uses that money to invest in assets, either by making loans or by investing it in interest-earning securities, such as government bonds. In Bank of America's case, for instance, it has $270 billion worth of shareholders' equity -- in other words, capital. This is what's left over after you subtract its liabilities from its assets. Look at that number for a second; it equates to only about 12% of Bank of America's assets. The remaining 88% of its assets are financed by debt -- $1.2 trillion worth of deposits and about $700 billion worth of other types of liabilities, including bonds and credit lines from other banks or institutional investors. Measured in this way -- by capital -- it turns out the Bank of America is the biggest bank in the United States, as JPMorgan Chase has only $254 billion worth of capital on its balance sheet. The top four biggest banks by capital are rounded out by Citigroup at $232 billion and Wells Fargo at $203 billion. Here are the 10 biggest bank stocks by capital: Bank Capital (Millions of Dollars) Bank of America $270,083 JPMorgan Chase $254,331 Citigroup $231,575 Wells Fargo $203,028 Capital One Financial $48,213 U.S. Bancorp $47,759 PNC Financial Services Gr $45,707 Bank of New York Mellon $39,695 BB&T $30,052 SunTrust Banks $24,449 Data source: YCharts.com. For investors in these banks, the amount of capital listed in the table above should be reassuring. I say that because it represents the magnitude of losses in future crises that these banks can absorb before being rendered insolvent. This doesn't mean that banks like Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase can't or won't get into trouble in the future. But it does mean that, absent truly extraordinary and unprecedented losses, they should be able to make it through even the toughest of economic times. ","

A flag outside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. After analysts and commentators had predicted an interest-rate hike for most of 2016, the Federal Reserve finally came through for them. The central bank concluded its latest monetary policy committee meeting on Wednesday by releasing a statement saying that it had decided to boost the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage points. This is great news for banks, which stand to make a lot more money when rates rise, and none more so than Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). ""In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent,"" says the Fed's press release. ""In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."" US Target Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. The move didn't come as a shock. Going into Wednesday, an analysis of Fed Fund futures prices, which gauge the market's view on changes in monetary policy, tagged the likelihood of an increase at 95%. Much of the optimism was tied to the fact that the unemployment figures for November were surprisingly good. The unemployment rate last month dropped to 4.6%, down from 4.9% in October. That's well below the Fed's 5% target and it's the lowest the unemployment rate has been since August 2007. US Unemployment Rate data by YCharts. Another sign that the Fed's decision wasn't a surprise can be surmised from the fact that bank stocks barely budged today. Shares of JPMorgan Chase were essentially flat, Bank of America closed 0.27% higher, and Citigroup was down by 0.57%. The one exception among the nation's biggest banks was Wells Fargo, which saw its share price drop by 2%. But that had less to do with interest rates, and more to do with the Fed's announcement after the market closed on Tuesday that Wells Fargo had failed to remedy defects in its so-called living will that regulators had identified back in April -- click here to read more about this. For investors in bank stocks who have waited patiently for rates to rise, this is unquestionably a positive development. One way to think about banks is that, by making loans, they effectively sell money. And interest rates are the price at which they do so. As rates rise, in turn, so too will bank profits. All banks will benefit from this trend, but Bank of America is positioned to benefit the most. According to its latest quarterly regulatory filing, its 10-Q, Bank of America's net interest income will increase by $5.3 billion over the next 12 months if short- and long-term rates rise by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point. Bank of America obviously won't see the entirety of that $5.3 billion in added net interest income just yet, given that the Fed boosted short-term rates by only a quarter of that amount. But the North Carolina-based bank will benefit from a portion of the increase. And even more importantly, the Fed's decision to hike rates is a clear signal that the economy is heading in the right direction. ","

Image source: Dave & Buster's. Dave & Buster's (NASDAQ:PLAY) was one of last week's biggest winners. Shares of the company behind big-box restaurants that combine casual dining, sports bars, and massive high-tech gaming arcades soared 20.3% after posting another blowout quarter. At least two analysts boosted their price targets on the stock following the report, with one of them playing the stock up as a beneficiary of Donald Trump's presidential win last month. A strong report isn't really a surprise at Dave & Buster's. It has beaten analyst profit targets with ease in each and every quarter since its return as a public company two years ago. Last week's report was another beauty. Revenue clocked in at $228.7 million for its third quarter, 19% ahead of where it landed a year earlier. It had no trouble attracting customers with comps rising 5.9%. Scoring double-digit top-line growth is also easy when you grow your empire from 77 to 88 locations over the past year, but even with the aggressive expansion analysts were only targeting 12% in revenue growth. Net income more than doubled to $0.25 a share. Wall Street pros were settling for just $0.14 a share. Dave & Buster's has managed to beat analyst profit forecasts every quarter by at least a double-digits percentage, though landing 79% ahead of market expectations is its second biggest beat since going public at $16 two years ago. BMO Capital analyst Andrew Strelzik is sticking to his bullish Outperform rating on the stock, boosting his price target from $48 to $59. He is saying that this could be the ""ultimate Trump trade"" given the president-elect's vow for federal corporate tax rate reform. Strelzik points out that the eatertainment chain has been shelling out an average effective tax rate of roughly 37% over the past few years. The Dave & Buster's model is already a scalable one, fueled by high-margin entertainment offerings that make up a little more than half of its revenue. You won't find too many restaurant chains where food and beverage combine to account for just 44% of the revenue mix. Earnings have historically outpaced revenue growth. If Trump is successful in lowering corporate tax rates it could result in yet another boost to the bottom line. If Trump is also able to execute a reduction in personal federal income tax rates it could trigger a spike in consumer spending, another reason why Strelik is high on Dave & Buster's. The high-end arcades provide a nostalgic escape for well-to-do adults, playing redemption games for tickets that can be used to score legit prizes. This isn't just ""Chuck E. Cheese for adults."" It's Chuck E. Cheese for adults with disposable income to throw at flashy diversions. Wells Fargo also boosted its price target on the stock, taking its goal from a range of $52 to $55 up to $57 to $60. Wells Fargo is encouraged by the solid fundamentals and its resilience, arguing that Dave & Buster's isn't as vulnerable to industry lulls as its casual dining peers. Dave & Buster's has been doing just fine in its brief return as a public company. It has sidestepped the ""restaurant recession"" that tripped up other eateries that fell into negative comps earlier this year. If federal and personal tax rates head lower, at least one Wall Street analyst feels that this is the stock to own. ","

The opening of the new Wynn Palace in Macau is credited with halting the two-year slide in the region's gaming revenues, but it couldn't maintain the momentum. Image source: Wynn Palace. The big jump in Macau gaming revenues suggests the recovery underway in the Chinese gambling enclave is real. After a scant 1% rise in August that stopped a 26-month skein of losses in its tracks, the better-than-14% surge in November is a hearty turnabout that all casino operators welcome. Yet it's also clear the rebound is uneven. While most casinos reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, not all did. Most notably, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) missed Wall Street forecasts for its new Palace resort on Macau's Cotai Strip, causing its stock to plunge after the news. While it has regained all that lost ground, and more, over the past month, it's worth a look at why Wynn's new casino got off to a slow start while Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), which also opened a new resort on the strip, was able to beat estimates and show much-stronger results. Wynn Palace Las Vegas Sands Parisian Casino space 500,000 sq. ft. 253,000 sq. ft. Table games 346 410 Slot machines 1,082 1,600 Casino revenue $146.7 million $58.1 million Hotel guest rooms 1,706 3,000 Revenue per room $203 $121 The Palace opened Aug. 22, 2016, and The Parisian opened Sept. 13, 2016. Data source: company SEC filings. Wynn's third-quarter revenue rose 11% from last year, to $1.1 billion, which was in line with analyst estimates, but all of the gains came from the newly opened Palace, which cannibalized the existing Wynn Macau, where revenue fell by $67 million. Together, they generated $683 million in revenue, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $177 million, both well below Wall Street's estimates. In contrast, Las Vegas Sands saw total revenue grow 2.6%, to $2.97 billion, beating projections of $2.82 billion as the Parisian contributed $19.2 million of adjusted property EBITDA during the 18 days it was open in the quarter. Image source: Flickr user Azchael. Considering the Palace and the Parisian are in relatively close proximity to one another and are both targeting the same customer, why did one do well and the other less so? Partly, it's a result of the infrastructure Macau is building to accommodate the influx of tourists it is hoping to attract to the region. For example, a new light-rail system is being built that, when completed, will have the Palace as its first stop, a potential benefit for the casino. However, construction makes it difficult if not dangerous for guests trying to get to the casino. On the earnings conference call with analysts, CEO Steve Wynn said it was ""an anomalous situation where all four sides of our property are currently being enclosed by either barricades or construction blockades of one kind or another."" While such conditions are beyond the control of Wynn, and the resort will have to bide its time until the construction is completed, there were other problems confronting it, some of which were self-inflicted. A too-spacious casino floor layout: As the table above indicates, the Palace's cavernous casino floor is about double the size of the Parisian, which, while not exactly an intimate setting, packs the crowds closer together, generating more excitement and electricity. A Morningstar analyst contends the Palace's slow start was ""due to the design of its large and open casino space, which is leading to the perception of thin crowds and thereby reducing the feel of compressed energy that many gamers seek."" To rectify the problem, Wynn will adjust the layout to reduce space without reducing the number of tables. Image source: Wynn Palace. Lack of casual dining options: It's not that there's a lack of dining options -- the Palace has 12 different restaurants plus the Ling Wei Bar -- but rather a lack of casual restaurants for guests to eat at. The resort hosts five separate fine dining establishments, like Mizumi and SW Steakhouse, and it has seven different casual locations, including 99 Noodles and Sweets, but because the Cotai Strip is geared toward a mass-market audience, Wynn says he underestimated the number of casual eateries he would need. In comparison, the Parisian has 10 casual dining restaurants, so to compensate, Wynn is now expanding its Red 8 chain to handle the demand, but it will be several months before the expansion is complete. A more promotional environment: Wynn's president, Matt Maddox, noted the Cotai Strip is a more promotional environment than Macau proper, though not exaggeratedly so. However, a Wells Fargo analyst estimates promotional allowances and discounts as a percentage of gross gaming revenue ran as high as 30.4% at Wynn due to opening the Palace, well above the company's usual 24%, though he's not necessarily worried at the moment. VIP business returned to Macau much more strongly than anticipated in November, and the analyst thinks that could have tilted the discounting scales in the new resort's favor. Better-situated competition: While the Palace may find its location on the light-rail line advantageous in the future, the casino is otherwise situated a good distance from the strip itself, which tourists may find off-putting (VIPs, on the other hand, if they really are back, might enjoy being out of the limelight more). In contrast, the Parisian, which is also off the strip, is located right next door to Sands' other resort, the Four Seasons. The interconnected resort layout is more attractive to guests who want to take in more than one casino. There will be more competition coming in 2017 as MGM Resorts opens its new MGM Cotai casino, Melco Crown Entertainment debuts its fifth hotel tower at City of Dreams, and the over-the-top luxury hotel The 13 opens its doors early in the year. All-new venues, lots more hotel space, and a gaming market just trying to regain its footing may prove challenging to Wynn Resorts. While many of the problems it faces are correctable, having to go in and remodel a brand new resort it just opened already puts it behind its rivals and indicates a rare miscalculation for Wynn Resorts.

The Fed and the FDIC said Wells Fargo did not remedy two out of three areas of concern: “legal entity rationalization” and “shared services.” In light of Wells Fargo’s failure, the agencies “jointly determined to impose restrictions on the growth of international and non-bank activities.” The bank has to file a revised living will by the end of March. If it is still not acceptable, the regulators will limit the size of Wells Fargo’s non-bank and broker-dealer assets to levels in place at the end of September. If the problems linger for two years, the government could force the bank to divest certain assets. In a statement, Wells Fargo said it took its revisions to the plan “very seriously,” and was “disappointed” by Tuesday’s denial. “We believe we will be able to address the concerns raised today in the March 2017 revised submission,” the bank said. Wells Fargo shares closed Tuesday trading at $55.84, up about 0.1%. Shares are up about 2.7% so far this year. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo was fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators after it was revealed that bank employees had opened about 2 million unauthorized accounts for customers.

The Corporate Equality Index rates companies based on how inclusive their policies and benefits are toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. It uses five categories as measurement: non-discrimination policies, employment benefits, LGBTQ diversity and inclusion, public commitment to LGBTQ equality and “responsible citizenship.” Of the 887 companies surveyed in this year’s report, 517 earned a perfect 100% score—the most in the 15-year history of the index.

The number of companies offering transgender-inclusive health care jumped to 647 from 511 last year. Wal-Mart is one of many companies to update its health benefits to be more inclusive and got its highest score ever — 100%, up from 40% in 2008. Also see: Why I ditched Wells Fargo for a virtual bank There are no federal laws offering the same protections on the basis of gender or sexual orientation, although there are U.S. laws that explicitly ban workplace discrimination based on race, religion and disability. In 28 states, workers can still legally be fired for their sexual orientation and President-elect Donald Trump has promised to repeal related laws protecting federal workers. Because of these and other anti-LGBTQ legislation proposed in the past years, the HRC report says, the private sector has outpaced lawmakers in implementing progressive LGBTQ policies. “We are committed to fostering an inclusive work environment for our more than 2 million associates around the globe,” a Wal-Mart spokesman told MarketWatch. It’s good publicity for a company that has frequently clashed with labor unions over pay and conditions and, in October, raised salaries for entry-level managers above the new overtime threshold.

In a nutshell, Bank of America had faced resistance around $19 or so, dating all the way back to late 2009. But after a big breakout in the past week or so, the stock has finally reached a new plateau. That’s great to see, and the stock likely will stay there … but it also seems realistic that this stock could retest those levels in the coming months. While I would be a big buyer of Bank of America around $20, I would be reluctant to add to your position here.

                                   like Bank of America, is kind of a mixed bag. It certainly has the wind at its back, but it doesn’t quite have the quality of J.P. Morgan. And while it hasn’t run afoul of consumers and regulators the same way as Wells Fargo, that doesn’t necessarily make it a slam-dunk. As an Oppenheimer analyst recently said, it’s safe to “let the bet ride” if you’re holding bank stocks like Citi right now. However, it’s undeniable that a lot of rosy conditions like better loan margins and lower credit costs have already been baked into the cake. I wouldn’t sell, but there are other bank stocks I’d rather add too … including the regionals discussed below. Regions Financial — Buy Broadly speaking, I like regionals as a group over the megabanks because the promise of “reflation” in 2017 assuredly only applies to the U.S. and not to overseas markets.

It trades for roughly book value, and while its dividend is pretty meager at 1.8%, it has aggressively been increasing distributions lately; payouts went from paying 3 cents quarterly at the beginning of 2014 to 6.5 cents for its most recent dividend, yet RF is still only paying out about a third of total earnings and has more room for increases in 2017. Growing dividends coupled with projections of nearly double-digit EPS growth in 2017 bode very well for this regional bank.

While a bit more volatile, to be sure, the bank’s focused nature is very attractive given Utah’s amazingly low 3.2% unemployment rate as of October. While states like North Dakota enjoyed a brief period of growth thanks to fracking but challenges in the age of cheap oil, Utah has a much more balanced economy and isn’t as prone to the boom-and-bust cycle. Utah’s population growth and economic growth are both in the top 10 among U.S. states for 2015, its economy has continued to thrive in 2016 and it should continue to do well in the new year — bringing institutions like People’s Utah Bancorp with it.

Canaccord reiterated its sell rating with a price target of $47, up from $44.

                                   closed Thursday up 15%,the biggest one-day gain since March 2009. On the late-Wednesday conference call, Chief Executive Laurent Potdevin made sure to “differentiate from the athleisure trend” and “how people want to live their lives.” By his estimation, Lululemon is unique in the way it approaches the consumer and how that consumer moves in his or her daily life. The call focused a great deal on fabric innovation, like the Align pant, he company’s top pant style, according to Potdevin, which uses an exclusive Nulu fabric. Lululemon just introduced the Nulu fabric, which Potdevin said is designed for “high-sweat and high-intensity training.” “[A]s long as we focus on function and innovation and delivering value to our guests, we really don’t see any risk to the market that we’ve created and the market we continue to lead,” Potdevin said, according to the FactSet transcript.

Lululemon reported adjusted earnings per share of 47 cents, beating the 43-cent FactSet consensus.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said it fined several Wells Fargo & Co businesses, RBC Capital Markets, LPL Financial and others a combined $14.4 million on Wednesday for record-keeping problems that may have allowed company and customer documents to be altered. The securities industry’s self-regulator found that the firms failed to keep hundreds of millions of electronic documents in a “write once, read many” format, which would have made it impossible to alter or destroy records after they were written. The firms agreed to the fines but neither admitted nor denied the charges. FINRA did not say documents had been changed but said the records were “pivotal to the firms’ brokerage businesses,” and that it relies on these files to ensure firms are following securities laws. The regulator said it also is concerned about the security of the records because hackers in recent years have aggressively targeted banks’ electronic storage databases. The regulator fined Wells Fargo’s securities and prime brokerage businesses $4 million, and the bank’s brokerage and independent wealth management businesses $1.5 million. FINRA also fined RBS Securities, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Georgeson Securities Corp and PNC Capital Markets amounts ranging from $2 million to $500,000. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Elise Wilkinson said the firm took record-keeping compliance seriously. “We self-reported these issues to FINRA and continue to remediate as agreed,” she said in an emailed statement. RBC declined to comment. LPL and the other companies named did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the biggest foreign investment and commercial banks operating in Britain paid an average tax rate of just 6 percent on the billions of dollars of profits they made in the country last year, a Reuters analysis of regulatory filings shows. That is less than a third of Britain's corporate rate of 20 percent. There is however nothing illegal about how they managed to reduce their taxes, and includes using losses built up during the financial crisis to offset current bills. (Graphic on UK corporation tax payments: here) Seven of the biggest international banks operating in London - Europe’s main investment banking center - have published profit and tax data ahead of a year-end deadline stipulated by EU law. Five of them, all U.S. banks, reported a profit - a combined $7.5 billion - and paid corporation tax, or corporate income tax, of $452 million. Bank of America’s two main UK investment banking subsidiaries paid no corporation tax on combined profits of $875 million. JPMorgan paid $160 million in tax on $3.3 billion in UK profits. Goldman Sachs paid $256 million tax on $2.8 billion profit, while Morgan Stanley’s main UK unit paid $33 million tax and earned $530 million. All the banks declined to comment on the data except San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which reported $2.7 million tax on $34 million profit. It said its objective was to comply with all of its tax compliance requirements. The British Bankers’ Association (BBA) said the data did not reflect the sector’s full contribution and that, including other taxes and payments, foreign banks contributed about $20 billion to the UK treasury last year. The British tax authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, said the Government had taken steps to ensure banks paid the correct amount of tax. “Many complex factors contribute to the effective rate of tax paid by corporate businesses,” a spokesman added in a emailed statement. The finance ministry was not available to comment. The 6 percent rate is still higher than the average rate of 1 percent paid for 2014 by the 10 biggest foreign investment and commercial banks that reported UK profits and taxes. British banks also disclose profit and tax amounts but these are largely related to domestic retail activities, so it is not possible to calculate the effective UK tax rate on their commercial and investment banking activities. Analysts say many other companies pay tax at below the headline rate but only banks are required to disclose tax and profit figures by country, so it is not possible to calculate the rates paid by manufacturers, builders or services companies. ‘ALL-TIME HIGH’ The opposition Labour Party said the figures showed that the government was still going soft on the banks, years after saving the sector from collapse with taxpayer funds. “These again look like alarmingly low tax rates for banks which are making eye-watering amounts of money,” said shadow finance minister John McDonnell. “This shows that this government wants to create an environment in which big firms get tax giveaways while everyone else gets spending cuts.” The data comes as banks in Britain push back against a government decision last year to increase their corporate tax rate to 28 percent this year – a move that was offset by a cut in the levy on their assets. The BBA criticized the change saying, the government risked making Britain a “less attractive place for banks”. This week, it said the low corporation tax payments would likely increase in coming years. In any case, it said combining the bank levy, value added tax, payroll taxes and income taxes paid by staff foreign banks contributed 16.8 billion pounds to the UK Exchequer in 2015. “Tax contributions by the banking sector are at an all-time high,” a BBA spokeswoman said. The levy - introduced in 2011 to help discourage risky borrowing and pay for the crisis-era banking bailouts - raised 3.4 billion pounds in 2015-16, compared with corporation tax payments by the sector of 3.2 billion pounds, the BBA said. Only one of the foreign banks published data on their bank levy payments. Merrill Lynch International said it paid a levy of $19.2 million last year, down from $47.5 million in 2014. Bank of America said in a filing that its Merrill Lynch International unit paid no corporation because of “relief obtained via the utilization of historical losses brought forward”, largely from during the global financial crisis. Accounts for other banks’ UK subsidiaries also show that they benefited from using losses built up during the crisis to offset current tax bills. Last year the government changed tax rules so that such losses may only offset half a bank’s income in any one year, partly explaining the increase in the banks’ effective tax rate compared with 2014. Other banks including JPMorgan said in the filings that since tax payments often partly cover the previous year’s earnings, the rate paid in a given year may not reflect the amount eventually paid in respect of that year’s profits. Across the UK banking sector, corporation tax payments are half what they were before the financial crisis, according to the BBA’s own tax survey, published last month. The drop is not confined to banks, and is echoed across other businesses. The ‘100 Group’ which represents around 100 of the UK’s largest companies said corporation tax payments by its members had fallen over the past decade. Tax campaigners say some companies also use complex inter-company transactions to ensure profits are actually reported in lower tax jurisdictions to minimize bills. Banks filings do sometimes show disproportionate profitability in such jurisdictions. London-based Goldman Sachs Group UK Ltd reported a $194 million profit in the Cayman Islands, which has no corporate income tax, despite employing no staff there. Citigroup reported twice as much profit at Citigroup Europe Plc, its main subsidiary in Ireland, than at its main UK subsidiary. That’s despite the UK arm employing more people than Ireland, and more senior staff - average wages at London-based Citigroup Global Markets Ltd were $288,000 per head last year compared with $48,000 at Dublin–based Citigroup Europe Plc. Ireland’s tax rate is 12.5 percent. Goldman and Citigroup declined to comment. ($1 = 0.8035 pounds) ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Japanese yen rose on Monday on safe-haven bids after separate deadly attacks in Turkey and Germany, adding to earlier buying of the currency to book profits on the dollar’s recent gains. In Ankara, an off-duty police officer opened fire and killed Russia’s ambassador to Turkey at an art gallery in the Turkish capital Ankara. Russia and Turkey have been on opposing sides of the conflict in Syria, straining relations. Later in Berlin, a truck ploughed into a crowded Christmas market, leaving at least nine dead and up to 50 injured. It was not immediate clear who was behind the attack. Currency traders typically move into the yen from the dollar and riskier currencies in times of geopolitical nervousness. “These developments contributed to market jitters and safety bids for the yen,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Earlier on Monday before the attacks, traders were selling the dollar against the yen on lower U.S. Treasury yields and data that showed Japan’s export performance improved strongly in November. The greenback has rallied since the Nov. 8 U.S. election, underpinned by expectations of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and looser federal regulations under President-elect Donald Trump. The yen was up as much as 1.2 percent against the dollar before subsiding to 117.07 yen, down 0.8 percent on the day. It hit 118.66 yen on Dec. 15, which was its weakest since Feb. 2, according to Reuters data. The Japanese currency moved 1.1 percent higher against the euro at 121.83 yen. The Turkish lira shed 0.5 percent to 3.5245 liras per dollar. The Russian ruble reversed its losses tied to the Ankara attack and was last up 0.3 percent at 61.8795 rubles to the dollar. The Federal Reserve’s hint of a possibly faster pace of interest rate increases next year helped propel the dollar last week. Fed Chair Janet Yellen revived some bids for the greenback in U.S. afternoon trading after she said the improvement in the labour market signals wages will likely pick up. “It seems like she is acknowledging the continued improvement in the jobs market. That’s pretty consistent with what she and other policymakers have been saying,” Viloria said. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against the euro, yen and four other key currencies, was up 0.18 percent at 103.140. On Dec. 15, it touched 103.56, its highest since December 2002. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield traded six basis points lower at 2.536 percent. ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s BNP Paribas said it had processed its first live payments in various currencies for two corporate clients via blockchain technology, in a further sign of the growing importance of the new technology for major banks. Blockchain is a web-based transaction-processing and settlement system, whose efficiency banks say could slash costs. It creates a “golden record” of any given set of data that is automatically replicated for all parties in a secure network, eliminating any need for third-party verification. BNP Paribas said it had processed and cleared payments in various currencies between BNP Paribas bank accounts located in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom for its clients Panini Group - an Italian card collections producer - and Australian packaging company Amcor. “The payments were fully processed and cleared in a few minutes highlighting the real potential of this innovative technology which eliminates delays, unexpected fees and processing errors, paving the way for real time cash management,” BNP Paribas said in a statement. In October, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Wells Fargo said that the first cross-border transaction between banks using multiple blockchain applications had taken place, resulting in a shipment of cotton to China from the United States.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"The proposed settlement was disclosed in papers filed in federal court in Manhattan on Friday. It came after seven other banks agreed in May to pay a combined $324 million to resolve the litigation. As part of the deal, Goldman has also agreed to provide lawyers for the plaintiffs evidence including transaction data, documents and witness interviews, which could be used in litigations against the remaining banks, the court papers said. Neither a spokesman for Goldman Sachs nor a lawyer for the plaintiffs immediately responded to a request for comment late on Friday. The case is one of many pending in Manhattan federal court accusing banks of conspiring to rig rate benchmarks, securities prices or commodities prices. In the lawsuit, several pension funds and municipalities accused 14 banks, including those that settled, of conspiring to rig the “ISDAfix” benchmark for their own gain from at least 2009 to 2012. Companies and investors use ISDAfix to price swaps transactions, commercial real estate mortgages and structured debt securities. The lawsuit accused the banks of executing rapid trades before the rate was set each day. It said the banks also caused UK brokerage ICAP Plc IAP.F to delay trades until they moved ISDAfix where they wanted, and post rates that did not reflect market activity. U.S. and European regulators have also examined whether ISDAfix was set properly. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has secured settlements of $115 million with Barclays Plc in May 2015 and $250 million with Citigroup Inc in May 2016.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"The agreement in principle, announced by Deutsche Bank’s Frankfurt headquarters early Friday morning, offers some relief to the German lender, whose stock was hit hard in September after it acknowledged the Justice Department had been seeking nearly twice as much. It also highlights the Justice Department’s recent efforts to hold European banks accountable for shoddy securities that contributed to the U.S. housing market collapse. Deutsche Bank does not plan a capital increase to cover the settlement, a person close to the bank said. The lender expects the agreement to be finalized in early 2017, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Deutsche does expect to record a pretax charge of about $1.17 billion in its fourth quarter because of the civil monetary penalty, according to its press release. As part of the agreement, Deutsche Bank would pay a civil monetary penalty of $3.1 billion and provide $4.1 billion in consumer relief, such as loan forgiveness. The bank cautioned that there is “no assurance” the two sides will agree on the final documents. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. Settling the mortgage-securities case would mean Deutsche Bank has shaken off one legal headache. Three major probes remain. Deutsche faces investigations into the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange rates, suspicious equities trades in Russia, as well as alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran and other countries. Since 2012, Deutsche Bank has already paid more than 12 billion euros for litigation, including a deal with U.S. mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Deutsche Bank’s “troubling practices” were widespread, including when trader Greg Lippmann told colleagues that many home loans the bank was packaging into securities were “crap” and “pigs,” according to a 2011 U.S. Senate subcommittee report. Lippmann has declined to comment on the report. There has been fear among investors, companies and regulators that the penalties are too much for Deutsche Bank to withstand. Its shares plunged to a record low of 9.90 euros in September, after the bank confirmed the Justice Department was demanding $14 billion. The stock has recovered substantially, but is down from the beginning of 2016. The Justice Department is still pursuing mortgage allegations against other lenders in addition to Barclays. U.S. banks have paid tens of billions of dollars over the past three years to settle with U.S. authorities over misleading investors about the quality of mortgages underlying securities. Deutsche is not the first bank to announce a settlement amount before both sides have agreed on the final documentation.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"(Reuters) - Mark Zuckerberg on Monday introduced the world to “Jarvis”, an artificial intelligence system the Facebook chief created in his spare time, which can choose and play music, turn on lights, and recognize visitors, deciding whether to open the front door. Jarvis, named after the virtual assistant in the Iron Man movies, could be a step toward a new product, Zuckerberg wrote, although he cautioned that the system he had created in 100 hours over the last year was customized for his house. (Zuckerberg post: bit.ly/2h4tuN7) Zuckerberg announced results of the project, a personal challenge he set for himself this year, as digital home assistants by Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc compete for holiday sales and are expected to outsell popular emerging gadgets such as virtual reality headsets and drones. Creating Jarvis proved humanity is “both closer and farther off” from an AI breakthrough than we imagine, Zuckerberg wrote. Computers are getting very good at pick out patterns, such as face recognition, but it is difficult to teach them new things, he wrote. “Everything I did this year — natural language, face recognition, speech recognition and so on — are all variants of the same fundamental pattern recognition techniques,” he wrote. “But even if I spent 1,000 more hours, I probably wouldn’t be able to build a system that could learn completely new skills on its own.” By the end of the year, Jarvis was able to respond to text and voice commands and it could run music, air conditioning, doors, and other systems. It could recognize visitors, start a toaster and even shoot t-shirts from a cannon in his closet. With more effort to broaden Jarvis’ use beyond Zuckerberg’s own house, the experiment “could be a great foundation to build a new product,” he wrote. A dearth of internet-connected devices, lack of common standards for connected devices to communicate and challenges related to speech recognition and machine learning were all obstacles, he said. At the same time, he said challenges lead to eureka moments. Adjustments made to help Jarvis recognize context in commands ultimately helped the system respond to less specific requests in a better fashion, such as asking the system to “play me some music”. “I’ve found we use these more open-ended requests more frequently than more specific asks. No commercial products I know of do this today, and this seems like a big opportunity,” he wrote. ","

Richard Saintvilus,12222016,Investopedia,12152016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Add the name Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) to the list of large banking institutions looking to establish a foothold in the fast-growing $4.1 trillion exchange-traded funds (ETFs) asset-management industry. The embattled San Francisco-based bank plans to launch its first-ever ETF next year, according to Bloomberg. But it won't be your typical ETF. Bloomberg, which cited company executives, noted that Wells Fargo's ETF could come within three to six months. As with the ETF's recently launched by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS), Wells Fargo's fund is poised to be of the new-age multi-factor smart beta variety. Wells Fargo, which in October acquired small quant specialist Analytic Investors LLC, has been growing its quant capabilities likely for this exact reason. (See also: When Multi-Factor ETFs Make Sense) Getting in and out of multiple asset classes within a second's time–given multiple factors–offers investors a distinct advantage over human-based trades. But these ETFs also come with tons of risk, while the reward isn't always breathtaking. Alex Bryan, director of passive-strategies research at Morningstar earlier this year called the ETF's approach more “aggressive.” Bryan explains that these ETFs should deliver higher returns when its factors are working, and trail the market in a more pronounced way when they aren’t. And while the multi-factor component is a nice selling point to investors seeking diversification, Bryan argues that the exclusion of low volatility as a factor could make these ETFs ""incrementally riskier"" during choppy markets. Not to mention their relatively high expenses, at 0.35%. Still, while some analysts regard these new ETFs as replacements for pricier actively-managed equity funds, their popularity continue to rise. As of the most recent quarter, there were almost 200 multi-factor ETFs currently on the market, managing almost $40 billion in assets, according to Morningstar. And several of these funds trail the major indexes in terms of performance. It remains to be seen whether Wells Fargo's new ETF, which may include factors such as risk parity and volatility, can outperform its peers or will it just one more name added to a long list of average, yet costly, returns.

David Floyd,12222016,Investopedia,12152016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve's interest-rate setting panel, voted unanimously on Wednesday to raise the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 0.5% to 0.75%. Stocks hardly budged as a result: the hike was modest, after all, and so thoroughly expected that fed funds futures were pricing in a 90-plus percent probability going into the decision. It's easy to come away with the impression that investors, savers and consumers should carry on as before. On the other hand, there are good reasons not to be nonchalant. The FOMC signaled three rate hikes in each of the next three years on Wednesday, a faster pace of tightening than it had projected in December, meaning that the target range could be as high as 2.75%-3.00% at the end of 2019. Given that it was 0.00%-0.25% until December 2015, that's a dramatic increase (of course the Fed chronically overestimates the rate of tightening – going by December 2014 estimates, the rate should be four times higher than it currently is). (See also, Fed Projections: Where Do Rates Go from Here?) The federal funds rate is the bedrock of the world's financial calculus. Raising it pushes up the price of money, affecting rates on everything from credit cards to corporate bonds. It pushes up the yield on Treasuries, which stands in for the so-called risk-free rate of return on which every lending decision is based. It sucks capital into the U.S., that is, out of everywhere else. The fed funds rate is so powerful that it has the potential to wreak political havoc not just at home, but also oceans away. All of which means that the list below is far from comprehensive. But it's a start. The Fed's key policy rate only applies to overnight lending between banks out of their reserves held at the Fed. In other words, it doesn't affect consumer or (non-bank) business borrowing directly, but the distinction is academic, because it is so closely linked to rates that do affect these borrowers directly. The prime rate is one. Within hours of the Fed's move, just about every major bank announced that they would raise their prime rates from 3.50% to 3.75%. This rate affects a slew of variable-rate loans, including most credit cards. Mortgages are generally linked to Treasury yields, but these are also rising due to the rate hike: the 10-year Treasury yield shot up nearly 10 basis points to 2.57% Wednesday and is above 2.62% as of 12:15 p.m. EST Thursday. Libor, another common benchmark that serves as the basis for many student loans, for example, rose to its highest level since May 2009 in response to the rate rise. In short, just about every variable-rate lending rate is likely to move more or less in line with Fed actions. Borrowers who can refinance to lock in low rates should consider doing so. Higher borrowing costs also apply to banks, which take loans from savers in the forms of deposits. In other words, the savings account that currently pays out a few bucks a year – if that – will become more generous. But don't hold your breath. Trading gains, fees and other revenue streams aside, banks profit from the spread between the rates they lend at and the ones they borrow at. In other words, they have little incentive to raise the interest they pay on deposits and cut into their profit margins. Following liftoff in December 2015, deposit rates mostly stayed flat. Between the third quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, Bank of America Corp.'s (BAC) average rates stayed at 0.08%, according to SEC filings. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) rose by a rounding error, from 0.14% to 0.15%. Wells Fargo & Co.'s (WFC) rose from 0.11% to 0.16%, but that's still less than $2 earned per $1,000 per year. The three banks held almost $3.9 trillion in combined deposits at the end of the third quarter. At some point deposit rates are likely rise due to competition among banks for customers. But unlike rate changes that make the banks money – like raising the prime rate – it will take longer than a few hours. (See also, How Will Rising Rates Impact the Banking Sector?) As a result of this lag, banks can expect fatter profit margins, and investors are responding accordingly. Bank of America's stock has risen 2.9% to $23.26 from Tuesday's close to 1:49 p.m. Thursday, while JPMorgan's has risen 1.9% to $86.39. Wells Fargo, perhaps due to the ongoing fracas over the debit cards it opened in customers' names without their knowledge, has seen its shares slip slightly. In a webcast on Tuesday, DoubleLine Capital chief investment officer Jeffrey Gundlach linked Fed tightening to rising 10-year Treasury yields, which he said could reach the psychologically important level of 3% in the next year. A sell-off in government debt could accelerate the bear market in bonds, which began to take hold almost immediately after Donald Trump's election victory. (See also, Trump Win Shocks Bond Market With $1 Trillion Loss Globally.) ""We're getting to the point where further rises in Treasuries, certainly above 3%, would start to have a real impact on market liquidity in corporate bonds and junk bonds,"" Gundlach said. He added that equities and housing could also suffer: ""a 10-year Treasury above 3% in my view starts to bring into question some of the aspects of the stock market and of the housing market in particular."" Bond yields move in the opposite direction to their prices; since yields are closely correlated to the federal funds rate, monetary tightening implies a bond rout, particularly when trillions of dollars' worth of government bonds have been bid up to the point that they trade with negative yields. The relationship between the federal funds rate and equity prices is less direct. Since higher rates serve to reign in borrowing and spending, they can impact companies' bottom lines, particularly in industries that depend on discretionary – and often debt-fueled – consumer spending. Higher rates also make it more difficult for companies to borrow, meaning that the pace of hiring, capital investment, acquisitions and stock repurchases slows. Finally, the ability to receive a decent return from safer investments such as Treasuries and even – some day – savings accounts makes the stock market a less appealing destination for capital. (See also, How Interest Rates Affect the Stock Market.) As higher rates make investing in Treasuries and other safe, dollar-denominated assets more attractive, capital floods out of other countries, particularly risky emerging markets. The result is that the dollar gains against other currencies, which can have profound implications for trade and, in a thoroughly trade-skeptical environment, politics. (See also, How Inflation Expectations and the Dollar Can Both Surge.) The value of the euro, for example, decreased by nearly 1.9% to $1.0428 between Tuesday and 2:40 p.m. Thursday, leading to predictions that the two currencies would soon reach parity. While a one-to-one exchange rate is an arbitrary level, observers focus on it because of its psychological importance: since the financial crisis, the eurozone has been buffeted by deflation, high unemployment, dormant growth, sovereign debt scares, the prospect of bank failures – which could potentially set off another financial crisis – the fallout from Brexit and a vocal anti-euro contingent in almost every country (ironically, euroskeptics are increasingly allied across borders, increasing their effectiveness). If a euro can't buy a dollar when French and German voters head to the polls next year, François Fillon and Angela Merkel's prospects will look bleaker, and the single currency's future will be in question. The Fed's hike has driven the dollar up against another key currency, the yuan, by 0.6% over the same period. Behind the European Union and Canada (where the currency has also fallen against the dollar), China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner. It has assumed outsized political importance due to Trump's emphasis on the U.S.'s trade deficit with China and his claim – apparently false – that China is holding down the value of the yuan in order increase the attractiveness of its exports. (See also, Billionaire Kyle Bass Anticipates 30% Drop in Chinese Yuan.) By the same token, the dollar's strength will make American exports more expensive, further squeezing the manufacturing sector that accounts for around 9% of U.S. employment but a significantly larger share of the political conversation.

Evelyn Cheng,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"Individual investor optimism jumped to a nine-year high in November, according to the Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index published Tuesday. The 96 read last month marked the third straight quarterly rise and was up from 79 in the third quarter, the survey said. The last time the index approached the November level was before the financial crisis, in May 2007 with a read of 95, the report said. The index was at 103 in January 2007. ""Rising investor optimism and the stock market reaching all-time highs is great news to end the year on, but it isn't necessarily driving investors to put their money into the markets,"" Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in the release. ""Investors are more interested in the markets, but it takes time for this optimism to translate to flows into the stock market, especially when investors have been cautious for so long,"" he said. The poll was conducted by phone Nov. 16 to 20, just over a week after the U.S. presidential election. At the time, the Dow Jones industrial average had gained more than 500 points postelection but hadn't crossed 19,000 yet. The Wells Fargo/Gallup study surveyed 1,012 U.S. investors with total savings and investments of at least $10,000. About 40 percent of American households fall in that category, the report said. Fifty-four percent of investors said they were optimistic about the stock market, up from 51 percent in the prior quarter and 32 percent in the first quarter of the year, the survey said. Nearly three-fourths of investors said the stock market will be volatile in 2017. About one-fifth of those investors expect stocks will be ""highly volatile,"" from 16 percent in the same period in 2015. The S&P 500 ended down less than 1 percent for 2015 after a more than 10 percent drop in August of that year. Stocks had one of their worst starts on record at the beginning of 2016, but the S&P has not fallen more than 10 percent from a recent high since February. ""Last year was not as volatile as some investors perceived it to be, and we are not forecasting a lot of volatility in the U.S. markets for the first half of the new year. We encourage investors to think of volatility in terms of what opportunities it may present,"" Wren said. Among retired investors, which accounted for 27 percent of respondents, the optimism index rose 36 points to 117, while the index rose 11 points to 89 for nonretirees, or 73 percent of respondents. Of total respondents, 42 percent reported annual income of less than $90,000, while 58 percent reported $90,000 or more. ",US investor optimism jumps to 9-year high: Survey
Paul Smith,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"During the recent campaign, President-elect Donald Trump  discussed financial regulatory issues in broad terms. He mentioned reinstating the Glass–Steagall Act for big banks, repealing the Volcker Rule, and ditching the Department of Labor's (DOL's) fiduciary duty rule. However, since winning the election, Mr. Trump has softened his tone on such hot-button issues as immigration and the Affordable Care Act. In the weeks and months ahead, his attention will invariably turn to financial market regulation, and we would like to encourage him to continue in a similar vein of moderation. A case for keeping regulatory reforms. There is undoubtedly ample scope for improving the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Written and signed into law in the aftermath of the most severe global financial crisis in more than 70 years, the new regulations were essential in helping to stem the tide of bank losses. Given the time constraints and the strong desire to shore up confidence in the financial markets at the time, there were bound to be provisions that resulted in unintended consequences. Moreover, the reforms were debated and drafted six months before a long-awaited assessment of exactly what went wrong and how to prevent a reocurrence. So, yes, Dodd–Frank is due for refurbishing. But let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater. It will not serve the interests of the financial system or the Trump Administration's economic program to start from scratch. Nor would it make sense to overhaul significant parts of Dodd–Frank that could mitigate the severity of another financial crisis. The same can also be said about the Consumer Protection Act and other reforms that were passed in response to the crisis. As the asset management industry's standard bearer for professionalism and ethics, CFA Institute urges the president-elect to retain these five regulatory reforms in order to prevent another financial crisis. Mr. Trump once said, ""A little more moderation would be good. Of course, my life hasn't exactly been one of moderation."" However, a little more moderation is exactly what we hope to see from the President-elect as he considers financial regulatory reform. And in these five important regulatory areas, the Dodd–Frank Act and market regulators have made so much progress that a reversal would ultimately do more harm than good. While Dodd–Frank has created certain regulatory ""overreach"" problems, we believe the balance is correct in the five areas mentioned. Further, we believe that turning the clock back to 2008 would ultimately betray the interests of investors, the markets, and taxpayers. ",Trump shouldn't let Wall Street off the hook—commentary
Eric Chemi,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"What do companies like General Dynamics, Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil have in common? They're a few of the names with board members joining the next presidential Cabinet, if Donald Trump gets his way. Directors from those companies and others — including Wells Fargo, News Corp. and Ingersoll-Rand — are going to be nominated for high-level government positions in the new administration. And those stocks have already seen a benefit to their share prices since the election, beating the overall market. Future government officials such as James Mattis, Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross, Rex Tillerson and Elaine Chao all serve on at least one board of a major publicly traded company. Here's a list, compiled by CNBC and corporate data firm Equilar: We can go one step further and put all these companies into their own basket of stocks. Let's call it the ""Trump Cabinet index"" — and that index has outperformed the overall market since the election. Since Nov. 8, this basket was up 14 percent through Friday, surpassing the S&P 500's move of 6 percent. Specifically, 10 of 15 companies are beating the market. To be clear, none of these people actually serve in the government yet, since almost all of them will require Senate confirmation. And that's not a slam dunk: There's already been plenty of public discussion from current senators about whether Exxon Mobil CEO Tillerson is an appropriate choice to be secretary of State, especially because of his connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But for now the index is worth following. We'll be updating the index as time goes on depending on who is in and out of the government, and which companies they have direct relationships with. It will be interesting to watch whether these companies get an added benefit for having one of their own in government, or whether they sell off harder than normal when the difficulties of managing the nation become a daily reality. Some notes about the index: We did not include WWE because Linda McMahon is no longer on its board of directors, having left to run for senate several years ago. But we did include Goldman Sachs, because Cohn is on that board. Even though Cohn's future nomination as director of the National Economic Council doesn't require Senate confirmation since it's not a Cabinet position, we thought it was a relevant and powerful enough job to include in the basket. We also included Steve Mnuchin's connection to Sears, which he gave up in early December specifically to join the incoming team. ",'Trump Cabinet index' is outpacing the market since election
Evelyn Cheng,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"Stocks have surged so quickly in the past few weeks that a gauge of enthusiasm in the Dow Jones industrial average has hit its highest level in 20 years. And for now, some strategists are on the alert for a near-term pullback in the market. The technical indicator is called the relative strength index, or RSI, and it shows the relative size of gains versus losses for an underlying market index, usually over 14 trading days. Whenever the RSI climbs above a 70 to 75 range that signals the underlying index is getting expensive. For the Dow, its 14-day RSI rose above 80 for several days this month to hit 87.4 on Tuesday, the highest since the 87.8 level hit on Nov. 25, 1996. ""That indicates to me that there are an overwhelming amount of buyers. The fact that it hasn't hit that mark since 1996 just shows you how aggressive these buyers are being,"" J.C. Parets, founder of Allstarcharts, said in an email. ""A correction, either through time or price, is certainly warranted,"" Parets said, referring to a possible 10 percent drop in stocks. He added, however, that ""overbought conditions are a positive, not a negative, from any kind of structural perspective."" Robert Sinche, global strategist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, pointed out that late November 1996 was just days before then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan gave his famous ""irrational exuberance"" speech. His Dec. 5 talk of that year discussed whether stocks were getting too expensive and prone to a sharp sell-off. ""RSI is just an indicator there's a lot of optimism, a lot of enthusiasm in markets, which opened up an opportunity for something to go wrong and a case for a correction. The Fed announcement opened up a correction in many markets,"" Sinche said. The question, he said, is whether the sell-off ""persists."" The Dow's relative strength index held above 80 Thursday as stocks resumed their rise following the Dow's worst day in two months Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve surprised markets by forecasting three interest rate hikes next year. It's worth noting, of course, that after the late 1996 high in the Dow technical indicator and Greenspan's ""irrational exuberance"" comment, the Dow continued to rally for the next three quarters before pausing. ""The strongest markets can stay overbought for long periods of time; thus, we have been treating the stretched indicator as a condition, not a sickness, for much of this rally,"" Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet, said in an email. U.S. stocks rallied to all-time highs on hopes of promised tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation after President-elect Donald Trump won the election. The 30-stock Dow Jones index has leaped more than 8.5 percent since then, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. ""The most probable scenario now is the market continues going up, but at a slower pace,"" said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Strategists' expectations for stock performance next year vary widely, he said, because ""for the first time in a few years, we've got a variety of things that could do really well for stocks or disappoint that could lead to a less rosy outcome.""

Abigail Stevenson,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"When Jim Cramer heard the news that Kraft Heinz could recombine with Mondelez and tobacco company Philip Morris International could get back together with Altria, he saw dollar signs. ""I have no idea if either of these recombination deals is going to happen, but I do know this: these two potential blockbuster transactions would create still one more wave of M&A, simply because the combinations make so much sense,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Kraft broke up four years ago into a brand of North American pantry brands under the name Kraft Foods Group and international snack group called Mondelez. The break up was intended to bring out value, and while Cramer says it didn't generate a lot of enthusiasm on Wall Street at the time, investors have made money from the split. Kraft has since morphed into Kraft Heinz, another slow-growing pantry-based company. Yet, the stock of Kraft Heinz has actually jumped higher than Mondelez on the combination rumors. ""I know that the split left Kraft without the growth it needs and I know that the Heinz people who are now running the show don't really care about whether the antecedents were together before. The breakup wasn't their idea, and I think recombining makes a ton of sense,"" Cramer said. Philip Morris also broke up into a slow-growing, high-yielding U.S. tobacco company called Altria, and a faster growing, lower yielding entity called Philip Morris International. Ironically because of the strong dollar and demand for dividend stocks in the U.S., Philip Morris actually now yields more than Altria. However, Altria and Philip Morris International have given investors a 230 percent return since the breakup over five years ago, versus the 108 percent move in the S&P in the same period. Cramer was shocked when Wells Fargo issued research on Monday entitled ""Probability of PM/MO Combo Now Higher."" ""Excuse me for not knowing that this merger idea was even in the hopper, but apparently it's even hotter than the Kraft-Heinz Mondelez talk,"" Cramer said. Cramer suspects that what could be behind the idea of the potential combination is a device called the IQOS developed by Philip Morris that Wells Fargo thinks could change smokeless cigarettes forever. The issue is that Philip Morris only operates overseas, and this breakthrough device will need the U.S. market to take off. ""That, plus the likelihood of Trump's corporate tax reform and a possible rise in interest rates means the deal would need to be done now if it is going to happen at all.

Elizabeth Gurdus,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"Loosened federal regulations are in focus with Donald Trump about to take office, but the financial sector has been in a government-imposed ""time out"" for far too long, AIG's chief investment officer, Doug Dachille, told CNBC on Thursday. ""The regulation of the banking system was a natural response, because when I think about regulation, it's like disciplining your children, and the financial crisis was like your children doing something really bad,"" Dachille told ""Squawk Box."" Dachille likened the situation to parents coming home to a 17-year-old having burned down their house. A severe response is expected, he said, but a nearly eight-year-long time out becomes excessive and ""extremely inconvenient."" The investment chief acknowledged that bad incentives lead to regulatory consequences, like Wells Fargo's illegal sales practices for which the bank paid a $185 million fine in September. But when the government all but eliminates risk from the financial sector by directing where and to whom big banks can lend, the prospective borrowers who need loans the most, like small businesses, tend to suffer, Dachille said. He said a loosening of Dodd-Frank, which was the government's direct regulatory response to the 2008 crisis, would encourage banks to lend to those who need it, in turn affecting the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy over the coming years. ""I think you have to really rethink what the path of rate policy will be if you actually have banks willing to lend again,"" he said, adding that the Fed would probably only raise rates twice in 2017, as opposed to its three-hike projection.

Courtney Reagan,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"President-elect Donald Trump's tariff rhetoric has gotten a lot of attention, but it's actually the Republican House Ways and Means Committee's ""A Better Way"" tax reform proposal that's scaring the pants off clothing and shoe retailers. The plan was proposed in June, but wasn't a focal point until it became more of a possibility under a Republican-controlled Congress and White House. Now, retailers are nervous. Very nervous. As expected with a corporate tax reform policy, it's complex, but it boils down to three pieces. First, instituting a flat 20 percent corporate tax, which is a welcome change from a typical 35 percent corporate tax rate. Second, it allows for the immediate expense of business investments, instead of over time as it is now. That's part is likely OK with many, too. But, the third piece is the real zinger for retail. It's a border-adjustment tax for goods that are imported. About 95 percent of clothing and shoes sold in the U.S. are manufactured overseas, which means imports make up a vast majority of many U.S. retailers' merchandise. The tax is aimed at encouraging more manufacturing in the U.S. as well as raising government funds. Using very simple math to illustrate how the tax law works for retailers importing goods currently: A retailer like the Gap buys a sweater from its overseas manufacturer for $80. Gap has an additional $15 in other expenses associated with that sweater (like transporting it). Gap sells the sweater to a shopper for $100. So tax is calculated by taking that $100 in revenue, subtracting the $80 cost of the good, subtracting the $15 other costs, leaving $5 in profit. If Gap pays a typical 35 percent tax rate on the $5 profit, its tax bill for that sweater is $1.75. If the GOP plan was adopted as it's currently laid out, Gap pays 20 percent corporate tax on the $5 profit from the sweater, or $1. Plus, 20 percent tax on the $80 cost it paid for that sweater from the overseas supplier, or $16. That means the tax goes from $1.75 to $17 for that sweater, more than three times the profit on that sweater. Talk about a hit to margins. One answer is that retailers increase the prices shoppers pay. But that's going to be a hard sell. Clothing prices have actually been falling for years, and consumers are addicted to discounts. Good luck trying to sell that sweater for more. Some economists argue that trade equilibrium will cause the dollar to strengthen enough to offset the above scenario. If a retailer, like Gap, has to pay import taxes, it will be less incentivized to buy those imported goods. Proponents say economic theory suggests imports are then less desirable, so in response, the overseas supplier will then sell its goods more cheaply. Thus, the dollar will be able to buy in the foreign currency at the cost of fewer dollars, so the dollar appreciates until the trade comes back into balance. The math works out that the greenback would have to appreciate 25 percent in order to even it out for importers, and economists aren't sure how fast that will happen. Alan Viard, economist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute said, ""There's no scenario in which the dollar would not appreciate"" but he adds that how fast it happens is debatable. ""Logically, it should be a quick, or immediate adjustment, but economics are not good at predicting speed."" Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips doesn't expect the dollar to appreciate as theory predicts. In a research note, he said, ""It is unlikely that nominal or even real exchange rates would in fact adjust so quickly and perfectly."" Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation, said he understands that theory suggests currency adjustment should counteract border taxes, but he isn't sure it will actually play out that way. The NRF, the retail industry's trade group, has generally been opposed to tariffs on goods. ""This is pretty old-style thinking, it is not clear that [exchange rates] will adjust, however. These days exchange rates are determined by financial flows,"" Kleinhenz said. Among the forces at play are ""speculation, inflation rates (current and expected), interest rates, political regimes (performance and policies), level of interest rates, amount of debt"" and of course, the supply and demand for dollars. ""Theoretical evidence suggests the currency appreciation evens the cost out,"" said JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli. But, he also acknowledged ""there could be a retail profitability margin story that's not being appreciated by economists."" Retailers certainly aren't taking a lot of comfort in the economic theory of dollar appreciation. So even though there are many caveats and assumptions, analysts are trying to model which retailers could get hit the hardest if the border adjustments go through. Retailers don't have the realistic option of sourcing from here in the U.S. The facilities and skilled labor just don't exist in the U.S. to take the place of what's manufactured abroad. Most analysts agree the tax would hit the specialty retailers the most as nearly all of the goods they sell are imported after being produced overseas. JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss said he expects the tax reform plan will dilute specialty retailers' earnings by an average of 132 percent. In his coverage, that includes companies like Abercrombie & Fitch, Ascena Retail and Boot Barn because each source heavily overseas and sell mainly in the U.S. Athletic manufacturers could take a 40 percent earnings hit, but Under Armour would feel it more than Nike because Nike sells more of its goods in other countries than Under Armour, and those goods wouldn't have the extra import cost tacked on, Boss said. Department stores' earnings will take an average 14 percent hit, with J.C. Penney and Kohl's getting hit the worst, he said. Wells Fargo's Ike Boruchow said Gap, Carter's, Urban Outfitters, Fossil and Under Armour are most at risk under the plan. KeyBanc's Ed Yruma said he expects high-end names like Tiffany, Nordstrom and Net-A-Porter are more insulated, given the ability to pass along higher prices to their more affluent shoppers. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo analysts both cited the off-price retailers like TJX Companies, Ross Stores and Burlington as examples of retailers that could actually see an earnings benefit from border-adjustments because they have lower levels of imports, higher domestic sales and recent strong sales performance. There's no certainty this plan will come to fruition exactly as proposed, and if it does, exactly when. But there is a stronger chance it will be at least proposed to the House of Representatives by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) with the border-adjustments as a key cornerstone.

Evelyn Cheng,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"The so-called fear index shows that investors are feeling content right now, but volatility could be coming as markets roll into 2017. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX), fell below 11.5 Tuesday to its lowest level since Dec. 8, coming within half a point of the year's low at 11.02. Meanwhile, stocks continued their rally Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite setting record closes. ""Everything about it is telling me people are kind of apathetic about what's going to happen for the rest of the year,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Next week, you may see people suddenly starting to hedge themselves,"" he said, noting concern about the strong dollar's impact on U.S. earnings. ""The real question starts to become, as we get closer to earnings, [do] people start to hedge themselves for an overall market sell-off?"" Typically, a low VIX signals a market that's comfortable with current levels. But as 2016 winds down, some analysts say the low levels in the VIX and improved outlook on growth potentially set the market up for disappointment — and greater volatility ahead. ""A lot of sentiment gauges are telling us there's plenty of optimism in the market right now, and we have to be on the alert when that optimism rolls over,"" said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research Group. When it comes to the ""VIX, we want to see it reverse from extremely low levels."" Wednesday is the last day to trade the VIX contract for December, and trade volume was significantly higher on the January contract, which was trading just above 14. The VIX measures the buying of put and call options on the S&P 500 near-term options and is generally considered the best gauge of fear in the market. Puts and calls give the buyers the right to sell or acquire an asset, respectively, at a preset price. Now, at least to one analyst, the VIX may be an indicator that investors are almost acting in ""fear of missing out"" in the rally. Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Brean Capital, pointed out that four times this year the VIX began edging higher with stocks around risky events, before equities sold off and the volatility index jumped. ""I think it's not only telling [us] complacency. It's almost talking about greed to me,"" Tchir said. ""People are buying calls rather than buying puts."" Last week, Mandy Xu, derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse, pointed out that demand for calls reached an all-time high. With the election over, ""investors feel like they have the world figured out,"" and ""with a clear playbook, there's less volatility,"" said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. Popular bets right now include bank stocks and small-cap names, which many analysts say should benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. It's still unclear, of course, whether those proposals will help stocks — or if they will happen at all. ""You may have a playbook,"" Colas said, but ""you may still lose the game."" Meanwhile, the year ahead brings other risks — dollar strength, the U.K.'s formal negotiations to leave the European Union, other European elections, and violence or the potential for it. While 2016's market calendar had many defined events, 2017 is ""going to be a year where people are going to come in complacent into events that aren't scheduled,"" said Ilya Feygin, managing director and senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital. ""Trump's policy has no dates."" The only date analysts have to look toward so far is the Jan. 20 inauguration, from which the clock begins ticking on the president's first 100 days. Other factors, such as major moves within S&P 500 sectors and lack of buying interest, are behind the low VIX, analysts said. December is also generally a low point of the year for the VIX, Colas said. ""The kind of funds that have typically paid up for that downside are simply not paying up (now) because they've been burned,"" said John Wilson, CEO of Sprott Asset Management. That said, the straight-up market rally that's sent the Dow within striking distance of 20,000 may have some credible reasons to hold its gains. ""We would argue the market is here because of the economic fundamentals, not because Donald Trump won the election,"" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""The market might concern itself with things that might and could happen two or three years down the road … but very quickly you get back to fundamentals,"" he said. The Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index jumped to a nine-year high of 96 in the fourth quarter, still below the plus-130 level Wren would consider as a negative for stocks. In addition, analysts resist comparisons between the postelection market rally today and the the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century. The Dow first topped 10,000 in 1999, and the VIX at that time was above 23, nearly twice where it was Wednesday. The Dow ""was really being dragged higher by the tech stocks of the late '90s, and since tech stocks have higher volatility … the base volatility of the market was higher,"" Colas said.

Patti Domm,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"Since Election Day, stocks have been roaring in — Russia. Russian stocks are up 16 percent since Nov. 8, based on the performance of the RSX Van Eck Vectors Russia ETF, while the other emerging markets are down 6 percent collectively, as measured by the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF EEM. Oil's rise above $50 has helped Russia, which depends on its energy industry to remain solvent. President-elect Donald Trump is also expected to push for better relations with Moscow, which U.S. intelligence agencies say hacked into the Democratic National Committee's emails in an effort to throw the election toward Trump. Russian President Vladimir Putin denies it. Brent crude is up 19 percent since Election Day and was trading at just under $55 per barrel Friday. ""They're obviously getting benefits both from the sense that the tensions with the West are going to go down and that they're going to have more access to markets, plus the fact that oil has gone up,"" said Bruce Kasman, chief global economist at JPMorgan. ""It's a double positive for them,"" he said, adding that an agreement to curtail oil output that OPEC reached this month with Russia and some other nonmember states should push crude prices higher. The Moscow Exchange, MICEX-RTS, is up 12 percent since the election, as measured in rubles. The S&P 500 is up 5.9 percent over that time frame, and U.S. small-caps are up about 14 percent. Russia's economy is recovering, and oil prices should help. ""We're forecasting 1 to 2 percent growth. I wouldn't call that anything to get excited about, especially after they had a deep recession and now they have a modest growth path,"" Kasman said. Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said oil is a factor in Russia's stock market rally, but so is Trump. ""In general, it's an expectation that Trump will be friendlier to Putin and his leadership than (President Barack) Obama has been,"" said Christopher. Christopher said he doesn't expect sanctions on Russia to be lifted. ""There could be new sanctions as a result of this hacking case,"" he said.

Since Donald Trump was elected president, financial stocks have gone straight up. There is good reason for this -- Trump's pro-growth policies and his opposition to regulation are a combination that can produce an excellent environment for banks to make money. Here's why the next several years could be good for banks, plus three choices that could be a great fit for your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. In a nutshell, banks have rallied recently for two main reasons, both of which have to do with Trump's election and the Republican majorities in Congress. First, Trump has been outspoken about his opposition to regulation, and few industries are more burdened by regulation than banks -- particularly the big banks. Trump has pledged to repeal or modify Dodd-Frank and generally make it easier for the banks to do business, which would save the banks significant money in complying with regulations. Second, Trump's tax cuts and other pro-growth policies could create an environment that is ideal for banks to make money. They are widely expected to lead to higher interest rates, which generally translates to higher profit margins for banks. Also, lower taxes mean more money in people's pockets, which means more deposits in the banks. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) had an interesting 2016, to say the least. Rocked by the infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal when it was revealed in September, the bank's shares sold off initially. Then, the stock rebounded and more -- up 15% in November alone and reaching a new 52-week high in December, mainly thanks to the election-related boost I discussed earlier. In addition, the election and ensuing bank rally got the media attention off Wells Fargo, as my colleague John Maxfield pointed out in a recent article. Even though Wells Fargo certainly did a bad thing, and there could still be fallout from the scandal to come, it's important to keep the big picture in mind. Wells Fargo is still the best-run big bank in the business in terms of risk management and efficiency, and the fact that it continuously earns better returns on equity and assets than the rest of the ""big four"" banks is proof of this. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. At the end of the day, Wells Fargo isn't likely to lose a significant number of customers over the scandal. Also, remember that the 2 million fake accounts weren't generating any real revenue for the bank -- if anything, they may have cost Wells Fargo money in the form of employee incentives for meeting sales targets. Wells Fargo's largest shareholder is Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway, and Buffett has said he hasn't sold a single share of Wells Fargo in the wake of the scandal, and has no plans to do so. Buffett went on to call Wells Fargo an ""incredible institution,"" and that he still has faith in the company. Wells Fargo remains the most rock-solid of the U.S. banking giants and is worth a look. If you have a little bit more appetite for risk, consider Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which accidentally became my largest stock holding over the past few months. I say ""accidentally"" because when the stock was trading in the $11-13 range earlier in 2016, I jumped on the opportunity to add some shares to my position. Now that it's doubled, my position has grown accordingly. However, even with the recent gain, I have no plans to sell a single share. The recent Federal Reserve interest rate hike is a positive catalyst for all banks, but Bank of America stands to benefit more than most. Even more importantly, the slightly improved forecast of three more rate hikes in 2017, two or three in 2018, and three in 2019, with a longer-term target of 3%, is a good indicator that the bank's profitability could grow more than the market thinks. As a final suggestion, if you have a long investment time frame and want to potentially get in on the future of banking, you might want to take a look at BofI (NYSE:AX), which stands for Bank of Internet. As the name implies, BofI does its business exclusively online -- it has a single office location in California, and no branches whatsoever. Through its internet-only platform, BofI offers a full range of banking products, such as checking and savings accounts, mortgages, CDs, auto loans, and more. The bank's business model is simple. Online and mobile banking is rapidly growing in popularity, and non-branch transactions are much cheaper, so the bank aims to operate more efficiently than its competitors. Over the past few years, the bank has successfully transitioned away from a CD-based model to a more traditional portfolio of checking and savings products. As a result, deposits have nearly tripled since 2013. It appears to be working so far. The company's growth over the past few years has been spectacular. In fact, BofI's EPS has grown at an impressive 32% annualized rate over the past five years, and despite this growth, the stock trades for less than 15 times trailing-12-month earnings. As far as efficiency is concerned, the bank's profitability metrics speak for themselves: Data source: BOFI investor presentation. The bottom line is that there is a bank stock for you to buy in 2017, whether you prefer the stable, tried-and-true banks, have a little more risk tolerance, or want to potentially get in on the next big thing.

John Maxfield,12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. America's biggest banks are massive. Just how large are they? Here are the 10 biggest banks in America as of the third quarter of 2016: Bank Total Assets (Millions)* JPMorgan Chase $2,521,029 Bank of America $2,195,314 Wells Fargo $1,942,124 Citigroup $1,818,117 U.S. Bancorp $454,134 Bank of New York Mellon $374,114 PNC Financial $369,348 Capital One Financial $345,061 State Street $256,140 BB&T $222,622 *As of the third quarter of 2016. Data source: YCharts.com. The interesting thing about this list is that the banks on it have grown substantially in size since many of them were derided as being too big to fail during the financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is a case in point. Going into the crisis, it was far from the biggest bank in the United States. That distinction went to Citigroup (NYSE:C), followed by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). But two developments swung things in JPMorgan Chase's favor. The first was that both Citigroup and Bank of America dove headlong into risky credit card loans and subprime mortgages during the housing bubble that preceded the financial crisis. In the fourth quarter of 2008 alone, Citigroup reported a $31 billion pre-tax net operating loss. Bank of America's total financial crisis-related costs, meanwhile, amounted to $191 billion. As a result of these losses, both Bank of America and Citigroup have had to spend much of the past decade regrouping and retrenching, generally shedding assets as opposed to growing. JPMorgan Chase, on the other hand, went into the crisis in perhaps better shape than any other big bank, with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) being a possible exception. Run by Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who writes an incredible shareholder letter each year, JPMorgan Chase unloaded its subprime exposure well before the crisis took hold. This positioned the New York-based bank to not only survive the financial crisis, but to thrive because of it. In March of 2008, at the behest of the federal government, JPMorgan Chase swooped in to acquire Bear Stearns, the fifth largest investment bank at the time. Six months later, JPMorgan Chase did the same with one of the largest depositories in the United States, the then-teetering Washington Mutual. And because of their perilous states, JPMorgan Chase bought both for pennies on the dollar. The same sequence of events allowed Wells Fargo to more than double in size during the crisis by way of its 2008 acquisition of its larger rival Wachovia. The net result is that Citigroup was eclipsed not only by JPMorgan Chase, but also by Wells Fargo, which is now the third biggest bank in America. In short, not only are the nation's largest banks already huge, but many of them continue to get even bigger. ","

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Bigger isn't always better in the banking world. In the wake of the financial crisis, regulators and lawmakers decided that the nation's biggest banks should be required to hold more capital than their smaller and simpler peers in the regional and community banking spaces. And the eight largest banks in the United States, the so-called global systemically important banks, or GSIB, bear the brunt of the decision. This is because these banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), must hold an additional tranche of capital above and beyond what even other very large banks must hold. This is known as the GSIB buffer or surcharge. Just how much extra capital do these banks have to hold? When the rules were first published two years ago, JPMorgan Chase faced the stiffest penalty, with a 4.5% surcharge relative to its Tier 1 common equity. Citigroup was second at 3.5%. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs rounded out the top four at 3%. Fortunately for these banks, these thresholds have since declined, due in large part to specific actions taken by the banks to lower their risk profiles and thereby the amount of systemic risk that regulators believe they pose to the economy. The updated list of U.S.-based global systemically important banks, including their original and current GSIB buffers, can be found in this table: Bank Current GSIB Buffer Original GSIB Buffer JPMorgan Chase 2.5% 4.5% Citigroup 2.5% 3.5% Bank of America 2% 3% Goldman Sachs 1.5% 3% Wells Fargo 1.5% 2% Morgan Stanley 1% 3% State Street 1% 1.5% Bank of New York Mellon 1% 1% For current or prospective investors in any of these banks, this is something that needs to be taken into account. Most large banks generate half or more of their top lines from borrowing cheaply from depositors and lending the same money out at higher interest rates to businesses and individuals in need of funds. The income from this activity is known as net interest income. And the more a bank can leverage, the more net interest income it can generate. The good news is that most of these banks can make up the difference through economies of scale and the fact that they can borrow much more inexpensively than smaller banks can. At the same time, however, if these capital rules were to be relaxed, which the incoming presidential administration has suggested is a top priority, then there's every reason to believe that the eight U.S.-based global systemically important banks have a lot to gain. Suffice it to say, this is one reason shares of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs have all surged since the presidential election. ","

""A ham sandwich could run Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)"" -- Warren Buffett to Bill Gates. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett may be as famous for his aphorisms as he is for his love of Coca-Cola. Image Source: Coca-Cola. He jokes that he's ""one quarter Coca-Cola,"" referring to his anatomy, not his holdings, as he drinks at least five cans of Coke or Cherry Coke a day. Buffett is big backer of the stock as well, as Berkshire owns more 9% of the company and counts Coke as its second-biggest holding after Wells Fargo. Buffett's son, Howard, even sat on its board before announcing his retirement recently. In many ways, Coca-Cola is a classic Buffett stock. The company has a huge brand that, along with its distribution network, gives it an economic moat, and its business is focused on recurring small purchases that happen in an up or down economy. Though Coke made many early investors rich -- it was one of the best-performing stocks of the 20th century -- the stock's reputation his taken a hit in recent years. As the chart below shows, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and Berkshire Hathaway over the last five years. ^SPX data by YCharts Buffett's quote above looks especially relevant today. Coke is set the hand the reins to a new CEO as COO James Quincey replaces Muhtar Kent at the helm on May 1, 2017. James Quincey (left) with outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent. Source: Coca-Cola. Quincey's anointment is no surprise, as Coke had signaled that he would replace Kent when Kent retired. Quincey has led the company in various regions, including Europe and Mexico, and became COO last year, but his job running Coke's iconic portfolio of brands may be more difficult than that of his predecessors. Coca-Cola today faces several challenges that won't be easy to overcome. It's no secret that Americans are drinking less soda. Volume sales of the fizzy beverages have fallen every year since 2004, dropping 1.2% last year as per capita consumption reached a 30-year low. As health concerns have mounted, Americans have flocked away from excess sugar in drinks like Coca-Cola, and sales of diet soda have fallen even faster -- trends towards organic and natural foods seem to be worse for artificial sweeteners and drinks like Diet Coke, which are perceived to be loaded with chemicals. Coke brags that it has gained market share for 26 straight quarters in North America in the Non Alcoholic Ready To Drink market, but that figure ignores the fact that many consumers have moved on to coffee drinks available at Starbucks and other chains. Starbucks has seen U.S. comparable sales growth of 4% or better for more than 20 quarters in a row. To counter sluggish growth, Coca-Cola has adopted a few key strategies. It's begun selling smaller-volume drinks at a higher price-per-ounce, borrowing a page from tobacco companies, which have also raised prices to counter falling consumption. That strategy has helped pad the bottom line and given consumers lower-calorie options, but its potential is limited. The company has also gone on a shopping spree in the hopes of diversifying away from its core soda brands. In recent years it's purchased alternative beverage brands like Zico coconut water, Gold Peak tea, and Suja Life juice. It also took stakes in Keurig Green Mountain, which was bought out, and Monster Beverage. Coke now has more than 500 brands and derives 36% of sales from still beverages. However, the company may have missed an opportunity to diversify into food as its rival Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP) has done well with brands like Frito-Lay and Quaker. As a result, Pepsico has outperformed Coke in recent years. Coke's organic revenue is still growing, up 4% so far this year, but a strengthening dollar has weighed on financial results, as have structural changes. Return on Invested Capital plummeted all the way from 21% in 2008 to 9% last year as the company spent on acquisitions while earnings remained stubbornly slow to grow. As per-capita consumption has fallen in key markets, the company has also been confronted with an increasing number of soda taxes. Four cities in the U.S., including San Francisco and Boulder, Colo., passed soda surcharges on Election Day, and Philadelphia did so earlier this year. A number of countries, including Mexico and several in Europe, have also moved to tax sugary beverages. It's an idea that's gaining currency and is likely to present continued headaches for Coke, as the company has already mounted significant lobbying efforts against such measures. With the lobbying push, big soda, unsurprisingly, has often drawn comparisons to big tobacco. James Quincey is stepping into a morass of regulatory battles, changing tastes, and slumping returns. There may be no one more qualified for the job, but the status quo will not be enough to revive Coca-Cola's stock. In recent years, the company has acted incrementally -- cutting, costs, making acquisitions, launching new marketing campaigns -- but it hasn't been enough to reinvigorate its core brands. Coke may need to think bigger. For instance, scientists are working to make a calorie-free soda that tastes like the real thing, using sugar substitutes like stevia. Such a beverage could capture consumers who have been ditching sodas because of calories or artificial flavors. Pulling off such a feat won't be easy, but an innovative push like that is more likely to generate long-term growth than Coca-Cola's current strategy. Investing in food is another such option. Though management has resisted it in the past, the company recently considered taking a stake in yogurt-maker Chobani before backing out. It's clear what Warren Buffett meant by his ""ham sandwich"" comment -- Coke's brands are so powerful and its business is so simple that the company is essentially a profit machine. But that logic only applies to a market when soda sales have organic long-term growth ahead, not one in which public sentiment is turning against beverage-makers.  As Buffett may already know, today's consumers don't want any old ham sandwich. They want organic, grass-fed porchetta on a fresh-baked ciabatta with garlic aioli and house-made pepperoncini. Today's Coca-Cola requires a strategy beyond the stewardship of a perpetual profit machine. If Quincey is going to deliver for investors, he needs to aim for a higher standard than an ordinary ham sandwich. ","

With thousands of stocks available for purchase, it can be hard to separate winning investment ideas from losers. That's why it makes sense to develop a checklist that can help you quickly vet potential candidates. This is a tactic Warren Buffett uses when he makes multibillion-dollar acquisitions at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). Image source: Getty Images. There's no need to reinvent the wheel when you are creating your checklist, either. In fact, simply copying Buffett's list of criteria can be a smart move. Here's a look at his checklist: With tens of billions of dollars to invest, Buffett set up this first criterion to ensure that only large, stable, and profitable companies find their way in front of him. Thankfully, Visa sails through this first test with ease. The company rang up more than $15 billion in total sales last year, and impressively, Visa converted more than $8 billion of that total into pre-tax profit. Buffett wants to own businesses that can remain highly profitable even during periods of market stress. That's why he demands that all potential investments candidates prove their profits can remain high for long periods of time. Here's a look at Visa's revenue and net income over the last decade. V Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. As you can see, the company's revenue and profits have both consistently headed higher over time. That makes sense as consumers continue to ditch cash and checks in favor of credit and debit cards when making purchasing decisions. I think Buffett would give Visa a passing grade here. Buffett believes the best companies are capable of generating high returns on equity without the need to juice the numbers by carrying a lot of debt. Here's how Visa's numbers look over the previous five years: V Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. Visa has generally kept its return on equity quite high even though its business was largely debt-free over the past five years. However, it's worth noting that Visa recently decided to take on more than $15 billion in debt earlier this year to help fund the buyout of Visa Europe. That's a big number, but since Visa can easily afford the payments and has a proven track record of operating without debt for years on end, my hunch is that Buffett would be willing to give the company a pass. Visa just recently went through a big management change in the corner office. The company's former CEO, Charlie Scharf, decided to step down since he could no longer spend enough time in San Francisco to lead the company effectively. In response, the board gave the top chair to Alfred Kelly, Jr. Kelly seems like a great choice to lead Visa moving forward. He has been on Visa's board since 2014, and he spent more than 23 years at American Express, including a period where served as the company's president. Right behind CEO Kelly is Ryan McInerney, who has served as the company's president since 2013. McInerney is another industry veteran that spent a large portion of his career working as the CEO of Consumer Banking for JPMorgan Chase. With these two industry veterans calling the shots, I think Buffett would give the company a thumbs up here. While Visa's business model isn't quite as easy to understand as a candy maker or home builder, it isn't too difficult to understand how this company makes money. At its core, Visa acts as a middleman between consumers, financial institutions, and merchants. The company operates the largest electronic payments network in the world, called VisaNet, which provides authorization, clearing, and settlement services for its customers. Visa earns a small fee each time a transaction occurs on its network, essentially operating as a digital payment toll booth. Image source: Visa. We know Buffett is very comfortable with buying financial stocks since Berkshire holds sizable positions in companies like Wells Fargo, American Express, and U.S. Bancorp. I'm willing to bet he would be quite comfortable with Visa's business model, too. Add it all up, and Visa scores a five out of five on Buffett's checklist. Given that stellar score, perhaps it shouldn't come as much of a surprise to learn that Berkshire is already an investor in Visa. In fact, Berkshire currently owns more than 10 million shares of the company's stock, which is worth more than $800 million at current prices. Of course, given that Berkshire's market cap currently exceeds $400 billion, the company's stake in Visa is still just chump change for the Oracle of Omaha. Still, since Buffett likes Visa enough to be a shareholder, perhaps you should consider becoming one as well. ","
      
    Does Visa Pass Warren Buffett's Test? -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With 2016 ending, and the election behind us, it's time to think about some of the best moves to make in your portfolio that could perform well in 2017 and beyond. One of my favorite places to look for stock ideas is Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio, much of which was hand-picked by the Oracle of Omaha himself, Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. With that in mind, here are three stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that I'm keeping an eye on as we head into 2017. In fact, I already own all three and am considering adding more to each position as the New Year approaches. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has had a tremendous rally over much of 2016. After bottoming out at less than $11 in February, the stock has more than doubled, trading for about $22.50 as I write. Even so, I have no plans to sell a single share, and I think the ""Trump rally"" for big banks could still be in its early stages. To be clear, Berkshire doesn't actually own Bank of America -- not yet. During the financial crisis, Berkshire made a $5 billion investment in the bank that included warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank before September 2021, and Buffett has made it clear that Berkshire plans on exercising these warrants. In addition, Trump's promise to lower regulation could mean looser capital requirements and smaller compliance costs for the bank. This development would allow the bank to make more loans, increase efficiency, and simply make it easier for the bank to conduct business. As a final thought on Bank of America, keep in mind that even with the big rally, the stock still trades for a 7% discount to its book value. BAC data by YCharts From a valuation standpoint, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of the cheapest stocks in the market. With a P/E multiple of just 6.1 times 2016's expected earnings and a 4.2% dividend yield, GM appears to be a value-seeker's dream. First the bad news. The U.S. auto market has been growing for several years and looks like it's plateauing, which could mean increased competition and shrinking margins. Also, it's still somewhat unclear how much damage the flurry of recalls over the past few years has done to GM's brand image. Finally, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the Trump presidency. Trump's trade policies could put GM's international growth in jeopardy, and the interest-rate growth that's expected to come with Trump's growth plans could hurt GM's business. Despite these negative factors, GM still looks promising. The company's Chinese sales have been soaring, up 8.5% in the past year alone, and with the continuous growth of China's middle class, this trend could continue for years to come. GM has also dramatically improved its efficiency in recent years, and newer models, such as the widely praised Malibu, have higher margins than the models they replace. Even if GM's earnings were cut in half, the stock's valuation would still be attractive. GM is wisely taking advantage of the cheap valuation and buying back as much of its own stock as it can, and you can do the same. As a final suggestion, perhaps my favorite Buffett stock to buy now is Berkshire Hathaway itself -- probably the Class B shares for most readers. I've written before about the reasons for owning Berkshire for the long term, including its diverse portfolio of fully owned subsidiaries as well as a rock-solid stock portfolio, but there's an extra reason to consider Berkshire now. I already discussed how Trump's pro-growth and anti-regulation policies could help American banks such as Bank of America, as well as other Buffett financial stocks such as Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, Goldman Sachs, and others. In addition, Berkshire's core business of insurance could benefit tremendously. Insurers don't aim to make their money through the premiums you pay; rather, their main source of profit is to invest the premiums they've collected but haven't paid out yet, and earn money from their investments. So as interest rates rise, so can profits on invested reserves. As I write, Berkshire has about $85 billion in cash on its balance sheet, so an increase of a percent or two over the next few years would translate to billions in additional profit. Finally, Trump's plans to lower regulation could translate into tremendous cost savings for Geico and other Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. ","
      
    3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in December -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it comes to bank stocks (or any stocks for that matter) it's important to distinguish between price and value. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. If you're an investor with an interest in the bank industry, then there are certain stocks that should be on your radar. Ten that come immediately to mind are the eight global systemically important banks together with two of the largest regional banks, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF). But whether you can afford to buy any of these stocks depends in part on their share prices. With this in mind, here's a list of these 10 popular bank stocks ranked by share price. Bank Share Price Price-to-Tangible Book Value Goldman Sachs $241.41 1.34 Capital One Financial $90.15 1.29 JPMorgan Chase $86.75 1.77 State Street $78.84 2.72 Citigroup $60.69 0.94 Wells Fargo $55.71 2.00 US Bancorp $52.17 2.95 Bank of New York Mellon $47.56 3.35 Morgan Stanley $43.37 1.35 Bank of America $22.60 1.35 Data source: YCharts.com. There's a wide range of bank stocks \ both in terms of their respective share prices and their business models. The standalone investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) tops the list, with a share price of $241. That's more than double the runner-up, credit card specialist Capital One Financial, with its shares selling for $90 each. On the other end of the spectrum is the nation's second largest commercial bank, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which has the least expensive stock by far within its peer group. Its shares trade for less than $23 a unit, which is roughly half that of the next cheapest bank stock, investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), which trades for around $43 a share. It's important to point out that a stock's price should play a smaller role in an investor's decision about whether to invest in it than valuation should. That's why I included the third column, showing these banks' price-to-tangible-book-value ratios. This is really what dictates whether a particular bank's stock is cheap or expensive. It's by looking at this that you can see why Goldman Sachs' stock isn't as expensive as its share price would otherwise lead you to believe. Based on its valuation, in fact, Goldman Sachs is ranked fifth after Citigroup, Capital One, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley. On the other end of the spectrum are banks such as Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, and State Street, which trade near or above three times their respective tangible book values. Why are these three banks so expensive? In U.S. Bancorp's case, a regional lender based in Minneapolis, it's the most profitable big bank in the country, run by some of the best in the business. And in Bank of New York Mellon and State Street's cases, both of which operate custodial banks (here are the five different types of banks you can invest in), their unique business models insulate them from the same degree of risk that most other banks face. The point is, if you're looking to invest in a bank today, you need to look beyond its share price and consider not only its value, but also what it brings to the table in terms of its business model.

CEO Jamie Dimon has close ties to Trump and the GOP, recently joining a policy forum to advise the incoming administration. He was rumored as a potential Treasury secretary before Trump named Steven Mnuchin as his pick. However, the biggest bullish factor is simply the numbers; J.P. Morgan is riding seven consecutive earnings beats, proving this is not a stock that is simply benefitting from a short-lived pop in pro-bank sentiment. With higher rates boosting net interest margins, a well-run megabank like J.P. Morgan Chase is a must-own in 2017. Bank of America — Hold A lot of the factors lifting J.P. Morgan’s stock price are similar at Bank of America Corp.

In a nutshell, Bank of America had faced resistance around $19 or so, dating all the way back to late 2009. But after a big breakout in the past week or so, the stock has finally reached a new plateau. That’s great to see, and the stock likely will stay there … but it also seems realistic that this stock could retest those levels in the coming months. While I would be a big buyer of Bank of America around $20, I would be reluctant to add to your position here. More loans at better margins will help in 2017, so I’m not bearish, but I think the stock price is a little ahead of itself.

                                   like Bank of America, is kind of a mixed bag. It certainly has the wind at its back, but it doesn’t quite have the quality of J.P. Morgan. And while it hasn’t run afoul of consumers and regulators the same way as Wells Fargo, that doesn’t necessarily make it a slam-dunk. As an Oppenheimer analyst recently said, it’s safe to “let the bet ride” if you’re holding bank stocks like Citi right now. However, it’s undeniable that a lot of rosy conditions like better loan margins and lower credit costs have already been baked into the cake. I wouldn’t sell, but there are other bank stocks I’d rather add too … including the regionals discussed below. Regions Financial — Buy Broadly speaking, I like regionals as a group over the megabanks because the promise of “reflation” in 2017 assuredly only applies to the U.S. and not to overseas markets. That makes smaller, regional banks a more focused play on this trend — and Regions Financial Corp.

It trades for roughly book value, and while its dividend is pretty meager at 1.8%, it has aggressively been increasing distributions lately; payouts went from paying 3 cents quarterly at the beginning of 2014 to 6.5 cents for its most recent dividend, yet RF is still only paying out about a third of total earnings and has more room for increases in 2017. Growing dividends coupled with projections of nearly double-digit EPS growth in 2017 bode very well for this regional bank.

While a bit more volatile, to be sure, the bank’s focused nature is very attractive given Utah’s amazingly low 3.2% unemployment rate as of October. While states like North Dakota enjoyed a brief period of growth thanks to fracking but challenges in the age of cheap oil, Utah has a much more balanced economy and isn’t as prone to the boom-and-bust cycle. Utah’s population growth and economic growth are both in the top 10 among U.S. states for 2015, its economy has continued to thrive in 2016 and it should continue to do well in the new year — bringing institutions like People’s Utah Bancorp with it.

Jeff Reeves,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 22, 2016 1:15 p.m. ET Investors have been piling into financial stocks since Election Day, but the Russell 2000 has been blasting past the S&P 500 By With the stock market at all-time highs and all the headlines about Dow 20,000, investors are buying U.S. stocks with confidence and optimism once again. However, not all stocks are created equal — and some trades are more popular than others. Many pundits are touting financial stocks as a tactical opportunity thanks to the hope of more favorable regulations out of Washington and better margins thanks to higher interest rates. Investors seem to be buying that narrative, based on a stunning 18% gain for the Financial Select Sector SPR ETF

That’s in part a response to this asset class being oversold in 2015 and bottoming out. But it’s also because of big growth opportunities in small-caps that were taking shape before the Trump trade and now are looking even brighter after Election Day. Despite this, the small-cap resurgence isn't getting quite as much attention as the run for financials. And that means there could still be an opportunity to stake out a claim in individual picks or broad-based index funds without overpaying. The narrative that has fueled the broader stock market rally is, in fact, tailor-made for small-cap stocks. It goes something like this: Better credit availability: While lenders have been getting all the love, let’s remember that more favorable financial regulations can be good for borrowers, too. If capital restraints are loosened and allow for better credit availability, smaller companies that don’t have the deep pockets of blue chips will benefit as they find it easier to get cash to fuel their growth. Fiscal stimulus: While the details remain hazy, President-elect Donald Trump and many of his Republican partners in Congress are eager to inject a massive stimulus into the economy. For megacap stocks, $10 million in extra contracts may not matter… but when you’re a small-cap stock doing a only few hundred million in total revenue annually, that adds up in a big way. Return of “risk-on” trades: Rising rates are making longer-duration bonds less attractive, and that has forced a rotation of cash into stocks. And at the same time, the 10-year Treasury

                                    yield is finally back above 2.5% while the typical S&P 500 yield is only about 2.0% right now. That makes sleepy large-cap dividend payers much less attractive, and sets the stage for investors to favor more volatile but more “growthy” small caps in the new year. Enjoy the ride while it lasts: Of course, the euphoria may not last forever and eventually the old narrative of stagnant global growth could return. So if you want to strike while the iron is hot, take advantage of smaller companies that can ramp up faster and are much “simpler” companies — particularly those focused on domestic opportunities instead of juggling the complex operations of a multinational operation. The current rally will inevitably lose momentum, so take enjoy the ride while it lasts in smaller stocks best positioned to profit. It all adds up to a compelling reason to weight your portfolio toward small cap growth in 2017, either through individual names or with a broad-based play like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. You may be wondering why I consider small-caps an opportunity but see financials as overbought, considering they share many of the same growth narratives and roughly the same outperformance. However, it’s pretty difficult to ever consider a bank as a true “growth” stock even in an environment of short-term improvement in fundamentals thanks to macro conditions. And after the sentiment pop fades in financials, there’s not much staying power vs. a growth narrative in a small company that will last. And beyond that, the advantage of small caps lies not just in growth potential, but in valuation. Smaller U.S. stocks had largely been left for dead in 2015 thanks to a number of factors, including the crash in commodity prices that threatened a wave of junk-bond defaults in smaller miners and energy companies. At the same time, uncertainty around the presidential election at home and Brexit in Europe caused many investors to steer away from riskier small-caps for much of 2016. However, even before Election Day investors started to view the sector as oversold — and even now, after a big run, the forward P/E of the Russell 2000 is trading 20.1 times expected 2017 earnings compared with a forward P/E of 19.6 for the Nasdaq 100 and 19.0 for the S&P 500. That a very small premium to pay on faster-moving small-caps, which have much higher growth potential then blue chips. Fund flows show investors are clearly interested in the risk-on equities trade right now; According to Morningstar, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF

That in itself is a very bullish sign, since small-cap stocks are frequently momentum names that ride as much on sentiment as they do on any underlying growth metrics. In other words, take what the market gives you and join in this small-cap rally while it lasts. Not only is it equally powerful for investors as the rise in financial stocks, it will likely prove much more durable. ",4 reasons to weight your portfolio toward small-cap growth stocks in 2017 - MarketWatch
,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"U.S. prosecutors in San Francisco have asked Wells Fargo banker Yesenia Guitron, who lost a private lawsuit against the fourth-largest lender, to testify before a grand jury in San Francisco on Tuesday, according to a subpoena dated Dec. 12, which was seen by Reuters. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. Guitron is among at least five Wells Fargo employees who sued the bank or filed complaints with regulators alleging that they were fired after reporting the opening of customer accounts without their permission, according to a Reuters review of lawsuits and complaints to the U.S. Labor Department. The suits and complaints, filed between 2010 and 2014, raise questions about how early Wells Fargo knew about such allegations and how it handled them. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo reached a settlement with U.S. regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney in September. The Justice Department subpoena directs Guitron to bring all documents related to her employment at Wells, including any related to sales practices, discipline “or other form of retaliation taken against you by Wells Fargo or Wells Fargo employees.” Guitron and her lawyer were not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, which issued the subpoena, declined comment. The bank has acknowledged opening as many as 2 million accounts without customer permission, and it fired 5,300 employees for the behavior. Former staffers have publicly described a culture where they were pushed into hitting unrealistic sales targets and opened the sham accounts to do so. Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf resigned in October after intense questioning before Congress. Beyond the Justice Department probe, Wells Fargo is facing others from various lawmakers and regulators, including a criminal probe by the California attorney general’s office. Guitron and another personal banker, Judi Klosek, filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as a joint federal lawsuit in 2010, claiming Wells Fargo retaliated against them for blowing the whistle on similar conduct. Guitron alleged that managers responded by falsifying a paper trail that purported to document her poor performance, forbidding her from taking family medical leave and firing her improperly. A federal judge ultimately dismissed all of Guitron’s claims, saying Wells Fargo was justified in firing her because she failed to meet sales quotas and refused to meet with management. ","

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"The agreement in principle, announced by Deutsche Bank’s Frankfurt headquarters early Friday morning, offers some relief to the German lender, whose stock was hit hard in September after it acknowledged the Justice Department had been seeking nearly twice as much. It also highlights the Justice Department’s recent efforts to hold European banks accountable for shoddy securities that contributed to the U.S. housing market collapse. Deutsche Bank does not plan a capital increase to cover the settlement, a person close to the bank said. The lender expects the agreement to be finalized in early 2017, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Deutsche does expect to record a pretax charge of about $1.17 billion in its fourth quarter because of the civil monetary penalty, according to its press release. As part of the agreement, Deutsche Bank would pay a civil monetary penalty of $3.1 billion and provide $4.1 billion in consumer relief, such as loan forgiveness. The bank cautioned that there is “no assurance” the two sides will agree on the final documents. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. Settling the mortgage-securities case would mean Deutsche Bank has shaken off one legal headache. Three major probes remain. Deutsche faces investigations into the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange rates, suspicious equities trades in Russia, as well as alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran and other countries. Since 2012, Deutsche Bank has already paid more than 12 billion euros for litigation, including a deal with U.S. mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Deutsche Bank’s “troubling practices” were widespread, including when trader Greg Lippmann told colleagues that many home loans the bank was packaging into securities were “crap” and “pigs,” according to a 2011 U.S. Senate subcommittee report. Lippmann has declined to comment on the report. There has been fear among investors, companies and regulators that the penalties are too much for Deutsche Bank to withstand. Its shares plunged to a record low of 9.90 euros in September, after the bank confirmed the Justice Department was demanding $14 billion. The stock has recovered substantially, but is down from the beginning of 2016. The Justice Department is still pursuing mortgage allegations against other lenders in addition to Barclays. U.S. banks have paid tens of billions of dollars over the past three years to settle with U.S. authorities over misleading investors about the quality of mortgages underlying securities. Deutsche is not the first bank to announce a settlement amount before both sides have agreed on the final documentation. Morgan Stanley disclosed its agreement a year before it was finalized and formally announced. ","

 ,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"Expectations for 2017 are generally positive for the stock market, anticipating that the “pragmatic” economic version of Trump wins out over the “anti-growth” version of Trump who often appears in late night Twitter rants. Key economic assumptions for the new year are for moderate growth in corporate earnings, rising employment and wages, and interest rates that rise at a moderate pace. Policy assumptions are for increased government spending, corporate and personal tax reform, and for an easing of regulation. The expectation of corporate tax reform provided a significant boost to small company stocks, which often pay effective tax rates that are close to the statutory maximum. If corporate taxes are lowered, the small company stock rally is likely to continue. The hope for a less-burdensome regulatory reform is providing an additional boost in sentiment for small company stocks, while contributing to the rally in bank stocks. Low interest rates and a flat yield curve have hurt bank stocks for many years, so the reversal in interest rates and inflation expectations triggered a rally in bank stocks. Strong economic momentum and increasing interest rates make financial services an attractive investment segment for 2017. Trump’s selection of fossil-fuel friendly advisors and the recent OPEC agreement to limit oil production has boosted energy stocks, though energy prices may not have much more room to run given shale supply that will come back into production as prices rise and the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. Although Trump may want to help the coal industry and fossil fuel producers, economic reality may get in the way of his plans. “Lower for longer” Federal Reserve policies are being supplanted by a more balanced outlook in which inflation is considered an emerging risk. Consequently, investors have adjusted their expectations for rate hikes, with longer-term government bonds, municipal bonds and emerging markets debt losing ground. Bond proxies that benefited from the quest for yield earlier in 2016, such as utilities and real estate investment trusts, also lost ground after the election. A rising rate environment into 2017 will extend the pressure on bonds and bond proxies. Healthcare and defense stocks are controversial segments of the market. Both were expected to be winners in a Trump administration. Healthcare was expected to benefit from lower pricing pressures and repeal or restructuring of the Affordable Care Act.  However, Trump has become more vocal about high drug prices, so the sigh of relief from pharmaceutical executives after his election may have been premature. Defense stocks were also expected to winners under Trump, but recent criticisms of Boeing and Lockheed Martin indicate that Trump may strike a hard bargain with government contractors. European stocks face challenges in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, populist unrest and a weakened banking system. Japan faces daunting debt levels and demographic challenges, though Japanese stocks have rebounded in recent weeks with help from a falling yen and government equity purchases. Emerging markets have a mixed outlook, as rebalancing toward consumer-oriented economies will help some emerging markets, but the strong dollar and American protectionism will hurt others. The euphoria of the recent rally may fade as Trump faces the limitations of presidential power. Uncertainty is building about the specifics of his governing priorities and ability to implement policy. Changes to the market outlook are likely to be driven by a few key economic and geopolitical considerations, including tax and spending initiatives, trade policy, immigration changes and global geopolitical developments. The bottom line is that investors can count on 2017 to be a year of continued volatility. View the discussion thread.

 ,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"CHICAGO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Investors pulled another $2 billion from U.S. municipal bond funds in the latest week, underscoring fears that potential sweeping tax changes under President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican Congress will undermine the tax-exempt debt market. Trump’s plans to cut taxes and increase fiscal spending have already boosted inflation expectations. As a result fixed-income markets, already weighed down by forecasts for tighter U.S. monetary policy, have see prices slump while stocks have reached record highs. Since the Nov. 8 election, munis suffered more than any other fixed-income sector with a negative total return of 3.229 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices. Trump wants to reduce the current seven tax brackets to three: 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. This mirrors a June tax proposal by U.S. House Republicans but the House proposal would also allow taxpayers to deduct 50 percent of their capital gains, dividends and interest income, shrinking overall taxes even further. “It just seems that municipals would have to readjust in terms of yield, a little bit higher yield, to bring itself back into parity proportionately with other asset classes to remain competitive,” said Jim Colby, chief municipal strategist at VanEck. Tax-exempt bonds, which outperformed other fixed-income assets in 2015, are on track to have the only negative return, albeit a small one, for all of 2016. As of last Wednesday, munis returned a negative 0.078 percent versus positive returns of 0.551 percent for Treasuries and 5.158 percent for corporate bonds, BAML reported. The corporate tax rate, as envisioned by Trump, would fall to 15 percent from 35 percent, making muni bonds less attractive for tax-exempt debt buyers like banks and property and casualty insurance companies. Wealthy investors subject to federal income tax rates currently as high as 39.6 percent are traditional buyers of tax-free bonds sold by states, cities, schools, nonprofits and other issuers. Investors are fleeing from muni bond funds. The net outflows have grown for six straight weeks to $13.5 billion since the U.S. election, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper service. The muni market is $3.7 trillion overall and until recently was the beneficiary of 54 straight weeks of fund net inflows. While there is talk of a tax reform bill moving through the House relatively quickly, past history indicates a vote by the August recess, setting up a Senate vote in the fall and potential signing by Trump before year-end. If progress stalls, tax reform could lay dormant during 2018’s election year. Some question the tax impact on the municipal bond market though. Philip Fischer, municipal research strategist at BAML, said tax rates are no longer the driving force behind muni purchases and that tax-sheltered investment vehicles have replaced competition from other fixed-income assets. “What is going on is that munis have to yield enough so they are competitive with other tax sheltered instruments like 401k’s,” he said. The tax-exempt market should have some time to adjust before the first major U.S. tax changes materialize since 1986’s massive reform law. “We really believe if it really does happen it’s more of a 2018 event not a 2017,” said Dan Heckman, national investment consultant at US Bank. Meanwhile, muni issuers are facing higher borrowing costs than just six months ago. A rise in yields on Municipal Market Data’s benchmark triple-A scale from record lows reached this summer accelerated after the election. The yield on top-rated 30-year bonds ended Friday at 3.11 percent, which is 118 basis points up from its 1.93 percent low. For 10-year bonds, Friday’s 2.39 percent yield was 110 basis points over the all-time low of 1.29 percent. Issuers took advantage of historic low rates to refund old debt and sell new bonds, pushing 2016 issuance to $423.5 billion as of Friday, just short of 2010’s record $430.35 billion supply, according to Thomson Reuters data. “We could envision a market totaling $350 billion (in 2017), about $100 billion less than this year, but this of course depends heavily on how the proposals play out,” Natalie Cohen, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a December report on potential tax changes.

Adam Howard,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"President Barack Obama expressed confidence that his progressive vision for the country still has broad appeal despite the stunning defeat of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election this November in a candid sit-down for his former adviser David Axelrod's podcast ""The Axe Files."" Although he complimented Clinton, saying she ""performed wonderfully under really tough circumstances,"" he also suggested that had he been able to campaign for a third term he could have rallied many Americans — even those who disagreed with him — behind his vision of a more tolerant and diverse nation.

President-elect Donald Trump won several districts in crucial Rust Belt states that the president had triumphed in previously, a fact Obama and Axelrod discussed during the show. Trump tweet: President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. The numbers may back up the president's argument. For months now, Obama has enjoyed approval ratings north of 50 percent, with even a decent portion of Trump voters still holding a favorable view of him. In the November election, Clinton was not able to outperform the president in key demographic groups (women, minorities, young people) which have come to be known as ""the Obama coalition,"" but that doesn't mean the president believes all is lost. ""In the wake of the election and Trump winning, a lot of people have suggested that somehow, it really was a fantasy,"" Obama said of his historic 2008 White House run and eventual victory. ""What I would argue is, is that the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of a one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and full of energy and dynamism."" In order for Democrats to avoid being permanently marginalized, Obama made the case that the party must embrace its roots as a party of average Americans. ""We're not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this, but that we care about these communities, that we're bleeding for these communities,"" he said. ""It means caring about local races, state boards or school boards and city councils and state legislative races and not thinking that somehow, just a great set of progressive policies that we present to the New York Times editorial board will win the day.""

Michelle Fox,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"The Dow Jones industrial average will likely hit 20,000 in January and will probably climb to 30,000 in the next four to five years, investment expert Nancy Tengler told CNBC on Wednesday. Her bullish forecast is due, in part, to the potential ""pro-growth"" economic policies expected after President-elect Donald Trump takes office. ""The formula for growth is before us and we have turned the corner from an earnings standpoint in the third quarter,"" the chief investment officer of Heartland Financial said in an interview with ""Power Lunch."" ""We are being given a tail wind that, I think, is going to very much help corporate America."" The market has been moving higher since Trump's victory Nov. 8. While the Dow has been within striking distance of 20,000 in recent days, on Wednesday it slipped lower. Scott Wren, global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, believes the index will see the milestone this week or in early 2017. However, it will move above and below 20,000 several times over the next couple of months, he told ""Power Lunch."" And while he is hopeful about the economic proposals of the Trump administration, he pointed out that the benefits will take some time to be seen. ""They're going to take a long time to refine, debate, implement and then finally have an effect on the economy,"" Wren said. He also thinks concerns may hit the market later next year. ""I think the market in the second half of 2017 is going to start to worry a little bit about inflation, wage inflation, Fed behind the curve in 2018 and that is going to take a little steam out of the market in 2017,"" he predicted. Meanwhile, Tim Seymour, managing partner at Triogem Asset Management, is urging caution heading into January, which he believes is likely to be ""nasty."" In part, that's because there have only been three positive Januarys in the past 10 years, and there has already been an enormous runup in the market,"" he told ""Power Lunch."" ""Taking risk right out of the gate just because things have gone so well isn't necessarily how you want to play this,"" Seymour said. He believes sectors that were doing well before the election will continue to perform. He specifically likes reflation trades, and thinks housing, master limited partnerships and industrial metals should do well. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, also thinks there may be a pullback early in 2017, but believes the market will likely move higher because the fundamentals are improving. He specifically likes financials and consumer discretionary. ""You want to bet on the American consumer,"" McMillan said. ""We're seeing wage growth continue to rise. We're seeing job growth doing very well."" For those who want to put money into the market, he would buy every two weeks or so over the next couple of months.

Krystina Gustafson,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"Minutes before Dow Jones reported that Kate Spade  is exploring a sale of its business, one options trader purchased nearly 2,000 calls in the accessories label — resulting in a quick $320,000 profit. According to CNBC ""Fast Money Halftime Report"" trader Jon Najarian, thousands of Kate Spade's call options were purchased at 12:23 p.m. ET Wednesday — roughly 10 minutes before headlines of a potential sale hit. A call gives the buyer an option to purchase assets at an already agreed-upon price on or before a certain date. When options activity spikes ahead of an announcement, it can indicate that someone had inside information. Kate Spade has been under pressure to sell its business, after activist firm Caerus Investors suggested the company do so last month. Tweet ""We are deeply concerned about the precipitous decline in the share price of Kate Spade over the last two and a half years brought about by management's inability to meet their own stated goals,"" Caerus said in its letter at that time. The SEC declined to comment as to whether it would investigate Wednesday's trading activity. Earlier, a spokeswoman for Kate Spade declined to comment on the potential sale, telling CNBC that ""as a company policy, we do not comment on industry rumors or speculation."" She did not immediately respond to a second request for comment regarding the trading activity. After the Dow Jones report surfaced, Kate Spade shares were halted for volatility. They resumed trading shortly after, and following another brief halt, were recently trading about 15 percent higher Wednesday afternoon. Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow said several brand houses — namely, VF Corp, PVH, Hanesbrands, Michael Kors and Coach — have said they are looking to make an acquisition. Boruchow said Kate's valuation was ""compelling"" since the shares have been punished for the company's recent choppy earnings reports. VF Corp and Michael Kors, which are typically quiet on the options front, both saw heightened activity on Wednesday. ""We know that both Coach and Kors each have cash and want to make a purchase of another brand,"" Telsey Advisory Group's Dana Telsey told CNBC on Wednesday. ""You certainly have in Kate a long runway of potential growth ahead."" Spokespersons from Michael Kors, Coach and VF Corp each told CNBC that their companies do not comment on rumors or speculation.

Jeff Brown,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"The Dow Jones industrial average has finally hit 20,000, and if it closes above that mark on Wednesday, it will surely be a market milestone. But if the long wait for Dow 20,000 already tired you out, don't feel bad. Dow 20,000 is not quite like running a four-minute mile or breaking the sound barrier. It's little more than an imaginary line. As a practical matter, Dow 20,001 will make investors richer than Dow 20,000, but surely won't get as much attention. Big round numbers are easier to remember and visualize than the ones marking records leading up to them, just as the 20-foot pole vault seems easier to imagine than 19 feet, 11½ inches. ""Hitting 20,000 is significant only in terms of its emotional and psychological impact on us,"" said Jeremy Torgerson, CEO of NVest Advisors in Brownsville, Texas. ""We humans love round numbers. ""Remember New Year's Day 2000, as a recent example,"" he added. ""That new year was somehow more meaningful than January 2, 2001, or January 1, 1999."" The Dow's climb up over time can't make any claim to being a natural law of market evolution. It's purely a human invention,created by The Wall Street Journal in 1896, and its makeup changes from time to time based on choices by editors at S&P Dow Jones Indices. ""The fact that people even monitor the Dow is an artifact of history,"" said Robert Johnson, president of the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. It is the only price-weighted market index, a methodology that more heavily emphasizes moves by higher priced stocks than their lower priced counterparts — without sound logic, in Johnson's opinion. ""People still refer to how many points the Dow is up or down, even though a 100-point move is roughly half a percent today and it was approximately 5 percent at the time of the 1987 crash,"" Johnson said. If the Dow were a typical average, prices of the 30 stocks would be added up and divided by 30. But instead the calculation uses a much smaller divisor — currently 0.14602128057775. The divisor has been adjusted over the decades to account for stock splits, spin-offs, mergers and stock dividends, to assure that numbers from before and after yield apples-to-apples comparisons. What really matters to investors is percentage gains, not the number of points the Dow adds over time. So going from 1,000 to 2,000 doubled investors' money, as did 5,000 to 10,000 and 10,000 to 20,000. Investors may also be interested in how the Dow behaves after passing a big milestone. Unfortunately, there's no pattern dependable enough to bet on. ""Back in 1999, we hit 10,000 and the market continued to run another 1,000 points, but in January 2000, the market went from 11,900 down to 9,600,"" recalled Michael Darvish, senior financial advisor with Regal Securities in New York. ""There is no specific pattern. ""It depends on the economic conditions,"" he added. ""We are on a Trump high right now. Last January, we had a sell-off, and I would not be surprised if we get another one this year as investors want to take some money off the table."" An investor who wanted to bet on gains in the Dow could buy the 30 stocks, buy a fund that holds large-capitalization stocks including those in the Dow or make a pure play with SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA), an exchange-traded fund that owns the 30 Dow stocks. But unless you own DIA, chances are your own results are different from the Dow's. The other big-name stock index ETF, the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPY), contains 500 stocks versus the Dow's 30, but tends to move about the same as the Dow over time, since it also is composed of large-cap issues. But if you own foreign stocks, or small-company stocks, or shares in specific sectors, the Dow 20,000 may not matter much to you. ""What matters is not where the Dow is, or how round that number is, but how one's own portfolio of investments is doing,"" said Michal Strahilevitz, behavioral economist at Duke University's Center for Advanced Hindsight. ""For the wisest of investors, that will include a diverse range of index funds and such and not just a fund that tracks the Dow."" Investors may be cheered by a milestone. ""It is significant because, from a momentum perspective, once people see Dow 20,000 then they can be convinced that Dow 25,000 is possible,"" said Ted Jenkin, CEO of Oxygen Financial in Alpharetta, Georgia. But they should not use the Dow milestone as an excuse to alter their long-term plan. ""That is the best advice for anyone, no matter what the Dow has done, is doing or will do,"" Strahilevitz said. ""Timing the market based on anything is a fool's strategy. ""It fails at least as often as it works.""

According to Gartman, ""The trade for the next year,"" or at least for the next few months, is actually in soft agricultural commodities. ""Historically at this time of the year, being long corn and short wheat [is the trade, especially as] the winter wheat crop seems to be in pretty good shape,"" the editor and publisher of The Gartman Letter said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""We've gotten decent rains and snow where needed, we had some cold temperatures last week that might've done a little damage to the wintering wheat crop but on balance, we will do fine.""

This even though the yellow metal is seeing its longest losing streak in 12 years, with seven straight weeks of decline. He says that from a technical standpoint, gold is actually holding its own with a support level around $1,125. This means that Gartman doesn't see gold dropping below $1,125, even though the metal has plunged more than 10 percent since the election in November.

Darla Mercado,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"Think twice before you swipe that debit card if you have a low balance: Your bank is getting fat off your overdraft fees. Over the first three quarters of this year, 626 large banks reaped a windfall of $8.4 billion from overdraft and ""non-sufficient funds"" fees,   according to a report from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a federation of consumer advocacy groups. That's up 4 percent from a year ago. Overdraft fees are charges banks assess when a transaction puts your balance in the red. Institutions charge a ""non-sufficient funds"" penalty when your account is already in negative territory and your purchase is rejected. These charges continue to be a bonanza for banks, despite the Federal Reserve's 2010 regulations that sought to bar them from assessing these fees unless customers have opted into an overdraft protection program. ""The point is that the rule is very important because it prevents you from overdrafting your debit or ATM card unless you opt in,"" said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the U.S. PIRG. ""But the rule didn't do anything about the other two problems identified by consumer advocacy groups: reordering transactions and the allowed maximum number of overdrafts in a day,"" he said. When an institution reorders transactions, it shuffles a large purchase so that it clears before subsequent smaller debits are charged against your balance. This allows banks to maximize overdraft fees. Here's how it works: You have $100 in your checking account, and as you go throughout your day, you spend a total of $25 on three small purchases. Later that same day, your bank clears a check you wrote for $100. When a bank reorders a transaction, it will post the $100 first — even though it was the last charge against your account — and post the three smaller charges that total $25 afterward. This way, the bank assesses fees on each of the last three smaller purchases, rather than charging one fee for the check. The   median overdraft fee is $34, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Banks also have different policies on the number of fees they permit in a given day. Some will allow you to overdraft more than five times in a day, which can rack up hundreds of dollars in additional charges to your account, according to   data from NerdWallet. ""Banks offer customers multiple tools to avoid overdrawing, including text alerts about low balances and the ability to monitor their accounts online, on a mobile device, at the ATM or by telephone 24/7,"" wrote John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association, in an e-mail. ""Customers who want debit card and ATM overdraft protection must proactively opt-in and can opt-out at any time,"" he wrote. The average bank pocketed $17.76 in overdraft fee revenue per customer in the first three quarters of the year, up 2.6 percent from the year-ago period, according to the U.S. PIRG's report. Ten banks account for two-thirds of overdraft revenue. Many of the institutions are nationally known, but one is regional. See below. In order to avoid the additional fees, customers ought to take a look at their bank statements and determine whether they're enrolled in an overdraft program. Sometimes it's better to pay cash for small purchases or to have those transactions denied altogether, as opposed to racking up hundreds of dollars in fees. ""The main message for the consumers is that if you're bouncing checks and paying fees that constitute a $38 cup of coffee, then you've opted into a service that's serving the bank and not you,"" said Mierzwinski. Another suggestion is to go back to the basics: Balance your checkbook and be vigilant for transactions that could put you in negative territory if they clear. Finally, keep a buffer if you live paycheck to paycheck. ""When your account says you have $100 in it, pretend it has zero,"" said Mierzwinski. ""Don't use it until you put another $100 in it."" ","Banks are raking in the fees, thanks to your overdrafts"

Wells Fargo's shares didn't move a lot, but it made it to the finish line. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. It's been a banner year for banks. The KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen blue-chip bank stocks, is up 28% in 2016. That's more than twice the return on the S&P 500. But some banks haven't fully participated in the rally. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is a case in point. Shares of the nation's third biggest bank by assets are up for the year, but only by 3%. KBWB data by YCharts. While 2016 has ended well for most bank stocks, it didn't start that way. From the beginning of the year into the first half of February, bank stocks dropped precipitously, with shares of Wells Fargo losing 17% of their value. Low energy prices were the culprit. As the price of oil fell below $30 a barrel in January, analysts and commentators began to speculate that the nation's biggest banks would start to write off loans from their energy portfolios. This is exactly what Wells Fargo did. When it reported fourth-quarter 2015 earnings in January, loan loss provisions at the bank increased by 71% on a year-over-year basis, climbing from $485 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 up to $831 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. On the conference call with analysts, its CFO said that the bank expected loan losses in the sector to continue mounting. And Wells Fargo's now-former CEO, John Stumpf, apprised investors that upwards of 250 employees at the bank were ""big-time focused on this."" These efforts aside, bank stocks proceeded to follow the price of oil up over the next few months, with energy prices flirting with $50 a barrel by the beginning of June. But just as oil prices were recovering, assuaging fears of further loan losses at Wells Fargo and other major energy lenders, a second crisis struck. In the middle of June: Voters in the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Known as Brexit, the development sent bank stocks spiraling downward. The concerns were threefold. First, the presumed turmoil that would erupt from the unexpected outcome would increase uncertainty and thereby decrease business investment and thus demand for loans. Second, economic and political problems in Europe would cause the value of the euro to decline relative to the dollar and thereby increase the cost of U.S. exports. As a domestic bank, this would hit Wells Fargo particularly hard. Finally, the turmoil in the credit markets would weigh on the Federal Reserve's long-awaited decision to raise the fed funds rate, the key short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States. Because banks make more money when interest rates rise, this would mean that Wells Fargo and others would have to continue to be patient before a rate rise came to fruition. All of these factors conspired in June to push Wells Fargo's shares down by 17% yet again for the year. Just as Wells Fargo's shares recovered from the pullback following Brexit, they plummeted again in September. This time, though, the bank couldn't blame others for its problems. In early September, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau revealed that thousands of employees in Wells Fargo branches had opened millions of fake accounts for customers in order to meet aggressive sales targets. The damage to Wells Fargo's reputation translated into a 20% drop in Wells Fargo's stock price, the third time in 2016 that its shares lost nearly a fifth of their value. Wells Fargo has since changed its CEO, eliminated product sales goals in its branches, paid $185 million in fines to regulators, and been sanctioned by three of the four main industry regulators -- the Fed, the CFPB, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. But even though Wells Fargo's fake-account scandal is among the worst to strike the industry in recent memory, it still wasn't enough to keep the bank's shares down for long. Fast-forward to November, and its stock made up for the loss and then some. The outcome of the presidential election served as the catalyst. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promises to accelerate economic growth through tax cuts and infrastructure projects, combined with easing up on bank regulations, has convinced investors that banks could soon make much more money. One month later, this view seemed to be confirmed by the Federal Reserve's decision to increase the fed funds rate. Thus, despite being down by upwards of 20% on multiple occasions through 2016, Wells Fargo's shares are headed for a mediocre 3% gain on the year. This may not seem like a huge accomplishment given how the rest of the banking sector performed this year, but it's certainly a lot better than it could have been. ","
      
    Why Wells Fargo Shares Barely Budged in 2016 -- The Motley Fool

Bank of America lowered the bar on its stock price in 2009. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. If you compare Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) stock to the other global systemically important banks in the United States, one thing sticks out: Bank of America's share price is significantly lower than all of the rest. It costs a little less than $23 to buy a share of Bank of America, and that's after the post-election surge in bank stocks. Meanwhile, even the second least expensive big bank stock, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), costs more than $43 per share. Given that Bank of America is the second biggest bank in the United States, what explains this? Bank Price per Share Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (millions) Goldman Sachs $241.39 430 JPMorgan Chase $86.74 3,630 State Street $78.96 393 Citigroup $60.78 2,880 Wells Fargo $55.77 5,095 Bank of New York Mellon $47.58 1,068 Morgan Stanley $43.37 1,879 Bank of America $22.64 11,000 Data source: YCharts.com. The answer is that Bank of America has way more shares outstanding than any other bank. It had an average of 11 billion shares of common stock outstanding in the third quarter of this year, according to YCharts.com. That compares to five billion outstanding shares at Wells Fargo, 3.6 billion at JPMorgan Chase, 2.9 billion at Citigroup, and 1.9 billion at Morgan Stanley, to cite the four other big banks with the most outstanding shares. This means that Bank of America's book value must be divvied up across a much larger number of shares than close competitors such as Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley. This dilutes the amount of book value that each share of Bank of America's stock lays claim to. It accordingly follows that because a bank's share price is largely a function of its book value per share, Bank of America's stock will invariably trade for a lower price than its peers so long as it has so many more outstanding shares. Bank of America wasn't always in the situation. Going into the financial crisis, Bank of America had between four and five billion shares of outstanding common stock. That's roughly half its current count. Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author. Most of the increase came in 2009, when Bank of America issued upwards of five billion new shares of common stock in order to acquire Merrill Lynch and to raise capital to survive the crisis. Consequently, even though Bank of America has turned the corner and largely left the 2008 crisis in the rearview mirror, the bank's missteps in the lead-up to the downturn continue to be reflected in its share price today.

    1 Reason Bank of America’s Stock Price Is Still So Low -- The Motley Fool

Maurie Backman,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Many of us experience different types of financial remorse, but when it comes to retirement, there's one major regret that's seemingly universal: not saving early enough. In a recent Wells Fargo survey, 74% of workers admitted that they should've started saving for retirement sooner than when they actually did. Not surprisingly, this attitude is highest among 30-somethings, many of whom had the forethought and ability to start saving earlier on in their careers. Even 68% of current retirees say they regret waiting to save. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. There's a reason why a dollar today is worth more than that same dollar in the future, and it all has to do with growth potential. IRAs and 401(k) plans are so instrumental in saving for retirement because they allow us to take advantage of compounding. When you put money into a 401(k) or IRA, you're not just benefiting from that principal contribution; you're also capitalizing on whatever investment growth that money achieves. And the more time you have to let your savings compound, the higher your ending balance is likely to be. That's why it's crucial to start saving as early on in your career as possible. Transamerica reports that among Gen Xers (roughly today's 34- to 54-year-olds), the median age to start saving for retirement was 28. And while that's far better than starting later, it also means that countless workers are missing out on five years of investment growth or more. The following table shows how much money you stand to accumulate if you begin saving $300 a month at various ages: If You Start Saving $300 a Month at Age... Your Savings Balance at Age 65 Will Be... (Assumes an 8% Average Annual Return) 22 $1.186 million 25 $932,000 28 $731,000 35 $408,000 45 $165,000 55 $52,000 TABLE AND CALCULATIONS BY AUTHOR. There are a few things you should note about these calculations. First, they assume an average annual 8% return, which you're most likely to get if you invest heavily in stocks. While stocks are a riskier investment than bonds, they've historically proven to deliver significantly higher returns, and if you start saving when you're young, you'll have time to ride out whatever volatility the market throws your way. Furthermore, these calculations assume that your contributions remain steady over time. In reality, as you progress in your career and earn more money, you should conceivably be able to increase your contributions and grow your savings even further. On top of that, it's estimated that a good 50% of companies offer some type of 401(k) match. If yours is one of them, you can benefit even further from ramping up your savings over time. But all that aside, let's study these numbers for a moment. It's clear that the sooner you start putting money away, the more wealth you'll accumulate over time, but take a look at the difference between kicking off your savings efforts at 22 versus 28, the median age among Gen Xers. What you'll see is that an extra $21,600 in base contributions could've yielded an additional $455,000 for retirement. Talk about a staggering return on investment. Of course, not everyone can afford to part with $300 a month, especially in the early stages of post-college life. But if you're committed to amassing a sizable nest egg, there are things you can do to maximize your savings. First, stick to a budget. It's estimated that only 41% of Americans use a household budget, but without one, you'll have a hard time tracking your spending and finding room to save. Next, live below your means, especially when it comes to housing, which is most people's largest expense. Between 2011 and 2014, more than 50% of Americans had to make at least one major sacrifice to cover their housing costs, from putting off retirement savings to taking on credit card debt. Keeping your housing costs lower than 30% of your take-home pay is a reasonably good starting point. Finally, think before you spend money on things you don't actually need. A new TV might seem like a fun reward, but putting that cash into a 401(k) plan is bound to be a more worthwhile investment in the long run. ","
      
    Almost 75% of Americans Have This Major Retirement Regret -- The Motley Fool

  "
John Maxfield,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has been waiting for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for years. So when the central bank went ahead and hiked the fed funds rate last week, Bank of America didn't waste any time in its response. On Wednesday, almost simultaneous with the Fed's announcement of a 25 basis point hike, Bank of America announced that it was increasing its prime lending rate from 3.5% to 3.75%. This is the lowest rate at which it will lend to its most creditworthy customers, typically multinational corporations. It wasn't alone in doing so. Among other banks that followed suit were JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and U.S. Bancorp. The actual increase in Bank of America's prime rate was marginal -- like the Fed's, only 25 basis points -- but this doesn't detract from the move's importance. When a bank makes a loan, it's essentially selling money. The price at which it does so is dictated by prevailing interest rates. It follows that as interest rates rise, banks earn more revenue and profit from lending money. You can get sense for this by comparing how much Bank of America charged for loans before interest rates plummeted eight years ago to how much it charges today. In the fourth quarter of 2006, its loan portfolio yielded 7.42%. Fast-forward to the third quarter of this year, and the yield on Bank of America's loan portfolio had dropped to 3.73%. Data from 4Q06 and 3Q16. Source: Bank of America. Chart by author. If Bank of America's loan portfolio yield was the same today as it was in 2006, the North Carolina-based bank's interest income would be $8.3 billion higher. And because that's high-margin revenue -- you don't have to hire more employees or build more branches to earn those extra dollars -- most of that revenue would fall to Bank of America's bottom line as profit, as much as doubling its current earnings. It probably goes without saying, but we're a long way from seeing interest rates double. Yet even modest increases in rates would provide meaningful boosts to Bank of America's top and bottom lines. As of Sept. 30, a 100 basis point, or one percentage point, increase in short- and long-term rates would boost Bank of America's net interest income over the next 12 months by $5.3 billion. That's more than any other bank stands to benefit under that scenario. The Fed helped in this regard, increasing short-term rates by 25 basis points last week. But even more significant from Bank of America's perspective has been the rapid ascent of long-term rates. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the primary long-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, climbed from 1.6% at the beginning of November to around 2.6% today, an increase of 100 basis points. Viewed from this perspective, it should be clear to investors why Bank of America's decision to raise its prime rate is an auspicious sign of things to come. ","
      
    Bank of America Didn’t Waste Any Time Raising Its Own Interest Rates -- The Motley Fool

With 2016 ending, and the election behind us, it's time to think about some of the best moves to make in your portfolio that could perform well in 2017 and beyond. One of my favorite places to look for stock ideas is Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio, much of which was hand-picked by the Oracle of Omaha himself, Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. With that in mind, here are three stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that I'm keeping an eye on as we head into 2017. In fact, I already own all three and am considering adding more to each position as the New Year approaches. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has had a tremendous rally over much of 2016. After bottoming out at less than $11 in February, the stock has more than doubled, trading for about $22.50 as I write. Even so, I have no plans to sell a single share, and I think the ""Trump rally"" for big banks could still be in its early stages. To be clear, Berkshire doesn't actually own Bank of America -- not yet. During the financial crisis, Berkshire made a $5 billion investment in the bank that included warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank before September 2021, and Buffett has made it clear that Berkshire plans on exercising these warrants. In addition, Trump's promise to lower regulation could mean looser capital requirements and smaller compliance costs for the bank. This development would allow the bank to make more loans, increase efficiency, and simply make it easier for the bank to conduct business. As a final thought on Bank of America, keep in mind that even with the big rally, the stock still trades for a 7% discount to its book value. BAC data by YCharts From a valuation standpoint, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of the cheapest stocks in the market. With a P/E multiple of just 6.1 times 2016's expected earnings and a 4.2% dividend yield, GM appears to be a value-seeker's dream. First the bad news. The U.S. auto market has been growing for several years and looks like it's plateauing, which could mean increased competition and shrinking margins. Also, it's still somewhat unclear how much damage the flurry of recalls over the past few years has done to GM's brand image. Finally, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the Trump presidency. Trump's trade policies could put GM's international growth in jeopardy, and the interest-rate growth that's expected to come with Trump's growth plans could hurt GM's business. Despite these negative factors, GM still looks promising. The company's Chinese sales have been soaring, up 8.5% in the past year alone, and with the continuous growth of China's middle class, this trend could continue for years to come. GM has also dramatically improved its efficiency in recent years, and newer models, such as the widely praised Malibu, have higher margins than the models they replace. Even if GM's earnings were cut in half, the stock's valuation would still be attractive. GM is wisely taking advantage of the cheap valuation and buying back as much of its own stock as it can, and you can do the same. As a final suggestion, perhaps my favorite Buffett stock to buy now is Berkshire Hathaway itself -- probably the Class B shares for most readers. I've written before about the reasons for owning Berkshire for the long term, including its diverse portfolio of fully owned subsidiaries as well as a rock-solid stock portfolio, but there's an extra reason to consider Berkshire now. I already discussed how Trump's pro-growth and anti-regulation policies could help American banks such as Bank of America, as well as other Buffett financial stocks such as Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, Goldman Sachs, and others. In addition, Berkshire's core business of insurance could benefit tremendously. Insurers don't aim to make their money through the premiums you pay; rather, their main source of profit is to invest the premiums they've collected but haven't paid out yet, and earn money from their investments. So as interest rates rise, so can profits on invested reserves. As I write, Berkshire has about $85 billion in cash on its balance sheet, so an increase of a percent or two over the next few years would translate to billions in additional profit. Finally, Trump's plans to lower regulation could translate into tremendous cost savings for Geico and other Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. ","
      
    3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in December -- The Motley Fool

When it comes to bank stocks (or any stocks for that matter) it's important to distinguish between price and value. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. If you're an investor with an interest in the bank industry, then there are certain stocks that should be on your radar. Ten that come immediately to mind are the eight global systemically important banks together with two of the largest regional banks, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF). But whether you can afford to buy any of these stocks depends in part on their share prices. With this in mind, here's a list of these 10 popular bank stocks ranked by share price. Bank Share Price Price-to-Tangible Book Value Goldman Sachs $241.41 1.34 Capital One Financial $90.15 1.29 JPMorgan Chase $86.75 1.77 State Street $78.84 2.72 Citigroup $60.69 0.94 Wells Fargo $55.71 2.00 US Bancorp $52.17 2.95 Bank of New York Mellon $47.56 3.35 Morgan Stanley $43.37 1.35 Bank of America $22.60 1.35 Data source: YCharts.com. There's a wide range of bank stocks \ both in terms of their respective share prices and their business models. The standalone investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) tops the list, with a share price of $241. That's more than double the runner-up, credit card specialist Capital One Financial, with its shares selling for $90 each. On the other end of the spectrum is the nation's second largest commercial bank, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which has the least expensive stock by far within its peer group. Its shares trade for less than $23 a unit, which is roughly half that of the next cheapest bank stock, investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), which trades for around $43 a share. It's important to point out that a stock's price should play a smaller role in an investor's decision about whether to invest in it than valuation should. That's why I included the third column, showing these banks' price-to-tangible-book-value ratios. This is really what dictates whether a particular bank's stock is cheap or expensive. It's by looking at this that you can see why Goldman Sachs' stock isn't as expensive as its share price would otherwise lead you to believe. Based on its valuation, in fact, Goldman Sachs is ranked fifth after Citigroup, Capital One, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley. On the other end of the spectrum are banks such as Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, and State Street, which trade near or above three times their respective tangible book values. Why are these three banks so expensive? In U.S. Bancorp's case, a regional lender based in Minneapolis, it's the most profitable big bank in the country, run by some of the best in the business. And in Bank of New York Mellon and State Street's cases, both of which operate custodial banks (here are the five different types of banks you can invest in), their unique business models insulate them from the same degree of risk that most other banks face. The point is, if you're looking to invest in a bank today, you need to look beyond its share price and consider not only its value, but also what it brings to the table in terms of its business model.

The future looks bright for Bank of America. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. When you buy a stock, you shouldn't focus on how much you think it'll be worth next week, next month, or even next year. What you should focus on instead, as I do below with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), is how much it'll likely be worth in a decade or two, after allowing the law of compounding growth to work its magic. Getting a sense for this is both easier and harder than it seems. It's easier because it doesn't take a mathematical genius to project performance and valuation metrics forward. But it's harder because doing so only yields a rough estimate at best. I nevertheless think it's worthwhile to go through this exercise. Seeing how quickly an investment can grow in value if left alone can only incentivize you to be a long-term investor. And that strategy is the best way for individual investors to gain an advantage over institutional investors. On top of this, projecting a particular investment's potential return into the future can help you choose between stocks. It also forces you to think about the levers that will impact a particular stock's performance. Again, this is a rough science, but it's better than nothing. With respect to Bank of America, it seems reasonable to me to expect that the North Carolina-based bank will average between an 8% and 9% compound annual growth rate over the next quarter century. This means that a roughly $2,300 investment today would grow to almost $18,000 25 years from now. Assumes a 15% return on tangible common equity, average price-to-tangible-book-value ratio of 1.5, and enrollment in a dividend reinvestment plan. Calculations by author. The first assumption I made in this projection is that Bank of America will average a 12% return on tangible common equity over the next 25 years. That's higher than Bank of America's profitability of 10.3% last quarter, but it seems reasonable when you consider the trajectory of Bank of America's earnings, the pent-up earnings power that will be realized once its debt ratings improve, and the fact that only a small increase in interest rates (the Fed Funds rate in particular) will alone put it over that mark. The most profitable banks, even in the inhospitable environment they're operating in right now, are able to generate returns on equity well in excess of 12%. Wells Fargo's in the latest quarter came out to 14%. U.S. Bancorp's exceeded 17%. The point being, a 12% return on tangible common equity is conservative. My second assumption is that Bank of America's stock over the next 25 years will trade at an average multiple of 1.5 times its tangible common shareholders' equity. Right now it trades for 1.3 times tangible common equity. In the future, it'll trade for 2.0 or more times the same figure. Embedded in my assumption, then, is that these ups and downs will average out to around 1.5 times tangible book value. Finally, I assume that Bank of America will allocate its earnings evenly between dividends, buybacks, and retained earnings. This is how banks generally strive to distribute their capital. Relatedly, I also assume that investors in its stock use a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, which automatically reinvests dividends into new shares of the underlying stock. In sum, while nearly anything can happen in the future -- a world war, a major economic depression, whatever -- these are reasonable assumptions that could just as easily underestimate Bank of America's potential as overestimate it. This is a central reason that Bank of America is my largest stock holding, as I think an 8% to 9% compound annual growth rate is a very respectable return. ","
      
    What Return Can Bank of America Stock Deliver Over the Long Term? -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate led by billionaire Warren Buffett, has done quite well in 2016 -- up about 26% with just over a week to go in the year. Much of the company's gain has taken place in the last six weeks or so, and since Buffett was an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, the reason is somewhat ironic: the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Image source: Disney/ABC via Flickr. There are a few reasons Berkshire Hathaway stock has risen by 16% since the election. For starters, Trump's pro-growth policies could be great news for many of Berkshire's subsidiary businesses. Manufacturers like Precision Castparts could see a rise in orders, railroads like BNSF could have more goods to transport, and consumer-goods companies like Fruit of the Loom could benefit from more disposable income in consumers' pockets. BRK.B data by YCharts. However, Berkshire's insurance subsidiaries could turn out to be big winners under a Trump presidency, for multiple reasons. First, Trump's anti-regulation platform could save money on compliance expenses and make it generally easier for insurers like GEICO and the rest of Berkshire's insurance companies to do business. In addition, consider the general business model of insurers. Insurance companies don't necessarily try to profit from collecting premiums. Instead, the goal is to invest the premium income collected and generate income until it's paid out for claims. Trump's policies could cause interest rates to rise significantly in the coming years, meaning that Berkshire could earn billions more on its reserves. As of the third quarter, the company has about $85 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, so this could translate to a serious boost. Finally, don't forget about Berkshire's stock portfolio, a lot of which is invested in the financial industry -- by far, the best-performing sector since the election. Like insurance companies, banks stand to benefit from lower regulation and higher interest rates, and Berkshire has huge investments in Wells Fargo, American Express, and Bank of America, as well as significant investments in several other companies in that sector. This is the billion-dollar question for Berkshire Hathaway and its investors. While I'm not predicting the direction of the overall stock market, I do think banks and insurance companies will have more room to run if Trump rolls back regulations on their industries, invests in infrastructure, and slashes taxes. The same logic can be applied to the rest of Berkshire's financial stocks as well as its insurance subsidiaries. If Trump follows through on his promises, Berkshire's rally could be just getting started. As an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, Warren Buffett is strongly in favor of higher taxes on the rich, among other left-leaning policies. However, from a purely business standpoint, it doesn't get much better for Berkshire's subsidiaries and stock investments than Donald Trump's pro-growth, anti-regulation platform. Whether Trump actually follows through with his plans, and whether they work, remains to be seen, but for now, it's fair to say that Berkshire Hathaway and its investors were big winners in 2016 as a result of the election.

    Berkshire Hathaway's Biggest Win in 2016 -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Make up your mind, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)! A little more than one week ago, healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson announced that it was no longer pursuing Swiss-based lung disease drug specialist Actelion (NASDAQOTH:ALIOF). Johnson & Johnson had initially approached Actelion in late November with an offer worth about $26 billion to acquire the maker of therapies to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a disease characterized by high blood pressure between the heart and lungs. After Actelion rejected the offer as being too low, J&J upped its offer to north of $27 billion, according to reports. Following a lack of progress, J&J abandoned its offer and walked away from the deal... until yesterday. Image source: Getty Images. The allure of Actelion throughout this entire process has been its PAH product portfolio, which covers every stage of PAH. Having such dominant market share in the PAH space means excellent pricing power for Actelion, which J&J would undoubtedly appreciate. On the other side of the coin, J&J is also dealing with the introduction of biosimilar competition to Remicade, its top-selling anti-inflammatory drug slated to bring in more than $6 billion in sales this year. Pfizer's and Celltrion's Inflecta, the biosimilar version of Remicade, is selling for a 15% discount to Remicade's list price, which is expected to chip away at Remicade's total sales in 2017 and beyond. Johnson & Johnson is looking for a quick way to add revenue and profits in the wake of an expected decline in Remicade sales beginning next year. Two up-and-coming PAH drugs, Opsumit and Uptravi, are both expected to generate $2 billion in peak annual sales, which is primarily what J&J would be acquiring in its bid for Actelion. However, this Fool's opinion is that J&J's sudden willingness to value Actelion at perhaps $32 billion is insane! Johnson & Johnson's CEO Alex Gorsky and his management team are generally very cautious in their approach to M&A. Despite bearing a AAA credit rating (it's one of only two publicly traded companies endowed with Standard & Poor's highest credit rating) and more than $40 billion in cash and cash equivalents, J&J has mostly shied away from larger acquisitions. With the exception of medical device company Synthes, most of J&J's purchases are easily digestible. Incorporating a $32 billion buyout could be asking for trouble in so many ways. Image source: Getty Images. One of the biggest issues with J&J's pursuit of Actelion is the imminent fate of Tracleer, a PAH drug that comprised 46% of Actelion's sales during the first-half of 2016. Originally approved in 2001, Tracleer's patent protection is essentially up. With generic competition expected to enter the marketplace in 2017, Tracleer's sales could dip by 50% or more within a year. In other words, even with healthy sales growth from Opsumit and Uptravi, Tracleer's sales decline could deliver an overall sales decline for Actelion's product portfolio in 2017. Another key point is that Actelion's product portfolio and pipeline have a lot of question marks beyond Opsumit and Uptravi. Aside from Tracleer's imminent exposure to generics, the company's pipeline leaves a lot to be desired at a $32 billion price tag. For instance, ponesimod, an experimental treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis that's currently being studied in the pivotal OPTIMUM trial, is likely to face fierce competition from market share leader Gilenya, developed by Novartis. Being good enough to simply match Gilenya's effectiveness may not be enough, and J&J would be heading into a deal with Actelion while flying blind as to the phase 3 results. Image source: Getty Images. But arguably the biggest problem with this deal is the valuation. If J&J ponied up $32 billion for Actelion, it would probably be paying in excess of six times peak annual sales, which is far and away higher than where most M&A deals in biotech and pharmaceuticals have gone down in recent years. Perhaps even more telling is what J&J would be paying relative to Actelion's EBITDA over the trailing 12-month period. Based on the $857.6 million in trailing 12-month EBITDA, J&J would be paying more than 37 times EBITDA and approximately 36 times next year's earnings. At $32 billion, I'm not convinced J&J would actually come out ahead on the deal, even with the boost to its EPS. The good news is that Johnson & Johnson is a great company to own regardless of whether or not it acquires Actelion. It's comprised of more than 250 subsidiaries, allowing it to divest and acquire without disrupting its core businesses, and it possesses three major operating groups, each with its own purpose. J&J's consumer health products are slow growing, but the pricing power and cash flow the segment provides are very predictable. Medical devices have also been slower growing of late, but there's a long-tail growth opportunity as the U.S. elderly population soars in the decades to come. And finally, pharmaceuticals provide the juicy margins and fast growth that we've become accustomed to with J&J. While not a J&J shareholder myself, if I were in the board's shoes I would strongly suggest J&J walk away from Actelion, or at least hold off on its pursuit until the generic effect on Tracleer, and the results of a handful of phase 3 trials, are known. My belief is J&J could get a much better deal on Actelion by this time next year. ","

Nearly all Americans share one goal: They want to be able to hang up their work coats after many years in the labor force and know that they're financially set for retirement. Unfortunately, this is a goal that's being reached by a depressingly low number of Americans. However, what's just as worrisome is how easily those who have saved enough for retirement can be derailed. There are seemingly just as many concerns entering/during retirement as there are during your working years. Here are five somewhat common ways your retirement can easily be ruined, as well as how to avoid becoming a victim of a bad financial decision. One of the biggest concerns during retirement is that you'll enter it with complacency. Though you may have hit your retirement number, inflation stops for no one. If you stop investing for the future, you could find your purchasing power greatly reduced over time. As you age, there's a good chance that the goods and services you need (e.g., rent, food, medical care) are going to get more expensive with each passing year. This means you'll need to invest with the goal of keeping pace with or topping the national rate of inflation each and every year if you hope to at least maintain your purchasing power. Image source: Getty Images. One of the more common mistakes that seniors make is to gravitate toward bank CDs and bonds because they're seen as safe. While these interest-bearing assets can and do generate near-guaranteed nominal returns, many could still be losing real money relative to the national inflation rate. The solution? Continue investing some of your nest egg in the stock market. While there's little denying that stocks are more volatile than bonds or bank CDs, the stock market also offers historically inflation-crushing returns of 7% per year, including dividend reinvestment. Investing in stocks with dividend income to boot could be the perfect formula to help grow your nest egg, or at least keep up with inflation, during retirement. Another mistake that could easily ruin your retirement is filing for Social Security benefits at the wrong time (in many cases too early). Image source: Getty Images. Your Social Security benefits increase by approximately 8% for each year that you hold off on claiming. If you wind up claiming benefits as soon as possible at age 62, you could end up taking a 25% to 30% haircut from what you would have received each month had you waited until your full retirement age. Similarly, waiting until age 70, the last age at which your benefits grow, could net you a 24% to 32% higher benefit than what you'd have received at your full retirement age. An easy way to wreck you retirement is to take Social Security benefits early if you don't have much saved up for your golden years. If you plan to rely on Social Security income in retirement, you should, in theory, try your best to maximize your Social Security payout. This means waiting until age 70, or at least your full retirement age, before filing for benefits. If you have little saved for retirement but are a healthy individual, working a few years longer can make a huge difference in your eventual Social Security payout and your long-term financial stability. According to a Wells Fargo/Gallup survey released in September 2014, 46% of Americans surveyed, including 36% of retirees and 50% of current workers (at the time), were worried that they would outlive their savings in retirement. This fear is once again a representation of the poor saving habits of Americans. Image source: Getty Images. However, it's pretty easy for seniors to outlive their savings if they don't have a working budget in place during retirement that allows them to understand their cash flow. Some seniors who are entering retirement are completely unprepared for the drop in income when shifting from job-based wages to alternative channels of income, such as an IRA, 401(k), or Social Security income. Often times, these alternative channels of income are lower than what you received during your working years. If you don't have a working budget in place, you could wind up spending more of your nest egg than expected and outlive your savings. The solution here is pretty simple: you need to have a retirement budget in place well before you retire. Having a well-crafted retirement budget in place should help you avoid dangerously overspending during your golden years, and formulating your budget years in advance can allow you to transition into your retirement budget slowly, instead of facing a substantial drop off in income between your last working month and your first month of retirement. Another potential retirement crippler is debt. Image source: Getty Images. According to the Federal Reserve's 2013 study, ""Insights into the Financial Experiences of Older Adults,"" 60% of adults in their 60s and 40% of adults in their 70s owed money on their mortgages. The report does note that this isn't necessarily a sign of financial stress as some people simply prefer to pay off their home in installment payments over 15 or 30 years. But the other side of the coin could imply that seniors are playing a dangerous game by carrying a significant amount of debt into retirement when their income could presumably be lower on a monthly basis compared to when they were working. Part of the solution to ensuring you aren't derailed by debt in retirement is to have a working budget in place to keep from overspending. The other half of the solution is to be a smart consumer during your working years. In other words, you should only be opening lines of credit in instances where it makes sense to do so. Avoiding department store credit cards, as an example, can go a long way to keeping your budget on track and ensuring you don't enter retirement with a backbreaking amount of seemingly unnecessary debt. A final way your retirement can be easily ruined is by lending a good chunk of your nest egg to a close friend or family member. Image source: Getty Images. It's only natural for us to want to help the people we love, be it by helping with a down payment on a home or perhaps providing tuition money for college. Unfortunately, doing so could wind up crippling your own retirement prospects in two ways. To begin with, a younger friend or family member has time on their side and can borrow money via a loan and pay it back. If you're nearing retirement, or are retired, you can't borrow against your nest egg. The other problem is that it can severely hamper your ability to compound your nest egg. When you hand over cash to a loved one, you not only lose the money you've handed over, but the ability of that money to grow over time. If investments in the stock market grow at about 7% annually, $10,000 handed over at age 50 that would have otherwise been invested over the long-term could have been worth nearly $57,000 by age 80 based on Bankrate's return on investment calculator. The solution is pretty straightforward: only hand out money to family and close friends if you've gone well above and beyond your retirement number. If you're still saving to reach your goal, you simply can't afford to put your family or friends above your own financial retirement goals. ","

Analysts determined that two of the changes would most impact consumer discretionary companies because a significant number of goods they sell are manufactured overseas: a corporate income tax rate reduction to 20% from 35%, and a modification to business income taxes that would make them “border-adjustable.” “Given that, on average, the majority of merchandise that our 28 companies under coverage sell domestically is directly sourced overseas, the potential to have the lion share of their cost base inflated (lack of ability to deduct cost from taxation could drive a 20% increase in merchandise cost of goods sold) would be extremely troubling across the board,” Wells Fargo wrote. At points during his presidential campaign, Trump said he supported a tariff of up to 45% on goods from China, up to 35% tariffs on auto imports from Mexico, and scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement. China is the U.S.’s largest trading partner, with about $483 billion in Chinese goods imported in 2015, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. Mexico is the third-largest trading partner with the U.S., with Mexican imports totaling $296 billion in 2015. “Given President-elect Donald Trump’s surprising victory and the Republican majority in both houses of Congress, we see the threat of U.S. protectionist trade policies against some of its largest trading partners as having broad economic and investment implications,” analysts wrote in a December report. Taking these factors into account, S&P Capital believes Delphi Automotive PLC

                                   has done even better, climbing 21.7% this year — and its post-election gains of 16.25% through Wednesday have outstripped those of the iShares Russell 2000. That’s in part a response to this asset class being oversold in 2015 and bottoming out. But it’s also because of big growth opportunities in small-caps that were taking shape before the Trump trade and now are looking even brighter after Election Day. Despite this, the small-cap resurgence isn't getting quite as much attention as the run for financials. And that means there could still be an opportunity to stake out a claim in individual picks or broad-based index funds without overpaying. The narrative that has fueled the broader stock market rally is, in fact, tailor-made for small-cap stocks. It goes something like this: Better credit availability: While lenders have been getting all the love, let’s remember that more favorable financial regulations can be good for borrowers, too. If capital restraints are loosened and allow for better credit availability, smaller companies that don’t have the deep pockets of blue chips will benefit as they find it easier to get cash to fuel their growth. Fiscal stimulus: While the details remain hazy, President-elect Donald Trump and many of his Republican partners in Congress are eager to inject a massive stimulus into the economy. For megacap stocks, $10 million in extra contracts may not matter… but when you’re a small-cap stock doing a only few hundred million in total revenue annually, that adds up in a big way. Return of “risk-on” trades: Rising rates are making longer-duration bonds less attractive, and that has forced a rotation of cash into stocks. And at the same time, the 10-year Treasury

                                    yield is finally back above 2.5% while the typical S&P 500 yield is only about 2.0% right now. That makes sleepy large-cap dividend payers much less attractive, and sets the stage for investors to favor more volatile but more “growthy” small caps in the new year. Enjoy the ride while it lasts: Of course, the euphoria may not last forever and eventually the old narrative of stagnant global growth could return. So if you want to strike while the iron is hot, take advantage of smaller companies that can ramp up faster and are much “simpler” companies — particularly those focused on domestic opportunities instead of juggling the complex operations of a multinational operation. The current rally will inevitably lose momentum, so take enjoy the ride while it lasts in smaller stocks best positioned to profit. It all adds up to a compelling reason to weight your portfolio toward small cap growth in 2017, either through individual names or with a broad-based play like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. You may be wondering why I consider small-caps an opportunity but see financials as overbought, considering they share many of the same growth narratives and roughly the same outperformance. However, it’s pretty difficult to ever consider a bank as a true “growth” stock even in an environment of short-term improvement in fundamentals thanks to macro conditions. And after the sentiment pop fades in financials, there’s not much staying power vs. a growth narrative in a small company that will last. And beyond that, the advantage of small caps lies not just in growth potential, but in valuation. Smaller U.S. stocks had largely been left for dead in 2015 thanks to a number of factors, including the crash in commodity prices that threatened a wave of junk-bond defaults in smaller miners and energy companies. At the same time, uncertainty around the presidential election at home and Brexit in Europe caused many investors to steer away from riskier small-caps for much of 2016. However, even before Election Day investors started to view the sector as oversold — and even now, after a big run, the forward P/E of the Russell 2000 is trading 20.1 times expected 2017 earnings compared with a forward P/E of 19.6 for the Nasdaq 100 and 19.0 for the S&P 500. That a very small premium to pay on faster-moving small-caps, which have much higher growth potential then blue chips. Fund flows show investors are clearly interested in the risk-on equities trade right now; According to Morningstar, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF

                                    topped all passive index funds with inflows of $7.5 million on the month, but in second place was the small-cap focused iShares Russell 2000 ETF with $6.2 million — just above the $6.1 million sucked up by the Financial Select SPDR that has been so popular in recent weeks. That in itself is a very bullish sign, since small-cap stocks are frequently momentum names that ride as much on sentiment as they do on any underlying growth metrics. In other words, take what the market gives you and join in this small-cap rally while it lasts. Not only is it equally powerful for investors as the rise in financial stocks, it will likely prove much more durable.
