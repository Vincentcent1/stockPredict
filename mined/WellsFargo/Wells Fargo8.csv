It's well known that General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is shifting back to its industrial roots with CEO Jeff Immelt planning to generate 90% of the company's earnings from its digital industrial businesses by 2018. As such, GE Capital assets have been sold off to banks like Wells Fargo & Co and Capital One Financial Corp., while the highly successful Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) spinoff also saw General Electric jettisoning financial businesses. With all of this going on, it's easy to forget that the company still has a capital arm, and it happens to be a key part of its future. Here's how and why. GE Capital industrial finance solutions are being expanded to also cover renewable energy. Image source: GE Reports. The financial crisis hit GE particularly hard, and few long-term investors will forget when Immelt cut the dividend to 10 cents a share from 31 cents a share in 2009 -- the first cut since 1938. The effects of the crisis still linger, and as shown below, bank stock valuations are nowhere near what they used to be prior to the crisis. WFC Price to Book Value data by YCharts. However, industrial company valuations are comparable to pre-recession levels. HON EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YCharts. In other words, the market has decided to take a different view on future prospects of the two industries -- not least because banks like Wells Fargo are more subject to regulation intended to reduce risk, and this is likely to make them less able to generate outsized returns. With that said, many industrial companies have financial arms that support their businesses, and GE is no different. In a presentation given at a recent JPMorgan conference, GE Capital CEO Richard Laxer claimed that 90% of GE's financial services business is now aligned with GE's industrial business, whereas ""a few years ago it was 50-50."" Here are the benefits of such a change: To demonstrate how this works, Laxer outlined the three areas where GE Capital is active today. In aviation finance, it's the world's leading aircraft-leasing company, with 85% of its fleet powered by GE or GE joint-venture (CFM) engines. Second, in energy finance, 90% of its investment activity is related to GE equipment. Third, industrial finance reduces friction at the point of sale and generates cash flow for GE. Aviation and energy are core industries for GE, and they both tend to involve significant investments by customers who are unlikely to recoup their investments in terms of cash flow in the near term. In this context, GE Capital's services are key to driving order growth. Meanwhile, industrial financing is being expanded from traditional strength in healthcare toward areas like transportation, additives, oil and gas, and renewables. This industrial pivot isn't just about GE's industrial businesses. It also marks a change of emphasis at GE Capital. In a nutshell, the capital arm is now overwhelmingly focused on helping GE's industrial businesses generate growth and productivity. Moreover, as the company expands into emerging markets, it's going to be increasingly important to create financing solutions for potential customers in areas like energy and transportation. All told, GE Capital is still an integral part of GE's future and another good example of how the company is leveraging scale to give itself an edge over the competition. ","

It's that time of year when publicly traded companies file their proxy reports, which disclose how much they paid their top executives the previous year. Now that all four of the nation's megabanks have done so, we can compare the compensation of the heads of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Three out of these four CEOs got raises last year. Bank of America's Brian Moynihan got the biggest raise, at 25%. All told, the 57-year-old executive earned $20 million last year. That ranks the Bank of America CEO second when it comes to total 2016 compensation. Data source: Regulatory filings. Chart by author. Wells Fargo's newly appointed CEO, Tim Sloan, also earned more money last year than he did in 2015, seeing a 16% increase. However, that wasn't because the bank's performance improved. In fact, just the opposite occurred, as the California-based bank has spent much of the past seven months digging itself out of its massive fake-account scandal that was revealed last September. The reason Sloan got a raise, in turn, is that he was recently promoted to CEO, after his predecessor, John Stumpf, resigned in the wake of the fake-account scandal. Previously, Sloan was Wells Fargo's chief operating officer. JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon was the final big bank executive to get a raise last year. His compensation increased 4% to $28 million. This makes Dimon far and away the highest paid big bank CEO (justifiably so, if you ask me). JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. The one CEO to see his compensation fall in 2016 was Citigroup's Michael Corbat. His earnings dropped by 6% compared to 2015, resulting in a $15.5 million haul. Citigroup's board was clear in its proxy statement that it isn't because they were necessarily displeased with Corbat's performance: In making the decision on CEO pay, the Compensation Committee considered several factors, including another positive outcome from the 2016 CCAR process which led to the most meaningful capital return since before the financial crisis, objective feedback from regulators on Citi's resolution plan, and the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings. However, the Compensation Committee believed that it was appropriate to reflect the firm's performance relative to its financial targets in the compensation for Mr. Corbat. Overall, the Board continues to be very pleased with the progress Citi is making under Mr. Corbat's leadership and is confident that the plan Citi's senior management is executing will improve returns for stockholders. It's hard to feel sorry for a guy that earned $15.5 million, but it's a good sign that Citigroup's board is making at least a token effort, which is far less common than one might think in the cushy world of publicly traded companies, of tying executive compensation to the bank's financial targets. In short, while the amount that any particular bank executive makes in any given year doesn't tend to factor heavily into most investors' decision to buy or sell the underlying bank's stock, it's still good information for investors to be aware of.

John Ballard,03232017,Fool,03162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. CEO Warren Buffett recently disclosed that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) owned 133 million shares, or about $18.5 billion, worth of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Apple joins other sizable holdings -- Wells Fargo & Co and The Coca-Cola Co -- as one of Berkshire Hathaway's top equity investments. Throughout his career, Warren Buffett has made successful investments in several different industries, but some of his most famous and rewarding investments have been in consumer product companies. His 1988 investment in Coca-Cola is probably Buffett's most famous investment. Similar to Apple, Coca-Cola had a product with universal appeal and was demonstrating growing revenue and profits at the time when Warren Buffett invested 25% of Berkshire Hathaway's book value in Coke shares. Apple's Opera retail store in Paris. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE INC. Although the Apple investment is notable because of Buffett's historical tendency to shun tech stocks, it actually fits the qualities the Omaha-based investor has looked for in other investments. If you use an iPhone, iPad, and/or a Mac computer, you probably have some experience with the stickiness of Apple's products and services. It's not likely that someone who has taken lots of photos of treasured moments and purchased lots of content from iTunes is suddenly going to abandon Apple for a Samsung Electronics Co or a Microsoft product. Millions of customers have a strong attachment with Apple's devices, and this is what attracted Warren Buffett's attention: Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and enormously useful product that people would use ... The continuity of the product is huge, and the degree to which their lives center around it is huge. And it's a pretty nice ... franchise to have with a consumer product. Apple creates beautifully designed products and has successfully tied it all together with Apple's iCloud storage service, which automatically keeps all of your content synced between devices. The unique, spartan-esque product design and sticky services have led Apple to become one of the most iconic brands in the world. Apple consistently earns high customer satisfaction ratings, which continues to help sell tens of millions of iPhones every quarter. This success has been a good marketing tool for other product lines like Mac computers, which continues to show strength while the PC industry is in decline. These qualities have led to impressive growth in Apple's business over the last 10 years: Amounts in billions. DATA SOURCE: Apple Inc. annual reports. While Samsung controls the No. 1 spot in smartphone market share in terms of unit sales, Apple generated every dollar of profit in the industry in 2016, according to one analyst. Apple achieves this by commanding a premium price to competing products, reinforcing the brand's strength in the marketplace. Let's not kid ourselves: Warren Buffett is one of the world's greatest investors. You could do a lot worse than just sit back and buy every stock Berkshire Hathaway owns, and never sell. But keep in mind that Warren Buffett's investments don't always perform well right off the bat. In 2011, he disclosed on CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway's $10.7 billion investment in International Business Machines, which has dramatically underperformed the market ever since. SPY data by YCharts. Nonetheless, the strong financial position of the company and a great brand should deliver decent returns for shareholders in the future, but don't expect to earn anything close to the stock's nearly 1,000% rise in the last 10 years. SPY data by YCharts. The stock trades for a very reasonable 16 times earnings, and analysts expect the company to grow about 9% annually over the next five years. Apple also offers an annual dividend yield of 1.6%, and management has been using cash flow to buy back shares, helping earnings per share grow 16% annually over the last five years compared to 14.8% annual growth in revenue. Plenty more dividends and share buybacks will come since the business generates over $60 billion in annual cash flow and currently has a whopping $246 billion in cash assets on the balance sheet and only $73.5 billion in debt. My takeaway from Warren Buffett's investment in Apple is the advantage individual investors have over the big financial institutions in managing their own money. Anyone who has been an Apple customer in the last 10 years would have figured out long ago the same qualities one legendary investor observed only recently. ","

Leo Sun,03232017,Fool,03162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) is generally considered a slow growth income stock. Yet shares of the tobacco giant have rallied 25% since the beginning of the year to a historic high and crushed the S&P 500's 6% gain. That big rally likely caused many investors to wonder if PMI is becoming overvalued relative to the market and its industry peers. Let's take a closer look at PMI's fundamentals, growth estimates, and potential catalysts to decide. Philip Morris and Altria's iconic Marlboro brand. Image source: Pixabay. A simple way to see if an income stock is overvalued is to check its P/E ratio and dividend yield. PMI currently trades at 25 times earnings, which is higher than the industry average of 21 for cigarette makers. Altria (NYSE:MO), which spun off its international business as PMI in 2008, trades at just 10 times earnings -- but that multiple was notably distorted by a big windfall from the sale of its stake in SABMiller to AB InBev last year. PMI pays a trailing dividend yield of 3.6%, which is higher than the S&P 500's average yield of 2% and Altria's 3.2% yield. But if we look at P/E ratio and dividend yield over the past five years, we'll notice that the former is at a historic high and the latter is at a multi-year low. This means that investors who buy PMI today are paying a premium for the stock while getting a much lower dividend yield than investors in previous years. Source: YCharts PMI's adjusted earnings grew 1.4% in 2016, compared to a 12% decline in 2015. Analysts expect its earnings to rise another 8% this year and 11% next year. Like most tobacco companies, PMI offsets slower cigarette shipments with higher prices, job cuts, and investments in adjacent markets like e-cigarettes and other alternative tobacco products. But unlike Altria, which relies heavily on buybacks to boost its earnings, PMI has stopped buying back stock in recent quarters due to the impact of the strong dollar. If that headwind fades, PMI will likely start buying back shares again. PMI's top and bottom line recovery is encouraging, but the stock is also likely being lifted by low interest rates, making blue chip dividend stocks look better than bonds. However, that trend could reverse as the Fed gradually raises rates. Higher interest rates could also cause the U.S. dollar to strengthen -- which would be bad news for PMI. The other potential catalyst for PMI is inorganic growth. Several analysts have speculated that PMI could buy Altria to recombine the two halves of the Philip Morris empire. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog suggests that megamerger would counter the tougher competition brought on by British American Tobacco's recent decision to buy Reynolds American. Herzog also believes that purchase would mutually boost both companies' positions in non-cigarette products (with Altria's MarkTen e-cigs and PMI's iQOS ""heated"" tobacco sticks) while offsetting PMI's currency headwinds. But even if PMI decided to buy Altria, it could lift the latter's stock more than the former. I've bought and sold PMI in the past at lower prices, but I don't think investors should chase the stock's recent rally. Its multiple is too high, its yield is too low, and there are too many uncertainties regarding currency fluctuations, competition, and potential megamergers on the horizon. Investors who are looking for better income plays should consider cheaper stocks in other industries instead. ","

Ciena (NYSE:CIEN) may be a stock for growth-oriented investors to keep an eye on. The company makes optical networking equipment, along with software and services that help transmit vast amounts of voice, data, and video across networks. Ciena shares had run up from a low of $15.62 last summer to $26.17, but pulled back after the company's most recent earnings report on March 8. In that report (for the first fiscal quarter in 2017), revenues were up 8.4% year over year (but down sequentially) to $621 million, and earnings per share were $0.26, missing analysts' estimates by $0.03. Shares sold off initially, but two analysts -- Wells Fargo's Jess Lubert and Dougherty & Company's Catharine Trebnick -- immediately reiterated outperform ratings after the somewhat disappointing report. Moreover, management pointed the way toward continued growth across its portfolio. Let's dive in to some highlights. Image source: Ciena. Ciena prides itself on having invested early in an open platform with a diverse portfolio -- allowing its networking, data center, and web customers to pick from a variety of products, and add, alter, or drop network elements as necessary, and in a seamless fashion. In the company's 2016 annual report, CEO Gary Smith wrote: Five years ago, we introduced our OPn Architecture, a focused approach to next-generation networks through scalability, programmability and network level applications. Today, OPn has evolved and expanded into our governing philosophy and broader belief system, which is rooted in enabling choice in the market through openness. This bet appears to be paying off, as the company says it now has a leading position in many applications, such as data center interconnect, and multivendor network orchestration, which requires openness and flexibility. Basically, instead of locking its customers into a particular hardware regime, Ciena has invested in a diverse suite of technologies, and opened its technologies up to developers with its Emulation Cloud and DevOps Toolkit. The results seem to be excellent -- at least relative to the industry. Ciena cited recognition as an industry leader in several segments in its annual report. On the latest conference call, the company reiterated that it was growing faster than the market, and should continue to do so. The market, it forecast, is growing in the mid-single digits, so expect high-single-digit growth for Ciena. This appears to be true, especially when you compare Ciena's results to those of competitor Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN). Infinera had a terrible year, and its most recent quarter showed year-over-year growth of negative 30%, a stark contrast from Ciena's 8.4% gain. Ciena has been using its recent strength to take care of its balance sheet. The company reduced its convertible debt by $46 million in the quarter and its term loan by $93 million, though it still has a ways to go as it has $1.25 billion in debt and convertible notes. The company is not necessarily in any danger here -- cash and short-term and long-term investments topped $1 billion, so Ciena should have plenty of cash to pay off the $185 million that comes due in June 2017. Still, the company's ratio of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) to interest expense in 2016 was only roughly 3, so interest expense is taking up a good chunk of potential earnings. Telecom equipment is not the most stable business, so debt reduction could go a long way in de-risking the company. The company grew its Asia-Pacific revenues nearly 60% year over year in the most recent quarter, despite not being in China. Its main growth driver in the Asia-Pacific region is India. As Smith explained on the call, there is a very large build for 4G capability going on in India right now, and Ciena is reaping the gains of seeds it's been sowing in the region for years (transcript via Seeking Alpha): ... this is an investment that we've made dating back 12 years, both in terms of software development teams and market development teams there. It is our fastest-growing country, and we are basically with every single major carrier in India and we are very well positioned for it. So I think it's a multiyear opportunity; it's not just one quick buildout that's getting all the attention, it's across the very broad base of technologies for Ciena. And really it's a market that I think will be very, very high growth for us over multiple years. The Asia Pacific region accounted for about 14% of revenue in the most recent quarter. While Ciena has performed very well in a cyclical, competitive market, it is about to lose a key executive. Francois Locoh-Donou has been with Ciena for almost 20 years, and is currently the company's chief operating officer. However, this year he will take over the reins as CEO of F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV). Smith assured investors on the call that a succession plan was underway and the company has a very deep bench. Nevertheless, someone with the skills to be a CEO will surely be missed, so investors must watch how the company executes going forward. It appears as though Ciena is performing strongly in the market for optical networking gear. Nevertheless, it is losing its COO, and remains subject to the investment cycles of large telcos. AT&T and Verizon make up more than 27% of the company's revenue, so any further slowdown with those clients could be reason for caution. The company currently trades at 39 times earnings, though only 11 times forward estimates, so continued strong growth and increasing margins are built into the current price. Still, those who believe in a renewed cycle for optical networking spend may wish to give Ciena a look. ","

Count Wells Fargo among the cautiously optimistic; it rates Tiffany shares at market perform, but now with a valuation range of $93 to $95, up from $78 to $80. “It is clear that Tiffany wants to reestablish its relevance to project a much more distinctive image,” wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, in a Friday note. He believes the Lady Gaga ad during the Super Bowl was “a good start.” But “it needs to be accompanied by a step-change in products, store environments and the general approach to selling,” said Saunders. “There is a need for a more fundamental and deeper shift in the brand’s direction. Tiffany is a brand that is increasingly overlooked by American consumers, especially younger demographics.” One reason that Tiffany needs to expand its positioning with consumers, and why it’s leaning younger to achieve that, is because since the 2008-2009 recession jewelry’s share of holiday purchases is shrinking. “Jewelry is no longer at the top of the Christmas list,” Saunders said. Tiffany’s executives addressed the question of “newness” on the earnings call. Mark Aaron, vice president of investor relations, said the number of silver jewelry items priced below $500 increased more than 10% in 2016, according to a FactSet transcript. Going forward, there will be new merchandise across all categories, including higher-priced diamond and platinum jewelry, he said.

Though “while the momentum appears to have carried into the fourth quarter (comped +12%), now that the series has ended, Tiffany’s Japan business could ‘normalize’ to the run-rate of other luxury peers,” analysts wrote. Lady Gaga could provide another pop-culture bump, the company and optimistic analysts believe. Price targets for Tiffany’s were raised at Instinet, up to $102 from $98, and Cowen & Company, up to $107 from $91, although with Cowen also focused on online-sales upgrades at the 180-year-old jeweler. “New executive and creative management are catalysts for change, margin enhancement and digital restructuring,” Cowen analysts wrote in a Monday note. “Ahead, we envision strides to better integrate Tiffany’s stores with online, as well as likely alter the store experience in a revised format, which should drive physical store traffic and ideally more comp consistency.” Tiffany shares closed up 1.5% Monday, and are up 30% for the past 12 months.

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"The bank said on Tuesday it expects the settlement to resolve claims in 11 other pending class actions, and will cover claims between Jan. 1, 2009, through the date the agreement is executed. The settlement agreement is yet to be approved by the court. After attorneys’ fees and costs of administration, claimants will be reimbursed for any wrong fees, Wells Fargo said on Tuesday. The remaining amount will be distributed to the claimants, based on the number and kinds of unauthorized accounts or services claimed, the bank said. The lawsuit resolves claims that Wells Fargo’s high-pressure culture drove branch workers needing to meet sales quotas to open unauthorized accounts, including with forged signatures. Customers said this saddled them with accounts they did not need or want, and fees they knew nothing about. The lawsuit dates from May 2015, sixteen months before Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million in penalties to settle regulatory charges over the sham accounts, estimated to number as many as 2 million. That settlement with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer prompted national outrage, leading to the departure in October of the bank’s longtime chief executive, John Stumpf. The named plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Shahriar Jabbari, a Californian, and Kaylee Heffelfinger, from Arizona. They believed they each had two accounts at Wells Fargo, but said the bank opened a respective nine and seven accounts for them, according to court papers. Wells Fargo, which has abandoned sales quotas, had already set aside enough money to cover the $110 million settlement. Its new chief executive, Tim Sloan, in January told analysts that the bank still has “a lot of work to do” to rebuild trust with customers, employees and other stakeholders. “This agreement is another step in our journey to make things right with customers and rebuild trust,” Sloan said in a statement on Tuesday. The case is Jabbari et al v. Wells Fargo & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 15-02159. ","

Failla’s 80-page decision covers five lawsuits, which comprise one of the largest remaining pieces of U.S. litigation seeking to hold banks liable for risky mortgage securities that were a major cause of the 2008 global financial crisis. Much of this litigation targeted lenders, but some targeted trustees that oversaw the securities’ performance. Investors accused Wells Fargo of having taken “virtually no action” to require lenders to buy back or fix defaulted or poorly underwritten loans that backed their securities, despite knowing of shortfalls. They said the San Francisco-based bank’s resistance stemmed from concern that acting would have exposed its own “misconduct” in other residential mortgage-backed securities trusts, and jeopardized its business dealings with lenders and servicers, court papers show. Failla said the plaintiffs “more than met” the legal standard for letting the breach of contract claims proceed, having pointed to internal Wells Fargo documents to suggest the bank knew about many loan defects but did nothing. “It is plaintiffs’ contention that such allegations go far beyond many other RMBS trustee complaints, which themselves have been found sufficient to state a claim,” Failla wrote, without ruling on the merits. “The court agrees.” Failla also said the National Credit Union Administration may pursue various claims against Wells Fargo on behalf of five failed credit unions. The NCUA has already recouped roughly $4.3 billion in litigation against many banks over securities that the credit unions bought. A spokesman could not be reached for comment.

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A wealthy Turkish gold trader’s decision to hire former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey to represent him, as he defends against charges he conspired to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran, raises a potential conflict of interest, prosecutors said. At least eight big banks allegedly victimized by the trader, Reza Zarrab, are current or former clients of Giuliani and Mukasey’s law firms, acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said in a letter dated Monday to the federal judge hearing the case. The banks’ relationships with the law firms require a special hearing, known as a “Curcio” hearing, to make sure Zarrab understands the potential conflict, Kim said. Giuliani is a lawyer for Greenberg Traurig, while Mukasey, who is also a former federal judge, is a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton. Neither firm had an immediate comment. The eight banks are Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Standard Chartered Plc, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co. “Through various deceptive acts, including layering the transactions and omitting information concerning the Iranian nexus, Zarrab and his co-conspirators allegedly tricked numerous U.S. financial institutions into processing barred transactions, thus exposing them to significant potential loss,” Kim said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, explaining the potential conflict of interest. Prosecutors accused the Iranian-born Zarrab and two others of engaging in hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions for Iran’s government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015, in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions. A trial is scheduled for Aug. 21. Zarrab has been in federal custody since his March 21, 2016, arrest in Miami, while en route to Disney World with his wife and daughter. Holding a Curcio hearing now could eliminate one ground for appeal if the case goes against Zarrab. The case has been closely watched in Turkey, where Zarrab was arrested in 2013 in a corruption probe into individuals with close ties to Tayyip Erdogan, then Turkey’s prime minister and now its president. Zarrab is a dual national of Iran and Turkey. Another lawyer for Zarrab, Benjamin Brafman, said in a letter on Monday that Giuliani and Mukasey’s roles “will not require any appearance in court and, accordingly, a hearing is not required.” The case is U.S. v.

Industry-wide sales in North America have grown 39.2 percent to $26.05 billion in the last five years, according to Euromonitor. However, sales in the category are expected to grow at 5.2 percent in 2017, slower than the average 6.9 percent rate at which the category had grown in the last five years. The latest quarterly results have also indicated a slowdown from the marquee manufacturers. “There is no more the growth that was there before and there are way more competitors for the brand (Lululemon) compared to when they’d started 10 years ago,” Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of consulting firm J. Rogers Kniffen WWE, said. A hash of celebrity brand launches, including Beyonce’s Ivy Park line in April last year, has also competed for sales at the traditional retailers. “We continue to believe trend shifts away from athleisure to denim will present stiffening headwinds to LULU,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon said. The stock market is giving the industry little room for error. Nike’s shares fell as much as 7.3 percent after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue last month, while Under Armour’s shares fell 28 percent in January after it forecast 2017 sales well below analysts’ estimates. “Over the past 12-24 months, other athletic wear bellwethers such as NKE and UA have seen meaningful multiple contraction once sales started slowing and margins stopped expanding,” said Ike Boruchow, analyst with Wells Fargo, in a research note. The market on Thursday showed little patience for Lululemon’s disappointing results, too. The company’s shares closed down 23.4 percent at $50.76. ","

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Executives at Toronto-Dominion Bank will on Thursday face shareholders for the first time since media reports suggested branch staff were pressured to meet sales targets, causing its shares to tumble. Chief Executive Bharat Masrani is expected to be grilled by investors about how Canada’s second-biggest lender is responding to the reports and whether the bank plans to scrap or re-shape sales incentives for branch staff, industry sources said. TD’s shares are currently trading around 6 percent below the level they were at before a March 10 report by CBC News, Canada’s public broadcaster, that cited branch staff as saying they moved customers to higher fee accounts and raised their overdraft and credit card limits without their knowledge. CBC News later reported that staff at Canada’s other big banks had admitted to similar behavior. TD and the other banks have defended their practices. But Canada’s financial watchdog has said it will start a review of their business practices in April. “There is tremendous pressure on all bank employees to sell bank products and there has been for quite a period of time. Their evaluation is done on the basis of moving product,” said Tom Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Securities, which holds shares in all of Canada’s major banks. Banks in Britain have stopped sales incentives for branch staff after a number of selling scandals and U.S. bank Wells Fargo & Co ended the practice earlier this year. Some analysts have said similar moves in Canada could ultimately hurt banks’ profits. The issue has exposed Canadian banks to an unusually high degree of public and media scrutiny in recent weeks. The banks came through the 2007-09 financial crisis without any failures and have, until now, managed to avoid the types of sales scandals that affected lenders in the United States and Europe. They have also remained popular with both retail and institutional investors, largely because of the high dividend yields they offer. “Canadians have a love-hate relationship with their banks,” said Norman Levine, managing director of Portfolio Management Corp. “They hate doing business with them but they love owning their shares and I don’t see anything out there that is going to change that.” TD’s annual meeting will be followed next week by Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal on Tuesday and Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on Thursday.

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Scrutiny of Canada’s financial oversight sparked by reports of improper sales practices at the nation’s top banks shows its watchdogs lack the muscle and the bite to tackle consumer abuses as aggressively as their U.S. and European peers. Canada’s banking system avoided failures in the 2007-09 financial crisis and the World Economic Forum consistently ranks it as being among the world’s soundest, crediting strong regulations and oversight for the top billing. But reports by CBC News, Canada’s public broadcaster, that staff at the country’s biggest five banks had moved customers to higher fee accounts and raised overdraft and credit card limits without their knowledge made lawmakers and campaign groups question if lenders were properly supervised. “If they’re doing it with customer service, where else might they be doing it?” said Robert-Falcon Ouellette, a Liberal MP and a member of Canada’s House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance. A review of budgets, staffing and legal powers at the disposal of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC), the primary financial consumer watchdog, shows the regulator lacking the firepower of its U.S. and British peers. The FCAC has a budget of C$18 million ($13.5 million) for the 2016/17 financial year and employs 89 staff. In contrast, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions that oversees the safety of the entire banking system employs 700 with an annual budget of C$144 million. By comparison, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority had an annual budget of 519 million pounds ($645 million) and 3,337 staff at the end of its last fiscal year. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had a budget of $606 million last year and 1,623 employees. The FCAC’s fines are also capped at C$500,000 per violation and since its formation in 2001, the FCAC has issued fines totaling just C$1.7 million. In contrast, Britain’s FCA has dished out over $3 billion pounds since its creation in 2013 while the CFPB has handed out fines worth over $5 billion since its creation in 2011. One consequence of the tight budget is that the FCAC has not carried out a “mystery shopper” exercise since 2005. “They demand a lot of resources and are not always necessary,” FCAC’s Deputy Commissioner Brigitte Goulard told Reuters in an interview. “There are better ways to make sure the banks actually comply with the legislation,” she added. “The banks are required to self-reveal, self-assess their own compliance with legislation and I think it’s worked fairly well.” Consumer advocate Duff Conacher said, however, that the Canadian regulator’s failure to detect questionable business practices reported by the public broadcaster could be down to the lack of “mystery shopper” checks where inspectors pose as regular customers. In Britain, regulators used the technique in 2008 to investigate banks’ mis-selling of loan insurance in the nation’s most costly corporate scandal. Conacher also criticized the FCAC for effectively tipping off banks when it said earlier this month it would review business practices in the federally regulated financial sector in April. “It’s just another example, unfortunately, of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada’s negligent lack of enforcement and weak enforcement record,” he said in an interview. Conacher is a co-founder of Democracy Watch, a lobby group which has gathered 50,000 signatures under a petition calling for more effective regulation of Canada’s biggest banks. All five have confirmed that they continue to offer sales incentives for staff and defended the practice that some of their British and U.S. peers have scrapped or modified under pressure from regulators. “What we’ve created is an incentive system where people might feel pressure to engage in unethical behavior which might actually jeopardize the long-term future of the banking market,” Ouellette said. Since Canadian banks have avoided scandals or failures that have plagued banks their European and U.S. peers, they have avoided similar intense regulatory scrutiny, raising the question if any improper practices might have gone undetected, banking analysts say. FCAC’s Goulard said existing statistics did not suggest that. “In the past two years we’ve had over 6,000 complaints and about 200 of those have to deal with not obtaining the consent of the consumer,” she said. In some cases consumers have given their consent but have forgotten about it, she added. Canada’s Liberal government is currently reviewing the regulation of the financial services industry and, last August, launched a consultation on the issue. Conservative MP Dan Albas, who also sits on the parliamentary finance committee, said the reports of mis-selling made the review particularly critical. “If there seem to be systematic issues where there are gaps that consumers are falling through or banks aren’t meeting their obligations then that’s something the government needs to take very seriously.” ","

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"The Wall Street bank this year faced shareholder proposals on topics ranging from its corporate structure to its financial ties to a controversial oil pipeline, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The issues would have been up for a vote at Goldman’s annual meeting in April. But in at least two cases, shareholders withdrew proposals after Goldman made concessions; in another three, the SEC sided with the bank’s view that the proposals were not worth including. A Goldman spokeswoman and SEC spokesman both declined to comment. The last time the bank had a proxy free of shareholder proposals was in 2006, which covered the prior year, said proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. While Goldman may still face questions about its executive pay, it stands out among big U.S. banks that have so far filed proxies, all of which are facing battles at their upcoming annual meetings. “It’s unusual for a large company, particularly large financial institutions that attract public attention, to have no shareholders proposals on their proxy,” said Yaron Nili, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who focuses on corporate governance. For many years, management teams of big banks dismissed activist shareholders as nuisances and their issues as irrelevant. But after the 2008 financial crisis, their annual meetings and investor gatherings became circus-like events: Protesters shouted down executives over bailouts, decried societal failures and, in one case, a topless female began chanting on stage in front of a conference room. In 2010, Goldman faced seven proposals - its biggest number ever - addressing topics like climate change and executive compensation, according to ISS. Goldman management began making a greater effort to engage with small investors, looking to restore the bank’s reputation after critics cast it as the greediest on Wall Street. “As the financial crisis gets further in the mirror, Goldman Sachs seems to be less in the spotlight,” said Patrick McGurn, special counsel for ISS. Last year the bank held 150 meetings focused on corporate governance with 77 shareholders in total, according to its proxy. In interviews, some investor activists said Goldman deserves credit. “Their willingness to engage is meaningful,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a California nonprofit that withdrew a resolution it had filed calling for Goldman to report on its financial involvement in a contentious Dakota pipeline project. In return, Goldman agreed to review policies on human rights and other issues. In other cases, Goldman won permission from regulators to leave measures off its proxy like a union-backed proposal that would have barred certain equity awards for executives leaving to enter government service. The toughest job for Goldman this year may be to win shareholder backing for its executive pay, which won support from just 66 percent of votes cast last year. Support for executive pay among Russell 3000 companies averaged 91 percent last year, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy.        After meeting with shareholders, Goldman made changes such as cutting a long-term award for Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein amid concerns it was too complex. The board awarded Blankfein, who is also chairman, $20.2 million for his work last year. ","

(See also: PVH Corp. Soars on Q4 Beat.) In the most recent fourth quarter, PVH Corp.’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.23 on revenue of $2.11 billion, representing flat revenue growth over last year, beat the forecast non-GAAP EPS of $1.21 on sales of $2.09 billion. Guidance also surpassed analysts’ estimates, with management expecting current-quarter EPS of $1.59 and full-year EPS of $7.35 at the midpoint. In response to the stellar fourth-quarter results, Wells Fargo analysts assure investors that PVH shouldn’t be looked at as “just another apparel maker selling clothes to U.S. department stores.” “What many folks on the sidelines are missing is that PVH’s international business: 1) is now larger than its domestic business (51% vs. 49%), 2) is growing 4x as fast as domestic (12% vs 3% LY) and 3) carries higher margins than domestic.” The team of analysts led by Ike Boruchow said PVH was able to do what few others could this earnings season in “talking to a bullish outlook for their business,” guiding FY EPS above the Street’s estimates: “The PVH story should continue to work and we’d expect a meaningful re-rating of shares accordingly (shares trading at just 13x).” Wells Fargo echoes PVH Corp.

Mark Kolakowski,03302017,Investopedia,03232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs While investors eagerly anticipate a boost to corporate earnings from the tax rate reductions advocated by President Trump and Republicans in Congress, low-income families in search of affordable housing units charging below-market rents have something to worry about, the Wall Street Journal reports. The reason is that development of these units is heavily subsidized through federal tax credits that would decline significantly in value if corporate tax rates were slashed. About 400,000 apartment units are built each year in the U.S., of which 25% are so-called affordable units, according to data from the National Multifamily Housing Council cited by the Journal. Under a tax credit program signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, developers are offered a federal tax credit if they reserve a portion of units for families earning less than the local median income and submit to rent controls. In practice, nearly all units constructed under the program go to low-income tenants. The concept of the program was to replace public housing units with private development.  With average rents rising by 26% since 2010, much faster than incomes, the need for affordable housing is growing. By 2014, a record 11.4 million households were burdened with rents costing 50% or more of their incomes, according to a Harvard University study cited by the Journal. This was an increase of 2.1 million since 2008. In the same period, the number of households paying more than 30% of their incomes on rent leapt by 3.6 million. Under the Low-income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, about $8 billion worth of tax credits annually are allocated on a per capita basis to state and local agencies, for distribution to participating developers, according the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). However, for reasons such as insufficient taxable income of their own, most developers find it more advantageous to find tax credit investors who will provide the funding for their projects, as described by accounting firm Novogradac & Company LLP. Complex paperwork is required of all parties to these transactions, but the upshot is that investors get tax credits that they can use in annual allotments, usually spread over ten years. In addition to tax credits for the amount of funding that they have supplied, investors also can claim other tax benefits by deducting project-related expenses such as depreciation and interest charges, the Journal says. To investors, the value of the tax credit essentially is equal to the value of their funds invested in an approved LIHTC project times their marginal federal tax rate. If the top federal corporate tax rate is cut, the value of new LIHTC tax credits will fall corresponding. Anticipating this, developers and investors have been valuing the credits at 10% to 20% less than before the election, based on Trump campaign promises to reduce the top corporate rate from 35% to as little as 15%. Equity investment in affordable housing will decline by about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2017, per a forecast from Novogradac cited by the Journal. Investors already are backing away from projects, as their anticipated returns decline. Bipartisan support is building in Congress to expand the LIHTC. In the Senate, Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) are co-sponsoring a bill to expand it by 50%, which may offset the loss in value, according to the Journal. Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) is among the largest investors in affordable housing, having bought $2.23 billion of LIHTC credits in 2016, per the Journal, which adds that executives of that expect to invest less in 2017. Even smaller banks can be big players in this market. As of the end of 2014, Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp (USB) reported having more than $6.3 billion of equity committed to projects covered by the LIHTC program, per its website. The Merrill Lynch division of Bank of America Corp. (BAC) is cited as a major LIHTC investor by Affordable Housing Finance, but with no figures given. The same publication was told by Susan Moro, a senior vice president at that firm, that the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) gives banks continued motivations to invest in LIHTCs.

Jeff Cox,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Wells Fargo has been trying to put its fake accounts scandal behind it since the matter was brought to light last year. Setting aside $110 million to help aggrieved customers is a good place to start, according to two industry analysts. Earlier this week, the bank announced the agreement to end a class-action suit over some 2 million accounts that were opened without customers' permission. Wells Fargo already has paid $185 million in fines as part of an agreement with multiple government agencies. The scandal is ""looking smaller in the rearview,"" analysts Brian Kleinhanzl and Michael Brown at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note. ""Wells Fargo has resolved another overhang related to the cross-sell scandal and the long-tail of potential negative outcomes is growing shorter."" The practice is called cross-selling because bank representatives enrolled customers into numerous bank products across various lines. Aggressive sales goals pushed Wells Fargo representatives into the practice, and they have since been rescinded. In addition to some 5,300 employees who were fired after the revelations, multiple top-ranking bank officials also left or were removed. Wells Fargo has been busy trying to rehabilitate its image since the scandal first broke in September 2016. ""This agreement is another step in our journey to make things right with customers and rebuild trust,"" said Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo's president and CEO, said in a statement. ""We want to ensure that each customer impacted by our sales practices issue has every opportunity for remediation, and this agreement presents an additional option."" The bank said it believes the settlement will address 11 other pending class actions as well. Customers who can show monetary damages will be reimbursed first, followed by those with other grievances. Some claim, for instance, that their credit scores suffered harm. As for financial impact to the bank, that likely will be limited if any; KBW said the money is ""fully reserved"" on Wells' balance sheet. ""We view the settlement as a positive, and we would expect court approval for the settlementgiven the size of the settlement versus the actual monetary damages incurred by customers,"" the note said. The class-action suit actually was filed more than a year before the bank agreed to pay the Sept. 8, 2016, agreement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies. The settlement announced this week ""should provide adequate financial remediation above and beyond wrongfully charged fees"" given that ""the financial impact to customers was relatively small as the initial review resulted in average refunds of $25 per impacted account,"" KBW said. The lone remaining issue is an investigation with the Department of Justice, though KBW noted that the bank has been able to negotiate settlements so far that are ""much less than we would have expected."" Wells Fargo shares plunged last September in the aftermath of the cross-selling revelations but have recovered since. The bank's biggest stockholder, Warren Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, has expressed confidence in Wells and has not sold shares. The stock is up 2 percent year to date, slightly outperforming the SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund, which tracks the industry and is down fractionally in 2017 as banks have lately fallen out of favor.

Evelyn Cheng,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Investor sentiment jumped to a 16-year high in the first quarter, according to the latest Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index. The index, released Thursday, rose 30 points to hit 126 in the first quarter, according to a telephone survey of 1,007 U.S. investors from Feb. 10 to 19. That was just days after the Dow Jones industrial average topped the psychologically key 20,000 level. The last time the optimism index was higher was during the tech bubble in November 2000, when the index was at 130. The similarly high readings are likely to raise concerns that investors are overly optimistic about the stock market's recent rally. In late 2000, the dotcom boom was in its last throes. This time, however, is different, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""People still hold a lot of cash, still very concentrated in very large-cap equities. They haven't embraced global diversification,"" he said. ""This is more suggestive of how people feel about their finances."" Sixty percent of investors in the survey said now is a good time to invest in financial markets, the highest percentage since early 2011. U.S. stocks have rallied into record territory in the months since President Donald Trump's election. While some analysts point to improving economic fundamentals and corporate earnings, most on Wall Street attribute the gains to bets that the U.S. will see stronger growth, in the short term at least, thanks to lower taxes, slashed regulation and new government spending. The survey found that most investors do not expect a tax cut. Thirty-nine percent expect an increase in the percentage of income they pay on taxes in the next few years, and 31 percent expect their tax rate to stay the same. The rest expect tax rates to go down, the survey said. ""What it would suggest to us is, expectations are really low,"" Samana said.

Elizabeth Gurdus,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Jim Cramer is a fan of well-executed spinoffs, so when communications conglomerate RR Donnelley & Sons decided on a three-way split, he was all for it. But instead of unlocking shareholder value, the new companies' stocks have been tanking in the double-digits, with no clear projections of where their businesses are headed. ""Breakups work when they provide clarity, but they only scare investors away if they actually make the story harder to understand,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. That's why investors have been shedding their shares of the new companies — LSC Communications, Donnelley Financial Solutions, and RR Donnelley — in droves since the split. ﻿Watch the full segment here: LSC shares are down 17 percent since its first trading day, Donnelley Financial's slid 14 percent, and RR Donnelley's stock was essentially slashed in half. Cramer decided to find out why the promising breakup went astray. Nearly six months have passed since the divorce, and LSC Communications, the company's printing business, is still getting a wait-and-see response from banks like Wells Fargo, whose analysts initiated coverage with a ""market perform"" rating two days ago. When RR Donnelley & Sons first split, Cramer had a wait-and-see attitude too, in the hopes that the company would make some smart acquisitions. ""The difference is that the company's had months to figure things out and they still seem pretty unfocused. It's like there's no sense of urgency here,"" Cramer said. And although investors liked LSC's last earnings report, the company recently filed for a secondary share offering so that the RR Donnelley stub could unload its position in LSC, a worrying sign. Donnelley Financial, the spun-off capital markets branch that deals with financial and regulatory communications for investment firms, was hit by 2016's drop in IPO activity, delivering weak revenues in its last earnings report and disappointing guidance for 2017. Donnelley Financial also announced a secondary offering that would enable the leftover RR Donnelley to sell its remaining shares of the company. And RR Donnelley itself has not been a stellar performer. While its latest earnings report beat expectations, management's 2017 sales forecast was flat, which Cramer said ""wasn't exactly confidence-inducing."" Not to mention the risk that Federal Reserve interest rate hikes pose to the high-yield business communications company's profits. ""No wonder it's been a horror show,"" Cramer said. Before the split, Cramer never imagined that the original RR Donnelley could botch a breakup so badly. ""They haven't given us growth targets, they haven't given us guidance, they haven't painted a very good picture of what they'll actually look like going forward,"" he said. Instead, the three have created confusion and uncertainty, the market's least favorite attributes.

John Melloy,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Economist Stephanie Pomboy said she believes the stock market is in a bubble because economic growth will not live up to expectations and because any federal stimulus from President Donald Trump, if it even comes to be, will be mostly canceled out by tax increases and spending cuts on the state and local level. ""I think the stock market fits that definition"" of a bubble, Pomboy told CNBC's Mike Santoli in an interview. ""As an economist I look at stock market valuation by taking total stock market cap relative to GDP and we're right back where we were in 2000 at the peak ...

Krystina Gustafson,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Shares of Luluemon have cratered as quickly as its sales momentum. The Canadian retailer's stock tumbled more than 23 percent Thursday, hours after the athletic wear maker warned its fiscal first quarter has gotten off to a slow start amid a sea of drab clothes. Specifically, weak store traffic and fewer online purchases are setting the chain up for its first quarterly comparable sales decline since the recession. The news was an abrupt pivot from its fourth-quarter performance, when both sales and earnings posted double-digit gains. At least four analysts on Thursday downgraded the company's shares, citing concerns about its about-face. Lululemon's warning added to concerns about a slowdown in the athletic apparel market, which has also been seen in recent results from Under Armour and Nike. The company's shares were on pace for their second worst day of trading in history. ""In what should have been a fairly tame print from Lululemon (holiday sales [were] already pre-announced), their fourth-quarter results uncovered several issues that are likely to create an overhang on the stock for the foreseeable future,"" Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow told investors. Boruchow on Thursday downgraded Lululemon's shares to market perform from outperform. Among those issues are that its steep drop-off occurred both in stores and online. Lululemon CEO Laurent Potdevin attributed the deceleration to a bland assortment that lacked color, and uninspiring presentation of the products on its website. On a call with investors outlining its results, Potdevin told investors that the steps it is taking to correct these problems are already showing results. He added that trends should improve in the second quarter and beyond as the company rolls out new sport bras and its first global marketing campaign. Yet Wall Street wasn't convinced. Given the broader slowdown in apparel sales and a crowded athletic wear market, it cautioned that Lululemon's optimism is likely premature. And after steadily driving its gross margin higher over the past several quarters, that metric is expected to be flat during the current fiscal year. Despite Lululemon's near-term shakiness, the company reiterated that it's on track to double its 2015 revenue and earnings by 2020. Analysts were likewise more optimistic about its prospects longer term, noting its white space in the U.S., internationally and within its menswear business. ""Lululemon has significant room to grow the brand,"" Citi analyst Paul Lejuez said in a research note while downgrading the stock to neutral from buy. ""However, the path to long-term growth is not as visible against the backdrop of the current weakness."" Lululemon shares are down more than 21 percent this year.

Robert Ferris,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"SpaceX's reusable rockets could open up the satellite business for smaller companies. Elon Musk's space exploration company launched and successfully landed its first recycled Falcon 9 rocket Thursday night: Tweet from SpaceX If the reusable rockets deliver on their promise to lower launch costs by up to 30 percent, it could push growth in a few key areas of the satellite market. SpaceX's current base launch price of $62 million for a Falcon 9 rocket is already solid discount over its competitors. But the price is still a bit too high for smaller companies wanting to send satellites into space. Bringing the cost closer to $40 million leaves the door open for a broader array of satellites at different orbital levels, serving different needs. It would be especially effective if SpaceX's few competitors begin adopting its cost-saving measures. ""It would open up the ecosystem to satellite companies that can't afford these high costs,"" said Andrew DeGasperi, an analyst with Macquarie. ""In my mind, that is probably going to increase the number of players in orbit, probably going to increase competition, probably going to drive costs down across the board."" Particularly notable are an emerging crop of satellite providers that are launching constellations of tens or even hundreds of satellites into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Unlike the further-out geostationary orbit, where many established satellite companies operate, LEO satellites do not orbit in a fixed position above the planet. Instead, they glide above the planet's surface. But getting adequate coverage requires a massive constellation of those satellites — sometimes numbering in the hundreds. This will require a lot of launches, even if several satellites can be launched on the same rocket. For example, satellite communication provider OneWeb plans to send a constellation of nearly 700 satellites into Low Earth Orbit, Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Spinola said in an interview with CNBC. The company plans to use its constellation to provide internet service to individuals no matter where they are on Earth. SpaceX also plans to launch its own constellation of around 4,200 LEO satellites, and Samsung has its own plan for a constellation of 4,600. ""There is a number of innovations you need to make these LEO constellations work, and if you can reduce the cost of these launches, that is a significant benefit,"" said Spinola said.

Jeff Daniels,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Wal-Mart Stores appears ""best positioned"" among the major food retailers to capitalize on the next phase of growth in online grocery and take on Amazon, according to a new report from Citi Research. Kroger also scored high among the pure-play grocers in terms of its online grocery positioning compared with e-commerce giant Amazon, particularly as it related to pricing. But at the bottom of the list was Whole Foods Market. Citi looked at the potential winners and losers in the online grocery space using a five-point analysis that looked at factors such as profitability, brick-and-mortar pricing, online pricing, exposure to Seattle-based Amazon, as well as any early adopter advantage. ""Based on our analysis, we determined that Wal-Mart was the winner (low exposure to Amazon Fresh/Prime Now markets and low EPS impact from exposure to those exposed markets),"" Citi said in the 43-page report. ""Whole Foods Market came in last place overall in our analysis, largely due to their urban store exposure, which overlaps highly with Amazon Fresh and Prime Now, as well as their higher price points."" Online grocery shopping could grow five-fold over the next decade, with American consumers spending upwards of $100 billion on food-at-home items by 2025, according an forecast released earlier this year by Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen. While many of the large grocers are still testing and investing in different formats to see which one works best, there's no denying the changing demographics and rise of millennials weaned on digital technologies supports the case for significant future growth in online grocery spending. Amazon's growing presence in the grocery space with different approaches highlights how much profit potential it sees in capturing spending from food and beverage sales. Amazon's grocery operating margin potential could be about 3 percent, or roughly comparable to North American retail industry margins, according to Citi. The estimate assumes inclusion of revenue from membership fees. Amazon's prices on grocery items tend to be higher than Wal-Mart, which accounts for about 20 percent of grocery sales domestically. Citi's research found the price gap between Wal-Mart's store pick-up prices relative to AmazonFresh was an average of 30 percent. Wal-Mart has been rapidly expanding its online grocery business and concentrating on the so-called click-and-collect model, which allows consumers to pickup orders at stores. A spokesman for the retailer told CNBC the retailer has expanded pickup to more than 100 markets in the U.S. last year and now has more than 600 locations offering the service. Whole Foods has partnered with Shipt for third-party grocery delivery and uses InstaCart too. Rival organic and natural foods chain Sprouts Farmers Market has an alliance with Amazon Prime Now. According to Citi, Whole Foods has more than 60 percent of their stores overlapped with Amazon's current or future delivery markets while Wal-Mart is just 23 percent exposed. Sprouts also has a high overlap with Amazon delivery markets but given the partnership Citi said that ""could therefore be a complementary, rather than adversarial scenario and could mute the threat, or even create an opportunity."" Yet Wal-Mart's exposure and threats from Amazon go well beyond groceries and include other merchandise categories, Citi noted. Similarly, Costco and Target also have online grocery activities through mostly third party services and compete with Amazon on several fronts such as consumer electronics, among other things. As for Kroger, the Citi report found that in addition to its competitive pricing compared with Amazon that the Cincinnati-based grocer was poised to benefit from growth in online grocery due to its ""early adopter advantage."" Even so, Kroger maybe seeing market share erosion in some markets against Wal-Mart, according to analysts. They believe part of the reason is the price-cutting strategy Wal-Mart embarked on to gain advantage against Kroger and Aldi, a rapidly expanding deep discounter. ""Kroger looks like they're losing share,"" said PiperJaffray analyst Sean Naughton. He explained that Kroger's same-store sales trends have been lagging Wal-Mart's in groceries. Meantime, analysts suggest both Wal-Mart and Kroger are likely to continue expanding their ""hybrid"" online grocer model, which includes focusing on both click-and-collect or in-store pickup as well as utilizing third-party or direct delivery services. ""Both models are going to thrive in 2017 and 2018,"" said Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights for Kantar Retail. ""I would actually predict that within 3 to 5 years — maybe sooner — that we would start to see some of these third parties getting acquired by major retailers."" Third-party home delivery services such as InstaCart, Shipt and Uber are expanding alliances with large national retail chains. The list of major retailers teaming with these services is growing and now includes not just traditional grocers such as Kroger and Whole Foods but warehouse club operators such as Costco. For example, Shipt this week announced it was offering Costco grocery deliveries in some Florida areas. Sheehan said retailers partnered with the third-party delivery services are relying on them not just to deliver groceries but also be the face of the brand to shoppers. And she said it's doubtful that the ""strongest-branded retailers"" in the U.S. will allow this to happen for an extended period of time. Still, some experts believe the grocery delivery model will ultimately work best for dense urban areas such as New York, a market where several pure-play grocery delivery companies such as FreshDirect have thrived. ""We're still in the test-and-learn phase,"" said Edward Yruma, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. He said the traditional grocery delivery model will continue to grow although Amazon's plans to open several brick-and-mortar grocery pickup locations maybe a sign that grocery shoppers prefer this approach over home delivery. Yruma sees the grocery delivery model a lot like ""waiting for the cable guy. You need to be at home between 5 and 8 o'clock versus just driving by a location and dumping groceries into the car [when you want it]."" Wal-Mart doesn't charge extra for online grocery orders picked up at stores, while rival Kroger offers a free trial but then charges after two deliveries. Kroger has been growing its online business with both its ClickList online grocery ordering service as well as providing grocery deliveries through third-party providers, including InstaCart, Shipt as well as conducting tests with Uber. ""Kroger is not wedded long term to charging a fee,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem. ""If they determined that is a competitive disadvantage then they could potentially change that. I don't necessarily think it hurts them to charge a fee right now because of the relatively solid results."" ",Wal-Mart 'best positioned' in online grocery battle against Amazon

A bi-weekly mortgage payment plan can save you tens of thousands of dollars in interest, and can help you pay off your home loan faster. However, it's not the smartest move for everyone. Here's how much you could save by making bi-weekly payments, and some things you need to consider before committing to a bi-weekly payment schedule. As the name implies, a bi-weekly mortgage payment plan involves paying your mortgage every two weeks, instead of monthly. Specifically, you pay half of your standard monthly payment amount every other week -- so if your mortgage payment is normally $1,000 per month, you would pay $500 in two-week intervals. Image source: Getty Images. The effect of doing this is that you'll end up making an extra mortgage payment each year, which will be applied to your principal balance. There are approximately 52 weeks in a year, which translates to 26 bi-weekly mortgage payments. Since every two bi-weekly payments are equal to one of your monthly payments, this means that you're making 13 of your required monthly payments per year, not just 12. Over time, this can have a dramatic effect. In my previous example of a $1,000 mortgage payment, that would be an additional $1,000 of mortgage principal on which you'll never have to pay interest again. The compound effect of this can result in significant interest savings, and can allow you to own your home free and clear several years earlier. If you currently have a mortgage that you pay monthly, or are planning to obtain a new mortgage in the near future, here's a handy calculator that can show you the difference a bi-weekly payment plan could make for you.  * Calculator is for estimation purposes only, and is not financial planning or advice. As with any tool, it is only as accurate as the assumptions it makes and the data it has, and should not be relied on as a substitute for a financial advisor or a tax professional. As an example, let's say that you get a $200,000, 30-year mortgage at 4.5% interest. Paying every two weeks instead of once per month would result in your loan being paid off after 25.6 years -- more than four years early. Even better, you would save more than $28,000 in interest along the way. If you already have a mortgage, you've probably received letters from third-party companies offering to set up a bi-weekly mortgage payment plan for you -- for a fee, of course. The easiest way, if it's available to you, is that many lenders will allow you to set up automatic bi-weekly mortgage payments on their website, for free. From personal experience, although my current lender doesn't have this feature, I happen to know from a previous mortgage that Wells Fargo does. I'm sure several other major lenders do as well. If your lender doesn't offer the ability to set it up for free, there's a do-it-yourself method that will produce the same long-term results. By simply dividing your monthly mortgage payment by 12 and adding this amount to each of your payments, you'll also get the effect of an additional payment applied to your loan each year. No discussion of bi-weekly mortgages and their benefits would be complete without mentioning the potential drawbacks. Specifically, before deciding to use a bi-weekly repayment plan, you need to ask yourself if that money could be put to smarter use elsewhere. Mortgage debt is usually the lowest-interest form of debt that people carry, so if you have outstanding credit card debt, or any other debt with a significantly higher interest rate than your mortgage, it's usually a good idea to pay that off first. In addition, it's often a bad idea to apply extra money to your mortgage that would otherwise be used for your retirement, college, or emergency savings. If you have catching up to do in any of these areas, that's probably the best use of your extra cash. On the other hand, if your credit card debt is under control and you have enough money to save for your other goals, a bi-weekly mortgage payment plan could be a smart move for you. ","

In fact, he's nine years into a 10-year bet that such a fund of his choosing could beat a set of at least five hedge funds. Buffett's pick for the bet? The Vanguard S&P 500 index fund, which is available in both ETF and mutual fund forms. Image source: Getty Images. As the name implies, this ETF tracks the S&P 500 index, which is composed of 500 of the largest publicly traded American companies. And don't think by simply investing in an index fund like this that you'll be sacrificing performance -- over long periods of time, the S&P 500 has averaged annual returns of 9-10% (including dividends), and has outperformed 80% of actively managed large-cap mutual funds over the past 10 years. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO) is an excellent option for new investors, as it's a diverse basket of the largest U.S. companies, and comes with an extremely low expense ratio (annual management fee) of just 0.04%. In other words, if your initial investment in the fund is for $1,000, this translates to an annual management fee of just $0.40. The iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) invests in companies with above-average growth potential. Specifically, the fund tracks the S&P 900 Growth Index, which is composed of large- and mid-cap U.S. companies that exhibit growth characteristics. Growth stocks are generally defined as companies whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the average company within the same industry. Growth stocks tend to be a bit more volatile than value stocks, which are generally more stable and mature businesses. To give you an idea of the type of companies that qualify as ""growth"" stocks, the fund's top five holdings are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet (Google). Not surprisingly, there are a lot of tech stocks in the index, due to the growing nature of the industry. Because of this inherent volatility risk, growth stocks are an especially good candidate for ETF investors, new and experienced. So, over the short term, these stocks can move up and down quite a bit (check out a 5-year chart of Facebook), but they certainly have higher growth potential over the long run. This makes this ETF an especially good choice for new investors who are relatively young and have a long time horizon to ride out the ups and downs. And with an expense ratio of just 0.05%, it's tough to find a cheaper growth stock ETF option. The High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which is a collection of stocks (394 to be exact) that pay above-average dividend yields, specifically excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs). As of January 2018, the fund pays a 3.5% dividend yield. Among the fund's top investments are rock-solid American companies such as Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. Like the other Vanguard fund I discussed, this one also has an extremely low expense ratio -- 0.08% in this case. ","

 ,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Among the biggest trends in the world of markets is the rise of passive investing. Rather than pay high fees to active mutual fund managers who often fail to beat the market, money has been pouring into passive strategies that track major indices and charge smaller fees. So what are the ramifications of this trend for investors who choose to remain active? We speak with Michael Maouboussin, who heads global financial strategies at Credit Suisse Group and is not just an expert on the world of investing, but also on the role of luck in success. As he sees it, trading is like a game of poker, and in poker you want to play against weaker, less-skilled players. But as more and more of those less-skilled players opt not to trade actively, the game is getting harder. © 2017 Bloomberg Oops! We could not locate your form. Username

As an investor in active funds I don’t have to forecast the future and year after year my active funds are beating the passive funds after fees so no need to follow the heard into passive. Agree wholeheartedly. I chose the good fund managers that consistently beat the Index over a 10 plus year period. I do not mind paying performance fees provided they beat the Index and their benchmark by a large (4%+ p.a.).

Ryan Vlastelica,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 27, 2017 8:08 a.m. ET Markets may be headed to an environment where active beats passive, but how do you find the right manager? By The trend in the great investing debate of active versus passive management is clear, but that doesn’t mean the issue is simple or even close to settled. While index-based funds have been the clear winner over the past several years, both in terms of performance and investor preference, analysts say the current economic environment is one where simply tracking the market may not provide the best return or protection against risk. And in equities—where gains are expected to continue in coming years, just in a less broad-based fashion—having the right manager can protect against volatility by readjusting to changing conditions. “We believe the active/passive debate does not yield a clear-cut winner. In our view, both strategies can be utilized together to help maximize expense reduction without fully eliminating the investment opportunities offered by active managers,” analysts at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute wrote in a recent report. Passive funds simply track a benchmark like the S&P 500

                                   while active funds have their portfolio components chosen by an individual or team. In recent years, the move has leaned decisively toward passive. According to Morningstar, active funds saw outflows of $285.2 billion last year; passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion. (Despite that, more assets continue to be held in active strategies than passive—$9.3 trillion versus $5.3 trillion, as of year-end 2016.) Investors have taken to them for a variety of reasons. Index funds are not only cheaper than actively managed ones—passive U.S. stock ETFs have an average expense ratio of 0.344%, according to Morningstar, though the most popular have fees below 0.1%; the average for active funds is 0.864%—but they offer better performance. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the number of active funds that have outperformed over the long term is essentially zero. See also: In stocks, nearly every type of active manager got worse at their job in 2016 Those stats are skewed, however, by the fact that Wall Street has been in a particularly good environment for passive management. Bull markets, the current of which celebrated its eighth anniversary earlier this month, favor passive strategies through “rising tide” environments. Because the market’s gains have been widespread for years, with basically all sectors participating, it has been exceedingly difficult for active managers to surpass that performance, especially over long periods, and especially factoring their higher fees. Read:  Should fund managers cut their fees if they underperform? This one does Lately, though, correlations between individual securities have been falling, giving stock pickers a chance to find undervalued names and avoid overvalued ones, and thus creating better odds of outperformance. “Active managers may outperform their passive peers in the latter part of a recovery, where we believe this recovery may be,” Wells Fargo wrote. Data bears out the idea that broader active outperformance is cyclical, as seen in the following graph, which was provided by Altus Securities and uses data from the Center for Research in Security Prices. That chart, however, gets at one of the hurdles faced by active management. The long-term average has roughly 40% of active managers outperforming, in aggregate. That means investors still have better odds sticking with the benchmark, especially since they can’t invest in “active” as a category—they need to select a specific fund. With thousands to choose from, and with each offering its own strategy or investment philosophy, finding the rare actively managed fund that would outperform net of fees for the long term is a daunting task, and one that investors are generally opting against. Read on: Wall Street pushes active management, but investors aren’t biting See also: A new actively managed ETF struggles to find contrarian bets among unjustly shorted stocks Still, if the market is in fact entering an environment where the right manager can preserve capital or boost returns, it is a task investors should consider. The first step in this, analysts said, was to view active management as a complement to one’s portfolio, not a replacement to the index funds that are widely seen as the best core holdings for any investor. In a market that favors value, for example, a manager who has a growth orientation can provide the same diversifying benefits as bond exposure. Second, analyze the funds as potential long-term holdings, not temporary positions to ride out periods of volatility or weakness. And finally, look for subcategories of the market where the professional analysis of a manager can add value, analysts said. “Your probabilities of success with an active manager are better in high-yield bonds than government bonds, in emerging markets rather than developed, and in small-cap equities rather than large cap,” said Steve Lipper, senior investment strategist at Royce & Associates LP, an active management firm that focuses on small companies. “Because there are more small companies and less analyst coverage of them, managers can more easily find values there than they would be able to in the large-cap space.” Within those categories, Lipper said, there are a variety of metrics that can help gauge the quality of a fund and its manager. In addition to the fund’s fees and past performance—evaluated against their benchmark over a variety of market conditions and economic cycles—prospective investors should look to see how long the manager has overseen the fund, whether they invest their own money in it, and what degree of “active share” it has. Active share is a measure of overlap between a fund and the benchmark it tracks (for example, a large-cap fund and the S&P 500). The higher the active share, the less correlation it would have with the benchmark, giving it more value as a diversification tool and creating the potential for outperformance (though this also increases the odds of underperformance). Read more about active share: This figure helps explain why so many active ETF managers underperform Lipper recommended funds with an active share of at least 80%, the same figure quoted by analysts at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “If you want an active manager, then you want an *active* manager,” Lipper emphasized. “You want him because he doesn’t look like the benchmark.” He pointed to the Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund

                                   the benchmark his fund now tracks, which was introduced in the late 1970s. Royce Funds also requires that its lead portfolio managers have at least $1 million of their own money in the funds they oversee. Data have shown this to be a good indicator of future performance, with such funds outperforming ones where the managers don’t invest their own money. According to a September 2016 Morningstar report, a group of funds where the managers don’t co-invest had “a meager 35% success rate” over a five-year period. “Those with between $100,001 and $500,000 [invested] had a 43% success rate, and those with more than $1 million had a 47% success rate,” wrote Russel Kinnel, the firm’s director of manager research. “Because about one third of funds were merged away or liquidated over that five-year stretch, a 47% success rate is actually quite good.” Even with these parameters, however, passive funds are nearly universally seen as the best choices to make up the bulk of an investor’s portfolio, even from the point of view of active managers themselves. “If you want passive exposure, vanilla funds are the way to go. But if you want something that isn’t correlated to the market, or which relies on an alternative data set, active managers are out there looking for bigger returns,” said Petra Bakosova, chief operating officer at Hull Tactical Asset Allocation, and a portfolio manager to the Hull Tactical U.S. ETF

Morey Stettner,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 30, 2017 3:06 a.m. ET It can provide peace of mind and flexibility By In many asset allocation models, cash barely registers. It’s a blip, maybe 10% of holdings. An investor’s age, income and risk tolerance come into play, of course. So do other variables. But as a general rule, financial advisers will recommend holding enough rainy-day cash to last perhaps a year — and not a dollar more. Most investors, after all, need to put their money to work to maximize long-term results, right? Sitting on too much cash can cause them to miss years of double-digit stock surges, right? Not so fast, says Brett Anderson. Anderson, a certified financial planner in Hudson, Wis., cherishes cash. And he persuades many of his clients to share that love, which he says gives them peace of mind while positioning them to make bold bets when they present themselves. “My philosophy is ‘Cash solves a lot of problems and creates a lot of opportunities,’” Anderson said. Over his 16-year career as an adviser, Anderson, 48, has explained to hundreds of clients the value of building a war chest. His clients, mostly midcareer professionals and business owners, earn an average annual income of about $250,000. He views prudent money management in terms of three buckets. The first bucket — cash — should sit indefinitely as a backstop. As that bucket fills, he turns his attention to a second bucket — a typical stock-and-bond mix with a time horizon of up to 10 years. The third represents long-term investments, including retirement savings, which are left alone to compound over decades. In their initial meetings with Anderson, clients often expect him to discuss traditional investment strategies involving stocks and bonds. Instead, he focuses on stopping what he calls “financial leakage.” “I’m looking to capture more money in the first bucket,” he said. “That means looking at lifestyle costs and reducing everyday spending on things such as eating out, clothing and travel. Clients should hit a minimum gross savings target of 15% to 20% or more.” Anderson urges clients to deposit large amounts of cash in savings accounts. Depending on their overall income and other factors, he might suggest that they start by setting aside, say, $25,000. Rather than using a formula to calculate the amount of the cash hoard, he confers with each individual to set a feasible target. “I usually get a lot of pushback,” he said. “They’re skeptical at first. But as we build up their savings and they start to feel a sense of security, they often want to put away even more cash.” How does Anderson determine when a client’s cash bucket is sufficiently filled? He gauges their attitude and outlook. “It’s emotional,” he said. “They like sleeping at night knowing they have a certain amount in a savings account.” When Anderson met a new client in her late 30s, she had about $400,000 in her portfolio — with roughly $30,000 in cash and the rest mostly equities. He suggested that she increase her cash balance to $50,000, which she did. He says she “liked the feeling” and kept socking away more funds; currently, she’s at $90,000 in cash and content with that amount. Happiness and saving money go hand in hand. And the more liquid wealth you accumulate, the happier you feel, according to a 2016 study by Joe Gladstone, an assistant professor at University College London. Some might call Anderson’s approach too conservative, saying it takes money out of the market. He rejects the criticism, noting that Warren Buffett holds billions in cash and “just waits for the opportunity to buy.” Similarly, he instructs his clients to treat cash holdings as a springboard for opportunistic investing or a way to solve problems that arise in their lives. Buffett, for example, reported his Wells Fargo

Similarly, Anderson might encourage a client to make a timely investment in a beaten-down market sector — or tap their cash to cover a medical emergency that’s not covered by health insurance. “It allows you to take greater risks with your other two buckets because you can absorb market losses with your cash bucket full,” he said. Anderson acknowledges that aggressive investors may want to limit their cash bucket and earmark more funds for equities — and potentially reap years of appreciating assets.

compound rate of return was 9.8%. But rather than focus on rate of return, he emphasizes the flexibility and peace of mind that investors gain from clinging to cash. “Most advisers say it’s an inefficient use of money,” he said. “I say it’s exactly the most efficient use of money, especially in the short term.

Wallace Witkowski,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 29, 2017 3:34 a.m. ET Tech, consumer discretionary stocks most widely held By Stock-picking fund managers are doubling down on bets that a strengthening economy will lead to a return of clear winners and losers in the stock market, emphasizing shares that would benefit from continued growth. “Active managers have bumped up their overweight in cyclicals yet again, reaching the second-highest cyclical versus defensive relative weight in our data history since 2008,” said analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a recent note. As B. of A. admits, investors have been abandoning active funds over the past few years in favor of lower-cost passive funds, which simply track a benchmark, as broad-based gains in the bull market have made it more difficult for active managers to outperform. That trend may change, with actively managed funds outperforming passive ones, if we have entered the late stage of the current economic recovery, according to a recent report from Wells Fargo Investment Institute. While challenges remain for President Donald Trump to make good on policy promises viewed as pro-business, economic data released Tuesday pointed to an improving economy as consumer confidence rose to its highest level in more than 16 years, home prices hit a 31-month high, and the U.S. trade deficit dropped in February. The upshot is that active positioning may once again matter as an upswing in the business cycle upsets the multiyear trend of having all boats rise with the tide and produces more distinct winners and losers. Tech and consumer-discretionary stocks figure into the most over-owned by active fund managers, with health-care stocks still commanding overweight exposure but at their least popular levels in five years, B. of A. said. After years of neglect following the financial crisis, financial stocks are finally being held by active managers at nearly equal weight, B. of A. said.

In those sectors, B. of A. listed the top five stocks that are most concentrated among a small number of owners, meaning those stocks could be subject to more volatility than their peers going forward given the less diversified ownership base. Overall, the most widely held stocks by active managers also fall along those sectors, with the highest relative weight compared with the S&P 500 going to Amazon.com Inc.

                                   tops Fortune magazine’s recently released ranking of America’s most admired companies. What’s the problem with that? Companies as admired as Apple typically have difficulty living up to stock investors’ lofty expectations. History suggests you’d be better off investing in companies that are least admired — companies such as Comcast and Bank of America. Let me hasten to add that I’m not saying that Comcast, Bank of America, or other least-admired firms are better companies than Apple. They’re certainly not more profitable. But the amount of money you make when investing in a stock is a function not of its profitability in any absolute sense but its profits relative to investor expectations. And since those expectations are already so low with stocks that are out of favor, you can make more money with them even when their business performance turns out to be merely mediocre. Don’t take my word for it. Consider a study conducted several years ago by two finance professors: Deniz Anginer at Virginia Tech and Meir Statman at Santa Clara University. The researchers constructed two portfolios out of the stocks on Fortune’s annual list. The first contained the stocks of companies that were most admired companies, while the second contained those with the lowest Fortune scores — those most despised, in other words. Between April 1983 and December 2007, the Despised Company portfolio outperformed the Admired Portfolio by nearly two percentage points per year, on average. Perhaps even more revealing, the professors found that increases in admiration were, on average, followed by lower returns. (See the chart below.) This historical pattern doesn’t hold up every year, needless to say, and last year was one of those exceptions. Apple was the most-admired stock on Fortune’s list in 2016, and has since risen 33.1%. Still, the most-hated stocks I listed in a year-ago column have performed almost as well, gaining an average of 27.0% over the last 12 months, nearly double the S&P 500’s

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"The Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced on Monday that the bank must rehire the employee, as well as pay back wages, compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees totaling $5.4 million. OSHA concluded that the manager was “abruptly” forced to leave a Los Angeles branch of the bank in 2010, after he told superiors he suspected two of his subordinates of bank, mail and wire fraud. The manager also called the bank’s ethics hot line. OSHA determined his whistleblowing was “at least a contributing factor in his termination.” The manager was not named. The bank is planning to request a full hearing on the OSHA decision before the Labor Department’s Office of Administrative Law Judges. Such a step will not halt the initial reinstatement order. “We take seriously the concerns of current and former team members. This decision is a preliminary order and to date there has been no hearing on the merits of this case.  We disagree with the findings and will be requesting a full hearing of the matter,” said Vince Scanlon, a bank spokesman. According to OSHA, the manager had previously received positive job performance appraisals, but in 2010 he was told he had 90 days to find a new job at the bank after being dismissed as a manager. He was unable to do so and was terminated, and has not found work in banking since. The manager worked in Wells Fargo’s wealth management group, according to the bank. The OSHA decision is unrelated to the bank’s woes surrounding the creation of potentially millions of fake accounts by employees looking to hit sales goals. In that case, the bank has also come under scrutiny over whether it punished whistleblowers that notified superiors of wrongdoing involving  Wells Fargo employees. ","

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"Ancel Martinez, a Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to comment. A lawyer for many of the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Failla’s 80-page decision covers five lawsuits, which comprise one of the largest remaining pieces of U.S. litigation seeking to hold banks liable for risky mortgage securities that were a major cause of the 2008 global financial crisis. Much of this litigation targeted lenders, but some targeted trustees that oversaw the securities’ performance. Investors accused Wells Fargo of having taken “virtually no action” to require lenders to buy back or fix defaulted or poorly underwritten loans that backed their securities, despite knowing of shortfalls. They said the San Francisco-based bank’s resistance stemmed from concern that acting would have exposed its own “misconduct” in other residential mortgage-backed securities trusts, and jeopardized its business dealings with lenders and servicers, court papers show. Failla said the plaintiffs “more than met” the legal standard for letting the breach of contract claims proceed, having pointed to internal Wells Fargo documents to suggest the bank knew about many loan defects but did nothing. “It is plaintiffs’ contention that such allegations go far beyond many other RMBS trustee complaints, which themselves have been found sufficient to state a claim,” Failla wrote, without ruling on the merits. “The court agrees.” Failla also said the National Credit Union Administration may pursue various claims against Wells Fargo on behalf of five failed credit unions. The NCUA has already recouped roughly $4.3 billion in litigation against many banks over securities that the credit unions bought. A spokesman could not be reached for comment.

 ,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A Boston-area man has agreed to pay more than $590,000 to settle U.S. insider trading charges over a deal he learned about from his former romantic partner, a Wells Fargo & Co analyst he met while salsa dancing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement on Monday with Vlad Spivak, a resident of Medford, Massachusetts, whom the agency had accused of making more than $220,000 illegally through insider trading. Spivak neither admitted nor denied the allegations in resolving the lawsuit, according to court papers. A lawyer for Spivak declined to comment. In a lawsuit filed in November 2015, the SEC said Spivak had been unemployed and supported himself by day trading when he bought shares in American Dental Partners Inc from mid-October to Nov. 1 of 2011, ahead of its $398 million acquisition by private equity firm JLL Partners Inc. The SEC said Spivak learned the company was going to be involved in a deal from Shirmila Doddi, who at the time was living in Boston and working at Wells Fargo, which had been advising American Dental Partners on potential transactions. The SEC said Doddi, who later moved to San Diego and no longer works at Wells Fargo, had met Spivak at a salsa dancing club in early 2011 and developed a romantic relationship with him that lasted through at least the end of the year. Under a settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Dennis Saylor in Boston on Monday, Spivak was required to forfeit his $222,357 in trading profits, plus pay $35,633 in interest and a civil penalty of $333,535. Doddi previously settled with the SEC without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.

 ,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"Canada’s financial watchdog is investigating sales practices at the country’s banks and expects to conclude its investigation by the end of the year. The probe follows media reports that staff at the country’s biggest banks were pressured into meeting sales targets by  moving customers to higher-fee accounts and raising credit card and overdraft limits, both without customers’ permission. Scotiabank Chief Executive Brian Porter told shareholders at the bank’s annual meeting on Tuesday that he believed the bank’s sales practices were “very sound”. “We have over 8 million customers in Canada, we did over 400 million transactions last year and we had only eight customer complaints about sales practices,” he said. O’Neill said attention on the issue was heightened further following the recent media reports in Canada and the board spent an hour reviewing the topic at a meeting on Monday. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, James O’Sullivan, Scotiabank’s group head, Canadian banking, said the bank was sifting through customer data to assess its sales practices. “Since the Wells Fargo issue, we’ve been looking at it very, very deeply,” he said. “Our sales practices are sound. That is not opinion. That’s a reasoned conclusion based on the information and the data that we have.” Speaking to shareholders at Bank of Montreal’s annual meeting on Tuesday, Chief Executive Bill Downe said he had a “high degree of confidence” in the bank’s staff and believed the bank had good practices with regard to sales. “With respect to our bankers, I have confidence that they know we’re not in business to push products. We guide our customers in picking services that best meet their needs.” Downe said the bank had been reviewing its procedures since the reports. “We track incidents of customer or employee dissatisfaction and I’ve seen no movement in the numbers in the most recent period,” he said. Fair Canada, a group advocating for investor rights, on Tuesday called on the Canadian Securities Administrators, an umbrella body of all of Canada’s provincial securities regulators, to address the recent reports.

 ,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"In the age of fast fashion, when trends change overnight, athletic leisure wear is showing signs of age. Industry-wide sales in North America have grown 39.2 percent to $26.05 billion in the last five years, according to Euromonitor. However, sales in the category are expected to grow at 5.2 percent in 2017, slower than the average 6.9 percent rate at which the category had grown in the last five years. The latest quarterly results have also indicated a slowdown from the marquee manufacturers. “There is no more the growth that was there before and there are way more competitors for the brand (Lululemon) compared to when they’d started 10 years ago,” Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of consulting firm J. Rogers Kniffen WWE, said. A hash of celebrity brand launches, including Beyonce’s Ivy Park line in April last year, has also competed for sales at the traditional retailers. “We continue to believe trend shifts away from athleisure to denim will present stiffening headwinds to LULU,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon said. The stock market is giving the industry little room for error. Nike’s shares fell as much as 7.3 percent after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue last month, while Under Armour’s shares fell 28 percent in January after it forecast 2017 sales well below analysts’ estimates. “Over the past 12-24 months, other athletic wear bellwethers such as NKE and UA have seen meaningful multiple contraction once sales started slowing and margins stopped expanding,” said Ike Boruchow, analyst with Wells Fargo, in a research note. The market on Thursday showed little patience for Lululemon’s disappointing results, too. The company’s shares closed down 23.4 percent at $50.76. ","

 ,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in February amid delays in the payment of income tax refunds, but the biggest annual increase in inflation in nearly five years supported expectations of further interest rate hikes this year. The slowdown in consumer spending reported by the Commerce Department on Friday is, however, likely to be temporary with consumer confidence at a more than 16-year high and a tightening labor market pushing up wage growth. “Given the weather-related weakness in utilities spending as well as some delays in tax refunds for low- and middle-income earners in February, we expect consumer spending to strengthen in the quarters ahead,” said Eugenio Aleman, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent. That was the smallest gain since August and followed an unrevised 0.2 percent rise in January. Economists had expected a 0.2 percent increase. The government delayed the issuing of tax refunds this year as part of efforts to combat fraud. Spending last month was held back by a 0.1 percent dip in purchases of big-ticket items like automobiles. While unseasonably warm weather lowered households’ heating bills, it restricted spending growth last month. Weak consumer spending resulted in the Atlanta Federal Reserve trimming its first-quarter economic growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.9 percent annualized rate. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter, stepping down from the July-September quarter’s brisk 3.5 percent pace. Despite signs of moderate growth, economists expect the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least twice more this year. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month. Other data on Friday showed the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index slipping to a reading of 96.9 in March from 97.6 earlier in the month. The final reading was a touch higher than February’s 96.3. A report from the Conference Board this week showed its consumer confidence index surging in March to its highest reading since December 2000. The dollar was trading slightly higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell marginally as investors skimmed profits off recent gains. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose modestly. INFLATION PRESSURES BUILDINGEven with economic growth slowing at the start of the year, inflation is rising. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 0.1 percent last month after jumping 0.4 percent in January. That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase in the PCE price index to 2.1 percent, the biggest gain since April 2012. The PCE price index rose 1.9 percent in January. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index increased 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the core PCE price index increased 1.8 percent after a similar gain in January. The core PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. Inflation is now in the upper end of the range that Fed officials in March felt would be reached this year. “There is nothing in this report that suggests the Fed should pause in June in its gradual renormalization of monetary policy but the Fed will look closely at the evolution of core inflation over the next two months in making that decision,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Rising price pressures are also eating into consumer spending. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.1 percent in February after declining 0.2 percent in January. That was the first back-to-back monthly decline in real consumer spending since April 2009. Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month after advancing 0.5 percent in January. Wages increased 0.5 percent, the biggest gain in five months. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation increased 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in January. Savings rose to a five-month high of $808.0 billion from $770.9 billion in January. Rising incomes and higher savings bode well for future consumer spending. ","

 ,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"The France-based company ended the quarter with 26 orders, but the net total for the year shrank to six after allowing for cancellations and conversions between different models. Boeing earlier posted 226 jetliner orders for the same quarter, boosted by orders for 21 airframes for its P-8 military surveillance jet project and 15 U.S. air refuelling tankers. After cancellations, Boeing posted 198 net orders including those military derivatives, but most of the remaining orders were from airlines that have to be identified. The order tally for A320neo aircraft fell by 8 units in March: hardly enough to dent a backlog of over 3,500 orders but enough to highlight the unexpected extra availability of current-generation A320s as Airbus keeps assembly lines flowing. Chinese lessor CALC and U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines are among customers seizing the chance to pick up extra A320s powered by an earlier generation of engines at what some industry sources describe as “opportunistic” prices. Airbus delivered 12 A320neos in March to bring the 2017 total to 26, but deliveries remain behind schedule due mainly to problems with engines from Pratt, one of two suppliers. Airbus aims to deliver about 200 A320neos this year. In two other widely watched projects it delivered 13 A350s and 3 A380s in the first quarter. In total, it delivered 136 jets in the quarter compared with Boeing’s total of 169. However, analysts said Boeing’s deliveries were lower than expected and Wells Fargo Securities cut its earnings forecast for the quarter, while maintaining its forecast for the year. Boeing shares rose 0.4 percent, about in line with the U.S. market, while Airbus shares rose more than 1 percent. Boeing overtook its European rival as the world’s largest jetliner producer in 2012 and analysts say it is expected to retain the title through the rest of the decade, while the prize for most orders is hotly contested each year. Last quarter’s wide order gap with Boeing came as Airbus faces a UK probe into suspected corruption in its use of third-party agents to win contracts in at least five countries, which widened this month as France started its own investigation.

 ,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"(Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Friday, pulled down by Exxon and JPMorgan Chase as investors wrapped up a strong quarter and weighed whether corporate earnings reports will justify the market’s lofty valuations. Major indexes have hit multiple record highs since the election of President Donald Trump on bets that he would improve economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending. The rally has also benefited from robust economic data and a pickup in corporate earnings growth. For the quarter ending Friday, the S&P 500 gained 5.5 percent, its strongest quarterly performance since the last quarter of 2015. Investors are now looking to the upcoming quarterly earnings season to justify pricy valuations. First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 10.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The index is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared to its long-term average of 15. “Valuations are as stretched as they ever get,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Nashville. “Certainly that’s cause for concern if earnings don’t grow the way they are anticipated to grow.” Over 40 strategists polled this week on average expected the S&P 500 to rise another 2 percent by the end of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.31 percent to end at 20,663.22 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.23 percent to 2,362.72. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC slipped 0.04 percent to 5,911.74. So far in 2017, technology .SPLRCT has been the top-performing S&P sector, up 12.2 percent. The weakest has been energy .SPNY, down 7.3 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 100 new highs and 17 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions and among the lightest volume days in 2017. ","

 ,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Wells Fargo has restructured its credit card processing business after an internal probe found some employees had falsely reported customer sales numbers, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. This raises questions about the scope of the sales scandal that hit the lender's retail banking business last year and cost Chief Executive John Stumpf his job. The probe also found that employees had pushed small firms toward more expensive contracts as part of aggressive sales tactics, the Journal reported. Wells Fargo was not immediately available for comment. The company had said on a conference call in January that it had made progress on evaluating potentially unauthorized credit card accounts, including any impact to customers' credit scores and analysis of credit signatures to verify authorization. ""We want to identify anyone who was negatively impacted so we can make things right,"" Chief Executive Tim Sloan said on the call. Merchants have battled for years with banks, in the courts and in Congress, over how much they must pay for accepting card payments. Revelations of Wells Fargo's problems with small-business customers come almost a month after it reached a $190 million settlement over opening as many as 2 million accounts in retail customers' names without their knowledge. The bank has said it fired more than 5,000 employees for improperly opening the accounts. Wells Fargo is also battling lawsuits from former employees, customers and shareholders related to the issue. Shares of Wells Fargo, which is expected to report first-quarter results on April 13, were up 0.3 percent in premarket trading. ",Wells Fargo's aggressive sales tactics hit small firms: WSJ
Jeff Cox,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Wells Fargo has been trying to put its fake accounts scandal behind it since the matter was brought to light last year. Setting aside $110 million to help aggrieved customers is a good place to start, according to two industry analysts. Earlier this week, the bank announced the agreement to end a class-action suit over some 2 million accounts that were opened without customers' permission. Wells Fargo already has paid $185 million in fines as part of an agreement with multiple government agencies. The scandal is ""looking smaller in the rearview,"" analysts Brian Kleinhanzl and Michael Brown at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note. ""Wells Fargo has resolved another overhang related to the cross-sell scandal and the long-tail of potential negative outcomes is growing shorter."" The practice is called cross-selling because bank representatives enrolled customers into numerous bank products across various lines. Aggressive sales goals pushed Wells Fargo representatives into the practice, and they have since been rescinded. In addition to some 5,300 employees who were fired after the revelations, multiple top-ranking bank officials also left or were removed. Wells Fargo has been busy trying to rehabilitate its image since the scandal first broke in September 2016. ""This agreement is another step in our journey to make things right with customers and rebuild trust,"" said Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo's president and CEO, said in a statement. ""We want to ensure that each customer impacted by our sales practices issue has every opportunity for remediation, and this agreement presents an additional option."" The bank said it believes the settlement will address 11 other pending class actions as well. Customers who can show monetary damages will be reimbursed first, followed by those with other grievances. Some claim, for instance, that their credit scores suffered harm. As for financial impact to the bank, that likely will be limited if any; KBW said the money is ""fully reserved"" on Wells' balance sheet. ""We view the settlement as a positive, and we would expect court approval for the settlementgiven the size of the settlement versus the actual monetary damages incurred by customers,"" the note said. The class-action suit actually was filed more than a year before the bank agreed to pay the Sept. 8, 2016, agreement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies. The settlement announced this week ""should provide adequate financial remediation above and beyond wrongfully charged fees"" given that ""the financial impact to customers was relatively small as the initial review resulted in average refunds of $25 per impacted account,"" KBW said. The lone remaining issue is an investigation with the Department of Justice, though KBW noted that the bank has been able to negotiate settlements so far that are ""much less than we would have expected."" Wells Fargo shares plunged last September in the aftermath of the cross-selling revelations but have recovered since. The bank's biggest stockholder, Warren Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, has expressed confidence in Wells and has not sold shares. The stock is up 2 percent year to date, slightly outperforming the SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund, which tracks the industry and is down fractionally in 2017 as banks have lately fallen out of favor.

Patti Domm,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"For the first time since he entered the White House, the world will get a glimpse of how President Donald Trump really deals with the sticky issues of trade when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping. Making American trade fair was a cornerstone of Trump's presidential campaign, but so far, it's been an intangible for markets. That may soon change. Trump hosts Xi at Mar-a-Lago Thursday and Friday, and even the exchanges and interplay between the two leaders on Trump's private Florida resort could send an important signal on where his administration plans to take the difficult trade relationship with China. ""The markets want to see that the president's efforts to prepare for tariffs are just mainly a negotiating ploy, and not a serious pre-commitment. If President Trump's already made up his mind that he's going to hit China with big tariffs, the market wants to know that now,"" said Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute chief international investment strategist. Ahead of the meeting, Trump has already tweeted that it will not be easy. ""The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits ... and job losses. American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives."" Candidate Trump threatened tariffs and called out countries that he claimed are unfair to the U.S., including Mexico and China. In the background, markets have feared, but not reacted to the idea that his comments could create retaliatory trade clashes and harm the economy. How far he is willing to go has remained unknown, even as his administration moves forward to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. He tasked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to look at practices behind U.S. trade deficits. ""I think what markets care most about is stability in China. As long as President Trump doesn't disrupt that, which I don't think he'll do, or disrupt Chinese buying of Treasury bonds, markets will handle it quite well,"" said Erin Browne, portfolio manager and head of macro investing at UBS Asset Management's hedge fund unit, UBS O'Connor. Analysts aren't optimistic that much will come of the initial meeting with the Chinese president, but there is a chance it could affect markets. ""We might get that sort of thing next week or we might not. Trade has not been a part of the market's rally since November. So far, they've only been talking about growth positives,"" Christopher said. The administration has also not taken a position on where it stands on the border-adjustment tax, a proposal in the House tax reform plan that would tax all imports to the country at 20 percent and not tax exports. Proponents say it would create U.S. jobs and increase exports, but it has opposition in the Senate and there is concern it will create inflation and hurt consumers and companies reliant on imports, like retailers. Steven Wieting, global chief strategist at Citi Private Bank, said the most important things to see coming from the meeting between Xi and Trump will be ""progress and cooperation."" What will come out of it is unclear. "" I've been asking when do we focus specifically on trade policies and I just can't tell whether this meeting really means that. It's high on my list of things to be watching,"" he said. China was by far the largest exporter to the U.S., shipping $462.8 billion in goods last year, and running a deficit of $347 billion. The U.S. is Mexico's largest export destination, and the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico was $63 billion. Xi is also being watched closely for his role in the relationship. China has been assertive in its right to pursue military activities in the South China Sea, but Xi has also worked to establish China as a new economic leader. ""Everyone remembers that Davos speech,"" said Wieting. Xi, in the January speech at the World Economic Forum, defended globalization and warned against trade wars that would hurt global growth. Wieting said he does not believe the Trump administration will ultimately go down the path of starting trade wars: ""Wilbur Ross has said the trick is expanding U.S. exports, and that would be the best way forward. If that indeed is the case and that's the attitude … you can have a win, win situation."" But others in the administration, like trade adviser Peter Navarro, have made much more strident comments about China and other U.S. trade partners such as Germany. Christopher said there is a perception that some of the early rhetoric may not amount to much. He said the market is already judging the changes to NAFTA to be less damaging to Mexico than first believed. With help from its central bank's rate hike regime, the peso has been recovering and is up 9.5 percent year to date. Mexican stocks have also performed well, reaching record highs just this past week. ""The market's been reversing itself on Mexico and on NAFTA for some time. The initial reaction was the bludgeoning of Mexico and the peso,"" Christopher said. ""I think the market's anticipating a renegotiated NAFTA that's not so bad as people were fearing."" Watch: Buy or steer clear of China? ",Trump's Mar-a-Lago diplomacy with China's Xi may reveal more than you think
Krystina Gustafson,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Shares of Luluemon have cratered as quickly as its sales momentum. The Canadian retailer's stock tumbled more than 23 percent Thursday, hours after the athletic wear maker warned its fiscal first quarter has gotten off to a slow start amid a sea of drab clothes. Specifically, weak store traffic and fewer online purchases are setting the chain up for its first quarterly comparable sales decline since the recession. The news was an abrupt pivot from its fourth-quarter performance, when both sales and earnings posted double-digit gains. At least four analysts on Thursday downgraded the company's shares, citing concerns about its about-face. Lululemon's warning added to concerns about a slowdown in the athletic apparel market, which has also been seen in recent results from Under Armour and Nike. The company's shares were on pace for their second worst day of trading in history. ""In what should have been a fairly tame print from Lululemon (holiday sales [were] already pre-announced), their fourth-quarter results uncovered several issues that are likely to create an overhang on the stock for the foreseeable future,"" Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow told investors. Boruchow on Thursday downgraded Lululemon's shares to market perform from outperform. Among those issues are that its steep drop-off occurred both in stores and online. Lululemon CEO Laurent Potdevin attributed the deceleration to a bland assortment that lacked color, and uninspiring presentation of the products on its website. On a call with investors outlining its results, Potdevin told investors that the steps it is taking to correct these problems are already showing results. He added that trends should improve in the second quarter and beyond as the company rolls out new sport bras and its first global marketing campaign. Yet Wall Street wasn't convinced. Given the broader slowdown in apparel sales and a crowded athletic wear market, it cautioned that Lululemon's optimism is likely premature. And after steadily driving its gross margin higher over the past several quarters, that metric is expected to be flat during the current fiscal year. Despite Lululemon's near-term shakiness, the company reiterated that it's on track to double its 2015 revenue and earnings by 2020. Analysts were likewise more optimistic about its prospects longer term, noting its white space in the U.S., internationally and within its menswear business. ""Lululemon has significant room to grow the brand,"" Citi analyst Paul Lejuez said in a research note while downgrading the stock to neutral from buy. ""However, the path to long-term growth is not as visible against the backdrop of the current weakness."" Lululemon shares are down more than 21 percent this year.

Nick Wells,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Officials at the Federal Reserve want to start winding down the massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet the central bank has built up. The news came Wednesday when minutes from the Federal Open Markets Committee's March meeting were released. During that meeting, the members of the committee voted to raise the federal funds rate a quarter of a point, the third such hike since the financial crisis. The Fed built up the behemoth balance sheet over the past decade through several rounds of quantitative easing, buying up bonds and mortgage-backed securities and has been discussing how to wind it down. When you're talking about numbers that high, things get out of perspective. We thought we'd help out and show you what $4.5 trillion could buy. For one thing, the Fed could buy up most of the companies in the S&P 500. A full 315 individual companies, when counting from the bottom of the list by market capitalization. That includes well-known names like Viacom, Clorox and Expedia. On the other end, the Fed's spending spree could purchase the top 10 companies: everything from Apple to Wells Fargo. That includes a lot of big outfits like Amazon, Alphabet and Exxon Mobil. But the Fed maybe should have wound down its balance sheet years ago: A previous CNBC analysis showed that in December 2015, it could have afforded the 14 biggest companies in the index. ""Provided that the economy continued to perform about as expected, most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the committee's reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year,"" the March minutes said. The Fed's balance sheet is around 24 percent of U.S. GDP, which is far above the historical average of around 6 percent. But other industrialized nations have asset-to-GDP ratios that are much higher. The Fed's total assets have plateaued in recent years while those of other central banks like Japan and the European Union have continued to rise. In terms of sales, the Fed's assets are worth about nine times the annual sales of Wal-Mart, which led the S&P 500 last year. It's equal to the total sales of the top 33 companies, or the bottom 441 on that list. ",What can the Fed buy with its behemoth balance sheet?
John Melloy,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Kimberly Greenberger, Morgan Stanley's retail guru, said the department store business model anchored in malls is fundamentally flawed in this online era, yet there is a group of brick-and-mortar retailers that can still thrive. ""If a retail store simply sells other people's brands that's a business model that's more at risk ...  because Amazon and some of the other pure-play retailers can sell other people's brands potentially better,"" Greenberger told Mike Santoli in an exclusive interview for CNBC PRO. But the off-price retailers should do well, she said. ""They really perform an inventory clearance function and most of the brands that need to clear inventory don't want to see that inventory show up online so there's a real need for these stores and they serve a real purpose and they also help the brands clear out their mistakes,"" she said, noting the firm has a buy rating on Ross Stores and Burlington Stores and an equal-weight rating on TJX because of this trend.

Robert Ferris,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"SpaceX's reusable rockets could open up the satellite business for smaller companies. Elon Musk's space exploration company launched and successfully landed its first recycled Falcon 9 rocket Thursday night: Tweet from SpaceX If the reusable rockets deliver on their promise to lower launch costs by up to 30 percent, it could push growth in a few key areas of the satellite market. SpaceX's current base launch price of $62 million for a Falcon 9 rocket is already solid discount over its competitors. But the price is still a bit too high for smaller companies wanting to send satellites into space. Bringing the cost closer to $40 million leaves the door open for a broader array of satellites at different orbital levels, serving different needs. It would be especially effective if SpaceX's few competitors begin adopting its cost-saving measures. ""It would open up the ecosystem to satellite companies that can't afford these high costs,"" said Andrew DeGasperi, an analyst with Macquarie. ""In my mind, that is probably going to increase the number of players in orbit, probably going to increase competition, probably going to drive costs down across the board."" Particularly notable are an emerging crop of satellite providers that are launching constellations of tens or even hundreds of satellites into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Unlike the further-out geostationary orbit, where many established satellite companies operate, LEO satellites do not orbit in a fixed position above the planet. Instead, they glide above the planet's surface. But getting adequate coverage requires a massive constellation of those satellites — sometimes numbering in the hundreds. This will require a lot of launches, even if several satellites can be launched on the same rocket. For example, satellite communication provider OneWeb plans to send a constellation of nearly 700 satellites into Low Earth Orbit, Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Spinola said in an interview with CNBC. The company plans to use its constellation to provide internet service to individuals no matter where they are on Earth. SpaceX also plans to launch its own constellation of around 4,200 LEO satellites, and Samsung has its own plan for a constellation of 4,600. ""There is a number of innovations you need to make these LEO constellations work, and if you can reduce the cost of these launches, that is a significant benefit,"" said Spinola said.

On Friday, the yellow metal traded at its lowest level in more than a week, and remains below its 2016 high. However, it finished the first quarter up by more than 8 percent, its best quarterly showing in a year. Todd Colvin of Ambrosino Brothers says that macro concerns are keeping him a ""gold buyer and holder,"" including a Federal Reserve embarking on a campaign to tighten monetary policy. ""It's not just U.S. growth, it's Fed policy, it's U.S. fiscal policy, it's European elections,"" he said this week on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" Colvin added that there are ""a lot of things out there that are going to keep gold bid until we get [a more stable macroeconomic outlook]."" Colvin is especially focused on the Federal Reserve's actions for the rest of the year. While the Fed has declared that up to three rate hikes are possible this year, Colvin thinks the Fed is actually facing a lot of market uncertainty that they may not be prepared for. ""I think the Fed right now is still seeing the economic and policy as glass half full without any real evidence,"" explained the trader. ""They need to get those hard data evidence numbers in, and they need to get through some of these cloudy events coming up like the French elections and more FOMC meetings in order to see where policy is really going to go."" If the Fed hikes fewer times than expected, that would be a bullish catalyst for gold, since the metal generally moves inversely to interest rates. Meanwhile, the metal's strong Q1 performance bodes well for the upcoming quarter:  Since 1990, gold has gained at least 6 percent in the first quarter of the year on 6 occasions, according to Kensho data. In the following quarter of those years, bullion trended higher 83 percent of the time, with a median return of 3.30 percent.

John Maxfield,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The past decade has been a challenge for banks, given the financial crisis and its aftermath, but one upside is that it's given investors the opportunity to see which of the nation's biggest lenders actually operate in a prudent and profitable manner as opposed to just claiming to do so. With respect to the nation's largest banks, three in particular have separated themselves from the pack: Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). These three banks have grown their book values per share, which heavily influences a bank's share prices, more than all of the other banks in their peer group: By comparison, the average bank in their peer group saw its book value per share climb by only 38%. And if you exclude these three banks, the peer group average drops to only 6%. USB Book Value (Annual Per Share) data by YCharts. What is it about these three banks that enabled them to so handily outperform their peers? The answer is twofold. First, Wells Fargo, PNC Financial, and U.S. Bancorp are three of the most efficient banks in the industry. Last year, their efficiency ratios, which measure the percent of revenue consumed by operating expenses, all came in below the standard industry benchmark of 60%, with PNC Financial leading all big banks with a 52.5% GAAP efficiency ratio in 2016. A low efficiency ratio is important because it means that a larger share of a bank's top line is available to fall to the bottom line and thereby bolster book value. It's also important because a highly efficient bank has less incentive to take shortcuts, like reducing credit standards in order to increase loan volumes, in an effort to improve profitability. The second trait that all three of these banks shared is that they largely avoided the worst excesses that fueled the subprime mortgage bubble -- things like interest-only and option-ARM mortgages. This sounds easy, but staying disciplined can be difficult because it tempers short-term profits, as the chairman and CEO wrote in Wells Fargo's 2007 shareholder letter: Because of our prudent lending to customers with less than prime credit and our decision not to make negative amortization loans, we estimate we lost between two and four percent in mortgage origination market share from 2004 to 2006. That translates into losing between $60 billion and $120 billion in mortgage originations in 2006 alone. Wells Fargo hasn't since done itself any favors, as it was revealed last September that thousands of its employees opened millions of fake accounts for customers who either didn't know about the accounts or didn't want them in the first place. But the fact remains that the California-based bank proved through the financial crisis that it knows how to manage credit risk. For investors interested in bank stocks, in turn, these three banks are a great place to begin your search. They all trade for high valuations, but the peace of mind and downside protection they seem to offer goes a long way toward earning the added premium on their share prices. ","

Rich Smith,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's been nearly a month since online brokerage Interactive Brokers Group (NYSEMKT:IBKR) announced it will be exiting the ""market making"" market for trading options. This morning, it received its reward: A downgrade from investment banker Wells Fargo. Here are three things you need to know about that. Wells Fargo's Interactive Brokers downgrade misses the big picture. Image source: Getty Images. Last year, Interactive Brokers' market-making unit generated $44 million in pre-tax profits on $190 million in revenue -- a not insubstantial 23.2% profit margin, but not quite as good a business as the company's flagship electronic brokerage, where margins average closer to 61%. Giving up the $190 million, though, says Wells Fargo, is only the start of Interactive Brokers' problems. According to the analyst, Interactive has been attributing a good chunk of its overhead costs to the market-making unit. Closing it down won't entirely eliminate those costs, but rather shift about $29 million or so in costs to what remains of Interactive Brokers' business -- without the revenue that used to offset those costs. The effect of this will be to decrease Interactive Brokers' earnings per share by about 6% going forward. Accordingly, the analyst is cutting its fiscal 2018 earnings estimate -- which was already far below estimates elsewhere on Wall Street -- to $1.55 per share. Positing a valuation of about 21 times those 2018 earnings for the stock, Wells now assigns a value of somewhere between $30 and $34 to the shares, or about $32 at the midpoint. With Interactive Brokers' stock currently costing nearly $35 a share, therefore, Wells Fargo believes the stock is overpriced -- and is downgrading it to underperform (i.e., sell). But the situation may not be as bad as Wells Fargo fears. Granted, there's no guarantee that investors will continue paying 27 times earnings to own Interactive Brokers stock. But earnings of $1.80 per share next year would be 44% better than what Interactive Brokers is earning today (about 22% annualized). Given this, it's not hard to see how investors might happily continue to pay for such a fast-growing stock. On the other hand, Wells' more conservative $1.55 estimate would represent only 24% growth (12% annualized). Final point: Let's not forget why Interactive Brokers is exiting market making in the first place. Last month, CEO Thomas Peterffy explained that the market making business is ""deteriorating."" ""Providing liquidity to sophisticated, professional synthesizers of short-term fundamental, technical and big data,"" said Petterfy, ""is not a profitable activity"" for the company anymore, while market making for ""large order internalizers"" presents a conflict of interest for Interactive Brokers that it does ""not wish to have."" Given this, Peterffy says Interactive Brokers really had no choice but to exit the business. And given that this business wasn't earning very big profit margins for Interactive Brokers in any case -- at least not relative to its much bigger electronic brokerage business -- I think it was the right call. When you get right down to it, this move is a non-issue for me. Interactive Brokers is just plain too expensive to own, with market-making or without it. ","

Bank Recent Share Price Number of Shares Berkshire Owns Value of Investment Wells Fargo $55.83 479,704,270 $26.8 Billion American Express $78.20 151,610,700 $11.9 Billion U.S. Bancorp $52.57 85,063,167 $4.5 Billion Goldman Sachs $228.41 10,959,519 $2.5 Billion Bank of New York Mellon $46.25 21,671,969 $1.0 Billion M&T Bank $154.97 5,382,040 $834 Million Source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC Filings. Current as of 12/31/2016. Image source: The Motley Fool. 1. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Wells Fargo has been a Buffett favorite for years, as the bank does a fantastic job of managing risk and running an efficient banking operation. Even after last year's ""fake accounts"" scandal, which Buffett acknowledged was a big mistake, he still refers to Wells Fargo as an ""incredible institution."" Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake represents just under 10% of all the bank's outstanding shares, and about 6.5% of Berkshire's entire market cap. To understand why, just take a look at Wells Fargo's return on assets (ROA) as compared with the rest of the largest U.S. banks over the past 10 years. WFC Return on Assets (TTM) data by YCharts 2. American Express (NYSE:AXP) Although it's not technically a ""bank stock"", credit card issuer and payment processor American Express does engage in many banking-related business activities, and is one of Berkshire's largest investments, so I felt it was important to include here. American Express is among Berkshire's five largest stock investments, and he hasn't sold a single share, even after Amex lost its Costco partnership and faced unfavorable legal decisions. Berkshire owns about 16% of the credit card giant, and has repeatedly praised the company's talented management team, as well as the competitive advantages of American Express' closed-loop payment network, valuable and well-regarded brand name, and the most affluent base of cardholders among any of the major issuers. 3. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) At first glance, U.S. Bancorp is an expensive bank stock. In fact, the bank trades for 2.1 times its book value, by far the highest valuation of any of the bank stocks on this list. However, Buffett doesn't need his stocks to be cheap, he just wants to find great companies at fair prices, and with U.S. Bank, you certainly get what you pay for. The bank is one of the most profitable and efficient operations in the entire banking industry, even topping ""rock solid"" heavyweight Wells Fargo. 4. Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) Berkshire's investment in Goldman Sachs began during the depths of the financial crisis, when Buffett agreed to a $5 billion deal to buy that amount of Goldman Sachs preferred stock with a 10% annual dividend, as well as for warrants to buy an additional $5 billion of Goldman Sachs common stock for $115 per share (the price is approximately double this amount today). The preferred stock was redeemed in April 2011, and Berkshire traded in its warrants for 43.5 million shares of Goldman, about three-fourths of which have since been sold, as you can see in the chart at the top. 5. Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Although it's a relatively small investment compared to some of the others on this list, Bank of New York Mellon is still one of Buffett's favorite banks. In fact, Berkshire added to its position in the bank in 2016, increasing its stake by 3.6%. Simply put, Bank of New York Mellon has a strong balance sheet and has been a consistently strong performer over the years (it was founded in 1784 and is America's oldest continuously operating bank). In addition, the bank has a highly diverse revenue stream, specializing in private banking, asset management, and institutional services. 6. M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) M&T Bank is a large regional institution headquartered in Buffalo, and has been a part of Berkshire's portfolio for more than two decades. The bank has been highly profitable relative to peers (see a pattern forming here?), and Buffett has tremendous respect for the bank's CEO and management team, which has grown the bank through decades of smart acquisitions. As a sidenote, I can't emphasize enough how much weight Buffet places on quality management. He literally believes that the right managers can add tremendously to a company's intrinsic value, and therefore should be an important piece of the puzzle to evaluate when choosing stocks. No discussion of Warren Buffett's bank stocks would be complete without mentioning Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). To be clear, Buffett doesn't own shares of Bank of America -- not yet, anyway. However, as the result of a savvy investment Buffett made in the wake of the financial crisis, Berkshire owns warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank for just $7.14 (Bank of America's share price is $23.85 as of this writing) at any time before September 2021. In recent shareholder letters, Buffett has all but told investors that Berkshire intends to exercise these warrants and finance, it's just a matter of when it will happen. ","
      
    Which Bank Stocks Does Warren Buffett Own? -- The Motley Fool

If there's one thing that would supercharge Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) ongoing recovery from the financial crisis, it's a higher debt rating. Not only would a higher rating reflect the bank's progress over the past eight years, but it would also lower its cost of funds and thereby boost its earnings. While there are three major ratings agencies, you only need to look at one of them to get a sense for Bank of America's opportunity for improvement. To this end, Moody's gives Bank of America's long-term debt a rating of Baa1. That rates the $2.2 trillion bank below many of its staunchest competitors. Bank Long-Term Senior Debt Ratings from Moody's U.S. Bancorp A1 Wells Fargo A2 BB&T A2 JPMorgan Chase A3 PNC Financial A3 Bank of America Baa1 Data source: U.S. Bancorp. A bank's debt ratings matter because they dictate the interest rate at which a bank can borrow money, with a higher rating translating into a lower cost of funds. Last year, for example, Bank of America borrowed nearly $230 billion on a long-term basis at an average annual rate of 2.44%. Wells Fargo, which has a higher debt rating, had roughly the same amount of long-term debt as Bank of America did, but its interest rate was only 1.6%. Translated into dollars and cents, this means that Wells Fargo spends $2 billion less a year to borrow the same amount of money as Bank of America does. The good news is that the North Carolina-based bank is headed in the right direction. At the end of January, Moody's changed its outlook on Bank of America from stable to positive, citing its improved profitability in particular: The change in outlook to positive from stable is based on Moody's view that there is an increased likelihood that Bank of America's profitability will strengthen on a sustainable basis over the next twelve to eighteen months, while the bank continues to adhere to its conservative risk profile, lowering its earnings volatility. If achieved, this would strengthen the bank's credit profile and could lead to a ratings upgrade. Moody's went on to cite Bank of America's goal to reduce expenses by an additional $3 billion by the end of 2018, as well as the benefit that rising rates will have on its top line. ""A realization of the bank's latest cost targets, combined with an increase in net interest income from higher interest rates, if achieved and sustained, should improve the bank's operating leverage and raise its profitability on a sustainable basis, strengthening the bank's credit profile,"" the ratings agency said in a recent assessment of Bank of America. This assessment tracks Moody's ratings methodology for banks, which is dictated by macroeconomic factors, a bank's unique financial profile, and qualitative adjustments. Within a bank's financial profile, moreover, Moody's balances five factors based on specific weightings: asset risk (25%), capital (25%), profitability (15%), funding structure (20%), and liquid resources (15%). Data source: Moody's. Chart by author. Given that Bank of America holds an abundance of excess capital and liquidity, as I've discussed in the past, it makes sense that Moody's (and presumably the other ratings agencies) has zeroed in on the bank's profitability as the main hurdle between it and higher ratings. This is an auspicious sign for Bank of America given that its profitability is improving, becoming more predictable, and should continue to grow in the years ahead. It earned more money last year, for instance, than in any other year in its history, with the exception of 2006. The result for current and prospective investors in Bank of America is that its continued recovery will not only impact the bank's bottom line directly, through higher revenues and lower expenses, but also indirectly, as higher debt ratings in the future should eventually reflect this improvement and thereby translate into lower borrowing costs.

    Improving This Would Really Help Bank of America -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Richard Davis is one of the greatest bankers of the modern era. As CEO of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) since the end of 2006, Davis has spent the last decade atop the most profitable big bank in America. A full transcript follows the video. John Maxfield: It's going great! How are you doing, Gaby? Lapera: I am doing really well. I was just telling Austin that I've had my first taste of adulthood and that I needed an antacid this morning. Maxfield: Oh no! [laughs] Adulthood, boo. Lapera: [laughs] I know, it's terrible. But yeah, how was your weekend? Maxfield: It was great. I have twin five year olds, so it's like going to the zoo for two days and hanging out in the lion's den. I don't know how my wife does it. Maxfield: Oh, wow. Lapera: I know, right? Talking about other people who have had big accomplishments, you did an interview with the U.S. [Bancorp] CEO, Richard Davis. Davis is actually stepping down from his position soon, but it's a really well thought-out, long-planned move, much like everything Davis has done before. But, this is a really good time to talk to him, and talk to him about how he saw his role at one of America's best banks. Maxfield: Yeah, and if you think about it, to put Richard Davis in perspective, U.S. Bank is the fifth-largest commercial bank in the United States. Why would you dedicate a whole podcast to U.S. Bancorp? If you're in banking, you would know. But if you're not in banking, the big question is, ""Why would you do that?"" And the answer is twofold. First, Davis, if you just think about the greatest bankers of our generation, you have Robert Wilmers at M&T Bank, you have Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase, you have a guy named William Demchak at PNC Financial, and you have Richard Davis. Richard Davis is literally one of the greatest bankers of the current generation. So, what can we learn from him? We are all investors. What can investors learn about being able to identify not only really good bankers, but also really good banks to invest in? Lapera: Yeah. A little background on Richard Davis, Davis started at U.S. Bancorp in 2006, 10 years ago, when everything was rosy and great for the banking industry, and it turned around pretty quickly, as I think most listeners know. U.S. Bancorp sailed through the financial crisis without much of a problem. In fact, they managed to take their solidity through the financial crisis and grow and outperform a bunch of other banks, which is a very impressive thing to do, when everyone else around you is failing, for you to be like, ""I'm fine, and not only am I fine, but I'm going to do great."" Maxfield: One clarification, in December of 2006 was when he was promoted to CEO. Davis has actually been with U.S. Bancorp for a little bit longer, because he was part of that original group -- there was a transformative merger in 2000 between Firststar and U.S. Bancorp that then created the U.S. Bancorp that we know today. And Richard Davis was kind of the No. 2 guy in that deal, and he finished his ascent through the ranks, and in December 2006 is when he took over. To your point, when he took over, U.S. Bancorp was already one of the most profitable banks in the country, and everything looked absolutely fantastic to them. But it was not too long after that that all dominos started tumbling in the financial crisis. Most banks, over 500 banks, failed during and after the financial crisis. And the banks that didn't fail, a lot of them got picked up for pennies on the dollar by better-positioned banks. And the banks that either didn't fail or didn't get acquired by better-positioned banks really struggled in the financial crisis, and lost a lot of money, like Bank of America and Citigroup. U.S. Bancorp was one of those few banks that didn't fail, wasn't picked up for pennies on the dollar by a competitor, didn't suffer enormous losses, and actually, to your point, emerged from the financial crisis in a stronger competitive position relative to its peers than it entered it. Maxfield: And here's one of the interesting questions -- he's 59, and he's run one of the best-run banks in the country for a decade, and he's retiring at 59. The question is, why would you retire so early? And this has not been confirmed by U.S. Bank. In fact, they've actually come out and denied that this is the case. But there are credible reports that he's being considered for a position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Not only is this relevant to investors, because they want to know about how to pick good banks, but it's also relevant because he could be one of the main financial policymakers în the country. And, to be perfectly honest with you, let me disclose my bias, I think he would be a fantastic person to join the Federal Reserve board. Lapera: He also strikes me as the type of person who doesn't retire well. Shout-out to my mom, who has now retired three times, and is currently in New York working for American Express. [laughs] But, let's get into some of the things he said -- The second point is, if you look at the annual growth in its book value per share, which is really the thing that's going to drive the underlying value of bank stock, the rate of growth of its book value per share has accelerated after the crisis relative to before it. This is not to say that it performed as well as it did in normal times during the financial crisis, because its profitability was not as high during the financial crisis. But that's expected. Banks aren't going to make quite as much money in times like that. But, it has come out of that so much stronger. Lapera: Yeah, and that's why we're so excited to talk about your interview with him today. He's really an underappreciated, at least among regular people, shining light in the banking industry. Let's dig into this interview. Do you want to talk metrics or constituencies first? Maxfield: I think we should talk constituencies first. I think his point was a really valuable point, not only just for bank investors, but for investors in general. Lapera: Yeah, definitely. One of the things that Richard Davis talked about in your interview is that there are a lot of different constituencies. In fact, he says, ""Our main constituents are our customers, shareholders, employees, analysts, and the ratings agencies."" It's really interesting, because he says that the most important of those constituents are the rating agencies. Maxfield: Right. So, you have each of these constituents. So, think the CEO of such a big bank, and he's also the chairman, so there is no one above him at the bank, per se. But that doesn't mean he doesn't have constituencies that he has the answer to. The complication with those constituencies is, some of them have different objectives than other of the constituencies. So the question is: How do you balance those? And let me give you a very precise example, the analyst community. These are people, men and women who look at companies, look at their fundamental performance, look at the valuation of their stock, and try to determine and give advice to other investors on whether these companies are buy, hold, or sell. Everybody knows what analysts are. But the problem with analysts is, they are focused on what's happening right now. Lapera: Yeah, in the short term. Maxfield: Right. And quite frankly, you could expand that a little bit more and say that they're actually interested in what happened last quarter. Because they're outsiders, they don't have access to inside data. So, the only data they get is data that is historical. So, when U.S. Bancorp reports its quarterly reports or annual report, that's when the analysts actually get to see the data. But the ratings agencies, they're more interested in long-term stability. They're trying to say, ""This is a company that bondholders can buy and not have to worry about them defaulting on their debt."" And the other thing with ratings agencies that's really critical to understand about ratings agencies, both for banks and investing in any type of company is, these are insiders. A point that Richard Davis made to me on the phone was, he can basically show a person from a ratings agency anything that he would show Andy Cecere, who is going to take over as CEO in April at the meeting. So, the rating agencies, not only do they have the same long-term perspective that U.S. Bancorp does, and conservative philosophy toward banking in order to be safe and sound, but they also have the best data about U.S. Bancorp's not only current performance -- and I mean, like, today's performance -- but also its projections for revenue over the next 90 days. Lapera: Yeah, it's definitely really interesting. I think his biggest point in here is, he has all these constituencies. Like any politician, he wants to keep them all happy, but many of them have conflicting interests. You have these ratings agencies that dictate -- and the reason the ratings agencies are so important is they dictate how good of a credit risk the bank is, so that dictates how cheaply the bank can borrow money. Which is huge. And you want to keep them extra happy. That's why, for him, they're the most important people. But then you also have these analysts that are going to say whether or not you think the bank is a buy right now, and like you said, they don't have access to all the same data that the credit agencies do. So, it's kind of this crazy dance. The bank obviously wants to outperform, and that's what the analysts are really happy with. But then, you have credit agencies and they see you outperforming, and they're like, ""How are you doing that? Are you sure that's sustainable? Are you going to be a good credit risk going forward? Are you doing anything hinky to outperform?"" I don't think that they say the word ""hinky,"" that might just be me, [laughs] but you get what I'm saying. Maxfield: Have you been taping their meetings, Gaby? [laughs] The other point is, to dig into that low debt rating -- underlying his entire idea that the rating agencies are the most important constituency is this link between your credit rating or your debt rating as an institution and the price that you can borrow money at, the interest rate that you can borrow money at. It's no different than for us. If I have a bad credit rating and you have a great credit rating, Gaby, and you and I both go to buy a house, and we both go to apply for a mortgage, you're going to get a better interest rate on your mortgage than I'm going to get. It's the same exact thing with the banks. So, why does this matter? It matters because, we've talked about this on the show before, if you think about what banks do, fundamentally, all they do is buy money for as inexpensively as they can, either by getting depositors or by going out and borrowing money from institutional investors on a short or long-term basis, and then they turn around and sell that money at a higher price by loaning it out, or buying higher-yielding government securities. The goal is to maximize that gap. If you're getting your money -- because, U.S. Bancorp has the best debt rating in the bank industry, which means it can get its money at the lowest possible rate of any of its competitors -- it means that gap is not only larger, so it's making more money, but it also gives it leeway to go out and negotiate with the best-performing, most creditworthy customers, to then bring into your loan book, which also decreases your loan losses in the future. So, you have that immediate impact of lower-cost funds, the longer-term impact of lower loan losses. Lapera: And you have these customers, the reason these customers are so valuable, the ones that are going to decrease your loan losses because they're going to pay on time, they're also very savvy, so, they're looking for someone with low interest rates, which U.S. Bancorp can offer because they borrowed the money at such a low rate. The other thing I want to mention really quick is it's technically not a zero-sum game. There can be multiple companies with the best credit rating. But it's very difficult to attain. Maxfield: Yeah. And another point that Davis made about the credit rating is, going into the crisis, everyone assumed the banks were safe. We went through some pretty hairy times during the 1970s and 1980s in the banking industry. But other than that, in the last eight or nine decades since the Great Depression, it's been relatively quiet. But the financial crisis made them realize and made them become much more discerning customers. So, what they use to direct which bank to go toward, in terms of bringing their deposits, is the bank's credit rating, because it's supposed to suggest whether they're safe and sound. So, what's interesting is that, to build off those things it gained in the financial crisis, in the five years after the financial crisis, 2008 to 2012, its deposits grew on an organic basis -- not through acquisitions, but just through more companies and people bringing their money to U.S. Bancorp -- by a double-digit percentage in five consecutive years. It is the only large bank that is even close to that. There are other banks that grew their deposits by double-digit percentages one or two years, but none that grew it at that rate for five consecutive years. Lapera: Yeah. And that's part of the reason why, when you look at their valuation now, it's so much higher compared to other banks, even after the little Trump bump where you saw all banks go up 30% in a quarter. U.S. Bancorp is still rated among investors as one of the most sought-after banks, one of the most valuable banks. Which brings us to the third set of stakeholders. You have these analysts who want these short-term results, you have these credit agencies who are really worried about long-term functioning, and in the third camp grouped with the credit agencies but operating in a different level in terms of the bank are the investors, who also want to see long-term results, but who are also interested in the short-term results. It's this balance that he has to keep everyone happy. Maxfield: But here's the interesting thing about U.S. Bancorp shareholders. Shareholders are not all the same. You have some shareholders that are day traders, you have some shareholders that are long-term investors, you have some that are value long-term investors, you have some that are growth long-term investors. The particular type of investor that U.S. Bancorp gets just so happens to be very similar to the type of investors that Warren Buffett gets. In fact, Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, is one of U.S. Bancorp's largest shareholders. These investors are value-oriented on a long-term basis, they're looking for long-term growth. You have a really convenient alignment for U.S. Bancorp between both its own conservative operating philosophy, the perspective of its long-term shareholders, and the perspective of ratings agencies. You put all those things together in U.S. Bancorp and you add it with its performance metrics, and right now it's in an almost unassailable competitive position. Lapera: Definitely. I'm just going to move us along, because we're starting to run out of time. Let's talk about efficiency ratios. What is an efficiency ratio? Very easy question for you. Maxfield: Efficiency ratio, this just measures the percentage of revenue that a bank spends on operating expenses. Lapera: Yes. So, the lower the efficiency ratio, the better. Most banks shoot for an efficiency ratio of around 60%. Drumroll. I don't think you can hear that. [laughs] Maxfield: It's a very quiet drum. [laughs] Lapera: What is U.S. Bancorp's efficiency ratio? Maxfield: U.S. Bancorp's efficiency ratio last year, its GAAP efficiency ratio, which is just taking your non-interest expenses, so, your operating expenses divided by net revenue, was 55%. Lapera: That's really good, for people who don't know. Amongst the other top big banks, you have Bank of America sitting at 66%, Wells Fargo and Citi both around 59%, JPMorgan around 58%, and those are the big banks. In general, they operate pretty well. Below the eighth-largest bank, most banks' efficiency ratios are pretty above 60%. There is an exception. I think New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) might be the country's 25th biggest bank, but it's doing this thing where it's been sitting around $48.9 billion in assets so it doesn't trip the regulatory threshold for having more regulations put on it. And its efficiency ratio is abnormally low at 44.5%. It's a really interesting bank because of the niche that it lives in, it lends primarily to people in New York City, to people who are looking for multifamily residences -- read that as apartment buildings. New York City is a great place to do that because of rent control. You know that your building is always going to be full of tenants, and you know those tenants are going to pay on time because they're living in some of the cheapest apartments in the city, and that means landlords always make their payments. And since New York Community Bancorp is operating in this very special environment, its costs are much lower, and its income is much more reliable than other banks, hence the very low efficiency ratio. Barring that, 55% is incredible. Maxfield: Yeah, 55%, it's incredible, because U.S. Bancorp is more of a general-purpose bank. But I'm glad you brought up a New York Community Bancorp, because it illustrates a really important point. Let me pull up a little bit and give a broader perspective, and then we'll dig in a little bit more. I think it was in his 1990 shareholder letter, or 1991, where Warren Buffett -- and, I talk about Warren Buffett a lot in terms of banking because he really understands banking, perhaps more than anybody, but those great bankers I listed at the beginning of the show, Warren Buffett understands it more. He says, ""If you want to outperform in an industry that is highly commoditized, like banking is, two things have to be the case. Either one, you have to have a niche product and earn outsized margins because you have expertise in that particular area that nobody else has; or, you have to be the low-cost producer. That New York Community Bancorp, it's in that niche area, and that's why it's been able to outperform the industry so much over the last few decades. Here's what's so interesting about what Richard Davis has to say about the efficiency ratio and how that plays into how Warren Buffett sees banking. Richard Davis says, ""You don't drive efficiency through lowering expenses. You drive efficiency through increasing your revenue."" There's a great quote, let me pull that up. He says, ""He who has the lowest efficiency ratio also often has the biggest revenue, which is in the denominator."" And this is true. If you look at, not the efficiency ratio, but if you actually look at expenses as a percentage of assets, U.S. Bancorp's expenses as a percentage of assets is actually higher than a lot of these other big banks. But its revenue as a percentage of assets is much, much higher on a relative basis, relative to its expenses. That's why its efficiency ratio is so low. So then you say, ""Look, how do you get your efficiency ratio so low?"" And the answer to that, in U.S. Bancorp's case, is twofold. Number one, and this ties back into Buffett's point, Richard Davis says, ""You have to go after businesses where,"" let me give you exactly what he said. ""A bank needs to look at what it does and get into businesses where it can, one, be better than everyone else, two, where it has skills that no one else has, or three, where it can outperform its own history."" He's basically saying, ""Look, Warren Buffett's paradigm,"" and I don't think he meant to say like this, but this is how I look at it, ""Warren Buffett's paradigm where if you want to outperform, you either have to be a niche operator or the low-cost operator, those two things are not mutually exclusive. In fact, you can be a low-cost operator by running it through a niche operation, because that will jack up your revenue and make your efficiency ratio go down."" Lapera: Yeah. I think the point he's driving at is, it's OK to spend money on expenses, too, because that means your underwriting quality is really strong, and that helps drive higher revenue. Maxfield: And another point he makes is, you can't be dogmatic about these types of things. Because the banking industry is in such a tough revenue environment because interest rates are so low, the question is, do you then starve innovation and investment and stuff like that just in order to get a couple basis points here or there on your efficiency ratio? Or do you continue to invest? One of the things he says is, ""When we think about efficiency, we run it through this idea of return on investment. We're not going to starve off expenses just for the sake of starving off expenses. What we're going to do is, if you want to go out and spend money,"" this is, like, Richard Davis talking to his folks, ""that's fine, but you have to have the numbers that the returns are going to be there."" So, what they do is, these people who have these ideas, they go in front of these committees that determine if they want to make these investments. But again, it all goes back to this idea that, if you want a really low efficiency ratio, running it through the expense side may actually not be the most effective. You want to run it through your revenue side. You can do that by thinking about making sure that you're making always very good, profitable investments. Lapera: Yes. I actually want to get into some words you said earlier, which is, the importance of being flexible and non-dogmatic. That's kind of a recurring theme in the interview you had with him, and it's related to everything to do with from the financial crisis to whether or not investors should buy at certain times. Lapera: Which, I'm guessing, made analysts freak out, because they're like, ""What's wrong with the bank?"" Maxfield: Yeah, that's exactly right! Analysts were like, ""Whoa, are you hiding something in your portfolio?"" And he was saying, ""Look, banks are still growing their loan portfolios right now. When you're growing your loan portfolio, the responsible thing to do is to increase your provisions, because even the best-run banks, once in a while, experience loan losses, and you want to provision ahead of that to be prepared for those loan losses."" And he's saying, ""We're just doing the responsible thing. You want to prepare for crises ahead of them, as opposed to waiting until they actually strike."" But again, that goes back to that point that analysts, because provisions act on your income in the same way that expenses do, analysts don't want to see those provisions go up. So, they're thinking, again, about either right now, the short term, or, looking in hindsight, whereas Richard Davis, and other great bankers and investors and business people are constantly looking forward. Lapera: Right. And the dogma in this case that he's ignoring is the analysts' idea that if your bank is growing really quickly, that's great, and you should just continue putting more resources into growing loans as opposed to putting resources into protecting yourself from potential future failure. That's the thing, that's what he's trying to get at when he says, ""Don't be dogmatic, don't just stick to what everyone thinks you should do. You should do what you think is right."" Maxfield: That's right. And let me expand on that point you made, because I think I answered a different question than you asked me. In the investment space, where that dogma comes into play -- at The Motley Fool, we're really against market timing, because there are studies that show if you're a day trader or someone who is exclusively focused on timing the markets, you're going to underperform the markets. You may as well dollar-cost average into a low-cost exchange-traded fund that tracks the broader market. That's the best way to do it, if you think you're going to scoot in and out. That's the general rule -- you don't want to turn the market. However, there are exceptions to that. If stocks are indisputably really high, if you think they are, you might want to tailor back the rate of your investments at that time period, and wait until correction, because historically, corrections happen once a year. A correction is, if something drops 10% or more in the market. As a general rule, again, dogmatically, you want to avoid timing the market. However, there are exceptions, because you also want to be aware of where the market is at in one particular time, because you may want to change the rate of your investment, depending on where the market is at. Lapera: Yeah, absolutely. There's definitely a lot more interesting stuff that we can talk about in this interview, but I know that you're actually writing an article or two about this, right? Maxfield: I am, yeah, there's going to be a few things coming out here pretty soon. Stay tuned. It's a good article, it's coming together really great. Lapera: Yeah. And if you guys want that article, definitely email us at industryfocus@fool.com, or by tweeting us at MFIndustryFocus. But if you email us, I will definitely respond a lot faster, because I don't really know how to use the Twitter, despite being a young person. Although, maybe not, I had to use an antacid this morning, so who knows? As usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Thanks so much for joining us, John! Thank you to Richard Davis, if you happen to listen to our humble podcast, for letting John interview you. And, thanks to the listeners for letting us natter on for so long. Happy birthday to my favorite producer, Austin Morgan. Austin, how old are you? Austin Morgan: The ripe old age of 26. Lapera: Oh my god. Maxfield: Oh, you are a spring chicken, Austin. Lapera: [laughs] I hope you have a great birthday. Thanks to everyone for listening, and I hope everyone has a great week!

    When a Giant Retires: A Chat About U.S. Bancorp's Richard Davis -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. Carrying credit card balances is not a smart financial move, as the interest rates card issuers charge increase exponentially the cost of whatever it is you bought. Yet according to the Federal Reserve, carry balances we do -- Americans had almost $1 trillion worth in 2016, up 6.5% from the prior year. The folks at WalletHub analyzed user search patterns and application statistics in order to identify the most popular credit cards. While most cards may be the ones you'd expect to find, a couple definitely will raise an eyebrow or two. Source: Best Buy. With consumer electronics suffering a 6% decline in sales over the past 12 months, having Best Buy pop up at the top of this list may raise some eyebrows, not least because the electronics retailer also saw domestic revenue decline 1.2% for the year and consumer electronics represent 34% of sales. Yet the Best Buy credit card also accounted for nearly a quarter of all the sales it made in 2016, or 23%. It did enjoy a 5% increase in comparable sales in the consumer electronics department, second only to appliances, which enjoyed a near-8% increase. So it seems consumers really weren't buying consumer electornics products all that much last year, but when they did, they went to Best Buy to do it, and apparently used its credit card to finance the purchases. However, while you can earn 5% back on purchases made with the Best Buy card, WalletHub notes all four Best Buy cards feature deferred interest, which means interest on purchases is retroactively applied to your entire original purchase amount if you're late paying your bill or don't repay the full balance by the end of the low-rate introductory period. Image source: Wal-Mart. Is anyone shocked that the world's biggest retailer also ranked very highly on the popularity charts for credit cards? Wal-Mart came in second, but WalletHub notes it's best for online purchases where you can earn up to 3% back while in-store purchases only garner you a 1% benefit. Wal-Mart notes its e-commerce offerings have also enjoyed strong growth, as it has invested substantial sums of money into building out the service. Including both its purchase of Jet.com and its online grocery options, Wal-Mart's e-commerce business grew 29% even as store growth expanded by less than 2%. Image source: Gap. Old Navy is Gap's largest retail concept and the only one that's experiencing any growth at all. Sales totaled $6.9 billion in 2016, ahead of the $5.4 billion generated by Gap stores themselves, and the only concept that saw positive comp growth for the year. Same-store sales rose 1% at Old Navy and fell everywhere else. What consumers might like about the Old Navy card is rewards can be earned at any of Gap's stores, including the namesake stores, Banana Republic, or Athleta, and it gives you some special sign-up bonuses and cash-back deals. What's not so sweet is the lack of an introductory rate and a higher-than-average APR that can really hurt if you don't pay your bill in full. Image source: Sears Holdings. Considering Sears Holdings is reportedly on the brink of bankruptcy, it's surprising so many people are looking to sign up for this credit card. While it's possible they're hoping to rack up charges on going-out-of-business sales, it just may be cardholders are more interested in the retailer's Shop Your Way member loyalty program, the centerpiece of CEO Eddie Lampert's integrated plan to connect how consumers shop. The program awards points for purchases that can be used toward future purchases, and not all the purchases have to be made at Sears or Kmart. There are over 11,000 partners in the program, including ride-sharing app Uber, Burger King, movie ticket site Fandango, even grocers. The Sears MasterCard is the core credit card of the Shop Your Way Platform. Sears' credit card, however, has an even higher APR than Old Navy, according to WalletHub. It's 25.74%, and that's if you have good or excellent credit, which you need to have to get the card in the first place. Image source: Getty Images. DIY center Home Depot has ridden the housing market boom higher, reporting a 7% increase in sales in 2016 to $95 billion, and it's expected housing will have another good year in 2017, though not as robust as it was last year. The National Association of Realtors predicts a 1.9% increase in home sales, as there will be a large number of first-time homebuyers entering the market in 2017, and that means they'll be turning to big-box stores like Home Depot to fix up, refresh, repair, and furnish their homes. Home Depot is forecasting sales and comps growth of 4.6% each this year, and likely a good portion of that will be put on its credit cards, since these are typically big-ticket purchases. Yet like we've seen with more than a few of the credit cards on this list, Home Depot charges really high rates, as much as 26.99%, so you're getting no bargain. Image source: Lowe's. Similar to Home Depot, big-box DIY rival Lowe's also ranked among the top 10 most popular credit cards, and for many of the same reasons. The company enjoyed a 10% increase in sales last year and a 4% rise in comps, yet 2017 might prove to be better for it as Lowe's generates more sales from appliances and fashion fixtures than does its orange competitor. Some 11% of sales come from the former category and 10% from the latter, while Home Depot generates just 7% of sales from appliances. In fact, Lowe's is the largest appliance retailer in the country, followed by Home Depot , which overtook Sears last year for second place. Best Buy comes in fourth. That could be why Lowe's credit card is a popular choice for consumers. Still, it has an APR just as high as its DIY rival, though it does give you generous 5% rewards on purchases. Image source: Banana Republic. Another Gap concept, Banana Republic came in seventh on the list, but it's a business in a long, steady decline, with comparable sales plunging 7% in 2016 (although that's slightly better than the 10% drop it suffered the year before). Analysts say it has struggled because it lacks an identity with consumers, or has one that is otherwise forgettable. Coupled with high prices in a period where cheap, fast-fashion retailers like H&M and Century 21 rule, the retail concept has been spiraling down for some time. Like the Old Navy card, the Banana Republic credit card can earn rewards at any of Gap's four concepts, and though it has a high APR, it does offer a few benefits like the equivalent of 5% cash back that makes it understandable why it would be a popular choice even if consumers don't seem to be using it all that much at the store these days. Image source: Gap. Finally, Gap itself shows up on the list, and it carries with it all the advantages and drawbacks that both Old Navy and Banana Republic carry. Since it doesn't matter which store brand card you have, it may be why the most popular brand in the portfolio is also the most popular card. And with Gap also on a multiyear slide in comparable sales, its card may not move higher in the ranks any time soon. Image source: Getty Images. If there's one trait that's common among the cards, it's that brick-and-mortar retailers are ailing these days, and Macy's is no different. It's closed down numerous stores and plans to close 100 over the next few years as sales shrink and move online. Yet unlike most of its rivals, Macy's actually owns a bank subsidiary, FDS Bank, that provides credit processing, collections, customer service, and marketing for all of its own credit card accounts as well as those from Department Stores National Bank, a subsidiary of Citibank.

The regulator also ordered Wells to pay the unidentified banker $5.4 million in damages. “It was alleged that this is what he reported to his supervisor, something he believed was going on, and as a result of reporting it, he was retaliated against,” Goto said. The case isn’t related to other whistleblower complaints and class-actions lawsuits that have sprung up after it was revealed last year that Wells Fargo engaged in a years-long scam to open up millions of fake accounts and credit cards in people’s names in order to boost sales numbers. That scandal led directly to the ousting last October of then-Chief Executive John Stumpf. Wells Fargo has 30 days to appeal Labor’s ruling. It indicated it is considering fighting the decision. “We take seriously the concerns of current and former team members,” Vince Scanlon, a bank spokesman, said in a statement. Read:  Wells Fargo agrees to $110 million settlement of class-action suit “This decision is a preliminary order and to date there has been no hearing on the merits of this case,” Scanlon said. “We disagree with the findings and will be requesting a full hearing of the matter.” The case is the OSHA’s largest-ever individual award for a person who claimed he was retaliated against, in part because his pay was already so high, Goto said.

Maria LaMagna,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Mar 31, 2017 7:59 a.m. ET Many merchants and ATM owners have still not upgraded their machines By Bad news for anyone who was hoping “chip” debit and credit cards would save us from ATM hacking. We still have a long way to go. The number of debit and credit cards that were compromised at U.S. ATMs and stores rose 70% in 2016, according to an analysis by the analytics and data company Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO). The company works with financial institutions to alert them about potentially compromised cards and analyzed all of the hundreds of thousands of ATMs and card readers it monitors to find out how widespread fraud was last year. The number of times ATMs and merchant devices were compromised also rose 30%. (That said, it was better than 2015, when the number of times increased more than 500%). Although merchants and ATMs have been gradually upgraded to require EMV, or “chip” cards, many merchants and ATM owners have still not done so, said TJ Horan, vice president of fraud solutions at FICO. EMV stands for “Europay, MasterCard and Visa,” three companies that collaborated to create the technology. These kinds of cards, experts say, cut down on fraud because many fraudsters attempt to copy credit cards with magnetic stripes by placing “skimmers” on devices where they are swiped. Cards with chips create a unique code banks use during every transaction to verify the payment, so they are not vulnerable to skimming in the same way. Oct. 1, 2015, was the first day of a “liability” shift for credit cards; it meant that the party that hadn’t switched to chip card technology (either the financial institution that issued a card, or a merchant) would become liable for counterfeit fraud on that card. And starting Oct. 1, 2016,that responsibility also fell on owners of ATMs who haven’t made the shift to chip cards. But the deadline for switching to EMV technology on automatic gas pumps isn’t until October 2020, meaning gas pumps are one spot at risk of being tampered with, Horan said. During this transition period, technology for creating skimming devices has become better and cheaper, Horan said. Don’t miss: Why that scuzzy ATM in the back of your favorite dive bar is about to disappear There was some good news in the report. Technology for detecting hacked ATMs and merchants has also improved. As a result, in 2016, the average amount of time an ATM or merchant device was compromised was 11 days, down from 14 days in 2015. There are warnings signs for consumers. Horan said people should be wary of any ATMs or merchants’ devices that are hard to fit a card into. Those may be compromised with skimmers, he said. Consumers should frequently check their bank and credit card accounts to be sure they don’t see any fraudulent charges, said Adam Levin, the chairman and co-founder of Credit.com and the author of “Swiped,” a book about scamming and identity theft. He also suggested signing up for email and text-message alerts from financial institutions; some will notify consumers every single time they make a payment, which can make keeping track of transactions easier. Some banks are updating their ATMs so customers can actually log into them using their smartphone. In other words, no card is required to access them, in another attempt to cut down on fraud.

Rachel Koning Beals,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Apr 1, 2017 1:23 p.m. ET Income inequality, easy lending from bank rivals are problems, UBS strategists stress By Subprime auto-loan default rates match those seen just before the 2007-2009 recession. It’s a red flag that’s been flapping for some time for analysts worried it could pose risks to the broader credit market, bank health and, ultimately, the consumer-driven economy. Those concerns have been offset, in part, by other considerations: strength in loans to higher-credit individuals and a growing economy’s potential to buffer a strained lending market for the lowest-rated, or subprime, borrowers. Plus, some temporary factors are at work, such as a delay in personal tax refunds that could crimp consumers’ ability to make their car payments on time, but only for a short time. UBS analysts Matthew Mish and Stephan Caprio, in a Thursday note, don’t see subprime auto loans as an immediate threat to financial stability, but they see plenty of reasons for concern. Namely, the pay gap between low- and moderate-income workers and their higher-income counterparts is only widening while the credit available to those bringing home thinner paychecks remains abundant. New York Federal Reserve researchers, in December, counted up some 6 million Americans delinquent with car payments, and predicted that number would only worsen. Concerns were elevated in part by the latest reading for the National Automobile Dealers Association used-vehicle price index, down 8% year over year through February. Financed used-car ownership is more common among lower-credit-rated drivers. Borrowers are also taking out longer loans, in fact the longest on record, Experian reported. Read: 5 reasons to say no to 72- and 84-month auto loans Analysts, including the authors of the UBS note, have stressed the impact on the auto-lending market from an increased proportion of “deep-subprime” borrowers, as well as comparatively lax underwriting practices across nonbank lenders that include auto finance companies, captive finance firms (a company subsidiary meant to provide financing to customers buying the parent company’s product) and credit unions and thrifts. Read: Auto-loan market stuck on risky ‘trade-in treadmill,’ says Moody’s Credit-rating firms and market participants have been scrambling to explain subprime default rates for recent vintages (loans made in 2015, 2016) that have now reached levels consistent with those originated just before the 2007-09 recession (see graphic below). Mish and Caprio don’t take the nonbank involvement lightly, especially within the context of the overall health of the car-loan market. They note that a net 23% of U.S. banks forecast that U.S. consumer loan delinquencies (of which a significant share is auto related) would increase in 2017, according to the latest Fed Senior Loan Officer Survey. “This would be the highest share of banks since 2007. Given that banks have focused their lending activities on prime borrowers [those with stronger credit scores], any worsening in higher-quality customers bodes poorly for subprime loans originated by non-banks,” Mish and Caprio wrote. Banks are responding accordingly to worsening credit conditions that include falling car prices and dwindling loan-to-value (how much is still owed on the car compared with its resale value), Fitch Ratings has noted. But banks’ caution is only costing them more lost customers to captive auto finance companies and credit unions. Notably, subprime auto loans are a much smaller slice of overall subprime lending than mortgages (one of the leading culprits in the financial crisis). Auto loans make up $179 billion of the over $1.2 trillion subprime debt total. It’s also easier to unload cars than houses. These factors have so far limited the fear of economic contagion. Don’t miss: Subprime car loans aren’t subprime mortgages yet still worry Jamie Dimon and, now, John Oliver “We do not believe this implies a pending downturn…but it is yet another data-point that investors should not overlook,” the UBS analysts said in their note. “One can add consumer delinquency trends to the sharp slowdown in bank and nonbank corporate borrowing as evidence that a growth rebound may be weaker than expected.” Analysts from firms such as Wells Fargo & Co.

                                   , the biggest underwriter of subprime auto bonds, to credit-rating agencies, including S&P Global Ratings, have noted the increasing riskiness of loans that get securitized. Weakening conditions are showing up in the specialized bond market that takes on these bundled and repackaged loans. Sixty-day delinquencies for bonds backed by deep subprime loans have risen 3 percentage points since 2012, compared with just 0.89 percentage points on all other subprime auto securities, Morgan Stanley’s Vishwanath Tirupattur, James Egan and Jeen Ng said in a research report dated March 24. “Auto loan fundamental performance, especially within ABS pools, continues to deteriorate,” the analysts said. The biggest risk, of course, lies in what’s not known, especially if the economy faces an unexpected test in the short term. “If subprime auto loan defaults are already nearing prior crisis levels, there are important questions to entertain ahead,” UBS’s Mish and Caprio emphasized. “What will they look like in a recessionary environment? What will recovery rates on defaulted auto loans be, considering they are already abnormally low? And finally, if non-banks have intermediated most of the lower quality consumer loans this cycle, will their business models, their sources of funding, and by extension their credit intermediation activities, prove resilient through a proper credit cycle?” Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

                                   late Wednesday reported fourth-quarter earnings that were below Wall Street expectations and sales that were slightly above forecast. Crucially, however, it called for lower profits and sales for the current quarter, and on a conference call with analysts following the results, Lululemon’s executives blamed the early-year miss on a Spring collection that lacked depth and color. Wall Street’s reaction was swift, weighing in with at least two stock downgrades and several price target reductions. Shares were headed for their lowest close since December 2015, and their largest percentage decrease in 8 years. Read more: Will denim steal Lululemon’s thunder? Lululemon is taking responsibility for its miscues with its spring collection, but “a lot of questions need to be answered before we can gauge the viability of a sustainable recovery,” analysts at SIG Susquehanna said in a note to clients Thursday. They downgraded the stock to neutral, saying they’d rather “step to the sidelines until visibility improves.” The company is taking action to correct its issues, adding new colors to its assortments in an effort to drive sales growth. That is likely to strengthen e-commerce sales and trends as early as April, although the company still has to contend with slow bricks-and-mortar store traffic, they said. “We appreciate the various initiatives management is putting in place to reaccelerate revenue anddrive margin, but we are not fully convinced they will all work,” the Susquehanna analysts said. Analysts at Wells Fargo also nicked Lululemon’s stock with a downgrade, taking it to their equivalent of neutral from buy, saying the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report had uncovered “issues that are likely to create an overhang on the stock for the foreseeable future.” Related: Wal-Mart is beating the pants off Amazon in apparel, and it’s fighting to keep it that way The slowdown is being driven by both online and stores, and the company’s full-year guidance “could prove optimistic given macro pressures and lack of needle-moving levers to pull,” they said. “While there are still some attractive aspects” of Lululemon, such as its international expansion and “dominant” position within its core categories, the positives are largely offset by emerging risks, the Wells Fargo analysts said. They also lowered their full-year 2017 per-share estimate to $2.34 from $2.56. The company has called for net revenue in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion and per-share earnings between $2.26 to $2.36 for the full year. The FactSet expectations for fiscal 2017 were for EPS of $2.16 and sales of $2.3 billion.

Morgan kept their rating on the stock at buy, but lowered their price target to $66 from $78. The magnitude of Lululemon’s e-commerce slowdown and color and fashion miss may be transitory, but the company “has checked into “Show-Me” camp with inconsistent execution deserving a lower interim multiple,” the analysts said. Wedbush analysts also stuck with their buy rating on the stock. While first-quarter guidance was disappointing, most of the first-quarter downside is self-inflicted “and thus fixable,” they said. Moreover, the company remains on track for margin growth and expense control. That Spring collection with no colors? It was a dubious merchandising decision, the Wedbush analysts said, but the fact that the misfire played a meaningful role in the first-quarter slowdown suggests “performance can be improved as 2017 goes along—and executives noted that color should begin to hit the assortment in April.” Shares of Lululemon have declined nearly 25% in the past 12 months, compared with 15% for the S&P 500 index

Mark DeCambre,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Apr 1, 2017 3:51 p.m. ET Dow Jones Industrial Averages is up nearly 30% over past 6 quarters—its best stretch since 2006 By “All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence, and then success is sure,” according to the eminently quotable Samuel Clemens, a.k.a. Mark Twain. That may be the dynamic Wall Street has been applying lately. Confidence in some realms doesn’t appear to be in short supply. Indeed, a reading of consumer confidence in March soared to its highest level in more than 16 years. Margin debt, or the amount stock-market investors borrowed against their brokerage accounts, pledging some of their holdings as collateral, hit an all-time high in February, extending a record set in January. High margin levels can be a sign of growing optimism.

                                  is on track for its longest streak of winning quarters. In fact, the Dow has climbed nearly 4,400 points, or about 30%, over the past six quarters, marking its best six-quarter advance since 2006. See: The Dow is about to do something it hasn’t done in 10 years Despite those moves, or perhaps because of them, some investors seem more hazy than usual about the direction the market takes from here, especially since by at least one measure stocks are trading at their most expensive levels since 2004. “Given the fact that valuations are at the very high end of normal and on the edge of expensive, there’s still room for people to change their mind about the market,” John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, told MarketWatch. So, is a correction—decline from the peak of at least 10%—on the horizon? Or are investors bound to see more gains? In a Thursday note, prominent technical analyst Tom McClellan suggested that the Nasdaq’s recent run of mostly positive closes, 28 of the past 40 trading sessions, indicates that the market is putting in a top and may be setting the stage for a downturn. The above graphic shows the number of positive closes out of a 40-session cycle, with the top Nasdaq moves represented by the black line indicating daily trading for the benchmark. The correlation has been far from perfect, specifically during 2013-14, but McClellan argued that the Federal Reserve’s resumption of a path of monetary normalization after a decade of easy-money policies will lead to a return of the normal pattern of protracted gains and sharp downturns for the Nasdaq. (Check out McClellan’s website here). What really has market participants on edge, however, is the unnatural degree to which the equity gauges have avoided major stumbles over the past five months. The S&P 500 and the Dow each saw only a single 1% daily decline, which occurred on March 21. In fact, stocks weren’t prone to big moves in either direction. On average, the S&P 500 and the Dow are on track to average an 0.3% daily gain during the first quarter, the smallest average daily move since the mid- to late-1960s, according to Dow Jones data.

                                   which briefly touched a recent intraday peak of 15.11 on Monday, is on pace to post its second-lowest quarterly average ever at 11.68, which is well under its historic average of 20. The VIX reflects the balance between supply and demand for insurance against big moves in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days. A market correction is inevitable, but when it will occur is anyone’s guess. Salil Mehta, a statistician and former leader a former director of analytics for the Treasury Department’s $700 billion TARP program, said there is a 13% chance of a short-term bear market, or fall of at least 20% from a recent peak. He sees a more than one-in-three chance of a downturn of at least 10% or better, and a nearly three-out-of-four likelihood of a 5% drop (see table below): A 5% drop would effectively wipe out year-to-date gains for the Dow and S&P 500 and chop the Nasdaq’s rise in 2017 in half. But such a move isn’t out of the ordinary, and some even view retreats of that order as cathartic. So far, however, the market has proved to be resilient, albeit relatively rangebound, even as Trump rattled nerves with his failure to get a vote on a bill to replace and repeal Obamacare. The apparent dysfunction has fueled skepticism about Trump’s ability to win approval of corporate tax cuts, which had been the backbone of the market’s ebullience. “I would say post the ACA-replacement failure, the market is really likely to be a bit directionless,” David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management, told MarketWatch. Lafferty said the market may be stuck in a rut with an improving global economy and earnings creating a floor for stocks and lofty valuations capping further sharp gains. “The movement that you’ve seen in the middle has been based on the optimism around Trump,” Lafferty said. “If [Trump] is going to struggle and the market’s already gone up 12%, the more [Trump-inspired] expectations are called into question, and the market for bonds are going to get a bid,” driving down yields, he said. Vassilis Dagioglu, a portfolio manager at Mellon Capital, which manages $360 billion, said fundamentals, including U.S. first-quarter earnings season, which will kick off mid-April, are expected to continue a recent trend of improvement. Analysts have made fewer cuts to earnings estimates than in previous quarters. In light of that, Dagioglu said he is upbeat on U.S. equities, though he sees markets outside the U.S. as offering better value. “We will see some pullbacks, 5% is likely, but barring some kind of external shock, the odds of a 15% or 20% drop are actually quite low at this point,” he speculated. Wells Fargo’s Manley said that a lot of folks are thinking about, and even bracing for, a correction. Sometimes, that serves as an antidote against a pullback: “Everyone’s on tenterhooks, and that’s good. Nerves are a wonderful thing, the more we worry about things, the less likely they are to happen.” Read: How investors can learn to stop worrying and love a stock-market correction Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

Ryan Vlastelica,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Apr 4, 2017 3:06 p.m. ET How a fund’s death sentence can create an opportunity By An ETF announces that it will be closing. Is that a buy signal? This may sound like an obvious “no,” given the security has announced its own limited shelf life, but investing in closing funds a strategy that traders have selectively done to take advantage of the way exchange-traded funds are structured. ETFs typically close because they fail to catch on with investors; the liquidation isn't a reflection on performance, construction, or strategy. If a fund doesn’t amass much in assets, or if it trades infrequently, the cost of running it may outweigh the amount it brings in revenue for the fund manager. As there are nearly 3,000 exchange-traded products on the market, at a time when the market share is dominated by the few massive funds, this happens increasingly often. See more: Here’s why the ETF graveyard is getting crowded Investors aren’t at risk when an ETF closes, they simply receive a check for the fund’s net asset value based on the size of their holding. Net asset value (NAV) is based on the total value of all the securities held by the fund. This is where the “buy a closing fund” strategy comes into play. Because investors, including large institutions, often dump funds that will be closing, the selling can result in a fund’s share price trading at a discount to the NAV. This discount can be pronounced, particularly for funds that track less-liquid securities, and investors who buy at such a time would potentially receive a premium upon closure. “People don’t pay attention to the NAV situation; they’re more concerned with trading spreads than how much more they’re paying for the value of something,” said Michael Venuto, chief investment officer at Toroso Investments, who has employed this strategy and wrote software to alert him when a fund trades at a premium to its net asset value. “When you factor in a NAV discount, a lot of ETFs are cheaper to buy than the underlying basket.” According to Venuto, it is common for funds to fallout of sync with their NAV, with small premiums—which he described as being in the range of 4-5%—occurring a few times a month. Larger premiums—such as 15-20%, though he has seen a mispricing in the 40-50% range—occur roughly once a year by his estimation. A fund’s closure isn’t the only reason an ETF will trade off its NAV, but that kind of event is how Venuto has used this strategy in the past, including with the Jefferies | TR/J CRB Wildcatters Exploration & Production Equity ETF, which offered exposure to small-cap energy exploration companies, and with the ETRACS Wells Fargo MLP Ex-Energy ETN, which tracked master limited partnerships but excluded companies in the energy sector. He had been an investor in both before the announcement that they would be closing. “I thought these were great ideas, great funds, but they never caught on. And as they got close to closing they traded at a pretty substantial discount [to the NAV]. I not only maintained my position but bought even more. There was a gain to be had, even knowing they would disappear,” he said. “When they settled in my accounts, the value was more than the last stated value of the trades. It was completely clean, without any issues.” Other reasons a NAV can become untethered aren’t as “clean.” Most notoriously, a huge market selloff in August 2015 resulted in this occurring for a large number of ETFs. When Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in 2011, trading on the country’s stock market was suspended for nearly two months amid the economic turmoil that resulted. This caused massive uncertainty for the VanEck Vectors Egypt Index ETF

At one point, the fund traded at a nearly 50% discount to its NAV, according to Venuto, but this didn’t make it an automatic buy for him. “You want to be interested in the ETF in general—the concept, fundamentals, the strategy,” he said. “As I see it, the discount makes the trade more attractive, but if it wasn’t attractive at NAV it wouldn’t be worth taking in the first place.” ",Should you invest in an ETF that’s closing? - MarketWatch
,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"The report, carried out by board Chairman Stephen Sanger and three other independent directors and released to media on Monday, said former retail division head Carrie Tolstedt ignored the systemic nature of abusive sales practices and accused her of impeding the board’s efforts to address an issue that festered for years. Lawyers for Tolstedt rejected the report’s findings on Monday. She had declined to be interviewed for the investigation. “We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt. A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion,” Enu Mainigi, Williams & Connolly LLP, attorneys for Tolstedt, said in a statement. Sanger, a board member since 2003, faces pressure to root out the problems amid calls by advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services for investors to oust him and other directors in place when the scandal broke. Glass Lewis meanwhile has recommended votes against six board members at the bank’s April 25 annual meeting. In an interview with Reuters, Sanger said the bank was not scapegoating anyone. “I’m not surprised that some of the people involved see it differently but we stand by the findings of this investigation,” he said. Sanger said the report showed the board had taken the appropriate action with the information it was given and had revamped compensation, leadership and its own structure to make sure such abuses did not reappear. “I’m very disappointed in the ISS and Glass Lewis recommendations, they do not take into account sufficiently the actions that the board has taken since the issue broke,” he said. “We will trust investors to make their own decisions about how they will vote.” With the U.S. Department of Justice looking into the sales practices, experts said Wells Fargo’s board was under pressure to ensure the buck stopped with someone else. “There’s a tremendous amount of pressure from regulators to throw someone under the bus,” said Duke Law School professor James Cox, who specializes in corporate and securities law. “If they don’t, then Wells Fargo is going to be even more in the crosshairs.” The Department of Justice declined to comment on its probe. Wells Fargo said Tolstedt had been fired for cause and it would cancel approximately $47 million worth of stock options held by her. The bank said it would also claw back approximately $28 million from former chief executive John Stumpf, who failed to heed warnings about the scale of the problem Stumpf, who retired under pressure from the scandal in October, was criticized for failing to grasp the gravity of the sales abuses and their impact on the bank. In the 110-page report, Stumpf was described as blinded by Wells Fargo’s cross-selling success. He refused to believe the model was seriously impaired and was full of admiration for Tolstedt, with whom he had a long working relationship. According to one director, Stumpf praised Tolstedt as the “best banker in America.” The report said Tolstedt hid the scale of the misconduct from the board, which only discovered that 5,300 staff had been fired for opening more than 2 million unauthorized accounts when the bank reached a $185 million settlement with regulators in September. A lawyer for Stumpf declined to comment on the report. The bank has fired five senior retail bank executives, including Tolstedt, over the scandal and imposed forfeitures, clawbacks and compensation adjustments on senior leaders now totaling more than $180 million, including $69 million from Stumpf and $67 million from Tolstedt. Since the scandal broke, the bank has seen a steady decline in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts and has lost its status as America’s most valuable bank by market value. Sales practices were identified as a “noteworthy risk” to the board and its risk committee, of which Sanger was a member, in 2014 after a series of stories in the Los Angeles Times detailed some of the practices. But Tolstedt was left to deal with the issue and was “notoriously resistant to outside intervention and oversight” the report said. Multiple board members felt misled by a presentation by Tolstedt and others to the risk committee in May 2015. The board members said they left thinking that between 200 and 300 employees had been fired for sales practice abuses and the problem was largely concentrated in southern California. The report criticized the board for not centralizing risk functions at the bank earlier, not requesting more detailed reports from management and not insisting Stumpf get rid of Tolstedt sooner. Tim Sloan, who replaced Stumpf as CEO, was described in the report as having little contact with sales practices at the bank before becoming chief operating officer and Tolstedt’s boss in November 2015. Six months later he told her to step aside. Since the scandal broke, the bank has ended sales targets, changed pay incentives for branch staff, separated the role of chairman and CEO and hired new directors to its board. A big part of Wells Fargo’s problem was its decentralized business model, which meant the retail bank was able to keep inquiries from head office at arm’s length. There was no joined-up effort by either the bank’s human resources or legal divisions to track and analyze the problem. As far back as 2002, Wells Fargo’s retail bank was taking steps to deal with sales practice violations and in 2004 an internal report recommended eliminating sales goals for employees. That report was sent to, among others, the chief auditor, a senior in-house employment lawyer, retail bank HR personnel and the head of retail bank sales & service development. No action was taken. Externally, Wells was lauded by investors for cross-selling customers multiple products and for its squeaky-clean reputation relative to peers following the financial crisis. Internally, the sales pressure was oppressive, particularly in California and Arizona, where senior bankers sometimes called subordinates several times a day to chastise those who failed to meet sales objectives. Tolstedt was perceived by high-level employees as having the support of Stumpf, with whom it was considered best to avoid raising problems with. “Stumpf was ultimately responsible for enterprise risk management at Wells Fargo, but was not perceived within Wells Fargo as someone who wanted to hear bad news or deal with conflict,” the report said. Wells Fargo shares were down 0.44 percent at $54.6 in early afternoon trade. ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co posted flat quarterly earnings on Thursday and warned its costs would remain elevated as the fallout from a sales practices scandal continues to impact the third-largest U.S. bank. Higher personnel costs and legal fees as well as lower mortgage banking revenues kept Wells Fargo’s first-quarter net income broadly flat at $5.5 billion and the San Francisco-based bank said expenses as a share of revenues would remain high. Wells Fargo is trying to put a scandal over the opening of unauthorized accounts behind it and earlier this week said it would claw back an additional $75 million of compensation from the two former executives it blamed most for the debacle. Known for consistently growing revenues and earnings in the post-crisis era, Wells Fargo has been thrown off course by the sales controversy and in recent quarters has also been disadvantaged by its smaller trading footprint. Wall Street rivals have bounced back as bond and currency markets roared back to life last year with JPMorgan and Citi each reporting a 17 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday, beating analyst expectations and boosting their shares. Wells Fargo’s revenues fell about 1 percent to $22 billion and missed the average estimate of $22.32 billion. On a per share basis, profit rose to $1.00 from 99 cents a year earlier, beating the average analyst estimate of 97 cents. Chief Executive Tim Sloan told analysts he expected new account and credit card openings to recover in the third quarter after a steady decline since the sales scandal broke in September but the bank said costs associated with the controversy, which were $80 million in the first quarter, would remain around $70 million to $80 million for an unspecified period. “I think it will be at least a few more quarters,” Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in an interview with Reuters. The bank’s efficiency ratio, a closely watched number reflecting non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 62.7 percent, compared with 58.7 percent a year ago and Sloan said it would be a challenge to get back to a preferred 55 to 59 percent level. “I want to make it very clear that operating at this level is not acceptable,” he said. Sloan added that the bank will unveil at its investor day in May additional cost savings initiatives beyond the annual $2 billion in savings they are targeting starting in 2018. The bank also plans to reduce headcount in businesses such as mortgage if, as expected, business gets slower. Sloan faces a rocky shareholder meeting on April 25 after influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services called on investors to vote against 12 out of 15 directors, including Chairman Stephen Sanger. The bank’s stock was down 2.5 percent at mid-afternoon on Thursday, the worst performer in the S&P 500 Financials Index. After the close on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder, said it withdrew an application to the Federal Reserve to boost its ownership stake above 10 percent, and is instead selling 9 million shares to keep it below that threshold. The Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates in March for the second time in three months has been welcomed by banks which earn more from lending out their deposits when rates rise. Higher rates helped Wells Fargo earn more from lending with a 5 percent rise to $12.3 billion in its net interest income. But higher rates can also put off borrowers, and Wells had a decline in total loans to $958 billion from nearly $968 billion in the prior quarter with a near $8 billion drop in consumer loans in that period. Wells Fargo’s mortgage business, the largest in the United States by volume, saw a 23 percent drop in fee income to $1.23 billion as customers shied away from refinancing their home loans. Mortgage borrowing was likewise a dark spot in JPMorgan’s results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to $406 million from $667 million. Wells’ consumer business is also feeling the impact from its unauthorized accounts scandal with a steady decline in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. Overall net profit at its retail bank, its biggest profit center, fell 9 percent due to a drop in fee income. Wells’ wholesale banking division, which provides loans and other services to corporate clients, reported a 10 percent increase in net profit from a year ago. Costs at Wells Fargo rose 6 percent compared to the year-ago period as the bank shelled out more for salaries as well as the legal costs related to the scandal. ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"Berkshire on Wednesday said it concluded after several months of talks with Fed officials that maintaining the higher stake would “materially restrict” its ability to do business with the third-largest U.S. bank. The Fed exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes. It often allows double-digit stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but has said it would review any resulting business relationship “case-by-case.” Berkshire said “investment or valuation considerations” were not factors in its sale of 7.13 million Wells Fargo shares this week, and planned sale of another 1.87 million shares “in the near future.” The company, which has owned Wells Fargo stock since 1989, also said it will sell more Wells Fargo shares if needed to keep its stake “slightly below 10 percent,” including if the bank repurchases its own stock. According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire owned 504.3 million Wells Fargo shares worth more than $27 billion before the sales, making it the bank’s largest shareholder. Buffett, 86, owned another 2.01 million of the bank’s shares personally. Wells Fargo has been beset since September by a scandal over its creation of unauthorized customer accounts. “We appreciate the confidence that Berkshire Hathaway has placed in Wells Fargo over the years, both as our largest shareholder and a very valued customer,” spokesman Mark Folk said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing our relationship.” On Monday, Wells Fargo said it would claw back an additional $75 million of compensation from the executives it blamed most for the accounts scandal, former Chief Executive John Stumpf and former community banking chief Carrie Tolstedt. The San Francisco-based lender’s shares have nonetheless risen 16.6 percent since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, though they now trade at their lowest level in four months. Many other banks’ shares also rose after Trump’s election. Buffett told CNBC television on Feb. 27 that Wells Fargo made a “huge mistake” by not immediately addressing the unauthorized accounts, and that letting the problem mushroom made its reputation suffer. Wells Fargo is expected on Thursday to report a decline in first-quarter profit, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also operates more than 90 businesses including insurers, utilities, industrial products makers, food and apparel companies, and a railroad. ","

Linskens did not immediately respond to requests for comment. OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard declined to comment. Wells Fargo’s board is expected to release a report on Monday detailing what went wrong at the fourth-largest U.S. bank, according to sources familiar with the matter. The bank and its board both declined to comment. In September, Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement with the OCC and other regulators over its opening millions of accounts in customers’ names without their permission. At the time, the bank said as many as 2 million accounts were affected, but has since said the number might be larger. The report is the result of a seven-month investigation by Wells Fargo’s board of directors into how and why the sales abuses happened. Thousands of employees were dismissed over the matter, and several have publicly said they opened the fake accounts to hit aggressive sales targets set by managers. Wells Fargo now faces probes from other government agencies including the Department of Justice, which is investigating whether any laws were broken. Linskens was responsible for day-to-day supervision of Wells Fargo and managed a staff of more than 60 people, according to past notices from the OCC. He joined the OCC in 1993 and earliest oversight of Wells Fargo began in 2006. In 2016, Linskens was honored with the title “senior national bank examiner” and received accolades in a news release from Comptroller Thomas Curry, who runs the OCC. In September, Curry ordered an internal review of how the OCC handled the Wells Fargo matter and whether the agency has “gaps in our supervision.” That review is drawing to a close, said an OCC official.

In the report, carried out by the bank's chairman Stephan Sanger and three other independent directors, Carrie Tolstedt is blamed for ignoring the systemic nature of the problem which was pinned instead on individual wrongdoers and accused of obstructing the board's efforts to get to the bottom of what was going on. Exclusive: The Malaysian firm funneling money to PyongyangOver the past two decades, North Korean-born Han Hun Il, the founding chief executive of a Malaysian conglomerate, funneled money to the leadership in Pyongyang, a North Korean defector, speaking out for the first time, told Reuters. Han’s conglomerate, Malaysia Korea Partners (MKP), worked in partnership with Jang Song Thaek, one of the most powerful people in the North until his execution in 2013, according to Lee Chol Ho. Lee worked as a trader for Han for nine years until he defected to Seoul in 2010. The new disclosures come at a time when United Nations sanctions monitors are intensifying scrutiny of both Han and MKP. IT ‘cowboys’ ride into the sunsetBill Hinshaw is not a typical 75-year-old.

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Citi was the top bank last year in transaction banking, a segment comprising trade finance and cash management services,  rankings compiled by industry analytics firm Coalition showed on Tuesday. This is the first time Coalition has ranked banks on  transaction banking, basing the scores on services provided to clients with annual turnover of over $1.5 billion. Cash management encompasses services such as direct debits, wire transfers and currency clearing, while trade finance can include items such as letters of credit and trade loans. Coalition regularly releases investment banking league tables and its 2016 rankings, released last month, showed U.S. banks grabbing the top five places. Eric Li, research and analytics director at Coalition, told Reuters that while the investment banking industry typically grabbed more attention, transaction banking had proved to be a more steady source of income for global banks. Also, trade finance, a key element in transaction banking, is picking up after a decline caused by the slowdown in global commerce in recent years, he noted. “This business is a lot more resilient compared to investment banking, you don’t see huge swings by 20-30 percent in terms of top line revenue. It’s a very steady business,” Li said. “As a result ... we are increasingly seeing a gradual increase in coverage of this from the media as well as the bank management perspective.” Coalition’s transaction banking list is less U.S. heavy than its investment banking league table - after Citi, U.S. banks JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo were in second, fourth and ninth place respectively. HSBC was the top placed European bank, tying for second place with JPMorgan, while other top 10 European names were Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, Societe Generale and Barclays, Coalition said. “In trade finance, most major players are European banks. This is a big divergence from the investment banking industry where you see big dominance by U.S. banks,” Lee added. The data showed Citi increasing its market share in trade finance as well as cash management, and dominant in the Americas. HSBC, on the other hand, was rapidly growing its transaction banking business in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Within transaction banking, the top trade finance banks were Citi, HSBC and BNP Paribas, while Citi, HSBC, JPMorgan and BAML scored highest in cash management. Coalition did not give details on how much banks had earned from the transaction business. The table was based upon the largest transaction banks  within 15 leading banks, which included Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, J.P. Morgan, Société Générale, Standard Chartered and Wells Fargo. ","

Eric Affeldt, who championed the strategy of growing the golf and private club operator largely through acquisition, intends to retire from his role as chief executive ""upon the appointment of his successor."" No timetable was given, but Affeldt said the review could take 90 days. ""This was 100 percent my decision,"" said Affeldt, 59, who joined ClubCorp as president and CEO in late 2006. As the top executive, he ""led the company through the best 10 years of its 60-year history, in terms of financial performance,"" the company said in a statement. Affeldt helped lead the company's 2013 foray into the public stock market, where results have been mixed. From a launch price of about $15 a share, the company's stock rose above $24 a share in mid-2015, before sinking below $11 late last year. That was shortly after an activist investor called for management to do something to boost shareholder value, even if it means a sale. In January, the company announced the formation of a committee to investigate strategic alternatives. Wednesday's announcement said the board of directors ""has unanimously determined not to pursue a strategic transaction at this time, and to continue executing its three-pronged growth strategy focused on organic growth, reinvention and acquisitions.""

ClubCorp, which also reported quarterly sales and profit below estimates, said Chief Executive Eric Affeldt would step down upon the appointment of a successor. Affeldt had joined ClubCorp in 2006 and helped lead the company’s initial public stock offering in 2013.

That increased activity boosted first-quarter revenue in JPMorgan’s markets-related businesses, particularly fixed-income trading. The bank also reported growth in loans and deposits and was able to earn more from lending as interest rates ticked higher. However, its pace of loan growth, much like in the broader U.S. banking industry, has slackened recently. Overall, JPMorgan earned $6.4 billion in the first quarter, or $1.65 per share, up from $5.5 billion, or $1.35 per share a year earlier. The bank’s total net revenue rose 6 percent to $24.7 billion from $23.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.52 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan shares rose 0.5 percent to $85.79 in premarket trading. JPMorgan’s corporate and investment banking division, which includes the trading business, reported a 17 percent rise in revenue to $9.5 billion, the biggest gain among its four major business lines. Weaker advisory fees were more than offset by gains in revenue from underwriting, securitized products, interest rate-related products, prime brokerage and corporate derivatives. On a conference call with journalists, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said some customers decided to borrow by issuing bonds rather than taking out loans. Mortgage borrowing was a dark spot in the bank’s results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to $406 million from $667 million. Higher interest rates have dissuaded borrowers from refinancing, and JPMorgan executives had said in February they expected non-interest mortgage revenue to fall throughout the year. Even so, the bank managed to grow its core book of loans by 9 percent on an annual basis and nearly 1 percent from the prior quarter. Its net interest income, an important measure of profitability that shows the difference between a bank’s cost of money and how much it receives for the funds, rose 6 percent. In a statement, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said U.S. consumers and businesses are “healthy overall” and that the economy could further improve if the government pursues pro-growth initiatives. ","

Other big investors caught up in the chaos include investment manager BlackRock (BLK), passive investment specialist Vanguard and Primecap Management.

The rally was led by Apple Inc (AAPL), which rose 24 percent in the first three months. These healthy returns could see the strongest S&P 500 EPS growth in over five years, Bank of America analysts say. Despite the Trump administration showing some wobbles at the end of the quarter, macro data remained upbeat. Bank of America says improving ISM numbers, led by new orders, has the economy in good stead and it expects earnings season to surprise to the upside. Even as estimates fall, Bank of America is predicting a $30.35 EPS, 3 percent above the market consensus of $29.44. (See also: First Quarter Analysis: Winners and Losers in Consumer Staples) The first quarter was a good one for financials. A combination of the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates (the 10-year yield rose 21 basis points in the quarter) and the deregulation plans from the Republican party helped bank stocks hit multi-year highs. Consensus for the financials sector is a 14.1 percent year-on-year increase. After a dismal Q1 2016, the energy sector is expected to return year-on-year EPS growth of 723.6 percent. A year ago, the price of oil traded below $30 a barrel for the first time in 13 years. A full-on oil crisis saw profits dive, rigs close and the energy industry suffer one of its worst quarters in history. It was the first sector to record a quarterly loss since financials in 2008. However, what a year makes. As oil hovers around $50 a barrel, a 50 percent increase from the average Q1 2016 price, expect a sharp rebound in the energy sector. (See also: The Energy Sector Could Offer Earnings Upside) Market consensus for ex-financials and energy EPS growth is just 3 percent. Historically, corporates have been reluctant to upgrade consensus for estimates as reporting dates get closer, even as optimism rises. Skeptics say this can distort any upside earnings beat and borders on immoral behavior. However, the current political uncertainty may provide a material excuse this time around. ""Corporates typically set a low bar at the beginning of the year, and they may also be hesitant to update their outlooks until they have greater clarity on the likelihood and timing of policy changes by the new administration,"" Bank of America said in its note.

Wilfred Frost,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"Wells Fargo's independent directors have decided to initiate corporate pay clawbacks that total some of the largest in history, after concluding a six-month investigation into the beleaguered institution's retail banking sales practices, it was revealed Monday. A board review, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, indicated that former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf acknowledged that he made significant mistakes and helped create a culture at the bank that resulted in abuses, including the creation of fake consumer accounts. That review was overseen by a special board committee, chaired by Stephen Sanger, and also includes three other independent directors: Elizabeth Duke, Enrique Hernandez and Donald James. The special committee retained law firm Shearman & Sterling to assist the investigation. On Monday the board is announcing that it has decided it is necessary to claw back an additional $28 million of pay from Stumpf, adding onto $41 million he already gave up when he resigned in October 2016. Stumpf's total pay from 2011-2016 was $286 million, according to executive compensation firm Equilar, meaning he will have forfeited 24 percent of his pay for that period since the scandal first emerged. Stumpf was made aware of the systemic nature of the bank's sales practice problems starting in 2012, but was first aware of specific cases as early as 2002, according to the board. He did not initiate any follow-up investigation or inquiry into the problem until 2015. One of the main accusations leveled at him was an unwillingness to criticize former community bank unit head Carrie Tolstedt, whom he once praised as being ""the best banker in America."" ""Stumpf was hesitant to criticize Tolstedt and, ultimately, hesitant to terminate her, even after the lead independent director and the Chair of the Risk Committee suggested that he do so in December 2015,"" according to details disclosed in the report. The review takes aim at the bank's decentralized structure, citing ""a culture of strong deference to management of the lines of business (embodied in the oft-repeated 'run it like you own it' mantra."" Further, ""the Chief Risk Officer had limited authority with respect to the Community Bank. As events were unfolding, his visibility into risk issues at the Community Bank was hampered by his dependence on its group risk officer and he was essentially confined to attempting to cajole and persuade Tolstedt and the Community Bank to be more responsive to sales practice-related risks,"" the review says. The board singles out Tolstedt for far more criticism than anyone else for creating the problems and failing to address them. ""Tolstedt resisted change to the Community Bank's sales model even when confronted with evidence that it led to low-quality sales and improper sales practices. … Instead, she reinforced the high-pressure sales culture,"" the report says. Community bank was Wells Fargo's consumer banking unit. Further, Tolstedt ""was ""obsessed"" with control, especially over negative information about the community bank, and extremely reluctant to make changes."" Tolstedt did not respond to CNBC request for comment, but Reuters quoted attorneys for the former executive as saying ""we strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt."" A full examination of the facts will produce ""a different conclusion,"" the attorneys said. Tolstedt declined, on advice of counsel, to be interviewed as part of the board's investigation, a footnote in the report revealed. As reported last month, four other executives were terminated for cause as part of this review. Wells Fargo Chairman Stephan Sanger reiterated in an interview with CNBC that Tolstedt ""is responsible"" as former leader of the Community Bank unit. Stumpf did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. The review states that by 2015 ""many Board members believed that [Tolstedt] was intentionally understating the problem which she had helped to create."" Tolstedt is therefore being terminated retroactively for cause and giving up an additional $47.3 million of pay. She had already forgone $19 million in September last year, as CNBC first reported on March 16. Meanwhile, the report says that current Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan's ""direct involvement with the sales practice issue was limited"" until he became president and chief operating officer in November 2015. At that point, Tolstedt began reporting directly to him instead of Stumpf, and Sloan is credited with deciding to end her tenure, something that Stumpf would not do.  One email in particular stands out that highlights Stumpf's unwillingness to acknowledge the scale of the problem his company faced. In an email to Sloan on May 17, 2015, after the company was notified of the filing of a lawsuit against the bank by the Los Angeles city attorney, Stumpf wrote: ""I have worked over the weekend with Carrie on the LA issue — I really feel for Carrie and her team. We do such a good job in this area. I will fight this one to the finish. Do you know only around 1% of our people lose their jobs [for] gaming the system, and about 2/3 of those are for gaming the monitoring of the system, i.e. changing phone numbers, etc. Nothing could be further from the truth on forcing products on customers. In any case, right will win and we are right. Did some do things wrong — you bet and that is called life. This is not systemic."" In his interview for the independent review, Stumpf acknowledged that 1 percent was too high regardless. The report is relatively less critical of the board, suggesting that at times ""Board members believe that they were misinformed"" by various presentations they received from executives. That acknowledged criticisms of the board, especially of its risk committee, and the fact that ""the Board should have been more forceful in pushing Stumpf to change leadership so that the Community Bank could move forward more quickly."" That tone comes in sharp contrast to last Friday's Institutional Shareholder Services report, which recommended that Wells Fargo shareholders vote against re-election of 12 of Wells' 15 board members at the annual shareholder meeting. That meeting is set to take place on April 25, in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ","Wells Fargo board slams Stumpf and Tolstedt, claws back millions"
Jeff Cox,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"Wells Fargo's recent report regarding its fake account scandal did little to assuage investors nervous over what the long-term ramifications might be. Shares of the third-largest U.S. bank by assets are down more than 2 percent this week as part of a broader sell-off in financials. However, there are specific issues with Wells that could cause even more obstacles. That's why Dick Bove thinks investors ought to dump the stock, at least for now. In a note to clients, the vice president of equity research at Rafferty Capital Markets and closely watched bank analyst reinstituted the sell rating he had on Wells Fargo. Bove had put a sell on the bank when the controversy first erupted in September, but then lifted it to hold as Wells looked to put the scandal behind it. However, news this week that the bank had clawed back $75 million from former CEO John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, who ran the community bank division, set off another round of questions. The clawback revelations came in a report the bank board commissioned into what happened in a scandal that saw Wells Fargo workers set up some 2 million accounts for customers without their knowledge in an effort to meet aggressive sales goals. Bove said the move to centralize operations is actually a positive, but one that will take time for a culture ""built on ignoring directives and lying."" ""Confrontations between the corporate office and the divisional offices are highly likely,"" he wrote. ""Departures by top sales people are quite likely as they move to less restrictive operating environments where they can make more money."" Moreover, regulators poring over the report ""are likely to be appalled"" both at the bank's behavior and the way their predecessors failed to catch what was happening in sales practices that stretched over a 15-year period. The immediate impact seen on Wells Fargo will be that sales will be scaled back while the company makes necessary changes. While positive over the long run, it will take time for the bank to adapt, Bove said. ""The biggest battle ahead is whether this company can be effectively managed,"" he wrote. ""The stock should be sold until that question is answered."" To be sure, Bove's sentiments about the bank are not universal. Analyst Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill told CNBC that ""the worst is over"" for the stock as investors probably have priced in all the bad news. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, meanwhile, last week raised their price target from $53 to $63 — about a 19 percent jump from the current level — and boosted the rating to outperform. However, the KBW move came before the board's report was released. Wells Fargo shares have tumbled more than 9 percent over the past month, are down more than 3 percent year to date and were among the sector's worst performers Wednesday, dropping 1.4 percent in morning trading. Bank stocks in general have been taking a beating after bursting higher after the November presidential election. Earnings season begins this week with major banks reporting Thursday. Wells Fargo is projected to post a profit of 97 cents a share — 2 cents lower than the same period in 2016 — on revenue of $22.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.

 ,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"The most senior bank examiner for Wells Fargo has been removed by a U.S. regulator in the wake of the bank's unauthorized accounts scandal, people familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the lead regulator for national banks, stripped the examiner, Bradley Linskens, of his supervisory powers within the last two weeks, said three sources, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Linskens did not immediately respond to requests for comment. OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard declined to comment. Wells Fargo's board is expected to release a report on Monday detailing what went wrong at the fourth-largest U.S. bank, according to sources familiar with the matter. The bank and its board both declined to comment. In September, Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement with the OCC and other regulators over its opening millions of accounts in customers' names without their permission. At the time, the bank said as many as 2 million accounts were affected, but has since said the number might be larger. The report is the result of a seven-month investigation by Wells Fargo's board of directors into how and why the sales abuses happened. Thousands of employees were dismissed over the matter, and several have publicly said they opened the fake accounts to hit aggressive sales targets set by managers. Wells Fargo now faces probes from other government agencies including the Department of Justice, which is investigating whether any laws were broken. Linskens was responsible for day-to-day supervision of Wells Fargo and managed a staff of more than 60 people, according to past notices from the OCC. He joined the OCC in 1993 and earliest oversight of Wells Fargo began in 2006. In 2016, Linskens was honored with the title ""senior national bank examiner"" and received accolades in a news release from Comptroller Thomas Curry, who runs the OCC. In September, Curry ordered an internal review of how the OCC handled the Wells Fargo matter and whether the agency has ""gaps in our supervision."" That review is drawing to a close, said an OCC official. ",US regulator removes top examiner for Wells Fargo: sources
 ,04132017,CNBC,04062017,Warren Buffett's company is selling a chunk of its Wells Fargo stock to avoid some federal regulations. Berkshire Hathaway says the sale isn't tied to the scandal about Wells Fargo's sales practices that led to the CEO's departure last year. The company says it's selling to keep its stake of the bank below 10 percent to avoid additional Federal Reserve regulations. It will continue selling shares as needed to remain below that threshold. Berkshire's holdings crept above 10 percent last year because of Wells Fargo's stock repurchases. Berkshire says it has already sold 7.1 million shares and will sell about 1.9 million more. That will bring its holding to around 491 million shares ,Buffett's firm selling some of its Wells Fargo shares
Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"Wells Fargo on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectation, but revenue came in light. The third-largest U.S. bank by assets reported essentially a flat profit, due to in part higher costs and weaker mortgage banking revenue. The bank's shares were down more than 2 percent in premarket trading following the announcement. In early trading the stock was down less than 1 percent. Here's what the Street was expecting: The bank earned 99 cents per share in the same period last year. ""Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results,""  Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. The bank said total average loans were $963.6 billion in the quarter, down $502 million from the fourth quarter. Mortgage banking revenue fell 23 percent to $1.23 billion. The earnings report came three days after the bank's independent directors decided to initiate corporate pay clawbacks, following a six-month investigation into the scrutinized institution's retail banking sales practices. The board review indicated that former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf acknowledged that he made significant mistakes and helped create a culture at the bank that resulted in abuses. ""The findings are valuable to us and beneficial in helping to identify areas for further improvement. While we have more work to do, I am pleased with all we have accomplished thus far,"" Sloan said in the earnings release Thursday. On Wednesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it is selling 9 million shares of Wells Fargo due to possible Federal Reserve regulations. Wells Fargo directors are likely to receive the support of Berkshire Hathaway, according to The Wall Street Journal. Citigroup also reported earnings on Thursday, beating expectations on the top and bottom line. Earlier in the day, JPMorgan Chase reported first-quarter earnings that easily beat Wall Street's expectations. ",Wells Fargo shares slide 2% after earnings come in mixed

THE REPORT WAS VERY CLEAR, CARRIE TOLSTEDT'S FAILINGS TERMINATING HER FOR CAUSE IT WAS ALSO , AND CRITICAL OF BOTH JOHN STUMPF AND THE BOARD FOR FAILING TO NOTICE THOSE FAILINGS SOONER ONCE YOU TOOK OVER, THOUGH, AS PRESIDENT AND COO AS STEVE SANGER SAID, YOU ENDED HER EMPLOYMENT FAIRLY QUICKLY. WHAT DID YOU NOTICE AND SPOT THAT OTHERS MISSED? SLOAN: WELL, WILFRED THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I THINK THAT ONCE I BECAME PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER IN NOVEMBER 2015, I SAT DOWN AND MADE A FRESH ASSESSMENT OF CARRIE. I WORKED WITH HER ON SOME THINGS I ASKED HER TO IMPROVE ON, WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION WITHIN A FEW MONTHS IT MADE SENSE FOR HER TO MOVE ON, AND WHAT I SAW WAS AN EXECUTIVE THAT WHILE HAVING A SUCCESSFUL CAREER HAD SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH OTHERS, HAD NOT DEALT AS AGGRESSIVELY WITH SOME OF THE SALES PRACTICE ISSUES AS SHE SHOULD HAVE, AND AS I LOOKED FORWARD IN TERMS OF WHERE WE WERE TAKING OUR RETAIL BUSINESS, IT JUST MADE SENSE TO MAKE A CHANGE, AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED WITH MARY MACK, THE NEW LEADER OF COMMUNITY BANKING, SHE'S DOING A TERRIFIC JOB. FROST: WHAT ABOUT PRE-COO WHEN YOU WERE CFO AND OTHER IMPORTANT HIGHER ROLES WITHIN THE BANK. COULD YOU HAVE BEEN MORE PROACTIVE WITH HELPING TO SORT OUT THE SALES PRACTICE SCANDAL EVEN IF IT WAS NOT DIRECTLY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY? SLOAN: VERY FAIR QUESTION. I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR SINCE I STEPPED INTO THIS CEO ROLE THAT WHEN I LOOK BACK I SHOULD HAVE AND COULD HAVE DONE SOME THINGS DIFFERENTLY. ONCE THE ISSUES MADE ITS WAY TO THE CORPORATE LEADERSHIP LEVEL, AND IN HINDSIGHT, I WISH WE WOULD HAVE MOVED MORE QUICKLY. WE WOULD HAVE MADE DECISIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE MADE LAST FALL, WHICH WAS TO END THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN IN THE COMMUNITY BANK, SO, GOSH, YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK BACK AND HINDSIGHT'S A GREAT THING. ARE THERE THINGS YOU SHOULD DO DIFFERENTLY ABSOLUTELY. I'M REALLY FOCUSED NOW ON BEING THE CEO OF WELLS FARGO AND MOVING FORWARD AND IMPLEMENTING ALL THE CHANGES WE'VE MADE AND REBUILDING TRUST WITH THE SHAREHOLDERS. FROST: TIM, I WANT TO READ BACK AN E-MAIL TO YOU SENT TO YOU BY JOHN STUMPF, THE THEN CEO, ON MAY THE 17th, 2015, JUST AFTER THE FILING OF THE LOS ANGELES ATTORNEY LAWSUIT AGAINST WELLS FARGO. BEAR WITH ME FOR THIS. SLOAN: SURE. FROST: JOHN STUMPF, EMAILING TO YOU SAYING, I HAVE WORKED OVER THE WEEKEND WITH CARRIE ON THE LA ISSUE, I REALLY FEEL FOR CARRIE AND HER TEAM, WE DO SUCH A GOOD JOB IN THIS AREA. I'LL FIGHT THIS ONE TO THE FINISH. DO YOU KNOW ONLY AROUND 1% OF THE PEOPLE LOSE JOBS FOR GAMING THE SYSTEM, AND TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE ARE FOR GAMING OR MONITORING THE SYSTEM, IE CHANGING PHONE NUMBERS, ET CETERA, NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH ON FORCING PRODUCTS ON CUSTOMERS. IN ANY CASE, RIGHT WILL WIN, AND WE ARE RIGHT. DID SOME DO THINGS WRONG? YOU BET, BUT THAT'S CALLED LIFE. THIS IS NOT SYSTEMIC. THAT WAS AN E-MAIL JOHN STUMPF SENT TO YOU IN MAY 2017. AT THAT MOMENT -- SORRY, 2015, EXCUSE ME. AT THAT MOMENT IN MAY 2015, DID YOU REALIZE IT WAS SYSTEMIC? WHAT ACTIONS DID YOU PERSONALLY TAKE IMMEDIATELY THEN, EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE NOT COO YET? SLOAN: WELL, THAT WAS AFTER THE TIME PERIOD, WILFRED, THAT THE ISSUE HAD BEEN ELEVATED TO THE OPERATING COMMITTEE OF WHICH I WAS A MEMBER OF AT THAT TIME. I WAS HEAD OF THE WHOLESALE BANK, AND, AGAIN, I THINK AT THAT POINT, WE PUT CORPORATE RESOURCES ON IT. WE PUT A LOT MORE PEOPLE, A GROUP OF FOLKS FROM ACROSS THE COMPANY IN TRYING TO MAKE CHANGES, AND YOU COULD SEE IN ALL THE NUMBERS AND THE BOARD WAS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN THEIR INVESTIGATION, AND THAT THE STEPS THAT WE WERE TAKING WERE HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT, BUT, AGAIN, I THINK IN HINDSIGHT, WE SHOULD HAVE MOVED FASTER. I HIGHLIGHT AGAIN THE FACT I WISH WE ENDED THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN WE HAD IN THE COMMUNITY BANK. WE'VE DONE THAT. NOW IT'S ABOUT MOVING FORWARD. I MEAN, I'M SO EXCITED WITH THE FACT THAT IN OUR NEW INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN, FOR EXAMPLE, WE'RE FOCUSED ON SERVICE, ADVICE, CUSTOMER SERVICE, HOW THE TEAM IS WORKING TOGETHER, HOW WE'RE GOING RELATIONSHIPS. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE MANY CHANGES THAT WE'RE MAKING AT THE COMPANY NOW THAT I'VE BECOME CEO. EVANS: MR. SLOAN, DOES THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND THESE CLAWBACKS INDICATE THAT THIS IS THE END OF THIS CHAPTER AS FAR AS YOU GUYS ARE CONCERNED AT WELLS FARGO? AND I ASK BECAUSE ELIZABETH WARREN ALSO JUST TWEETED THAT THE CLAWBACK IS A GOOD STEP, BUT AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A THOROUGH GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION. WILL THERE BE ANYTHING FURTHER THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF INTO THIS MATTER, OR IS THIS AS FAR AS YOU GUYS ARE CONCERNED THE END OF IT? SLOAN: WELL, THE BOARD WAS CLEAR IN ITS REPORT THAT THEIR INVESTIGATION IS OVER WITH. THERE ARE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON IN TERMS OF AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AND IN OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR REGULATORS, AND SO WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO IN TERMS OF REBUILDING TRUST WITH ALL OF OUR STAKE HOLDERS, AND MAKING THINGS RIGHT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. SO, NO, I DON'T THINK THIS IS A CHAPTER THAT'S OVER WITH. I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WAS THE BOARD RELEASED ITS REPORT, WHICH IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT, OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT OCCURRED AT THE COMPANY, MISTAKES THAT WE'VE MADE, AND MY JOB AS THE CEO IS TO FIX THEM AND MOVE FORWARD. EVANS: AND THIS IS ALL HAPPENING AGAINST A BACKDROP THAT'S ALSO INFLUX. WHILE WE HAVE YOU, I JUST WANTED TO ASK BECAUSE IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT GARY COHN, FORMER BANKING COLLEAGUE OF YOURS, JUST MEANING THAT HE WAS AT A COMPETITOR, GOLDMAN SACHS, IS REPORTEDLY INTERESTED IN REPEALING GLASS-STEAGALL. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD AFFECT YOUR BUSINESS DRAMATICALLY? DO YOU HAVE A VIEW ON THAT? ON THE WAY THE BANKING INDUSTRY MIGHT GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? SLOAN: SURE, IT'S A FAIR QUESTION. AND THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL CHANGE FROM A REGULATORY STANDPOINT THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED IN THE INDUSTRY. I THINK OUR PRIMARY FOCUS AS IT RELATES TO REGULATION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT REGULATION, WHICH IS VERY FOCUSED ON OUR CUSTOMERS, SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RIGHT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WHAT GARY ACTUALLY MEANS IN TERMS OF REPEALING GLASS-STEAGALL, I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. AT WELLS FARGO, OUR INVESTMENT BANKING OPERATION IS VERY INTEGRATED WITH HOW WE PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CORPORATE BANKING CUSTOMERS, FOR EXAMPLE. AND I THINK WE DO A TERRIFIC JOB, WE'VE GOT A TERRIFIC TEAM WITHIN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING GROUP. I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE BECAUSE I THINK INVESTMENT BANKING DONE RIGHT IS VERY BENEFICIAL TO OUR CUSTOMERS AS PART OF AN OVERALL RELATIONSHIP. FROST: TIM, JUST WANT TO JUMP BACK IN AGAIN AND ON THE CALL EARLIER TODAY WITH THE MEDIA, YOU OUTLINED THAT YOU'VE HIRED BACK AROUND ABOUT A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES SINCE SEPTEMBER, MANY OF WHOM HAD LEFT RELATING TO THESE SALES CULTURE ISSUES. HAVE THOSE ROUND ABOUT THOUSAND EMPLOYEES, THEREFORE, BEEN MISTREATED BY THE BANK IN THE PAST IN ORDER FOR THEM TO NOW BE REHIRED? SLOAN: YEAH WILFRED, IT'S A FAIR QUESTION. WE'VE ACTUALLY HIRED MANY MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE AT WELLS FARGO SINCE LAST FALL, BUT THE POINT I WAS MAKING THERE IS THAT IF THERE'S ANY FORMER TEAM MEMBER THAT WOULD LIKE TO COME BACK TO WELLS FARGO WHO MAY HAVE LEFT THE COMPANY BECAUSE THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE SALES CULTURE IN OUR RETAIL BANK, WE'D LOVE TO HAVE THEM BACK. AND MANY OF THOSE IN THAT THOUSAND NUMBER WOULD FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY. IN THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE COME BACK TO THE COMPANY, I THINK, IS A TERRIFIC SIGN IN TERMS HOW OUTSIDE PARTIES ARE VIEWING THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE MAKING AT THE COMPANY FOR THE GOOD. IN FACT, IN ADDITION TO THAT, ANOTHER INTERESTING INDICATOR IS THE FACT THAT OUR RETENTION IS ACTUALLY INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN OUR RETAIL BANK BECAUSE OUR TEAM MEMBERS ARE SAYING THEY LIKE ALL THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE MADE.

But Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz's parents divorced when she was a child, and her father's firm didn't become a financial force until she was well into her 20s. ""In my childhood, my dad was a struggling businessman,"" she said. Schwab-Pomerantz got her first job — a paper route — at the age of the 13, and it was her mother who took her to the bank (a Wells Fargo, in fact) to open up her first savings account. Her best advice to others,  which is part of a larger campaign by the Council for Economic Education to promote financial literacy, is to do what she has done — put aside a portion of every dollar you earn and always comparison shop when it comes to the dollars you spend. When Schwab-Pomerantz's own three children started working as teenagers, she encouraged them to save 10 percent of their income as well. They each opened up a Roth IRA and invested in mutual funds or broad-based exchange-traded funds. ""Most people's mistakes are about procrastination,"" she said. ""As a young person, retirement seems so far off."" But when it comes to saving and investing, ""time is of the essence,"" she said. Now, Schwab-Pomerantz is president and chair of the Charles Schwab Foundation, and a senior vice president at the $56 billion company.

 ,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"AT&T said on Monday it would buy Straight Path Communications, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, for $1.25 billion in an all-stock deal as it aims to accumulate the airwaves it needs for a next generation network. The deal shows how wireless carriers may be increasingly willing to pay lofty prices for assets that they view as critical to 5G, which is expected to boast higher speeds and more capacity. The network is widely considered to be a multibillion-dollar opportunity, and wireless carriers do not have many options in terms of acquisition targets that would give them the right type of spectrum for a next generation network. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of 28 GHz and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum used in mobile communications. The No.2 U.S. wireless carrier said it would offer $95.63 per share, a premium of 162.1 percent to Straight Path's close on Friday. Straight Path's shares leaped 150 percent to near $91 a share in afternoon trade, while AT&T's shares were marginally lower. Millimeter wave spectrum is expected to play a large role in 5G. Earlier this year, AT&T said it was acquiring privately held FiberTower and its millimeter wave spectrum rights. In February, competitor Verizon Communications, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, said it had closed on its acquisition of XO Communications' fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion, giving it access to millimeter wave spectrum. Between FiberTower and Straight Path, AT&T should have a similar amount of spectrum as Verizon if not more, said Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche, in a note on Monday. Other companies in the industry rose after the news as investors are expecting a wave of mergers and acquisitions in telecom this year. Sprint earlier rose 1.5 percent to $8.49, while Dish Network rose 2.3 percent to $64.01. Straight Path had said in January it was hiring investment bank Evercore Partners to help explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of assets. The company had also agreed in January to pay the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) $15 million to settle a federal probe of claims that Straight Path had submitted false data to renew airwave licenses. The tax-free deal, valued at $1.6 billion in total, includes liabilities and amounts to be remitted to the FCC, according to the January settlement terms. The deal with AT&T is supported by Straight Path's majority shareholder, Howard Jonas, who has entered into a voting agreement with the carrier in support of the transaction. Evercore advised Straight Path on the deal and Weil, Gotshal & Manges provided legal counsel, while AT&T was advised by Moelis & Co. and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton.

But the air almost went out of the room on the bank's earnings conference call when the CEO, whose overseen a double in JPMorgan's stock price over the last five years, joked about joining the Trump administration. When asked by Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Burnell during a conference call about the number of open positions inside the White House, specifically those relevant to regulating banks, Dimon interrupted: ""I said I'm not interested."" Dimon's name was thrown around for a White House position, including Treasury secretary, following President Donald Trump's presidential victory. ""I'm kidding,"" Dimon added. The Trump administration has struggled to fill a number of key positions, including Labor secretary. Andrew Puzder, Trump's first nominee for the post, withdrew from consideration in late January. Current nominee Alexander Acosta's vote was still pending as of Thursday. But Dimon didn't sound worried at all, reiterating his faith in Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Trump Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn, both Goldman Sachs alums. ""They want to find the right people for those jobs,"" Dimon said. ""I gather they are talking to lots of people. But even after they announced it, remember they need to be vetted and confirmed, and that ... can take 90 days. So the sooner the better, but I think getting the right people is equally important."" Dimon did get serious at one point during the call, saying current regulations are crippling many consumers' ability to achieve the American dream and take out a mortgage, a problem he thinks needs addressing.

Bove, vice president of equity research and financial sector analyst at Rafferty Capital, said banks are a ""very treacherous area"" to invest in, and the reasons people are investing are ""simply wacko.""

""If the yield on the 10-year goes up, which means the value of bank assets go down, bank stocks go up."" Bond prices typically go down as yield rises.

While there was little obvious direct impact from the bank's scandal-plagued 2016, the $29 million year-over-year drop in its quarterly earnings reflects Wells Fargo's ongoing efforts to put its fake-account scandal in the rearview mirror. ""Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results,"" said CEO Tim Sloan. ""We have taken significant actions throughout the company to date and we are committed to building a better bank as we move Wells Fargo forward."" The iconic Wells Fargo stagecoach. Image source: Wells Fargo. There were two particular bright spots in Wells Fargo's performance. In the first case, its loan loss provisions fell 44%, or $481 million, compared to the same quarter last year, when banks boosted provisions in anticipation of loan defaults throughout the energy sector as oil prices dropped below $30 a barrel. ""First quarter credit results reflected strong performance in our commercial portfolios and consumer real estate portfolios,"" said chief risk officer Mike Loughlin. ""Improvement in the oil and gas portfolio, as well as continued improvement in residential real estate, drove a $200 million reserve release in the quarter."" On top of this, Wells Fargo saw the amount of money it earned from its portfolio of loans and securities increase by 5%, or $633 million. This was fueled by the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the fed funds rate twice since the beginning of December. Metric Q1 2017 Change (YOY) Net revenue $22 billion (1%) Provision for credit losses $605 million (44%) Noninterest expenses $13.8 billion 6% Net income $5.1 billion (1%) Data source: Wells Fargo. YOY = year over year. However, these two positive trends were outweighed by a drop in Wells Fargo's noninterest income and an increase in its operating costs. Its noninterest income suffered in particular from a 23% drop in mortgage banking income. Meanwhile, its costs were higher on a sequential basis due to seasonally higher employee benefits and incentive compensation expenses -- heightened regulatory and compliance expenses related to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 aren't helping either. It's here where the ongoing impact of Wells Fargo's fake-account scandal is most pronounced. The bank's efficiency ratio, which measures the percent of revenue consumed by operating expenses, increased to 62.7% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 58.7% in the year-ago period. Given the singular importance of efficiency when it comes to maximizing profitability in the bank industry, this is a concerning trend. And it's all the more so given that Wells Fargo long had a reputation for being one of the leanest banks in the industry. The net result is that Wells Fargo will almost certainly be one of the only big banks in the country to report a year-over-year decline in first-quarter earnings and profitability. Analysts expected this, but Wells Fargo's stock was nevertheless down by more than 3% in intraday trading on Thursday. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, announced that it's selling around 9 million shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock. At first glance, this may sound like an alarming development -- after all, Wells Fargo is one of Berkshire's largest stock investments and is a company Buffett has praised many times. However, Buffett's reasons for selling have nothing to do with the stock as an investment. Berkshire Hathaway said on April 12 that it's selling about 9 million shares of its Wells Fargo stock position. It has already sold 7.1 million shares and plans to sell another 1.9 million. Image source: The Motley Fool. This may sound like a massive amount of stock (and it is, to most people), but this move will still leave Berkshire with about 491 million shares of the banking giant. So the sale represents less than 2% of Berkshire's total Wells Fargo stake. In addition, Berkshire specifically says that the sale has nothing to do with Wells Fargo, or the notorious ""fake accounts"" scandal that made headlines in 2016. Instead, the company is selling some of its Wells Fargo stock to keep its position below 10% of the bank's total outstanding shares, allowing it to avoid additional Federal Reserve regulations. It's also important to point out that it could (and probably will) need to sell more of its shares in future quarters, for the same purpose. As Wells Fargo repurchases shares of its own stock, Buffett's stake will represent a growing percentage of the company, so further sales could be necessary to stay under the 10% threshold in the long term. If you glance at Berkshire's portfolio, you'll notice that the company's Wells Fargo stake makes up just about 9.55% of the outstanding shares, so it may seem as if the stake is already small enough to satisfy regulators. However, Buffett owns a smaller piece of Wells Fargo in his personal account, which, combined with Berkshire's shares, made the total stake he had influence over exceed the 10% threshold. Without getting too technical, the Federal Reserve exerts more oversight on investors with large stakes in banks -- defined as 10% or more. What's more, to continue to own more than 10% of Wells Fargo, Berkshire would need permission from the Fed and would need to make the case that it had no intention to exert a ""controlling influence."" In July 2016, Buffett made such a request, stating at the time that ""Berkshire is seeking permission to retain its current ownership position ... and to acquire additional shares of common stock of Wells Fargo for investment purposes."" The application also made clear that Berkshire had no plans to make any significant changes to Wells Fargo's strategy or structure, nor did it have any desire to make changes to the bank's board. However, as part of the announcement made recently revealing the sale of some of his shares, Berkshire said that after months of talks with Fed officials, keeping the stake of more than 10% wasn't in Berkshire's best interest. Warren Buffett and his team are selling Wells Fargo shares to control the size of its position, not because of anything to do with the bank as a long-term investment. Keep in mind that this is a similar activity to the portfolio rebalancing many investors do regularly. For example, I recently revealed that after doubling over the past year, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has become my largest stock holding. I still think Bank of America has massive upside potential, but It's likely that I'll end up selling some of my shares in the near future. Nothing against the stock -- I just want to keep my position at a certain size. Similar logic applies here. The bottom line is that you shouldn't read too much into this move. To keep the size of his Wells Fargo stake under a certain threshold, Buffett is selling less than 2% of his shares. There's no reason to think that Wells Fargo isn't still one of Buffett's favorite banks, or that the selling will continue. If you have a positive opinion of Wells Fargo as a long-term investment, this news shouldn't change your mind. ","

To close or not to close your credit card accounts. That is the credit score question. In the previously recorded Facebook Live video segment below, Motley Fool analysts Michael Douglass and Nathan Hamilton answer a user-submitted question about when to close old credit card accounts. Michael Douglass: We'll do one more because this is a really good one. It's from Jennifer, and she asks...I'm just going to summarize as best I can. Switched from Wells Fargo to a credit union, transferred credit card balance to a low-interest card as a starting point to pay it all off. Before closing her account with Wells, she was advised to just keep the line of credit open and not use it because it helps her credit. We've talked about credit utilization, so this kind of gets into that. Is that good advice, or does it make better sense to close that card? Of course, one thing that she mentioned is she's got a good credit score and hasn't had any issue abstaining from using that credit since. That's really important, of course, because if you have two accounts open and you're like, ""I guess I'll just use both,"" obviously that would not be great. Your thoughts? Nathan Hamilton: First off, I'll just say congratulations, Jennifer, transferring to a low-interest card and managing your credit score well. For the closed account, generally it does make sense, if you are not incurring an annual fee, to keep that account open. There's no harm in doing so for the most part if she's not tapping it for credit. Douglass: It shows age of account. They don't necessarily want to see, ""You've been on a credit card for six months, and you were on a credit card before that for six months and before that for six months."" It's kind of almost a little bit like having a job. You don't want to be floating from job to job. Hamilton: Looking at, you mentioned account age. That is also a factor that is accounted for in your FICO score, so to have the best credit scores out there to really get your credit score rocking, what FICO wants to see is an average credit age of at least five years. As she keeps that account open, even if it's not incurring an annual fee, if there's no cost of keeping it open, then I would say in most any scenario, it's going to make sense to leave it as is.

Motley Fool Staff,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) has long been one of the most efficient big banks in the United States. But the Minneapolis-based bank doesn't approach efficiency in the same way that most of its competitors do. As opposed to focusing on expenses, U.S. Bancorp has minimized its efficiency ratio by driving revenue. A full transcript follows the video. Gaby Lapera: Let's talk about efficiency ratios. What is an efficiency ratio? Very easy question for you. John Maxfield: Efficiency ratio, this just measures the percentage of revenue that a bank spends on operating expenses. Lapera: Yes. So, the lower the efficiency ratio, the better. Most banks shoot for an efficiency ratio of around 60%. Drumroll. I don't think you can hear that. [laughs] Maxfield: It's a very quiet drum. [laughs] Lapera: What is U.S. Bancorp's efficiency ratio? Maxfield: U.S. Bancorp's efficiency ratio last year, its GAAP efficiency ratio, which is just taking your non-interest expenses, so, your operating expenses divided by net revenue, was 55%. Lapera: That's really good, for people who don't know. Amongst the other top big banks, you have Bank of America sitting at 66%, Wells Fargo and [Citigroup] both around 59%, [JPMorgan Chase] around 58%, and those are the big banks. In general, they operate pretty well. Below the eighth-largest bank, most banks' efficiency ratios are pretty above 60%. There is an exception. I think New York Community Bancorp might be the country's 25th biggest bank, but it's doing this thing where it's been sitting around $48.9 billion in assets so it doesn't trip the regulatory threshold for having more regulations put on it. And its efficiency ratio is abnormally low at 44.5%. It's a really interesting bank because of the niche that it lives in, it lends primarily the people in New York City, to people who are looking for multifamily residences -- read that as apartment buildings. New York City is a great place to do that because of rent control. You know that your building is always going to be full of tenants, and you know those tenants are going to pay on time because they're living in some of the cheapest apartments in the city, and that means landlords always make their payments. And since New York Community Bancorp is operating in this very special environment, its costs are much lower, and its income is much more reliable than other banks, hence the very low efficiency ratio. Barring that, 55% is incredible. Maxfield: Yeah, 55%, it's incredible, because U.S. Bancorp is more of a general-purpose bank. But I'm glad you brought up a New York Community Bancorp, because it illustrates a really important point. Let me pull up a little bit and give a broader perspective, and then we'll dig in a little bit more. I think it was in his 1990 shareholder letter, or 1991, where Warren Buffett -- and, I talk about Warren Buffett a lot in terms of banking because he really understands banking, perhaps more than anybody, but those great bankers I listed at the beginning of the show, Warren Buffett understands it more. He says, ""If you want to outperform in an industry that is highly commoditized, like banking is, two things have to be the case. Either one, you have to have a niche product and earn outsized margins because you have expertise in that particular area that nobody else has; or, you have to be the low-cost producer. That New York Community Bancorp, it's in that niche area, and that's why it's been able to outperform the industry so much over the last few decades. Here's what's so interesting about what Richard Davis has to say about the efficiency ratio and how that plays into how Warren Buffett sees banking. Richard Davis says, ""You don't drive efficiency through lowering expenses. You drive efficiency through increasing your revenue."" There's a great quote, let me pull that up. He says, ""He who has the lowest efficiency ratio also often has the biggest revenue, which is in the denominator."" And this is true. If you look at, not the efficiency ratio, but if you actually look at expenses as a percentage of assets, U.S. Bancorp's expenses as a percentage of assets is actually higher than a lot of these other big banks. But its revenue as a percentage of assets is much, much higher on a relative basis, relative to its expenses. That's why its efficiency ratio is so low. So then you say, ""Look, how do you get your efficiency ratio so low?"" And the answer to that, in U.S. Bancorp's case, is twofold. Number one, and this ties back into Buffett's point, Richard Davis says, ""You have to go after businesses where,"" let me give you exactly what he said. ""A bank needs to look at what it does and get into businesses where it can, one, be better than everyone else, two, where it has skills that no one else has, or three, where it can outperform its own history."" He's basically saying, ""Look, Warren Buffett's paradigm,"" and I don't think he meant to say like this, but this is how I look at it, ""Warren Buffett's paradigm where if you want to outperform, you either have to be a niche operator or the low-cost operator, those two things are not mutually exclusive. In fact, you can be a low-cost operator by running it through a niche operation, because that will jack up your revenue and make your efficiency ratio go down."" ","

When it comes to analyzing bank stocks, few metrics are as important as the efficiency ratio, which reflects the percentage of a bank's net revenue that's consumed by operating expenses. But while most banks struggle to get their efficiency ratios below 60%, PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) turned in a ratio of 52.5% last year, ranking it first in its peer group. A full transcript follows the video. Gaby Lapera: The reason we're talking about PNC Bank is because we talked about how great U.S. Bancorp's efficiency ratio is, and PNC Bank has an even better one. John Maxfield: Yeah. If you think about it, when you're analyzing banks as an investor, there's a couple of statistics that are really central that you're going to want to check first. Efficiency ratio is one of those. We talked about it last week, the efficiency ratio tells you the percentage of net revenue that is being consumed by operating expenses. Most banks want to get around 60%, that's what most are targeting right now. But PNC's efficiency ratio is 52.5%. So, what does that mean? The average bank in its peer group has a 62% efficiency ratio. What that means is that 10% more of PNC's revenue is available to pay taxes, cover loan-loss provisions, and to drop to the bottom line. So it has an enormous advantage right out of the chute. Lapera: Definitely. And the things that make up the efficiency ratio are expenses and assets. Maxfield: Expenses and revenue, rather. Lapera: Expenses and revenue, sorry. Not assets. Thank you. What I was going to say is, PNC has the highest revenue as a percent of asset. PNC does have the highest revenue as a percent of assets in its class, and it's over 1%, which is great. That's generally what you want to see in banks, anything over 1% is gravy. Most banks are not there yet. Maxfield: I think we mixed up some numbers. Their revenue as a percent of assets is 4.92%, which is the highest in its peer group, and its peer group are the really large, too-big-to-fail banks, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, plus other large regional banks. So that's the largest with one exception, and that is Capital One. The reason that Capital One's revenue is so high as a percentage of assets is because a very large portion of its loan portfolio consists of credit card loans, and those yield, as everybody knows, a lot more than, say, a home mortgage does. So its revenue as a percent of assets is the top in its peer group. But then, if you translate that over into profitability, that's where that 1.1% return on assets is. When you're talking about profitability for banks, there's two measures that you want to look at: your return on assets and your return on equity. Return on assets is basically your unlevered profitability. Your return on equity is your levered profitability. Here's the interesting thing about PNC, and this is one of the reasons that it doesn't pop up a lot when investors are looking for the top-performing banks -- it's because their return on common equity last year was 8.58%. When you're looking for a 10% return on equity, you think, that's actually meaningfully below that standard industry benchmark that you want to see. But the reason that it's below, as we see with its good return on assets, is just because it's not very levered, which means it's a very safe bank that's still earning a lot of money if you look at it on a levered basis. Lapera: Yes. And in my defense, 4.92% is above 1%. [laughs] Maxfield: [laughs] Absolutely. ","

Peg Brickley,04132017,MarketWatch,04062017,"Published: Apr 10, 2017 9:06 a.m. ET By Information-technology consulting firm Ciber Inc. filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sunday with a $50 million buyout offer from France's Capgemini for its North American and Indian assets. Ciber is targeting a May 15 bankruptcy auction, if competing bids come in to top the offer from Capgemini, an information-technology, outsourcing and consulting firm that employs 190,000 people in 40 countries. A bankruptcy loan of up to $45 million from Wells Fargo & Co. will fund Ciber's continued operations during the sale process, according to papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. Capgemini is also proposing to take on some of Ciber's obligations, as part of its offer. Ciber operates in the U.S., the U.K., and Denmark, and has centers in India, Vietnam and Poland. Major shareholders include BlackRock Inc., Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, Frontier Capital Management Co. LLC, and Invesco Ltd., according to court papers. Founded in 1974, Ciber grew through acquisitions, and, at its peak, employed more than 8,600 people. Years of decline in demand and performance in its European market, however, ate into Ciber's finances, court papers say. Customer defections that began in 2014 made it difficult for Ciber to restore European operations to profitability, according to court filings. Business operations in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden were shut down recently, according to the company. Ciber employs approximately 2,200 people, as well as 315 independent contractors, while subsidiaries in India employ about 1,350 people. The company generated revenue of about $610 million in 2016. Bankruptcy-court filings reflect Ciber's debts and assets are each in the $50 million to $100 million range.

                                   Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has said his bank has benefited in fixed-income trading from the exit from that business by many European banks that are struggling with new capital requirements that have made some businesses unprofitable. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading all rebounded in 2016 after a long period of weakness that led many to cut staff on trading desks. The big U.S. banks were key gainers immediately after the surprise election of President Donald Trump in November, partly fueled by expectations his administration will roll back some of the rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis to avoid a repeat. But bank stock gains have been pared in recent months as those same expectations have been scaled back. The pullback “is solely a function of policy uncertainty out of Washington, with market participants tempering expectations for tax and regulatory reform in the wake of the health care standoff,” said Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks. “This reaction likely makes sense. But we do want to point out that the overall backdrop for this industry remains very favorable, particularly given the Fed’s monetary policy stance.” In his annual shareholder letter published last week, Dimon called for simpler and better-coordinated rules that would encourage lending and promote growth. Dimon said it would be unwise “to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules” but said it would be “appropriate to open up the rulebook.” Dimon is a member of Trump’s business council of 16 top executives.

He also argued against the “gold plating” of international standards, referring to the stricter rules demanded of U.S. banks compared with their international peers, which he said would free up more capital for lending without damaging the safety of the system.

(That often-mocked gang was just hit with another scorecard detailing how indexes have trounced most actively managed funds.) Yes, says our call of the day, which comes from Nir Kaissar, founder and portfolio manager at Unison Advisors. But his upbeat view is largely based on elevated valuations. The U.S. stock market “looks very expensive,” and that means the S&P 500’s returns over the next decade “are not going to be great,” said Kaissar, while co-starring in WisdomTree’s latest “Behind The Markets” podcast. And so he has bet that hedge funds will outperform the S&P over the next 10 years, with Ritholtz Wealth Management’s Ben Carlson taking the other side of the wager and discussing it in the podcast. It’s basically a redo of Warren Buffett’s famous $1 million bet that an index fund would beat a selection of hedge funds over a decade.

Except only a beer is at stake this time — and passive-funds fan Carlson is conceding that the bet won’t be a blowout this time. “I think it’ll actually be a much closer race than the one that Buffett’s in now, because I agree with you — we’re at above-average valuations,” Carlson, known for his A Wealth of Common Sense blog, told Kaissar. “I don’t think that means we have to see a market crash — like a lot of people tend to believe — but I think it’s safe after a huge bull market to alter your expectations and assume lower-than-average returns follow above-average returns,” he said. And Carlson has thrown another bone to the 2-and-20 set (2% annual fixed fee and 20% of profits): “Something that people forget is that hedge funds are really a ‘cash-plus asset structure,’” so a rising-interest-rate environment could actually help them, he said.

                                   . So much for the bromance with Putin? As Trump says U.S.-Russia relations “may be at an all-time low” with tensions over Syria rising, there is no question that Russia’s main stock benchmark has fallen to its all-time low in the Trump era. In other words, the Micex index has touched levels last seen before Trump’s election win. (Hat tip to The Daily Shot newsletter for highlighting the Moscow meltdown.) “NATO is the most successful military alliance in human history. This was the right decision.” — Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, is among those reacting to Trump saying yesterday that NATO is “no longer obsolete.” In another change, ICYMI, Trump has said he won’t label China a currency manipulator as he works with Beijing to counter North Korea.

                                   shares dropped 1.9% in midday trade Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration released a warning letter to the company about the way it manufactures its medical devices. The facility in question was acquired by Abbott in its purchase of St. Jude Medical, which was completed in January. Though Abbott recalled certain implantable cardioverter defibrillators, which are used to treat irregular heartbeats, in October, 10 of the medical devices were later shipped out and an additional seven were put into patients, the FDA said. In this and other issues, Abbott didn't provide evidence of its corrective and preventive actions in its response to the FDA, the regulator said. If the letter's points aren't addressed promptly, the FDA said it may start regulatory actions such as seizure, injunction and civil money penalties, or there could be consequences for federal contracts or FDA approvals for related devices. Abbott leadership, which has 15 days to respond to the letter, ""does not expect today's warning letter to negatively impact products currently on the market, although it may affect new product approvals,"" including approvals for devices expected in the fourth quarter, said UBS analyst Matt Miksic. The letter could cause bad publicity for Abbott, since ""the language in the warning letter is such that public image of overall ABT may be affected,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Lawrence Biegelsen, who estimated the issues in the letter could be resolved in as little time as nine to 12 months. ""We take these matters seriously, continue to make progress on our corrective actions, will closely review FDA's warning letter, and are committed to fully addressing FDA's concerns,"" an Abbott spokesperson said. The company may release more information when it reports first-quarter earnings results, scheduled for Wednesday premarket. Abbott shares have risen 21.9% over the last three months, compared with a 3.2% rise in the S&P 500

Barbara Kollmeyer,04132017,MarketWatch,04062017,"Published: Apr 11, 2017 9:42 a.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By Tone-deaf comments from United Airlines’s CEO add to woes for the carrier this morning and shareholders, with stocks on a flight path to fall this morning. That’s not going to help the S&P 500, which looks stuck in a rut right now. What investors should do, says Josh Brown of the Reformed Broker blog, is take a look at an unloved asset class that may just barrel past the S&P 500 this year. He provides our call of the day, with this comment: “Foreign stocks are so despised (or ignored) at this point that it would make perfect sense for them to start a bout of outperformance vs. U.S. stocks.” Brown notes that for the first quarter of this year, the MSCI All Country World Index ex-USA is up nearly 9%, compared with just under 6% for the S&P 500

                                   . Investors who have been busy discussing whether the next 5% move for U.S. stocks will be up or down should remember that Wall Street stocks account for just over half of the global stock market. And “this ‘next 5%’ myopia could lead to missed opportunities,” says Brown. His team compared the first quarter and full-year performances of both the S&P 500 and MSCI All-Country World ex-USA index (using an index price net of dividends). They found that between 1970 and 2016, foreign stocks outperformed those in the U.S. in 22 of those 47 years. But during those years where foreign stocks came out ahead in the first quarter, they beat the S&P 500 in 17 of them — 77% of the time, notes Brown. Of course, he points out that foreign stocks have fallen behind after great starts, with currency trends just one factor that can surprise. Here’s his chart that shows 10-year rolling returns for U.S. and foreign stocks. The red line indicates where the S&P 500 is underperforming, and the green shows the opposite: It’s not a perfect system, but, says Brown, the “rewards of diversification have a habit of showing up at precisely the time that we need them to over the long run.” Read the whole blog here.

Margin debt — which is basically investors taking on more debt to buy stocks — hit a high in nominal terms in February. That has had some concerned. But Callum Thomas, blogging for See It Market, says calm your fears, as the real story is in this chart: The chart shows spikes or rapid acceleration in margin debt peaked in the crisis years of 2000 and 2007. But Thomas says at present, there’s no sign of a rapid dash into that debt. Nor is there any big rush to the exits — another reason this indicator is not much of a worry right now.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari is set to take part in a Q&A at the Minnesota Business Partnership in Minneapolis at 1:45 p.m. Eastern.

We will hold the U.S. wholly accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its outrageous actions.” — That was a spokesman for North Korea’s foreign ministry early Tuesday in response to a U.S. Navy strike group sent to Korean Peninsula on Sunday.

Barbara Kollmeyer,04132017,MarketWatch,04062017,"Published: Apr 10, 2017 9:47 a.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By The stock rally’s not done yet, and there’s another 15% pop ahead, according to strategists at one big bank. That would be good news for those who saw April — a historically good month for stocks — get off to a lackluster start, not helped by downbeat jobs data and geopolitical headlines. So our call of the day from Morgan Stanley says there’s more upside to this equity market, and this is not the time for bulls to falter. As the team, led by Michael Wilson, explains, the economy is in the late stages of an upturn that started a year ago, which got turbocharged by the U.S. election. Stocks got a boost as a result. “The end of the cycle is often the best. Think 1999 or 2006-07. In a low-return world, investors cannot afford to miss it,” say Michael J. Wilson and the team at Morgan Stanley. “It has taken eight long years to get here, but Wall and Main Street are finally starting to feel better about the future,” they add. Among the reasons they say it’s a good time for stocks: equity valuations are undemanding with borrowing rates low; so-called secular stagnation, or a no-growth period for the economy, is over; and very loose financial conditions are encouraging a shift toward investor euphoria. Morgan Stanley’s base-case 12-month target for the S&P 500 is 2,700 — 15% above current levels — while their bull case stretches up to 3,000. As for what to buy in the last throes of this cycle, Wilson says they like financials, industrials, energy and telecoms, but are less keen on real estate, telecom and staples. They prefer small and mid-caps. Check out their heat map for more on that: As for risks, the Morgan Stanley team says commercial real estate and autos both show “serious signs of distress” regarding credit exposure. They could be the canaries in the coal mine for a downturn. And if oil prices fail to recover, that could mean energy companies — the single biggest driver of S&P 500 earnings this year — cut guidance.

",The S&P 500 still has another 15% pop left this year — here’s why - MarketWatch
,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co posted flat quarterly earnings on Thursday and warned its costs would remain elevated as the fallout from a sales practices scandal continues to impact the third-largest U.S. bank. Higher personnel costs and legal fees as well as lower mortgage banking revenues kept Wells Fargo’s first-quarter net income broadly flat at $5.5 billion and the San Francisco-based bank said expenses as a share of revenues would remain high. Wells Fargo is trying to put a scandal over the opening of unauthorized accounts behind it and earlier this week said it would claw back an additional $75 million of compensation from the two former executives it blamed most for the debacle. Known for consistently growing revenues and earnings in the post-crisis era, Wells Fargo has been thrown off course by the sales controversy and in recent quarters has also been disadvantaged by its smaller trading footprint. Wall Street rivals have bounced back as bond and currency markets roared back to life last year with JPMorgan and Citi each reporting a 17 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday, beating analyst expectations and boosting their shares. Wells Fargo’s revenues fell about 1 percent to $22 billion and missed the average estimate of $22.32 billion. On a per share basis, profit rose to $1.00 from 99 cents a year earlier, beating the average analyst estimate of 97 cents. Chief Executive Tim Sloan told analysts he expected new account and credit card openings to recover in the third quarter after a steady decline since the sales scandal broke in September but the bank said costs associated with the controversy, which were $80 million in the first quarter, would remain around $70 million to $80 million for an unspecified period. “I think it will be at least a few more quarters,” Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in an interview with Reuters. The bank’s efficiency ratio, a closely watched number reflecting non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 62.7 percent, compared with 58.7 percent a year ago and Sloan said it would be a challenge to get back to a preferred 55 to 59 percent level. “I want to make it very clear that operating at this level is not acceptable,” he said. Sloan added that the bank will unveil at its investor day in May additional cost savings initiatives beyond the annual $2 billion in savings they are targeting starting in 2018. The bank also plans to reduce headcount in businesses such as mortgage if, as expected, business gets slower. Sloan faces a rocky shareholder meeting on April 25 after influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services called on investors to vote against 12 out of 15 directors, including Chairman Stephen Sanger. The bank’s stock was down 2.5 percent at mid-afternoon on Thursday, the worst performer in the S&P 500 Financials Index. After the close on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder, said it withdrew an application to the Federal Reserve to boost its ownership stake above 10 percent, and is instead selling 9 million shares to keep it below that threshold. The Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates in March for the second time in three months has been welcomed by banks which earn more from lending out their deposits when rates rise. Higher rates helped Wells Fargo earn more from lending with a 5 percent rise to $12.3 billion in its net interest income. But higher rates can also put off borrowers, and Wells had a decline in total loans to $958 billion from nearly $968 billion in the prior quarter with a near $8 billion drop in consumer loans in that period. Wells Fargo’s mortgage business, the largest in the United States by volume, saw a 23 percent drop in fee income to $1.23 billion as customers shied away from refinancing their home loans. Mortgage borrowing was likewise a dark spot in JPMorgan’s results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to $406 million from $667 million. Wells’ consumer business is also feeling the impact from its unauthorized accounts scandal with a steady decline in the number of consumers opening checking and credit card accounts. Overall net profit at its retail bank, its biggest profit center, fell 9 percent due to a drop in fee income. Wells’ wholesale banking division, which provides loans and other services to corporate clients, reported a 10 percent increase in net profit from a year ago. Costs at Wells Fargo rose 6 percent compared to the year-ago period as the bank shelled out more for salaries as well as the legal costs related to the scandal. ","

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"The U.S. bank said on Tuesday that it is piloting the virtual assistant with several hundred employees, and plans to extend testing to a few thousand customers later this spring. Wells Fargo’s chatbot will use artificial intelligence to respond to natural language messages from users, such as how much money they have in their accounts, and where the nearest bank ATM is. Chatbots have risen in popularity in finance and other industries over the past few months because recent improvements in artificial intelligence have made them better at interacting and interpreting human language. Banks and other financial firms are hopeful chatbots can be used to provide better and continuous customer service at the fraction of the cost of large call centers populated by humans. Money transfer startup TransferWise in February launched a Facebook chatbot that enables customers to send money to friends and family internationally from Facebook Messenger. Wells Fargo’s chatbot, which does not yet have a name, comes as the bank ramps up its development of artificial intelligence-based technology. In February it created a dedicated AI team to create technology, such as the new chatbot, that can help the bank provide more personalized customer service through its bankers and online. “AI technology allows us to take an experience that would have required our customers to navigate through several pages on our website, and turn it into a simple conversation in a chat environment,” said Steve Ellis, head of Wells Fargo’s Innovation Group, where the company’s AI team is based. Facebook opened up its Messenger app to developers to create chatbots in April 2016 in a bid to expand its reach in customer service and enterprise transactions. ","

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"In one of its toughest shareholder notes, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended earlier this month that investors vote against 12 of the 15 directors on Wells Fargo’s ballot at the company’s annual meeting on April 25, including independent chairman Stephen Sanger. ISS argued they had all failed in their oversight duties. The recommendation was another blow to the country’s third-largest bank, which has been struggling for months to move past revelations that thousands of employees created as many as 2 million accounts in customers’ names without permission to hit lofty sales targets. ISS’s recommendation followed one by Glass Lewis, its closest competitor, which recommended votes against six directors for similar reasons.   The ball is now in the shareholders’ court. A sampling of investors who spoke to Reuters were split on how to vote. It would be extremely unusual for most directors at a company the size of Wells Fargo to turn over suddenly, without pressure from an activist investor, but ISS’s scathing review was also rare. According to Proxy Insight, among the 2,780 meetings held by S&P 500 companies since 2012, ISS has recommended votes against 80 percent or more of directors in just seven cases besides Wells Fargo. Each involved a special circumstance, like only a few directors being up for re-election. ISS’s Wells Fargo recommendation was “among the harshest that I can recall,” said Bruce Goldfarb, president of proxy solicitation firm Okapi Partners. An ISS spokesman declined to comment. Wells Fargo representatives cited an April 7 statement calling the ISS recommendation “extreme and unprecedented.” ISS is the largest proxy adviser, with about 1,700 clients versus Glass Lewis’s 1,200, and has faced concerns it wields undue influence over corporate elections. On average, directors who ISS recommends “against” receive 17 percent to 18 percent less support, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy. Activists have criticized big fund managers for blindly following ISS. Institutional investors have built up large corporate governance departments in recent years and say they make their own judgments. But breaking with ISS and supporting the whole Wells Fargo board could be difficult for fund firms, said Michael Goldstein, a Babson College finance professor. “This may be one of those cases where you don’t want to have to answer a lot of questions about why did you support these people,” Goldstein said. If shareholders do vote against some of Wells Fargo’s directors, it does not mean they will immediately leave. The bank’s guidelines require directors offer to resign if they fail to receive a majority of votes cast, but leaves the board wiggle room in deciding whether to accept a resignation. Wells Fargo’s board and management have said the steps taken to fix problems and punish employees responsible for sales abuses show there is now strong oversight, and that directors nominated deserve to be elected. In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan said ousting most of the board would be “crazy.” The San Francisco-based bank paid $190 million in a September regulatory settlement for the unauthorized accounts, igniting a public firestorm that hammered its shares and led to the resignation of then-Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. Since then, Sloan replaced Stumpf, and Sanger became the independent chairman. The board took steps like eliminating sales goals, revamping its compensation structure and withholding or clawing back tens of millions of dollars of bonuses. Rhode Island Treasurer Seth Magaziner, who oversees funds that own Wells Fargo shares, said they will vote against directors flagged by ISS. “Directors are meant to be agents for the shareholders, and watchdogs for the investors,” he said. “Clearly that level of oversight was lacking at Wells Fargo.” Others were supportive. Gideon Bernstein, partner at wealth management firm Leisure Capital, said he plans to back the board. He was impressed with the bank’s April 10 report describing what went wrong, and actions taken in response. “The board has done a really good job drilling down,” he said. Thomas Russo, managing member at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, said he has not yet decided how to vote. He wants to see a smaller board with more banking experience. “There’s an elevated sense of urgency in a smaller board and a board that has more specific knowledge,” he said. Executives at American Century Investments also have not yet decided. Senior investment analyst Adam Krenn said the bank’s oversight and initial response was lacking. But portfolio manager Michael Liss praised the eventual response. “Even though they were late in reacting, they certainly came down strong,” he said. ","

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"The Federal Reserve’s decision to hike rates in March for the second time in three months led investors to reposition portfolios, as did elections in Europe and news about Britain’s progress in leaving the European Union. That increased activity boosted first-quarter revenue in JPMorgan’s markets-related businesses, particularly fixed-income trading. The bank also reported growth in loans and deposits and was able to earn more from lending as interest rates ticked higher. However, its pace of loan growth, much like in the broader U.S. banking industry, has slackened recently. Overall, JPMorgan earned $6.4 billion in the first quarter, or $1.65 per share, up from $5.5 billion, or $1.35 per share a year earlier. The bank’s total net revenue rose 6 percent to $24.7 billion from $23.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.52 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan shares rose 0.5 percent to $85.79 in premarket trading. JPMorgan’s corporate and investment banking division, which includes the trading business, reported a 17 percent rise in revenue to $9.5 billion, the biggest gain among its four major business lines. Weaker advisory fees were more than offset by gains in revenue from underwriting, securitized products, interest rate-related products, prime brokerage and corporate derivatives. On a conference call with journalists, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said some customers decided to borrow by issuing bonds rather than taking out loans. Mortgage borrowing was a dark spot in the bank’s results, with mortgage fees and loan servicing revenue tumbling 39 percent to $406 million from $667 million. Higher interest rates have dissuaded borrowers from refinancing, and JPMorgan executives had said in February they expected non-interest mortgage revenue to fall throughout the year. Even so, the bank managed to grow its core book of loans by 9 percent on an annual basis and nearly 1 percent from the prior quarter. Its net interest income, an important measure of profitability that shows the difference between a bank’s cost of money and how much it receives for the funds, rose 6 percent. In a statement, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said U.S. consumers and businesses are “healthy overall” and that the economy could further improve if the government pursues pro-growth initiatives. ","

Ramamurti, a legislative aide for Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, is a contender for one of the vacancies on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the matter. Ramamurti is senior counsel to Warren on banking and economic policy and she is staunchly backing him for the SEC job, one of the sources told Reuters. The sources spoke anonymously because deliberations on candidates for the SEC, which is the primary regulator that polices and writes rules for Wall Street, are not public. Ramamurti declined to comment. A source said a decision on the post was not imminent. In prior instances with President Donald Trump’s administration, candidates in the running for positions were sometimes dropped after their names became public. Other names that are in the mix include Vermont Law School professor Jennifer Taub, the AFL-CIO’s office of investment director Heather Slavkin Corzo and Andy Green, a managing director at the Center for American Progress who previously worked for SEC Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein, the sources told Reuters. Taub and Green declined to comment and Slavkin Corzo could not be immediately reached. A spokesperson for the White House declined to comment, saying he could not discuss personnel matters. Trump must nominate three people to fill out the five-member panel, which currently is down to two commissioners - Acting Chairman Michael Piwowar, a Republican, and Stein. The nomination of Wall Street deal-making attorney Jay Clayton, Trump’s choice to lead the SEC, was approved by the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month. Clayton, an independent, is still awaiting confirmation by the full Senate, which is currently away for Easter recess. Trump has not yet formally nominated anyone else for the remaining SEC spots - one Democrat and one Republican. Warren, a progressive Democrat, has been critical of the Trump administration’s plans to roll back the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. She voted against Clayton’s nomination, saying his employment as a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell representing large banks creates too many conflicts of interest and may prevent him from being a tough regulator. As her counsel on the banking committee, Ramamurti has played a prominent role in shaping Warren’s policy agenda. He helped steer her investigative efforts into the Wells Fargo fake accounts scandal and worked on bipartisan efforts to broker a deal on housing reforms for mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The S&P 500 banks index .SPXBK closed at its lowest point since early December. Investors have sought safe-haven assets throughout the week due to geopolitical tensions in Syria and North Korea. News of a massive bomb being dropped by the United States in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday added to uncertainty. Kate Warne, principal investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said a dip in bond yields put pressure on stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States. “What we’ve seen is investors from the rest of the world putting more money in U.S. Treasuries” due to geopolitical concerns, Warne said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 138.61 points, or 0.67 percent, to 20,453.25, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 15.98 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,328.95 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 31.01 points, or 0.53 percent, to 5,805.15. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed 8.9 percent since President Donald Trump’s Nov. 8 election, supported by his planned economic agenda of tax cuts and economic stimulus. But the rally has stalled the past six weeks as some investors question Trump’s ability to enact his proposals. There is “some concern among investors that there is now a shift going on in Washington to international and away from a domestic policy,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY dropped 1.3 percent, its fifth straight day of losses. Energy shares .SPNY were the worst-performing group, falling 1.8 percent. The technology sector .SPLRCT fell 0.4 percent, marking its longest losing streak since May 2012. The results from banks kicked off what is expected to be a strong first-quarter U.S. reporting season. S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 10.4 percent rise in earnings for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We could have double-digit earnings growth; we haven’t seen that in some time,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. “Investors are going to be impressed with that.” A report from the University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly strengthened in April as consumer optimism on current economic conditions climbed to its highest level since November 2000.

Companies plan to use the spectrum to build new networks or improve existing coverage. The spectrum auction’s end is widely expected to kick off a wave of deal-making in the telecom industry. Until now, companies participating in the auction have been restrained by a quiet period, but that will end after April 27, when down payments are due from auction winners. “What is most interesting to us was (Verizon) was nowhere to be found,” Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a research note, adding that “we continue to believe Verizon’s interests lay in the higher band spectrum assets.” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email that there were three surprises in the results: “Comcast bought less than expected, Dish Network bought more, and Verizon bought nothing at all.” Dish shares fell 2.5 percent to close at $62.38. Comcast, Verizon and AT&T were down less than 1 percent at market close while T-Mobile rose marginally. Moffett said Dish’s spectrum spending underscored “the growing importance of the company’s valuation as it relates to their spectrum holdings.” Comcast sold spectrum from three of its NBCUniversal owned stations in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago for $481.6 million. The FCC also announced new channel assignments for 957 non-winning stations that must change channels to clear the new wireless airwaves for use. Of the $19.8 billion bid, more than $7 billion will go to reduce the U.S. deficit and $10.05 billion to broadcasters relinquishing spectrum.

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Goldman Sachs’ internal technology revolution cannot come soon enough. The $90 billion Wall Street firm’s young online retail-banking unit is growing and could, once big enough, crank out far higher returns than the investment bank. Goldman could do with some of that extra juice already. At 11.4 percent, Goldman’s annualized return on equity for the quarter places it in the upper echelons of the industry, along with the likes of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. The trouble is, the ROE depended upon a low tax rate, which followed from a new accounting rule relating to the settlement of share awards. Without that benefit, Goldman’s return for the quarter would have been just 8.9 percent – below the rule-of-thumb 10 percent needed to cover the cost of capital. Disappointing fixed-income, currency and commodities trading was a big part of the problem. The division’s revenue was effectively flat relative to a poor first quarter for the industry last year. Rival traders at Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan boosted their top lines by almost a fifth year-on-year. They also managed a slight boost in equities-trading revenue while Goldman’s fell 6 percent. That raises further questions about Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein’s contention that the firm can win market share as others cut back. Goldman’s fledgling Main Street operation is a bright spot. With more than $115 billion in U.S. deposits, it’s already one of the top 25 U.S. banks by that measure. Meanwhile Marcus, as the online consumer-lending unit is called, is experiencing “demand more robust than we thought,” the unit’s boss, Harit Talwar, said recently. Marcus, like fintech rivals, offers a simpler, quicker, more flexible service than many traditional banks. But it also benefits from Goldman’s deep pockets and cheap funding. That ought to give it an edge. Consumer lending can earn at least a 3 percent return on assets – triple what Goldman has been managing as a whole of late. And Blankfein’s firm doesn’t have branches and legacy technology costs to worry about. For now, lending through new web platforms remains a small industry, with just $40 billion of credit extended over a decade, according to Deloitte. Goldman needs the return boost Marcus can eventually provide, but it will be a while before it’s big enough to cover the shortcomings of other businesses.

The pair bought $5 million worth of Well Fargo’s downtrodden stock, capitalizing on share price weakness and injecting some much needed confidence in the company, just several days after it released underwhelming first-quarter earnings results. Timothy Sloan, a longtime veteran of the bank who was appointed CEO last October, forked out $2 million on 39,000 shares priced at $51.65 each, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Chairman Stephen Sanger was even more generous, buying 58,342 shares at the same price to take his total spend up to $3 million. The news was first reported by CNBC who confirmed that these were new purchases and not compensation.  The decision by two top Wells Fargo executives to buy so many shares surprised Wall Street, particularly as both are likely to receive stock-based compensation as part of their pay packages. That recognition appeared to impress investors, who responded to the announcement by bidding the bank’s shares up 3 percent. This positive reaction provided some much needed respite in what has been a difficult period for Wells Fargo. The bank’s shares have been in freefall of late, driven mainly by news that it opened fake accounts and other products in customer names without consulting them.

Household and personal care (HPC) leader Kimberly-Clark has seen its shares jump 16% year to date (YTD), as Church & Dwight stock increased 14.5%, Clorox shares spiked 12.6% and Colgate’s stock gained 11.6% over the same period. (See also: First Quarter Analysis: Winners and Losers in Consumer Staples.) As earnings season comes around, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog suggests that stocks of consumer staples companies may have priced in too much good news. Wells Fargo analysts indicate that they are “incrementally more negative” on HPC stocks, but call much of the group “uninvestable” due to potential for M&A. Herzog and her team highlight four key themes that will likely weigh on core HPC fundamentals in the near term. Wells Fargo sees top line downside from inventory destocking at retail affecting industry leaders, particularly Church & Dwight and Clorox, as about 25% of their net sales come from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT). The analysts say that retail inventory data shows a widening spread between sales and inventory growth at major U.S. staples retailers, currently the largest since the recession. Further, Wells Fargo says data suggests moderating tracker channel category growth, in which growth sequentially slowed in 30 of the top 50 HPC categories tracked in the U.S. during Q1. The analysts tracked a 1.2% year-over-year (YOY) dip last quarter, versus a 0.4% decline in the fourth quarter of 2016. Herzog and her team also expressed concern that retailers are poised to accelerate price investments in HPC “in response to both weak category growth and deteriorating foot traffic.” Lastly, Wells Fargo says potential headwinds from commodity costs are set to negatively impact leaders such as Clorox, Kimberly-Clark and Newell Brands Inc. (NWL). “All in, we are reducing our C1Q17 EPS ests. for Colgate-Palmolive, Clorox, Procter & Gamble and modestly increasing our C1Q17 EPS ests. for Procter & Gamble (on favorable FX). That said, we expect M&A speculation to continue to support elevated HPC valuations and, as such, are increasing our valuation ranges for Church & Dwight, Colgate-Palmolive, Clorox, Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble. Bottom Line, we remain cautious with respect to HPC fundamentals—and see much of the sector as un-investible at this time given the disconnect between fundamentals and valuation on elevated M&A speculation,” wrote Wells Fargo.

The company said net interest income rose to $11.06 billion in the quarter from $10.49 billion a year earlier. Additionally, non-interest income increased to $11.2 billion from $10.3 billion. Net Income increased to $4.354 billion from $3.015 billion. The company had diluted EPS of $0.41 in the quarter, up from diluted EPS of $0.28 a year prior. Book value per share increased to $24.36 from $23.14, while tangible book value increased to $17.23 from $16.19. Analysts had been looking for total revenue of $21.77 billion and EPS of $0.35, according to data compiled by YCharts. The company said total loans were up by $18 billion, and deposits increased by $64 billion, while brokerage assets rose by 21%. Total assets rose to $2.25 trillion in the quarter from $2.19 trillion a year ago. Sales trading revenue was $3.9 billion. Average deposit balances declined by 3.1 billion, or 1% y/y; while average loans and leases grew $9.3 billion, or 7% y/y. Bank of America's net interest income rose nearly 8.5% y/y. This improvement was likely driven by increases in the yield curve, especially short-end spreads. Remember, banks typically borrow short-term funds and lend long-term funds. This means they borrow money through deposits (paying a lower rate), and lend long in the forms of loans and mortgages (capturing a higher rate). As the yield spreads expand, the bank generates more revenue. When looking at BAC's price to tangible book value versus peers like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), we find that BAC is still relatively undervalued. BAC Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts When taking into consideration Bank of America's performance over the past year and the steady increases in the bank's net interest income, if the yield curve keeps moving higher, it's likely we will see continuing improvement from the firm. BAC seems to be on the right path and early trading in the shares suggests the market agrees. ",Bank of America's Net Interest Income Surges | Investopedia
Michelle Fox,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Wells Fargo's sales practice scandal weighed on the bank's earnings but its chief financial officer thinks the decline in new account openings may have hit an inflection point. ""It might have bottomed in December or January. We'll know more with the passage of time, but it stands to reason because we've rolled out a new method of doing business for our people in the branches,"" John Shrewsberry said in an interview with CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Thursday. ""Too early to declare victory but certainly the direction looks good,"" he added. Wells Fargo shares closed down more than 3 percent on Thursday after reporting flat first-quarter earnings before the bell.  Shrewsberry, a member of the CNBC Global CFO Council, called the bank's overall performance ""very solid"" but acknowledged that expenses were higher because of the fallout over the opening of unauthorized accounts. ""We've got a lot of outside parties that we've invited in to do work, make investigations and give us recommendations about how to improve ourselves,"" he said. ""That weighed on things to the tune of about $80 million in the quarter."" Wells Fargo also reported total average loans were $963.6 billion in the quarter, down $502 million from the fourth quarter. Mortgage banking revenue fell 23 percent to $1.23 billion. Shrewsberry said while commercial loan growth has been ""sideways,"" sentiment is actually very high among its business customers. He believes they are ""enthusiastically waiting"" for the implementation of President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies, which would allow them to conduct more deals, expand and do more spending. ""Folks are waiting for a sign that those pro-growth policies are really going to happen before they pull the trigger on borrowing money to do that,"" he explained. When it comes to mortgages, Shrewsberry said the bank's business is strong. He said things slowed down in the first quarter because there is less home buying in the winter and people were expecting rates to be higher for longer. ""The mortgage market will be there. People are buying homes. We're coming into the home buying season and I think there will be more of that going on than there was a year ago,"" he noted. Wells Fargo's earnings report came just days after the bank's independent directors decided to claw back an additional $75 million in compensation from executives, following a six-month investigation into the scrutinized institution's retail banking sales practices. The board review indicated that former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf acknowledged that he made significant mistakes and helped create a culture at the bank that resulted in abuses.

 ,04202017,CNBC,04132017,Warren Buffett's company is selling a chunk of its Wells Fargo stock to avoid some federal regulations. Berkshire Hathaway says the sale isn't tied to the scandal about Wells Fargo's sales practices that led to the CEO's departure last year. The company says it's selling to keep its stake of the bank below 10 percent to avoid additional Federal Reserve regulations. It will continue selling shares as needed to remain below that threshold. Berkshire's holdings crept above 10 percent last year because of Wells Fargo's stock repurchases. Berkshire says it has already sold 7.1 million shares and will sell about 1.9 million more.

Lauren Thomas,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Wells Fargo's new chief executive officer and its chairman together bought $5 million worth of stock on Monday, just days after shares skidded on mixed earnings results. Wells Fargo's CEO Timothy Sloan scooped up nearly 40,000 shares in the bank valued at $2 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sloan acquired 39,000 shares at $51.65, each, the filing said. He has served in the CEO role at the bank since October, and before that he was Wells Fargo's chief operating officer and president. Chairman Stephen Sanger also bought stock in the company on Monday: 58,342 shares at $51.65, each, for a total value of $3 million, another filing said. ""These are new stock purchases, as opposed to compensation,"" a Wells Fargo spokesperson said in an e-mail to CNBC. Monday's buying may be an attempt by top executives to shift this latest news cycle, Max Magee, a senior research analyst for stock buyback research group InsiderScore, told CNBC. ""Given that insiders receive generous stock-based compensation, insider buying of any kind is rare, and the fact that these two purchases are coming on weakness does suggest that there may be some opportunism in their decision to buy here,"" Magee said. Shares of Wells Fargo closed up over 2 percent at $52.72 per share on Monday, as investors took the purchases as a vote of confidence in the beleaguered bank. Sloan took over for John Stumpf, who left his role amid a cross-selling scandal that bank has tried to put behind it this year by clawing back money paid to past executives, including Stumpf. Last Thursday, Wells Fargo reported mixed first-quarter earnings, one of the few reports with Sloan at the helm. And last Wednesday Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it is selling 9 million shares of Wells Fargo due to possible Federal Reserve regulations. In a call with analysts and investors last week, Sloan acknowledged that not all of the bank's metrics are back to prescandal levels. ""Clearly we've seen a reduction in new account openings and credit cards, and my guess is when you look at the annualized numbers you'll continue to see some deterioration in second quarter and then we'll rebound from there,"" he said.

Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Wells Fargo on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectation, but revenue came in light. The third-largest U.S. bank by assets reported essentially a flat profit, due to in part higher costs and weaker mortgage banking revenue. The bank's shares were down more than 2 percent in premarket trading following the announcement. In early trading the stock was down less than 1 percent. Here's what the Street was expecting: The bank earned 99 cents per share in the same period last year. ""Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results,""  Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. The bank said total average loans were $963.6 billion in the quarter, down $502 million from the fourth quarter. Mortgage banking revenue fell 23 percent to $1.23 billion.

The board review indicated that former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf acknowledged that he made significant mistakes and helped create a culture at the bank that resulted in abuses. ""The findings are valuable to us and beneficial in helping to identify areas for further improvement. While we have more work to do, I am pleased with all we have accomplished thus far,"" Sloan said in the earnings release Thursday. On Wednesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it is selling 9 million shares of Wells Fargo due to possible Federal Reserve regulations. Wells Fargo directors are likely to receive the support of Berkshire Hathaway, according to The Wall Street Journal.

""Among the hamburger players, we believe that MCD is establishing a first-mover advantage with digital that can drive sustainable share gains in late 2017 and beyond.""

Amazon recently announced it plans to add 5,000 remote customer service jobs over the next year, as part of a hiring push that will include some 25,000 additional jobs at its fulfillment centers. But before you quit your office job and set up your home work space, there's a catch: According to Amazon's job posting, these roles pay $10 per hour, just $2.75 more than Federal minimum wage. Amazon's hiring binge is part of a larger labor market trend. More Americans are working remotely now than ever before, many in salaried positions for top companies. IBM, Xerox, and Allergan are also currently hiring to fill remote positions, and not just in software engineering — jobs in finance, human resources and customer service are available, too. Recently, remote job search site FlexJobs found that some industries in particular were experiencing a spike in remote job listings. In a January report, which analyzed 100,000 job listings on its website, FlexJobs found that these five fields are adding the most remote workers: 1. Mortgage and real estate You might not be able to work as a real estate broker from your apartment, but you could still work in the industry. Companies like Zillow, Homeward Residential and American Advisors Group have recently recruited for remote jobs in mortgage and real estate. Popular remote or flexible job listings include positions for  mortgage loan officers, underwriters and mortgage processors. 2. HR and recruiting Not all HR and recruiting jobs require in-person work. Aon Hewitt, Xerox and IT Pros have recently recruited for remote jobs in human resources and recruiting. Companies are looking for workers to fill postings as  recruiters, human resources specialists and human resources managers. 3. Accounting and finance You could work on Wall Street while at home, the report shows. Large financial institutions like Wells Fargo, Citi and Ally Financial have recently recruited for remote jobs in accounting and finance. Postings include openings for  accountants, bookkeepers and auditors. 4. Pharmaceuticals This growing field is looking for workers to fill several remote or flexible schedule positions. CVS Health, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Pharmaceutical Product Development have recently recruited for remote jobs in pharmaceuticals. Postings include openings for  pharmacists, clinical research associates and account managers. 5. Education and training Teaching doesn't always have to be done in a classroom.

When asked by Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Burnell during a conference call about the number of open positions inside the White House, specifically those relevant to regulating banks, Dimon interrupted: ""I said I'm not interested."" Dimon's name was thrown around for a White House position, including Treasury secretary, following President Donald Trump's presidential victory. ""I'm kidding,"" Dimon added. The Trump administration has struggled to fill a number of key positions, including Labor secretary. Andrew Puzder, Trump's first nominee for the post, withdrew from consideration in late January. Current nominee Alexander Acosta's vote was still pending as of Thursday. But Dimon didn't sound worried at all, reiterating his faith in Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Trump Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn, both Goldman Sachs alums.

But it's the second-quarter guidance that has Nick Raich of The Earnings Scout worried. In a Monday note, The Earnings Scout's CEO said that just six of the 29 S&P 500 components that had reported also raised their second-quarter estimates, while 18 lowered them. ""It remains highly likely that 2Q 2017 EPS estimates will go lower as more companies report and this week, there will be 69 more companies in the S&P 500 reporting,"" Raich said.

The so-called hard economic data have softened recently. On Friday, the Labor Department said the consumer prices index — a key gauge of inflation — posted its biggest drop in more than two years in March, while the Commerce Department said retail sales dropped more than expected last month. In turn, market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike in June have slipped. But writing off tighter monetary policy — even near term — might be premature, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.

Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday. While there was little obvious direct impact from the bank's scandal-plagued 2016, the $29 million year-over-year drop in its quarterly earnings reflects Wells Fargo's ongoing efforts to put its fake-account scandal in the rearview mirror. ""Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results,"" said CEO Tim Sloan. ""We have taken significant actions throughout the company to date and we are committed to building a better bank as we move Wells Fargo forward."" The iconic Wells Fargo stagecoach. Image source: Wells Fargo. There were two particular bright spots in Wells Fargo's performance. In the first case, its loan loss provisions fell 44%, or $481 million, compared to the same quarter last year, when banks boosted provisions in anticipation of loan defaults throughout the energy sector as oil prices dropped below $30 a barrel. ""First quarter credit results reflected strong performance in our commercial portfolios and consumer real estate portfolios,"" said chief risk officer Mike Loughlin. ""Improvement in the oil and gas portfolio, as well as continued improvement in residential real estate, drove a $200 million reserve release in the quarter."" On top of this, Wells Fargo saw the amount of money it earned from its portfolio of loans and securities increase by 5%, or $633 million. This was fueled by the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the fed funds rate twice since the beginning of December. Metric Q1 2017 Change (YOY) Net revenue $22 billion (1%) Provision for credit losses $605 million (44%) Noninterest expenses $13.8 billion 6% Net income $5.1 billion (1%) Data source: Wells Fargo. YOY = year over year. However, these two positive trends were outweighed by a drop in Wells Fargo's noninterest income and an increase in its operating costs. Its noninterest income suffered in particular from a 23% drop in mortgage banking income. Meanwhile, its costs were higher on a sequential basis due to seasonally higher employee benefits and incentive compensation expenses -- heightened regulatory and compliance expenses related to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 aren't helping either. It's here where the ongoing impact of Wells Fargo's fake-account scandal is most pronounced. The bank's efficiency ratio, which measures the percent of revenue consumed by operating expenses, increased to 62.7% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 58.7% in the year-ago period. Given the singular importance of efficiency when it comes to maximizing profitability in the bank industry, this is a concerning trend. And it's all the more so given that Wells Fargo long had a reputation for being one of the leanest banks in the industry. The net result is that Wells Fargo will almost certainly be one of the only big banks in the country to report a year-over-year decline in first-quarter earnings and profitability. Analysts expected this, but Wells Fargo's stock was nevertheless down by more than 3% in intraday trading on Thursday. ","
      
    Wells Fargo's Earnings Continue to Suffer After Last Year's Fake-Account Scandal -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the ""big four"" financial institutions in the United States, along with Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America, but it makes its money somewhat differently from the others. Specifically, while the others rely on investment banking and trading activities for large percentages of their revenue, Wells Fargo's revenue mix looks more like what you'd expect from a traditional savings & loan. In 2016, Wells Fargo generated approximately $94.2 billion in revenue, $53.7 billion of which came from interest income and $40.5 billion of which came from other sources, such as fees. Image source: Getty Images. Here's a breakdown of the sources of Wells Fargo's interest income: Source Amount ($billions) Loans $39.5 Investment securities $9.2 Trading assets $2.5 Other interest income $1.6 Mortgages held for sale $0.8 Total $53.7 Source: Wells Fargo 2016 Income Statement. Numbers may not add up perfectly, due to rounding. As you might expect, the lion's share of Wells Fargo's interest income comes from its lending activities. The noninterest income, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated: Source Amount ($billions) Trust and investment fees $14.2 Mortgage banking $6.1 Service charges on deposit accounts $5.4 Card fees $3.9 Other fees $3.7 Lease income $1.9 Insurance $1.3 Other income $1.3 Net gains on debt securities $0.9 Net gains from equity investments $0.9 Net gains from trading activities $0.8 Total $40.5 Source: Wells Fargo 2016 Income Statement. Numbers may not add up perfectly, due to rounding. The main point to notice in these charts is that most of Wells Fargo's money is made from traditional consumer and business banking activities -- not investment banking and trading, which makes up a much larger portion of most other banks' revenue streams. For example, about $12.1 billion of Bank of America's $42.6 billion in noninterest income in 2016 came from investment banking and trading profits. Wells Fargo operates its business in three divisions -- community banking, wholesale banking, and wealth and investment management. The community banking division is the one that provides banking products for consumers and small businesses, such as checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards, auto loans, mortgages, and other lending products. It also offers investment services and insurance in 39 states and D.C. Community banking is Wells Fargo's largest division, and accounted for about 53% of the bank's revenue in the most recent quarter. Wholesale banking provides many of the same services as the community banking division, but to businesses, governments, and other institutions. In addition, wholesale banking offers treasury management, corporate trust, and equipment financing services, just to name a few. The wholesale banking division made up about 33% of the bank's total revenue in the latest quarter. Finally, the wealth and investment management division provides investment and retirement products to individuals and businesses through Wells Fargo Advisors, Wells Fargo Asset Management, and others. This includes Wells Fargo's brokerage services, as well as financial planning services provided to high-net-worth individuals. This is Wells Fargo's smallest division, at about 19% of revenue, but it has grown considerably over the past several years. The main thing to notice here is that while some of Wells Fargo's revenue comes from trading and investing, most of Wells Fargo's money is made from traditional consumer banking activities such as lending, credit cards, and account fees. This makes the bank different than the other big U.S. banks, as the business model looks more like a traditional savings and loan than what we've become accustomed to from our massive financial institutions. From an investing standpoint, Wells Fargo's more narrow focus on its core business has resulted in stronger and more consistent growth than most of its peers. Wells Fargo is a financial institution that does a better job of running an efficient and safe consumer banking operation than most, and the bank sticks with what it's good at. ","

Berkshire Hathaway said on April 12 that it's selling about 9 million shares of its Wells Fargo stock position. It has already sold 7.1 million shares and plans to sell another 1.9 million. Image source: The Motley Fool. This may sound like a massive amount of stock (and it is, to most people), but this move will still leave Berkshire with about 491 million shares of the banking giant. So the sale represents less than 2% of Berkshire's total Wells Fargo stake. In addition, Berkshire specifically says that the sale has nothing to do with Wells Fargo, or the notorious ""fake accounts"" scandal that made headlines in 2016. Instead, the company is selling some of its Wells Fargo stock to keep its position below 10% of the bank's total outstanding shares, allowing it to avoid additional Federal Reserve regulations. It's also important to point out that it could (and probably will) need to sell more of its shares in future quarters, for the same purpose. As Wells Fargo repurchases shares of its own stock, Buffett's stake will represent a growing percentage of the company, so further sales could be necessary to stay under the 10% threshold in the long term. If you glance at Berkshire's portfolio, you'll notice that the company's Wells Fargo stake makes up just about 9.55% of the outstanding shares, so it may seem as if the stake is already small enough to satisfy regulators. However, Buffett owns a smaller piece of Wells Fargo in his personal account, which, combined with Berkshire's shares, made the total stake he had influence over exceed the 10% threshold. Without getting too technical, the Federal Reserve exerts more oversight on investors with large stakes in banks -- defined as 10% or more. What's more, to continue to own more than 10% of Wells Fargo, Berkshire would need permission from the Fed and would need to make the case that it had no intention to exert a ""controlling influence."" In July 2016, Buffett made such a request, stating at the time that ""Berkshire is seeking permission to retain its current ownership position ... and to acquire additional shares of common stock of Wells Fargo for investment purposes."" The application also made clear that Berkshire had no plans to make any significant changes to Wells Fargo's strategy or structure, nor did it have any desire to make changes to the bank's board. However, as part of the announcement made recently revealing the sale of some of his shares, Berkshire said that after months of talks with Fed officials, keeping the stake of more than 10% wasn't in Berkshire's best interest. Warren Buffett and his team are selling Wells Fargo shares to control the size of its position, not because of anything to do with the bank as a long-term investment. Keep in mind that this is a similar activity to the portfolio rebalancing many investors do regularly. For example, I recently revealed that after doubling over the past year, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has become my largest stock holding. I still think Bank of America has massive upside potential, but It's likely that I'll end up selling some of my shares in the near future. Nothing against the stock -- I just want to keep my position at a certain size. Similar logic applies here. The bottom line is that you shouldn't read too much into this move. To keep the size of his Wells Fargo stake under a certain threshold, Buffett is selling less than 2% of his shares. There's no reason to think that Wells Fargo isn't still one of Buffett's favorite banks, or that the selling will continue. If you have a positive opinion of Wells Fargo as a long-term investment, this news shouldn't change your mind. ","
      
    Warren Buffett Is Selling Wells Fargo Stock -- Should You Do the Same? -- The Motley Fool

Shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) led bank stocks lower on Thursday, ending the day more than 3% down after the bank reported first-quarter earnings that narrowly missed expectations on the top line but exceeded the consensus estimate on the bottom line. All told, the nation's third biggest bank by assets earned $5.1 billion, or $1 per share, on $22 billion in revenue. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $0.97 on a $22.3 billion top line. Metric Actual (1Q17) Expected (1Q17) Revenue $22.0 billion $22.3 billion Earnings per share $1.00 $0.97 Wells Fargo has been the only big bank thus far this earnings season to report a year-over-year decline in first-quarter earnings. While its bottom line fell by less than 1%, or $29 million, the other two big banks to report earnings on Thursday notched substantial increases, with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup both seeing a 17% year-over-year growth in quarterly profits. One reason JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup saw their earnings climb so much was trading revenue, which was up by double-digit percentages at the two New York City-based banks. Wells Fargo didn't see the same benefit, as it has a much more modestly sized capital markets business. In addition, Wells Fargo is still in the throes of recovering from its fake-account scandal, in which thousands of its employees improperly opened millions of accounts for unwitting customers who either didn't need, want, or even know about the new accounts. Since the scandal was revealed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in September, Wells Fargo has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and settlements, promoted a new CEO, suffered considerable reputational harm, and eliminated product sales goals for branch employees. Image source: The Motley Fool. The change to Wells Fargo's sales culture is having a particularly pronounced effect on new account openings. In March, consumer credit card applications at the California-based bank were down 42% on a year-over-year basis. Not far behind, the number of new checking accounts that were opened last month fell 35%. ""Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results,"" said CEO Tim Sloan in prepared remarks. Ultimately, though, given that bank stocks declined across the board on Thursday, even hitting banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, it seems safe to say that Wells Fargo's comparatively downbeat performance isn't solely responsible for the 3% drop in its share price. The broader downturn in bank stocks last week likely has to do instead with valuations. Because the run-up in bank stocks over the past five months has sent share prices in the industry up 20% to 30%, investors expect a lot from banks to justify their current valuations right now. And at least by the looks of it, banks have thus far come up short in the first quarter. ","

Dan Caplinger,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) gets a lot of attention from investors, and when it makes a decision to sell a stock, everyone wants to know why. Warren Buffett is notorious for his long-term investing approach, and over time, he's typically been reluctant to sell without a good reason. That's a big part of why Berkshire's recent sale of a portion of its position in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) attracted so much attention, and the move actually prompted Berkshire to issue a rare press release explaining the true motivation for taking action. Berkshire Hathaway reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 12 that it had sold roughly 7.13 million shares of Wells Fargo stock earlier in the week. The sales generated about $384 million in proceeds, with prices sold ranging from roughly $53 to $55.25 per share. Image source: Wells Fargo. Yet as large as that sale might sound, it represents only a small portion of Berkshire's holdings in Wells Fargo. When you add up the stakes that Berkshire and its subsidiaries own, the total amount still adds up to more than 497 million shares, worth more than $25 billion at current prices. Put another way, despite the sizable sale, Berkshire reduced its holdings of Berkshire by less than 2%. Berkshire said that it also intends to make additional sales of Wells Fargo stock in the near future. In a news release, the company said it will sell another 1.865 million shares, which could bring in roughly another $100 million in sales proceeds. Yet Berkshire Hathaway was quick to say that it hasn't lost confidence in Wells Fargo. Indeed, the press release explicitly stated, ""These sales are not being made because of investment or valuation considerations."" Instead, the action was prompted by regulatory considerations. The Change in Bank Control Act and related regulations impose requirements on companies that hold a 10% stake in a bank. That hasn't been a problem for Berkshire historically, because even though it has gradually ramped up its holdings in Wells Fargo from 113 million shares in 2005 to as many as 506 million shares last year, the position represented less than 10% of Wells Fargo's outstanding share count. However, Wells Fargo has gradually used stock buybacks to reduce its outstanding share count. The bank had 5.27 billion shares outstanding in 2010, but over the past several years, repurchases have reduced that number to just over 5 billion shares. That has had the effect of back-ending Berkshire Hathaway into a 10% position in the bank. At first, Berkshire simply filed the required notice with the Federal Reserve, arguing that it had no intent to buy any more Wells Fargo shares. Yet after negotiations with Fed officials, Berkshire came to the conclusion that what the insurance giant would have to do to comply with applicable regulations would pose an obstacle to its commercial activity with the bank. Accordingly, Berkshire notified the Fed that it would sell shares to return to a less than 10% stake. Berkshire Hathaway acknowledged that if Wells Fargo continues to do stock buybacks, future sales of shares might become necessary. However, Berkshire reassured those following the stock that it has no intention of sales beyond whatever's required to keep its position safely below the 10% mark. Yet taking the extraordinary step of explaining its decision shows just how aware Berkshire is of the controversy surrounding Wells Fargo. The bank has been in the limelight since its questionable sales practices came to light, leading to the departure of CEO John Stumpf. More recently, the bank announced efforts to claw back compensation from key executives, a rare move that signals the importance that Wells Fargo has placed on trying to get its reputation back. Shareholders in Wells Fargo will appreciate that Berkshire's sales were motivated by the insurance giant's own regulatory concerns rather than the bank's issues. Nevertheless, even with the vote of confidence from Warren Buffett, Wells Fargo has a long way to go before it can restore its leadership position in the banking industry and come out from under the shadow of its recent scandal.

"Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Cory Renauer",04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Every stock Warren Buffett buys isn't guaranteed to do well. Even the Oracle of Omaha makes mistakes now and then. But using Buffett's portfolio as a source of investing ideas is a fine course of action, especially if you're looking for high-quality companies that can stand the test of time. Retirees who want solid, stable investments need look no further than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), and General Electric (NYSE:GE), which are all major Buffett stocks. Cory Renauer (Wells Fargo & Co): Retirees looking for steadily growing dividend income should consider this unique Buffett stock. Don't let its size fool you: This bank might have the heft to compete toe to toe with the big investment banks, but its operations more closely resemble those of a small regional bank than a Wall Street titan. Wells Fargo is America's leading gatherer of customer deposits, a very cheap source of capital. Last year's total interest expenses of about $5.91 billion worked out to just 0.3% of total assets at the end of the year. For comparison, Goldman Sachs' total 2016 interest expenses were around 0.8% of total assets at the end of the year. Cheap capital costs have helped Wells Fargo generate a higher return on assets than Goldman Sachs during nine of the past 10 years. Image source: Wells Fargo. Of course, retirees need to worry about the years ahead, and past performance isn't a guarantee of future success. Luckily, Wells Fargo's economies of scale should help it remain profitable for many years to come. For example, hiring experts to wade through reams of financial regulations isn't cheap, but this Goliath can spread the cost throughout its extensive network of operations. Wells Fargo also benefits from relatively high switching costs for its customers. Most of its customers have multiple accounts, and jumping ship for competing services often isn't worth the effort. The recent unauthorized account-generating scandal may have tarnished a reputation that took decades to build. So far, it seems that relatively few of the bank's customers found the news disturbing enough to take their savings elsewhere. Average deposits in the fourth quarter of 2016 rose 7% over the previous-year period. At recent prices, the stock offers a healthy 2.86% dividend yield, which you can reasonably expect to grow steadily. Last year's payments consumed just 41.2% of profits. This payout ratio may be higher than many of its peers, but it's about average for Wells Fargo, and leaves plenty of room for increases in the years ahead. Tim Green (Kraft Heinz): Global food company Kraft Heinz, formed in 2015 from the merger of Kraft and Heinz, is a wildly profitable company with a large stable of well-known brands. These include Kraft and Heinz, of course, as well as Oscar Mayer, Jell-O, Maxwell House, Philadelphia, Grey Poupon, Planters, and dozens more. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than one-quarter of the company, with its stake valued at nearly $30 billion. Kraft Heinz is Berkshire's largest holding, which should give investors quite a bit of confidence that the company is a solid long-term bet. Kraft is wildly profitable, and enjoyed an operating margin of 23.2% in 2016, and it throws off a solid dividend, yielding 2.6%. For retirees wanting a stable dividend stock, Kraft Heinz is an excellent choice. Every stock comes with some risk, and Kraft Heinz is no exception. The company has a lot of debt -- $32.4 billion at the end of 2016 -- and the possibility of a major acquisition could push the company's debt load up even higher. Rumors of a possible bid for either Mondelez or PepsiCo have emerged, both of which would be extremely expensive. If Kraft Heinz ends up buying another giant food company, there would be plenty that could go wrong. Despite these risks, Buffett's massive stake in the company should give investors some comfort. Tyler Crowe (General Electric): You have to give a company like General Electric credit. For a company that's over 100 years old and was founded on manufacturing consumer products like light bulbs, General Electric has no problem tearing the company down and building around a new strategy, when necessary. The company has been in the midst of a teardown/rebuild phase lately, and the company that's emerging looks like one that retirees will want to own for the next several years. A decade ago, General Electric was the poster child for a diversified conglomerate. It manufactured industrial goods and consumer products, had a massive media empire with its stake in NBC/Universal, and its finance arm, GE Capital, was so large that it was considered a systemically important financial institution following the financial collapse in 2008. The trouble with such diversification, though, was that the company lost focus and struggled to allocate capital to all the necessary places. As a result, CEO Jeff Immelt started a complete reboot of the company. NBC/Universal? Gone. Consumer goods? Gone. GE Capital? Significantly reduced to just a captive finance arm for its industrial products. In its place, the company is focusing on manufacturing industrial goods and using Big Data to revolutionize the way those industrial products are used. Today, almost all of GE's industrial products have some sort of remote sensing capability that collects immense amounts of data. That data is collected and analyzed using GE's Predix software platform, which can detect early signs of fatigue, as well as optimize operations of a given product. This real-time analysis is extremely valuable for GE's customers, and is becoming a very lucrative service business for GE. By 2020, GE estimates that subscriptions for Predix will generate $15 billion in revenue annually, and so far, it has been a high margin business for the company. With a renewed focus on manufacturing excellence and bringing the Internet of Things to the Industrial world, General Electric is entering its next corporate iteration, which looks to be at the vanguard of the integration of data analysis into our everyday lives.

    The 3 Best Buffett Stocks for Retirees -- The Motley Fool

As of the end of 2016, Warren Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) owned 479,704,270 shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) worth a total of $26.8 billion. This translates to a 9.5% stake in the banking giant. However, Buffett also owns a smaller position in his personal account, and the combined stake is just over 10%. Here's why Warren Buffett loves Wells Fargo, why he recently sold some of his shares, and what to expect going forward. In the aftermath of the infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal at Wells Fargo, Buffett revealed that he had not sold a single share of the stock and called the bank an ""incredible institution."" Image source: Getty Images. The reason Buffett feels this way is easy to understand. For starters, Wells Fargo consistently runs an extremely efficient and profitable operation, handily surpassing the rest of the ""big four"" U.S. banks on return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) year after year (the blue lines in the 10-year chart below). WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts In addition, the bank has done a great job of growing rapidly without sacrificing quality. Throughout the financial crisis, Wells Fargo experienced much lower loan losses than its peers and remained financially stable. This is illustrated by the fact that Wells Fargo paid the least amount of settlements out of the big banks in the crisis' aftermath -- by a wide margin. It was also the reason the bank was able to scoop up rival Wachovia at a deep discount. Bank Financial Crisis-Related Settlements Paid Bank of America $77.1 Billion JPMorgan Chase $40.1 Billion Citigroup $18.4 Billion Wells Fargo $10.2 Billion Source: Keffe, Bruyette, & Woods. On April 12, 2017, Berkshire Hathaway announced that it is selling about 9 million shares of its Wells Fargo stake -- about 2% of the total. This may sound like a big deal at first -- after all, Buffett had been adding to his Wells Fargo stake for many years. However, it's important to take a step back and look at the reasons Buffett decided to sell these shares, which had nothing to do with the bank as an investment. All indications point to Buffett still considering Wells Fargo one of the best banks in the U.S. Instead, Berkshire is selling the shares to reduce its stake to less than 10% of the bank, thereby avoiding additional regulations from the Federal Reserve. Specifically, the Fed wants to know that investors with large positions in banks don't intend to have a controlling influence. Berkshire originally sought permission from the Fed to increase its Wells Fargo stake above 10%, but has since decided against pursuing the matter. Now that Berkshire has publicly stated its intent to keep its stake at less than 10% of Wells Fargo, it's a safe bet that the company won't buy any more shares of the bank, at least not anytime soon. To the contrary, it's likely that Berkshire will need to continue to sell more of its Wells Fargo stake over time, particularly if the bank continues to buy back its own stock. For example, Wells Fargo recently reported that it reduced its outstanding share count by 19.4 million through buybacks during the first quarter of 2017. This makes the remaining shares worth slightly more, and buybacks like this will create a perpetual need for Berkshire to sell some of its Wells Fargo shares on occasion to stay under the 10% threshold.

    What Percent Of Wells Fargo Does Warren Buffett Own? -- The Motley Fool

Todd Campbell,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett can hand-pick the CEOs of the companies Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) owns outright, but that's not the case with the stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Since Buffett is a big believer that great management is key to long-term business success, let's see how employees rate the CEOs of his five biggest stock positions on Glassdoor. Buffett owns a massive 326 million-share stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) that's worth $29.8 billion. That makes it Berkshire Hathaway's largest stock holding, but Buffett doesn't run Kraft Heinz. CEO Bernardo Hees does, and cost-cutting appears to have taken a toll on Hees' reputation with employees, based on their 25% approval rating on Glassdoor. IMAGE SOURCE: KRAFTHEINZ In 2013, Berkshire Hathaway teamed up with venture-capital firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz, and in 2015, Heinz merged with Kraft Foods Group to create The Kraft Heinz Company. Hees, a partner of 3G Capital who left the top spot at Burger King to serve as Heinz's CEO in 2013, was awarded the top spot at the combined company, and at the time, his management team predicted $1.5 billion in cost savings from the merger by the end of 2017. By investors' measures, management's delivering on that promise. In the company's fourth-quarter earnings press release, cost savings were cited as a big reason operating income increased 22.8% year over year, despite slipping sales. Since its merger, KraftHeinz's operating margin has improved to the low twenties from the mid-teens, and its annualized net income has swelled to a record $3.63 billion. Unsurprisingly, that bottom-line performance has had KraftHeinz shares outperforming the S&P 500, with its shares returning 21% compared with the index's 15% return. Undeniably, competition in the bare-knuckle food industry is fierce, and consolidation to eke out savings is common. However, investors who believe that a company's long-term potential is best measured by happy and productive employees could be right to worry about employees' low approval rating of Hees on Glassdoor. Berkshire Hathaway recently trimmed its stake in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) to keep ownership south of 10%, thus avoiding more stringent regulatory requirements. Yet Berkshire Hathaway's position in Wells Fargo remains huge, at over $20 billion. Buffett's stuck by his big bet on Wells Fargo, despite a high-profile scandal last year in which Wells Fargo branches created accounts for customers without their permission. Since news broke of the scandal, the company's replaced its CEO, but its financial results have lost momentum. Paying incentives on cross-selling consumers may have boosted pay for some workers, but it's also damaged relationships with other workers. In 2014, one employee wrote on Glassdoor that ""cross-selling is the only focus now, firing employees who are great at their job in every area that should matter, but if the cross-selling results are not meeting the ever ridiculous quota (which continues to rise) than you may not have a job next month. Expectation for customers to say yes to cross-selling, leaving you with no real control of your job security. Stress!"" The ouster of former CEO John Stumpf, who once trumpeted himself as ""keeper of our company's culture,"" is the right move. His replacement, Tim Sloan, is a senior manager with over 25 years at the bank, so he certainly knows enough about the company's culture to make decisions necessary to get Wells Fargo back on track. However, it remains to be seen if he can keep employees happy and maintain that high CEO approval rating. Berkshire Hathaway is a longtime investor in Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and CEO Muhtar Kent has a 75% approval rating among employees, according to Glassdoor. IMAGE SOURCE: COCA-COLA. Kent started working for Coke in 1978, and he's been the company's CEO since 2008. He deserves a lot of credit for successfully managing Coca-Cola through the Great Recession. However, he's retiring soon, and his successor, James Quincey, is inheriting a business that's been seeing sales drop as consumers shift away from sugary drinks to healthier alternatives. Quincey's been the company's president and chief operating officer, and he'll take the reins from Kent on May 1. His long tenure at Coca-Cola means he has experience, but it doesn't guarantee he'll enjoy the same support from employees that Kent did. Investors should learn more about Quincey's plans for the future over the coming quarters, and until then, it's probably best to wait a while to see if the CEO approval rating changes after his first year on the job. Quincey does, however, appear to have the support of Buffett, who in December said, ""I know James and like him, and believe the company has made a smart investment in its future with his selection."" Berkshire Hathaway's got $13.7 billion riding on IBM (NYSE:IBM) CEO Virginia Rometty's success, and she's got a lot on her plate. IBM is in the midst of transforming itself into a growth technology company again, but declining demand for legacy products is still weighing down its top line. While IBM's revenue was topping $100 billion five years ago, its sales last year were below $80 billion. IBM Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Rometty won IBM's top spot in 2012, and since then, she's been investing considerably into fast-growing markets like cloud computing that management dubs ""strategic imperatives."" Her big push into growing technology markets is gaining traction, and double-digit sales growth in those markets means that their revenue now represents over 40% of companywide sales; however, there's still work to do. The company faces stiff competition from Amazon.com, MIcrosoft, and others, and despite an 11% increase in strategic imperative sales in the fourth quarter, total revenue still declined 1% year over year. American Express (NYSE:AXP), the global credit card giant, is Buffett's fifth biggest position, and his interest in American Express dates all the way back to the mid-1960s. Unquestionably, it's been a big winner for him. American Express has survived multiple banking crises over the decades, including the Great Recession, when bad debt and charge-offs soared, and Buffett's been an unwavering shareholder, owning a position worth $10 billion that makes him the company's biggest investor. His cost basis is about $1.3 billion, so he's got plenty of reason to be a fan of CEO Ken Chenault. AXP data by YCharts Based on Glassdoor's 85% approval rating, Chenault's also got a lot of fans working for him. He'll be relying heavily on those employees this year as he continues efforts to return the company's top line to growth following the loss of an exclusivity deal with Costco. The loss of Costco revenue means Chenault's having to balance cost-cutting with increased marketing spending to maintain earnings and win more cardholders to boost sales. Although Chenault faces headwinds because of Costco, Buffett appears to remain confident in Chenault's leadership, and fortunately for him, Glassdoor's rating suggests workers remain confident too. Certainly, there are some good reasons for optimism. The U.S. economy is growing, wages are up, and charge-offs and delinquency's on credit cards are down. Assuming those trends hold up, it's probably wise to bet on Chenault's success. ","

Most banks have come a long way in the years since the financial crisis, and many bank stocks have risen quite a bit over the past year or so. Expectations of rising interest rates, economic growth, and looser banking regulations have created a renewed sense of optimism among investors. Having said that, there are still some excellent long-term opportunities in the sector, many of which also pay attractive dividends. Here are five smart choices for dividend investors who want a piece of the banking sector. Company Recent Share Price Dividend Yield Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $55.67 2.72% Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) $49.60 3.64% U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) $51.75 2.12% New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) $13.91 4.82% Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) $23.32 1.28% Share prices and dividend yields current as of 3/30/2017. Image source: Getty Images. Wells Fargo is a longtime favorite of Warren Buffett, mainly for its consistently efficient and profitable operations, and its history of prudent risk management. In its most recent quarter, Wells Fargo reported a return on assets (ROA) of 1.15% and return on equity (ROE) of 11.54% -- both handily surpassing the industry benchmarks of 1% and 10%, respectively. In fact, over the past decade, Wells Fargo has consistently been the most profitable of the ""big four"" banks. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. Additionally, because of the fallout from the infamous fake-accounts scandal, as well as a mixed first-quarter earnings report, Wells Fargo is the only one of the ""big four"" that's actually trading for less than it was at the beginning of 2016. Now could be a good time to get into what Warren Buffett has called an ""incredible institution"" at a discount. Toronto-Dominion Bank, better known as TD Bank, is based in Canada, but has a large and rapidly growing U.S. presence. Over the past decade or so, TD has grown aggressively through a series of acquisitions, as well as organically. I recently wrote an in-depth discussion of the reasons I love TD Bank and own the stock in my personal portfolio, but one big reason is TD's emphasis on customer service and convenience. Known as ""America's Most Convenient Bank"" since its 2008 acquisition of New Jersey-based Commerce Bank, TD branches are open longer hours than most competitors, as well as on Saturdays and Sundays in many locations, and TD employees are known for providing more personalized service than most other banks. U.S. Bancorp, the fifth-largest U.S. bank, is another Warren Buffett favorite. At first glance, the bank looks extremely expensive -- its valuation of 2.1 times its book value is by far the highest of the big banks. With U.S. Bank, however, you get what you pay for. The bank has one of the most profitable and efficient operations in the entire banking industry, and has done a great job of gaining market share over the past decade, having emerged from the financial crisis even stronger than it was before. New York Community Bancorp is a niche lender, primarily making loans on rent-controlled or rent-stabilized apartment buildings, mostly in New York City. Because it's a leader in its niche market, and because rent-controlled buildings have naturally low default rates, the bank's charge-off and delinquency rates have stayed remarkably low, even during the depths of the financial crisis. The bank has also maintained one of the best track records of efficiency in the entire banking industry, and is the most efficient bank on this list by a wide margin. As you may have noticed from the chart, Bank of America actually pays the lowest dividend of any bank stock on this list. However, I believe that will change in the not-too-distant future. Specifically, over the past several years, Bank of America has traded for a steep discount to its book value, mainly due to low profitability (which is starting to improve). To take advantage of this situation, the bank chose to spend the majority of its capital on repurchasing its own stock at a discount, thereby making dividend increases a lower priority. Now that the bank's valuation isn't far below its book value, I wouldn't be surprised if dividend growth moves up on management's priority list. ","

Matthew Cochrane,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported its 2016 fourth quarter earnings, one of the most impressive items was the incredible growth of the popular peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platform, Venmo. In the final quarter of the calendar year, Venmo had processed $5.6 billion in total payment volume, a whopping 126% increase year over year. In the conference call, PayPal management proudly noted that in December 2016, Venmo had crossed the $2 billion threshold in total payment volume in a single month for the first time. To grasp how quickly the platform is growing, we must remember that it was just earlier in the year when the platform first surpassed $1 billion in a single month. P2P payment apps like Venmo have exploded in popularity. Image source: PayPal Holdings Inc. It's no secret that much of Venmo's growth is coming from younger generations and the app's social media-like qualities has made it a particular hit with millennials. Not surprisingly, the platform's growth has not gone unnoticed by the financial industry. This year, banks are responding by launching Zelle, a jointly backed P2P app that links directly to a consumer's account at one of the participating banks. Zelle is operated by Early Warning, a payment and risk solutions company that is owned by several of the country's largest banks and financial institutions including Bank of America Corp, BB&T Corporation, Capital One Financial Corp., JP Morgan Chase & Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc, and Wells Fargo & Co. Through partnerships with Mastercard and Visa, most credit unions will also participate in the program. Zelle's service allows payers to send money to another person using only their email address or phone number as an identifier. Zelle users can sign up with nothing more than a debit card or bank account. Users can both send and request funds. Money will be transferred ""within minutes"" from one bank account to another -- making it quicker than Venmo's service, which requires users to manually initially a transfer from their Venmo accounts to their banks. Image source: Early Warning. What most might not realize is that this payments platform has existed since 2011 under the name clearXchange, when it was originally founded by Bank of America, Chase, and Wells Fargo as a P2P service. While the platform gained little traction as clearXchange, the banks are hoping that rebranding, new leadership, and the corresponding marketing campaign will revitalize the service. The strategy seems to be working. In a recent press release, the service claimed to have ""processed more than 170-million person-to-person (P2P) payments in 2016, totaling $55 billion in aggregate transaction value."" Not too shabby! While some have opined that banks are hoping to kill off Venmo with Zelle's launch, I find that scenario unlikely, to say the least. Zelle's success in 2016 seems to have done little to stunt Venmo's growth last year. What it probably means is that, while the P2P market is not a big profit maker, banks want their account holders more engaged with their own banking products and services than having their customers practically forced to retreat to third-party services like PayPal. On the surface, Venmo doesn't appear worried about Zelle's imminent entrance. Josh Criscoe, Venmo's head of corporate affairs and communications, recently stated: ""We don't see it as a winner-take-all scenario. We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash."" Venmo's explosive growth probably also means there is plenty of room for additional players in the P2P market. After all, doling out cash and writing checks are still far and away the leading ways people pay back friends and family members. This gives Zelle and Venmo a long runway of growth ahead.

(That often-mocked gang was just hit with another scorecard detailing how indexes have trounced most actively managed funds.) Yes, says our call of the day, which comes from Nir Kaissar, founder and portfolio manager at Unison Advisors. But his upbeat view is largely based on elevated valuations. The U.S. stock market “looks very expensive,” and that means the S&P 500’s returns over the next decade “are not going to be great,” said Kaissar, while co-starring in WisdomTree’s latest “Behind The Markets” podcast. And so he has bet that hedge funds will outperform the S&P over the next 10 years, with Ritholtz Wealth Management’s Ben Carlson taking the other side of the wager and discussing it in the podcast. It’s basically a redo of Warren Buffett’s famous $1 million bet that an index fund would beat a selection of hedge funds over a decade.

Except only a beer is at stake this time — and passive-funds fan Carlson is conceding that the bet won’t be a blowout this time. “I think it’ll actually be a much closer race than the one that Buffett’s in now, because I agree with you — we’re at above-average valuations,” Carlson, known for his A Wealth of Common Sense blog, told Kaissar. “I don’t think that means we have to see a market crash — like a lot of people tend to believe — but I think it’s safe after a huge bull market to alter your expectations and assume lower-than-average returns follow above-average returns,” he said. And Carlson has thrown another bone to the 2-and-20 set (2% annual fixed fee and 20% of profits): “Something that people forget is that hedge funds are really a ‘cash-plus asset structure,’” so a rising-interest-rate environment could actually help them, he said.

As Trump says U.S.-Russia relations “may be at an all-time low” with tensions over Syria rising, there is no question that Russia’s main stock benchmark has fallen to its all-time low in the Trump era. In other words, the Micex index has touched levels last seen before Trump’s election win.

Alessandra Malito,04202017,MarketWatch,04132017,"Published: Apr 19, 2017 9:48 a.m. ET Less than a third of survey respondents had even heard of the fiduciary rule By For all of the hand-wringing about the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, a surprising number of people don’t know what it is. And that ignorance may affect your retirement savings. Only 32% of adults had heard of the fiduciary rule, according to a survey of 1,000 adults conducted on behalf of one of the original retirement robo advisers, Financial Engines.

                                   Of those surveyed, 22% worked with a financial adviser and 21% knew the difference between an adviser who acted as a fiduciary and one who did not. “These are things people don’t pay a lot of attention to unless you are in the industry in some way,” said Chris Jones, chief investment officer at Financial Engines. The financial services industry has done a good job of obfuscating the importance of fiduciary responsibilities, he said. So what’s the fiduciary rule? Here’s a refresher: The fiduciary rule is a highly contested piece of legislation, produced during President Obama’s presidency and managed by the Department of Labor, focused on mitigating conflicts of interests that may arise in financial advisers’ investment recommendations on retirement accounts. Not even two months after Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Labor announced it would delay the implementation — originally set for April 10 — until June 9. The prior administration had argued the rule would protect retirement savers from losing $17 billion a year to conflicts of interest, which could come from commissions earned on product recommendations. Critics, on the other hand, said it would orphan small accounts that managers deemed too costly to manage, and shrink the variety of investment options savers have. See: Dear President-elect Trump: Please do right by investors There is a disconnect between what investors believe to be true of their adviser’s responsibilities — and what’s actually true. For example, respondents were asked if all financial advisers are legally required to put the best interests of their clients first when they give advice on retirement investments — 53% said that was true, 47% said it was false. (It is false — not all advisers are legally required to act in their clients’ best interests). Here are some takeaways from the Financial Engines survey: If your financial advisor was not a fiduciary, would you: Financial Engines has openly supported the fiduciary rule, as have others, including New York-based robo adviser Betterment and New York-based financial services firm Merrill Lynch

See also:  Why many financial advisers use someone else to manage their money In order to educate more investors, the industry needs to improve transparency and communication efforts with investors, said Scott Puritz, managing director of advisory firm Rebalance IRA. “Fiduciary” can be an intimidating word, as can investing in general, he said. The firm released its “Dear Advisor” campaign in February, which is a letter investors can give their advisers to learn if they’re a fiduciary and what they are paying in fees. “The challenge is to make it in plain English.” (For example, when Financial Engines asked survey participants if they’d support requiring all financial advisers to provide advice on retirement assets be legally required to put their best interests first, 72% said yes, 7% said no and 21% said they were indifferent.) “We are fighting an uphill battle,” Puritz said. “Consumers think the other options are free because so many costs are hidden and that’s deliberate.” ",Still wondering what the fiduciary rule is?

                                   shares dropped 1.9% in midday trade Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration released a warning letter to the company about the way it manufactures its medical devices. The facility in question was acquired by Abbott in its purchase of St. Jude Medical, which was completed in January. Though Abbott recalled certain implantable cardioverter defibrillators, which are used to treat irregular heartbeats, in October, 10 of the medical devices were later shipped out and an additional seven were put into patients, the FDA said. In this and other issues, Abbott didn't provide evidence of its corrective and preventive actions in its response to the FDA, the regulator said. If the letter's points aren't addressed promptly, the FDA said it may start regulatory actions such as seizure, injunction and civil money penalties, or there could be consequences for federal contracts or FDA approvals for related devices. Abbott leadership, which has 15 days to respond to the letter, ""does not expect today's warning letter to negatively impact products currently on the market, although it may affect new product approvals,"" including approvals for devices expected in the fourth quarter, said UBS analyst Matt Miksic. The letter could cause bad publicity for Abbott, since ""the language in the warning letter is such that public image of overall ABT may be affected,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Lawrence Biegelsen, who estimated the issues in the letter could be resolved in as little time as nine to 12 months. ""We take these matters seriously, continue to make progress on our corrective actions, will closely review FDA's warning letter, and are committed to fully addressing FDA's concerns,"" an Abbott spokesperson said. The company may release more information when it reports first-quarter earnings results, scheduled for Wednesday premarket.

                                    on Thursday reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations, with trading and investment banking revenues contributing the most during the quarter. But the company’s CEO used his annual letter to push for a different business line, one which has fizzled in recent years. “It is no surprise the financial crisis, which was caused in part by poor mortgage lending practices and which caused so much pain for American families and businesses, led to new regulations and enhanced supervision,” Jamie Dimon wrote. “We needed to create a safer and better functioning mortgage industry. However, our housing sector has been unusually slow to recover, and that may be partly due to restrictions in mortgage credit.” Dimon then devoted about 1,400 words to a discussion about the regulations put in place since the subprime crisis. An overly onerous regulatory burden, he argued, has reduced mortgage lending by about $300 billion annually — or the equivalent of about 3 million home loans since the crisis. “Our economists think that $1 trillion of loans could have increased GDP, in each of those five years, by 0.5 [percentage points],” he wrote. Dimon is especially critical of the Federal Housing Administration, the government mortgage-buying agency that stepped up in the depths of the crisis when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were still on their knees. The FHA has drawn fire because of its aggressive use of the False Claims Act, legislation that was intended to protect the government from fraud, but which many industry participants say has been used to wring money from banks. That’s caused banks to flee from FHA lending, leaving “non-banks” as its primary lenders. And even some non-banks aren’t happy with the situation: Quicken Loans sued the government after being threatened with a fine. Also read: An old fear returns as new mortgage market players rise “A first step to increasing participation in the FHA program could be the communication of support for only using the FCA, as originally intended, to penalize intentional fraud rather than immaterial or unintentional errors,” Dimon wrote. He also calls for uniform standards for servicing mortgages, noting that “new mortgage rules and regulations total more than 14,000 pages and stand about six feet tall.” Treasury could take the lead on this effort, Dimon writes, as it did when it developed initiatives to help homeowners in distress. In particular, he notes the enormous costs associated with servicing a troubled mortgage: $2,386, or more than 13 times the $181 it costs to service a healthy loan, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. That’s keeping all lenders from extending credit to borrowers who don’t have pristine credit histories.

Morgan, it’s up 7% compared to the same period a year ago, however. Dimon’s proposals aren’t new, though it may be the first time someone of his stature has taken such a formal opportunity to argue for them. But it’s worth pointing out a few other post-crisis developments which may also be keeping a lid on mortgage lending: skittishness about homeownership, pricey rents that make it hard to save up a down payment, scant inventory that’s pushing home prices higher, and more.

Their investment-banking divisions benefited from stronger equity capital markets as the initial-public-offering market came back to life after a subdued 2016 and the flow of debt issuance remained strong. But loan growth was weak, after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December and signaled two more rate hikes this year. “The loan growth deceleration in all of these reports didn’t come as a surprise — we had seen it in Fed data already,” said Sheraz Mian, research director at Zack’s. Mian noted that some of the explanations offered included lower mortgage activity in the wake of higher rates, weak car-loan demand and strong capital markets activities that encouraged bigger issuers to tap the bond market instead of banks.

Analysts are expected to seek an update on the bank’s outlook for regulatory change, after the election of President Donald Trump in November fueled a rally in bank stocks on expectations he would roll back the set of rules known as Dodd-Frank. Bank stocks have since pulled back as those expectations have been tempered by uncertainty in Washington following the defeat of the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Wall Street will be closely watching how the sales of Johnson & Johnson’s largest product, the autoimmune disease drug Remicade, have eroded in the face of new competition. But, at least for now, sales erosion is expected to be moderate, and “there is much to like here,” said Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford. And the company should benefit from a dollar that was weaker than expected, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro, benefiting the company’s consumer, pharmaceuticals and medical devices segments. Meanwhile, the company’s $30 billion acquisition of biopharmaceutical company Actelion — which Holford called “an expensive band aid” — is expected to lift earnings results once it closes, likely by the second half of this year and going into 2018. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts expect Johnson & Johnson to report first-quarter earnings of $1.77 per share, up from $1.68 per share in the year-earlier period, according to FactSet. Johnson & Johnson has beat the FactSet consensus in every quarter over the past five years. The software platform Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from buy-side and sell-side analysts, hedge funds, academics and others, has the company earning more, at $1.79 per share.

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"Only three directors received more than 90 percent support from voting shareholders, a benchmark cited by Sanger as what would be the outcome of a normal vote. He received just 56 percent approval. “Wells Fargo stockholders today have sent the entire Board a clear message of dissatisfaction,” Sanger said in a statement. “Let me assure you that the Board has heard that message, and we recognize there is still a great deal of work to do to rebuild the trust of stockholders, customers and employees.” The meeting, which ran nearly three hours, was repeatedly interrupted by angry shareholders seeking answers about how and why thousands of bank employees were able to open 2.1 million fake accounts in customers’ names without their permission. There was a brief recess after one shareholder made what Sanger called a “physical approach” toward a board member and was removed. “You’re saying we’re out of order. Wells Fargo has been out of order for years!” said Bruce Marks, chief executive of Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, before being ejected. Others were escorted out after ignoring pleas to simmer down from Sanger and Chief Executive Tim Sloan. The directors who received weak support had faced negative recommendations from influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which argued they failed in their oversight duties. Two directors, Federico Peña and Enrique Hernandez, received even less support than Sanger, at 54 percent and 53 percent, respectively. They chair board committees related to risk, finance or corporate responsibility. All but three directors received support of 80 percent or less. The other three received 99 percent approval, and were recent additions: Sloan, who was named CEO in October after the scandal erupted, as well as Ronald Sargent and Karen Peetz, who were newly elected to the board this year. At most S&P 500 companies, director support averages around 95 percent of votes cast, according to pay consulting firm Semler Brossy. Six Wells Fargo directors will reach a mandatory retirement age of 72 in the coming years and are expected to leave when they do, Sanger said. He will hit that mark next year, but would not say when he planned to retire. The bank’s guidelines require that directors offer to resign if they fail to receive a majority of votes cast. But in practice, directors who receive less than 80 percent support should consider exiting the board, said Charles Elson, a University of Delaware expert on corporate governance. “It’s a really strong signal from shareholders, and I think they need to immediately consider refreshing that board,” he said of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo’s board and management had said the steps taken to fix problems and punish employees responsible for abuses show there is now strong oversight, and that directors nominated deserved to be elected. But the public firestorm that hammered its shares last year and led to the resignation of then-Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf was not forgotten. Sloan and Sanger reiterated those comments and apologized repeatedly to shareholders, customers and employees at the meeting on Tuesday. “We are deeply sorry for letting you, our shareholders, down and letting down our customers, our team members and the communities that we do business in,” said Sloan. “You expect and deserve much more from us.” Sanger tried to show patience as he was frequently interrupted, but struggled at times as speakers ignored his requests to follow the usual order of proceedings. “When I say I’m sorry ... I think that speaks for all of the board,” he said at one point. After investors had time to speak, Sloan and Sanger opened the floor to a general audience Q&A. Two borrowers gave emotional recountings of their ordeal with Wells Fargo’s mortgage operation, both breaking into tears. Management apologized and promised to personally look into their issues. It was not clear how or whether the board will refashion itself in response to the vote. Although shareholders sent a clear signal of dissatisfaction, some said it would not be wise to wipe out a nearly full slate of directors at once. “We do want a core of directors left able to reconstitute the board,” said Anne Simpson, investment director of sustainability at Calpers, which opposed nine directors. “Simply declaring ‘off with their heads’ is not reasonable.” ","

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"The bank has had a difficult seven months since a sales scandal that severely damaged its reputation and led to the departure of then-Chairman and CEO John Stumpf in October. Stumpf’s sudden retirement came after he was slammed by U.S. lawmakers. Still, David Moskowitz, the newly-promoted head of the lobbying and policy unit, said the overhaul was not a response to the scandal, nor to the bank’s failure of a “living will” test administered by federal regulators that led to the bank’s decision to temporarily halt the growth of its balance sheet. “This is not a reaction to all the events of the last year,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. Instead, he said the bank’s decision was about having a more coordinated public policy approach, rather than each business unit operating somewhat independently. While that siloed structure was one of the criticisms mentioned in an investigative report released by the Board of Directors, Moskowitz said the new structure was not a response to the report. “I don’t think there had been duplication of effort,” he said. “I need to integrate these things better into the business priorities of the company, to the needs of its customers, to help us rebuild trust and build the better bank that we’re going to work for.” The new unit will bring together several responsibilities that had been in different areas of the bank, including federal, regulatory, state and local government relations, political programs, external relations and public policy. Moskowitz said he would hire more people for the unit, though he would not yet say how many. When Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia at the start of 2009, it more than doubled its size and became the fourth largest U.S. bank. It eventually passed Citigroup and became the third largest. Following the Wachovia acquisition, its government relations team had two people. That number has since grown to six. Moskowitz, executive vice president and general counsel, most recently led the consumer lending and corporate regulatory division of the Wells Fargo law department. He will report to Hope Hardison, the bank’s chief administrative officer. The outgoing head of government and community relations, Jon Campbell, will stay at the bank in a modified role. ","
                Wells Fargo overhauls lawmaking and policy arm | Reuters"
,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"In one of its toughest shareholder notes, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended earlier this month that investors vote against 12 of the 15 directors on Wells Fargo’s ballot at the company’s annual meeting on April 25, including independent chairman Stephen Sanger. ISS argued they had all failed in their oversight duties. The recommendation was another blow to the country’s third-largest bank, which has been struggling for months to move past revelations that thousands of employees created as many as 2 million accounts in customers’ names without permission to hit lofty sales targets. ISS’s recommendation followed one by Glass Lewis, its closest competitor, which recommended votes against six directors for similar reasons.   The ball is now in the shareholders’ court. A sampling of investors who spoke to Reuters were split on how to vote. It would be extremely unusual for most directors at a company the size of Wells Fargo to turn over suddenly, without pressure from an activist investor, but ISS’s scathing review was also rare. According to Proxy Insight, among the 2,780 meetings held by S&P 500 companies since 2012, ISS has recommended votes against 80 percent or more of directors in just seven cases besides Wells Fargo. Each involved a special circumstance, like only a few directors being up for re-election. ISS’s Wells Fargo recommendation was “among the harshest that I can recall,” said Bruce Goldfarb, president of proxy solicitation firm Okapi Partners. An ISS spokesman declined to comment. Wells Fargo representatives cited an April 7 statement calling the ISS recommendation “extreme and unprecedented.” ISS is the largest proxy adviser, with about 1,700 clients versus Glass Lewis’s 1,200, and has faced concerns it wields undue influence over corporate elections. On average, directors who ISS recommends “against” receive 17 percent to 18 percent less support, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy. Activists have criticized big fund managers for blindly following ISS. Institutional investors have built up large corporate governance departments in recent years and say they make their own judgments. But breaking with ISS and supporting the whole Wells Fargo board could be difficult for fund firms, said Michael Goldstein, a Babson College finance professor. “This may be one of those cases where you don’t want to have to answer a lot of questions about why did you support these people,” Goldstein said. If shareholders do vote against some of Wells Fargo’s directors, it does not mean they will immediately leave. The bank’s guidelines require directors offer to resign if they fail to receive a majority of votes cast, but leaves the board wiggle room in deciding whether to accept a resignation. Wells Fargo’s board and management have said the steps taken to fix problems and punish employees responsible for sales abuses show there is now strong oversight, and that directors nominated deserve to be elected. In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan said ousting most of the board would be “crazy.” The San Francisco-based bank paid $190 million in a September regulatory settlement for the unauthorized accounts, igniting a public firestorm that hammered its shares and led to the resignation of then-Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. Since then, Sloan replaced Stumpf, and Sanger became the independent chairman. The board took steps like eliminating sales goals, revamping its compensation structure and withholding or clawing back tens of millions of dollars of bonuses. Rhode Island Treasurer Seth Magaziner, who oversees funds that own Wells Fargo shares, said they will vote against directors flagged by ISS. “Directors are meant to be agents for the shareholders, and watchdogs for the investors,” he said. “Clearly that level of oversight was lacking at Wells Fargo.” Others were supportive. Gideon Bernstein, partner at wealth management firm Leisure Capital, said he plans to back the board. He was impressed with the bank’s April 10 report describing what went wrong, and actions taken in response. “The board has done a really good job drilling down,” he said. Thomas Russo, managing member at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, said he has not yet decided how to vote. He wants to see a smaller board with more banking experience. “There’s an elevated sense of urgency in a smaller board and a board that has more specific knowledge,” he said. Executives at American Century Investments also have not yet decided. Senior investment analyst Adam Krenn said the bank’s oversight and initial response was lacking. But portfolio manager Michael Liss praised the eventual response. “Even though they were late in reacting, they certainly came down strong,” he said. ","

 ,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Senate Democrats are asking a U.S. audit watchdog to review whether KPMG failed to disclose or prevent fraud when it audited Wells Fargo’s books during the time period that the bank’s sales force was opening two million unauthorized accounts. In an April 25 letter to Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Chairman James Doty, Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey said they were concerned that the accounting company issued clean audit reports for Wells Fargo & Co from 2011 through 2015 even though KPMG became aware of the fraud during at least some of that time. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Mary Eschet declined to comment. Manuel Goncalves, a KPMG spokesman, said the firm takes its role as independent auditor seriously and it is confident its audits were done appropriately. KPMG also previously defended its performance in a November 2016 letter to Warren and Markey, saying it did not think misconduct at Wells Fargo implicated any of the bank’s “key controls over financial reporting” and that the opening of an unauthorized account “did not itself have an impact” on the financial statements, according to the letter. “KPMG, in its role as Wells Fargo’s independent auditor, failed to prevent or even publicly disclose the fraud that affected hundreds of thousands of customers, and cost the company CEO his job,” Warren and Markey wrote. Wells Fargo has been under fire since last fall, after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators fined the bank for opening as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers’ names without their permission. The bank remains under criminal investigation, its former CEO John Stumpf was forced to resign and an internal investigation released by the bank recently found that former retail division head Carrie Tolstedt ignored the systemic nature of abusive sales practices - a claim her lawyers have denied. Anger over the account scandal was apparent at Wells Fargo’s annual meeting on Tuesday, as shareholders repeatedly demanded answers and the meeting was briefly recessed after a shareholder made a “physical approach” toward a board member. Investors at Tuesday’s meeting also asked questions about KPMG and why it was able to give the bank a clean bill of health for its financial statements. The lawmakers, in their letter to the PCAOB, asked Doty about whether the PCAOB has reviewed KPMG’s audit work and whether the firm had run afoul of PCAOB rules. A PCAOB spokeswoman said the board looks forward to reviewing and responding to the letter. (Additional reporting by Ross Kerber and Dan Freed) ","

 ,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro dipped against the U.S. dollar on Thursday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said policymakers did not discuss removing the bank’s easing bias on monetary policy, while the dollar jumped against the Swedish crown after the Riksbank extended its bond-buying. The euro initially rose to a session high of $1.0932 EUR= on language in the ECB's statement, read by Draghi, which said the euro zone's recovery was increasingly solid and downside risks had diminished. But other parts of the statement and Draghi’s replies to questions stressed the barriers the ECB still faces before beginning to tighten the ultra-loose financing conditions it has maintained for nine years. Positive euro zone economic data and a Reuters report on Tuesday that many ECB rate-setters see scope for sending a small signal in June towards reducing monetary stimulus had lifted expectations for a less dovish stance. “Draghi wasn’t hawkish enough, and the markets found that to be disappointing,” said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. The euro was last down 0.3 percent against the dollar at $1.0866, near a session low of $1.0852. Sweden's Riksbank extended its bond-buying and predicted its first interest rate hike in mid-2018, later than previously projected. That sent the dollar as much as 1.3 percent higher against the Swedish crown to a session peak of 8.8730 crowns per dollar SEK=. The Bank of Japan also signaled it would maintain its massive stimulus effort, despite offering its most optimistic assessment of the Japanese economy in nine years. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda conceded that public perceptions of future price increases remained subdued, which disappointed some traders hoping for a more hawkish inflation outlook and pushed the dollar higher against the yen. “That lower inflation forecast would suggest continued accommodative monetary policy,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. The dollar was last 0.1 percent higher against the yen at 111.18 yen after rising as much as 0.5 percent to a session high of 111.59. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up 0.2 percent at 99.209. The dollar was down 0.6 percent against the Mexican peso at 19.0560 pesos MXN= after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would not scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). ","

 ,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"Supported by Propelled by the skyrocketing returns of large technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite index pushed past the 6,000 level for the first time in its history. The sharp move was driven by a confluence of positive news developments, including a market-friendly outcome in the first round of France’s presidential election over the weekend and reports that President Trump will put forward a plan to slash corporate taxes to 15 percent. Since Mr. Trump’s surprise victory last year, all the major stock indexes in the United States have been on a roll, with the Dow Jones industrial average blowing past 20,000 this year and broader indexes such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 index also hitting highs on a regular basis. But it has been the technology-laden index of 100 Nasdaq stocks that has delivered the far superior performance, rising 14 percent this year — more than twice the gains of the Dow and S.&P. 500. For the day, the Nasdaq closed at 6,025.49, up 0.7 percent for the day. Driving this performance has been the persistent run-up in stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon, which together now comprise about a third of the index, as measured by QQQ, the $43 billion exchange traded fund that tracks Nasdaq stocks. Apple, Amazon and Facebook are up over 20 percent for the year, with Google having increased by 12 percent. The Dow closed at 20,996.12, up 232.23 points, or 1.12 percent, while the broader S.&P. 500 ended at 2,388.61, up 14.46 points, or 0.61 percent. To a degree, the run-up brings to mind past episodes of stock market booms and busts that were driven by investors piling into faddish technology stocks, such as the so called go-go years in the late 1960s and, more recently, the dot-com bubble that collapsed in 2000. Analysts have pointed out, though, that compared with past manias — in particular the dot-com bubble — the recent surge in technology stocks stands on firmer ground. “In 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170 — today it is trading at 26 times,” said Charlie Bilello, the director of research at Pension Partners, an investment advisory firm, referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. “That is not cheap, but it’s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.” That may be true, but there is no doubt that the explosion in size of these stocks has taken many market participants by surprise, even if it is accepted that their corporate fundamentals are superior. Since the financial crisis, these four stocks — Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon — have been at the heart of the United States stock market rally and now have all reached sizes — between $400 billion and $700 billion — that in terms of value compare with the gross domestic product of many countries of note. And in a market that has been driven by large sums of money flowing into passive funds that track the largest companies in the largest stock market indexes, these stocks have flown higher than most. Indeed, the booming returns of these index-heavy stocks has been a cause of intense frustration for portfolio managers and hedge funds who charge their investors steep fees to uncover hidden gems in the stock market. That is because unless they have a large part of their portfolio in fast growing (and richly valued) stocks like Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they are going to lag their benchmarks and lose money to cheaper exchange traded funds that track these indexes and provide maximum exposure to these stocks. This was one of the main reasons that the fund giant BlackRock decided last month to revamp its actively managed stock unit, a move that favored an investment style focusing on machines and models over stock pickers trying to chase the likes of Amazon and Apple. “The mega cap growth stocks in Nasdaq have had a strong start to 2017, and many active managers have been underweight,” said Todd Rosenbluth, an exchange traded fund specialist at CFRA Research. “People underestimate the fact that large companies continue to get larger. And the answer is — yes they can.” Advertisement ","Nasdaq Hits 6,000 as Markets Rise on Tax Overhaul Optimism - The New York Times"
 ,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite index crossed the 6,000 threshold for the first time on Tuesday, aided by gains in a handful of large-cap tech names, more than 17 years after it last marked a 1,000 point milestone. The Nasdaq .IXIC first breached the 5,000 mark on March 7, 2000 and closed above that level two days later during the height of the tech boom. It had taken the index only slightly more than three months to climb from 4,000 to the 5,000 mark. “It’s different this time. It really is. This isn’t driven by companies that don’t have products,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, referring to the tech bubble that burst in 2000. Of the current index, Forrest said, “You can’t just have a knee-jerk reaction and say tech is doing well and assume it’s tied solely to corporate spending cycles. Tech tends to be a late-cycle phenomenon, though the kind of tech that populates the Nasdaq these days is consumer-focused.” The total market capitalization of the Nasdaq Composite stands at $9.6 trillion. The five largest companies have increased in market value by more than $400 billion in 2017 alone. The passing of the 6,000 threshold is mainly symbolic, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St Louis. “There are some on the technical analysis side who might view the clearance of this hurdle as a reason to get in, and so for a short time gains may accelerate,” he said. “If it is widely publicized, then it may lead to greater participation on the part of retail investors.” Since the cycle bottom in March 2009, which ended the Great Recession-related stock market selloff, the Nasdaq Composite has gained about 365 percent. That compares with a 250 percent gain in the S&P 500 .SPX and a 420 percent increase in the Nasdaq 100 .NDX, the top 100 companies in the index. ","

 ,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"By Alexandria Sage and Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A massive power outage threw San Francisco into chaos for most of the work day on Friday, knocking out traffic signals, paralyzing businesses and halting the city’s famed cable cars. The power outage, which was triggered by a fire in a PG&E Corp. utility substation, disrupted San Francisco’s normally bustling financial district, home to banks and technology companies. The blackout started just after 9 a.m. (noon ET/1600 GMT) and at one point affected nearly 90,000 customers, according to PG&E. The cause of the fire was a circuit breaker failure at the substation, PG&E spokesman Paul Doherty said. Office workers unable to access elevators or use their keycards spilled out onto the sidewalks, some wandering the streets in search of an open cafe or sunny spot to enjoy a rare warm San Francisco day. Others simply went home, with long lines forming for ferries. For many, there was little to do but wait. “When I got here we had to shut down all the servers, all the work stations were off-line,” said Bard Wood, an information technology worker in the financial district. “I’m sure we’ve lost millions of dollars already. There’s no business down here right now.” Some cable car operators snoozed after their cars stalled on the street rails. Traffic was snarled and emergency workers responded to 20 elevator rescues, according to the city’s fire department, but there were no reported deaths or major injuries. But many businesses, from coffee shops to major banks, took a hit. Wells Fargo & Co closed 13 bank branches and four office buildings, while the New York Stock Exchange said its ARCA options trading floor in San Francisco was briefly unavailable. Employees in Goldman Sachs’ financial district office were sent home. King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management, said his firm was in the middle of a trade when “all our systems went down.” He said employees in another state had to complete the transaction. Two office buildings and a local branch of First Republic Bank were shut down, a sign on the branch’s doorway apologizing for the unexpected closure. Fourteen neighborhoods were affected, including the main shopping district near Union Square, where stores turned signs to “closed” and major retailers such as Macy’s and Louis Vuitton shut their doors. In a city proud of its technological prowess, the outage forced residents back to the dark ages. At the salad bar MIXT, cashiers took credit card payments using old-fashioned paper imprints. “Old school,” commented patron Ben Fackler. “I haven’t seen that in forever.” For more than two hours, trains barreled through the Montgomery Street station - one of the busiest stops that services the downtown and financial district - as the outage prevented them from stopping until backup generators came on line, Bay Area Rapid Transit spokesman Jim Allison said. Power was finally restored to all customers by 6 pm local time, PG&E said. “Workers have entered the substation. They’re assessing the damage and starting to make repairs,” Doherty said. San Francisco International Airport remained operational, and a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said there was no evidence of terrorism. The spokesperson requested anonymity, citing department policy. “This had nothing to do with cyber,” said Joe Weiss, an expert on control system cyber security who has testified to Congress about structural weaknesses in grid components. “The real question is how could one substation take out, effectively, San Francisco?” An FBI spokesman said the agency monitored the incident but is not investigating. Twenty-one San Francisco schools lost power, but remained open nonetheless, according to a Department of Emergency spokesman. At least three hospitals had to rely on backup generators, canceling elective surgeries and redirecting emergency patients to other facilities. Joanna Gadd, 55, was in the admitting room of the city’s Saint Francis Memorial Hospital waiting for her daughter to undergo surgery when the lights went out. The diagnostic surgery was canceled. She had forfeited a trip to the United Kingdom, including airfare, to accommodate the operation. “It is frustrating,” Gadd said. “It’s quite nerve-racking going into surgery. She had been fasting, and fasting for someone with diabetes is definitely no picnic.” ","

(CHD), Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) and Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) have all gained significantly on investors’ M&A speculation. Household and personal care (HPC) leader Kimberly-Clark has seen its shares jump 16% year to date (YTD), as Church & Dwight stock increased 14.5%, Clorox shares spiked 12.6% and Colgate’s stock gained 11.6% over the same period. (See also: First Quarter Analysis: Winners and Losers in Consumer Staples.) As earnings season comes around, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog suggests that stocks of consumer staples companies may have priced in too much good news. Wells Fargo analysts indicate that they are “incrementally more negative” on HPC stocks, but call much of the group “uninvestable” due to potential for M&A. Herzog and her team highlight four key themes that will likely weigh on core HPC fundamentals in the near term. Wells Fargo sees top line downside from inventory destocking at retail affecting industry leaders, particularly Church & Dwight and Clorox, as about 25% of their net sales come from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT). The analysts say that retail inventory data shows a widening spread between sales and inventory growth at major U.S. staples retailers, currently the largest since the recession. Further, Wells Fargo says data suggests moderating tracker channel category growth, in which growth sequentially slowed in 30 of the top 50 HPC categories tracked in the U.S. during Q1. The analysts tracked a 1.2% year-over-year (YOY) dip last quarter, versus a 0.4% decline in the fourth quarter of 2016. Herzog and her team also expressed concern that retailers are poised to accelerate price investments in HPC “in response to both weak category growth and deteriorating foot traffic.” Lastly, Wells Fargo says potential headwinds from commodity costs are set to negatively impact leaders such as Clorox, Kimberly-Clark and Newell Brands Inc. (NWL). “All in, we are reducing our C1Q17 EPS ests. for Colgate-Palmolive, Clorox, Procter & Gamble and modestly increasing our C1Q17 EPS ests. for Procter & Gamble (on favorable FX). That said, we expect M&A speculation to continue to support elevated HPC valuations and, as such, are increasing our valuation ranges for Church & Dwight, Colgate-Palmolive, Clorox, Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble. Bottom Line, we remain cautious with respect to HPC fundamentals—and see much of the sector as un-investible at this time given the disconnect between fundamentals and valuation on elevated M&A speculation,” wrote Wells Fargo.

(PM) gained 25% in first three and a half months of 2017, as investors anticipated another strong earnings beat. On Thursday morning, when the New York City-based Marlboro maker instead posted top line and bottom line numbers that failed to meet consensus, the multinational company saw its shares nosedive almost 4%. (See also: Why Philip Morris is Up 24% in 2017.) Philip Morris’ cigarette shipment volume sunk over 11% in the most recent quarter across all major regions, dragging revenue down a fraction of a percentage point to $6.06 billion, compared to the Street’s consensus for a 6% gain. As investors sell off PM shares, analysts at Wells Fargo remain unconcerned, reiterating an outperform rating on shares of the tobacco leader, highlighting the company’s portfolio strength and FY17​ guidance, which exceeded expectations. “While Q1 was a tougher than expected quarter, we believe PM will execute to protect margins from secular combustible cig volume weakness with strong pricing and cost management. Importantly, we expect management’s commentary to focus on continued momentum behind iQOS as the company pivots toward reduced-risk products (RRPs). We expect the stock to react negatively on today’s results and would be buyers on weakness,” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog and team after results on Thursday. (See also: 'War of Innovation' Rages in Tobacco Industry.) Herzog indicates that investors fearful of lower-than-expected combustible cigarette volumes are missing the larger point, in which Philip Morris is intentionally moving away from “low-to-no margin volume in favor of supporting the premium end of its total portfolio.” An integral aspect of this expanded premium mix of PM’s portfolio is its RRPs, regardless of excise tax treatment, suggests the analyst. Banking on the growth of Philip Morris’ new “harm-reduced” burn-not-smoke tobacco sticks called iQOS, Herzog highlights PM’s FY17 EPS growth guidance of 9% to 12%, “which suggests a significantly improved 2H as comps ease and iQOS capacity constraints are unlocked.” All in all, despite weaker volume in Q1, Herzog says results were “in line.” Wells Fargo lowered FY17/18 EPS estimated by $0.02, maintain a valuation range of $140 at the midpoint on PM stock. Herzog warned investors not to get “caught up” on Q1 volume weakness, as analysts believe “PM is executing a broader strategy (started 2 years ago) to premium-ize its total tobacco portfolio.” ",Should Investors Sell on Philip Morris’ Q1 Miss?  | Investopedia

Tobacco makers have seen their operating profits surge 77% to $18.4 billion between 2006 and 2016, figures provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research show. (For more, see also: Behind Tobacco Stocks' Recent Strength.) Amid this period of strong profitability, the stocks of Altria Group Inc. (MO) and Reynolds American, Inc. (RAI) have surged, climbing roughly 125% and more than 200% in the last five years, according to Google Finance. These two companies sell eight out of every 10 cigarettes sold in the United States, the Journal reported. Altria and Reynolds American had 46.6% and 33.6% shares of this market in 2015, according to Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) data reported on by the Journal. The two companies have developed these dominant positions as the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a development that has helped major players generate billions in cost savings. As for how the industry will fare going forward, tobacco companies face significant regulatory headwinds, according to the Journal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration may be able to prohibit the sale of menthol cigarettes—which have been shown to be more dangerous than regular cigarettes—as a result of a law passed in 2009. As a result, many industry firms have been exploring innovative approaches that provide lower health risks than traditional cigarettes.

(PG), global food leader Nestle SA (NSRGY) and beverage giant PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) have experienced a pullback as slowed consumer spending in developed markets cuts into corporate profits. While the 20 largest consumer packaged goods companies reported flat sales last year, smaller firms on average secured sales growth of 2.4%. Reports indicate that as consumers shy away from packaged foods and move toward healthier, alternative private labels and premium brands, the industry could be on the verge of a shake-up. (See also: Winning Consumer Staples Stocks in 2017.) According to Nielsen Co. research, in the first quarter, hair care, cereal, beverages and snacks all experiences declines in unit sales over last year, with only snacks securing a less than 1% gain in dollar sales. Overall, purchases of consumer packaged goods declined 2.5% in unit terms. The only category up in Q1 was household cleaning, with a 1.5% increase in revenue and a 1.1% incline in unit sales. Hair care saw a steep 6.6% decline in volumes, while total sales declined 5.4%. Beverages, the industry’s largest segment at $26.3 billion, saw unit sales sink 1.5% in Q1, while dollar sales dipped 0.5%. Last week, Nestle and Unilever (UL) posted better-than-expected sales numbers driven by emerging market growth and improved pricing dynamics. Despite the Q1 beat, both firms hinted at slowed growth in the U.S. market, posting sales declines in North America. While Unilever posted underlying sales growth of 2.9%, driven by a 6.1% increase in emerging markets, its North American segment fell 0.9%. In an analyst call, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Graeme Pitkethly suggested the weak American consumer spending could be attributed partially to delayed tax refunds, a late Easter holiday and a degree of political angst. Such subdued consumer spending could also pose a threat to Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC) as it reports its earnings on May 3. The Chicago-based company is particularly at risk as it derived an approximate 80% of revenues from North America in 2016. After P&G posted its weakest quarter of the fiscal year, with organic sales up just 1%, CFO Jon Moeller said that there are “probably more sources of volatility today than at any other time in history.” The Wall Street Journal estimates that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1% in the first quarter over last month, compared to a rough average of 2%.   The dichotomy, however, is that U.S. consumer confidence in March reached its highest level since December 2000, with the Consumer Confidence Index reaching 125.6, up from 116.1 in February.   The problem for major consumer packaged goods companies, however, is that household staples don’t necessarily benefit to the same degree from increased consumer spending as, say, the automotive, home improvement and entertainment sectors. Further, the companies are more vulnerable to changing consumer habits and preferences. In today’s disrupted consumer space, driven by long-term shifts such as healthily living and ecommerce, whether or not consumers shell out more for things like dog food and shampoo in no way translates into sales gains for the traditional leaders. New players have entered the field, striking out the old-timers, and the new generation of fans are joining the underdog team by the masses.

Christine Wang,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Wells Fargo's board hears shareholder concerns and is pledging to fix itself, the bank's executives told CNBC after a rowdy annual meeting on Tuesday. Chairman Stephen Sanger said that while shareholders have liked what Wells Fargo's board has done to address issues regarding the bank's sales practices, investors wish the board jumped on the issue sooner. Wells Fargo has been trying to make amends in the wake of a scandal in which employees opened about 2 million accounts for customers without their consent. The bank fired more than 5,000 employees, paid $185 million in fines and forced top executives to give back millions in salary. Investors re-elected all directors nominated at Tuesday's meeting, but longer-tenured members received fewer votes than their newer colleagues. Sanger only received 56 percent support, while post-scandal CEO Tim Sloan received 99 percent support. Sanger said on CNBC's ""Power Lunch,"" however, that shareholders weren't sending a message to any particular director. ""They were voting to send a message to the board, and we clearly got that message that we need to resolve these problems and continue to make Wells Fargo a better bank,"" Sanger said. Sloan who was appointed CEO when longtime executive John Stumpf retired in the fallout of the debacle, said the board hears the message that shareholders are sending. ""We're going to be very responsive, not only at the board level, but also at the management level to make sure that we fix everything that was broken and build a better Wells Fargo — and we're doing that every day,"" Sloan said.

Navient, formerly known as Sallie Mae, was the subject of more consumer complaints than Wells Fargo, Bank of America, or credit reporting agencies like Experian, a report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said in its monthly report. From November through January, complaints against Navient leapt up by 813% compared to the same period a year prior, the CPFB said, spiking sharply in the days after the bureau  said it was suing the student loan servicer for misleading borrowers and bungling students' payments. More from Buzzfeed:  Chipotle Says Its Payment System May Have Been Hacked Palantir Will Pay $1.6 Million In Back Wages In A Discrimination Suit How to catch a hacker Among the most serious allegations in the government's suit were claims that Navient steered student loan borrowers struggling to make their payments into a short-term solution that ultimately resulted in higher payments, rather than income-based repayment programs. Navient denied the allegations in the CFPB suit, pointing to lower-than average default rates and high enrollments in income-based plans. A  BuzzFeed News investigation found in that Navient call centers, the high-pressure environment prioritized sometimes led employees to cut corners with student loan borrowers. In a statement, Navient spokeswoman Patricia Christel said that that the company's analysis had found that many borrowers' issues were in fact related to federal loan policy, such as issues with bankruptcy reform and private loan rehabilitation. She said the company had revamped its website and phone system based on customer feedback. Other student loan servicers also saw sharp increases from November through January, according to the CFPB report, in part because last year the bureau started taking complaints about federal student loans, in addition to private ones. Overall, the report said, complaints about student loan servicing increased 380%. But with 1,400 complaints in the three-month period surrounding the lawsuit, Navient topped all of the country's major banks and credit reporting agencies. Overall, the company still has far fewer complaints than most big banks. The CFPB has repeatedly found that the federal government's student loan servicing program is riddled with problems, making it difficult for borrowers to get information, correct errors with their loans, and enroll in repayment programs. But earlier this month, education secretary Betsy DeVos ordered the Education Department to halt a series of Obama administration efforts intended to streamline the struggling program. Most significantly, DeVos backtracked on a memo from her predecessor that would have made a loan servicer's past performance — including a history of complaints — one of the most important pieces of criteria in awarding a lucrative government contract. That rule was expected to hurt loan servicers, including Navient, that attracted large numbers of consumer complaints.

Quentin Webb,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Toshiba's move to switch accountants reflects a desperation to avoid delisting. The crisis-stricken Japanese group may ditch the Big Four auditor it hired only last year, Reuters reported on Wednesday, which might force the firm to risk using a second-tier player. That is an ugly look for a firm that badly needs to win back the trust of regulators and investors. Toshiba is doing all it can to avoid crashing out of the public markets, which would make the stock much harder to trade and thus force many big investors to sell. Toshiba's many individual fans in Japan – in total, it has nearly 400,000 shareholders, Eikon shows – would be left with near-worthless paper. There are three hurdles. First, a Tokyo Stock Exchange review has to conclude managers have fixed long-running shortcomings in internal controls. Second, the company must claw its way out of negative equity by March – hence the 2 trillion yen-plus ($18 billion) sale of its memory-chip business. And third, it must file full-year results promptly: ideally by May 15, late June at the very latest. At first blush, parting company with PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata seems an odd response. The local arm of PwC was brought in only last year, after predecessors Ernst & Young ShinNihon missed years of profit-padding. Conflicts of interest make a finding another replacement from the Big Four unlikely, the Nikkei newspaper says. The risk is that a second-tier player might lack the resources and experience to vet this complicated, international blue-chip conglomerate properly. But PwC and Toshiba are feuding. The bean-counters wanted to probe the previous financial year at Westinghouse, the U.S. nuclear unit that is now in bankruptcy protection, sources have told Reuters – something Toshiba opposed. And it withheld an opinion on Toshiba's most recent results, even after weeks of delays. The standoff created a risk Toshiba might not be able file full-year numbers on time. Toshiba could theoretically publish results without an auditor's endorsement, but that might make it harder for the TSE to give its internal controls a clean bill of health. Firing PwC in this way could unsettle the exchange too. But Toshiba is out of attractive options. Commentary by Quentin Webb, Asia financial editor at Reuters Breakingviews.

Kate Rogers,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Main Street sentiment has soared in the wake of the election of Donald Trump on hopes that the Washington outsider will usher in an era of business-friendly policies to bolster the economy. But as his presidency nears the 100-day mark, key campaign promises affecting small businesses have hit headwinds, including repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. On the other hand, Trump has followed through on other promises, signing an executive order on deregulation — often a top issue for smaller companies. Now it remains to be seen how long optimism holds if Trump is unable to further his agenda in a timely way. By several measures, sentiment has climbed postelection, with a Wells Fargo/Gallup index released in March reporting Main Street optimism rose to prerecession levels on better business conditions and expectations. The National Federation of Independent Business' monthly read on small business optimism is also holding above 104 — up above its historical average of 98 — but the data have not yet translated into real hiring and spending. The conservative the federation is ""generally pleased"" with Trump's first 100 days in office, spokesman Jack Mozloom said. ""Optimism among small-business owners is tied directly to the expectation of big policy changes,"" he said. ""Some of the president's executive orders have been outstanding, that's all great, but it isn't enough. If optimism is to be sustained, small business needs a sense of commitment from the White House to fix the tax system and repeal and replace Obamacare."" ""It's been a mixed bag for sure,"" Molly Day, spokeswoman for the nonpartisan National Small Business Association, said of Trump's performance. ""We were pleased to see an enhanced focus on making sure regulations don't hurt small business, but health-care reform has been less positive. Nothing has happened, and costs continue to rise."" Next month's optimism index from the NFIB will show how much Main Street's outlook is affected by Congress' failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with the GOP-proposed American Health Care Act, which included scrapping the employer mandate, a key issue for many small business owners. Ben Pouladian, president of Deco Lighting in Los Angeles, grew his company just as the ACA was enacted, bringing him to more than 150 full-time employees today. Under the ACA, he has to offer workers insurance or face penalties. ""I wanted it repealed and replaced to give more freedom to business owners and their employees,"" said Pouladian, whose company manufactures LED lighting systems. ""My premiums have gone up more than 10 percent year over year, and I have no predictability from a financial standpoint."" But not all groups are looking for the ACA to be repealed. Katie Vlietstra, spokeswoman for the nonpartisan National Association for the Self-Employed, said the group would like to see the law reformed and improved instead, as micro-entrepreneurs benefited from the law in some cases. ""We'd like to see more insurers involved and a better way for the individual mandate,"" Vlietstra said. ""There hasn't been any appetite for compromise, and I think the White House has now gotten around to understanding you have to have a coalition of people to support you."" An announcement on broad outlines for a proposed tax plan is expected from the White House on Wednesday, but recent data from the National Small Business Association show nearly one-third of small business owners believe comprehensive tax reform will never be enacted, and more than a quarter said they're unsure if it will come to fruition. Entrepreneurs like Laurie Sprouse are looking for simplicity and parity for big and small businesses in any new tax plan. Sprouse is president of Ultimate Ventures, a destination management company based in Dallas, which is structured as an S corporation and taxed at the individual level. The highest individual tax bracket is 39.6 percent, while the corporate tax rate is 35 percent. ""I am married, and my spouse may have a really good year, so we will get taxed at a higher rate. It's effectively taxing my business at that rate as well,"" said Sprouse, who has to hire an outside accountant part-time. Back in Los Angeles Pouladian is also hoping for comprehensive tax reform and simplicity. He said measuring Trump's performance in 100 days is ""overblown."" ""He will be president for four years — we can't look at his presidency a quarter at a time,"" he said. ","Small businesses see 'mixed bag' from Trump so far, but they're hopeful"

""That's PayPal's best organic growth in three years, showing a phenomenal acceleration in this hugely important key metric,"" Cramer said, adding that Venmo, PayPal's millennial-friendly peer-to-peer cash delivery app, saw a 114 percent increase in growth. In addition, the company's transactions per account ticked up, as did revenues, and the payment player generated a massive $603 million in free cash flow. ""That give this company a remarkable flywheel effect and it allowed PayPal's fabulous CEO Dan Schulman to announce a $5 billion buyback,"" Cramer said. ""The darned thing is a digital cash machine for its shareholders."" Best of all to Cramer was PayPal's move to bolster some of its key partnerships, including with Visa, to expand operations into Asia, Alphabet's Google, to be incorporated into Android Pay, and Wells Fargo, to boost services at point of sale, among other personal finance names. Once, those potential opponents were considered by the market's bears to be PayPal's fatal flaws and a reason to sell or even short its stock, Cramer said. ""Now, Shulman has convinced those companies that their best bet is to work with Paypal, not against it, especially if they want to win over the hearts and minds of millennials,"" he explained.

Faber had previously appeared on CNBC calling for a giant correction of as much as 40 percent in the market. His bold calls have led various analysts and traders to question his market predictions.

In addition to emerging markets, India in particular, Faber says that Europe is a good investment. ""I would rather build up cash positions and eventually invest in the euro,"" said Faber. ""I think the euro is attractive and fairly priced. I think European stocks are also relatively attractive."" Regarding individual sectors, Faber encourages investors to look at interest rate sensitive stocks and infrastructure plays. REITs will also ""do relatively well,"" he added, as well as consumer staples stocks, which have rallied almost 8 percent year to date. And while technology stocks have been the best-performing group under the Trump presidency, Faber actually warns that ""tech is very uncertain,"" and investors should be cautious when looking at the sector.

Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) doesn't deserve a lot of credit for the way it's handled the fallout from its fake-account scandal, which came to light last September, but the bank is trying to make things right. To this end, every month, Wells Fargo reports nearly two dozen metrics that shed light on the latest activity in its retail branches. It's doing so to be transparent -- and presumably to show that it no longer emphasizes cross-sales in its branches, the practice that is widely believed to have caused the scandal in the first place. Two metrics in particular stick out: New checking-account openings dropped 35% last month compared to the year-ago period, and consumer credit card applications were down 42%. Metric March 2017 Change from March 2016 Total branch interactions 54.8 million (4%) Consumer checking-account openings 400,000 (35%) Consumer checking-account closings 200,000 (2%) Credit card applications 200,000 (42%) Debit card transactions $5.8 billion 5% Data source: Wells Fargo's 1Q17 supplement. Last month wasn't an anomaly, either. The magnitude of the drop has been consistent over the past few months. In January, for instance, new-account openings fell on a year-over-year basis by 31%, while credit card applications were off by 47%. These numbers belie claims by former CEO John Stumpf that the bank hadn't previously disclosed the scandal in regulatory filings because its executives didn't anticipate the fallout to be sufficiently material, which would trigger its duty to disclose. Numbers like these also illuminate how much Wells Fargo depended on cross-selling to generate new checking and credit card accounts. Given that these numbers have dropped so far, one can't help but wonder how big of a role fake accounts played in Wells Fargo's once proudly and loudly proclaimed cross-sell ratio, which tended to be double that of most other banks. May Wells Fargo's former retail sales strategy rest in peace. Image source: Getty Images. To a certain extent, Stumpf was right, as the short-term impact on Wells Fargo's bottom line from the scandal has been minimal. Sure, it was the only big bank to report a year-over-year drop in first-quarter earnings. And yes, it's paid a few hundred million dollars in fines and settlements. But that's a small fraction of its $5.5 billion in typical quarterly earnings. And while new checking and credit accounts are down, it's not as if these drive revenue right out of the gate anyhow. But the problem is that Wells Fargo's overarching retail strategy has long revolved around getting customers in the door with checking accounts and then cross-selling them more profitable products -- things like brokerage accounts, credit cards, car loans, and mortgages. It's no surprise, given this, that the trend in credit card applications has mirrored new checking accounts. As Stumpf explained in 2012: There are only three ways a company can grow. First, earn more business from your current customers. Second, attract customers from your competitors. Or third, buy another company. If you can't do the first, what makes you think you can earn more business from your competitors' customers or from customers you buy through acquisition? My point is that it remains to be seen how big an impact the scandal will have on Wells Fargo's long-term growth rate. The reputational damage will eventually subside, but the impact from the change in its sales culture is likely to be longer-lasting. ","
      
    The Death of Wells Fargo's Retail Strategy -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the ""big four"" financial institutions in the United States, along with Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America, but it makes its money somewhat differently from the others. Specifically, while the others rely on investment banking and trading activities for large percentages of their revenue, Wells Fargo's revenue mix looks more like what you'd expect from a traditional savings & loan. In 2016, Wells Fargo generated approximately $94.2 billion in revenue, $53.7 billion of which came from interest income and $40.5 billion of which came from other sources, such as fees. Image source: Getty Images. Here's a breakdown of the sources of Wells Fargo's interest income: Source Amount ($billions) Loans $39.5 Investment securities $9.2 Trading assets $2.5 Other interest income $1.6 Mortgages held for sale $0.8 Total $53.7 Source: Wells Fargo 2016 Income Statement. Numbers may not add up perfectly, due to rounding. As you might expect, the lion's share of Wells Fargo's interest income comes from its lending activities. The noninterest income, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated: Source Amount ($billions) Trust and investment fees $14.2 Mortgage banking $6.1 Service charges on deposit accounts $5.4 Card fees $3.9 Other fees $3.7 Lease income $1.9 Insurance $1.3 Other income $1.3 Net gains on debt securities $0.9 Net gains from equity investments $0.9 Net gains from trading activities $0.8 Total $40.5 Source: Wells Fargo 2016 Income Statement. Numbers may not add up perfectly, due to rounding. The main point to notice in these charts is that most of Wells Fargo's money is made from traditional consumer and business banking activities -- not investment banking and trading, which makes up a much larger portion of most other banks' revenue streams. For example, about $12.1 billion of Bank of America's $42.6 billion in noninterest income in 2016 came from investment banking and trading profits. Wells Fargo operates its business in three divisions -- community banking, wholesale banking, and wealth and investment management. The community banking division is the one that provides banking products for consumers and small businesses, such as checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards, auto loans, mortgages, and other lending products. It also offers investment services and insurance in 39 states and D.C. Community banking is Wells Fargo's largest division, and accounted for about 53% of the bank's revenue in the most recent quarter. Wholesale banking provides many of the same services as the community banking division, but to businesses, governments, and other institutions. In addition, wholesale banking offers treasury management, corporate trust, and equipment financing services, just to name a few. The wholesale banking division made up about 33% of the bank's total revenue in the latest quarter. Finally, the wealth and investment management division provides investment and retirement products to individuals and businesses through Wells Fargo Advisors, Wells Fargo Asset Management, and others. This includes Wells Fargo's brokerage services, as well as financial planning services provided to high-net-worth individuals. This is Wells Fargo's smallest division, at about 19% of revenue, but it has grown considerably over the past several years. The main thing to notice here is that while some of Wells Fargo's revenue comes from trading and investing, most of Wells Fargo's money is made from traditional consumer banking activities such as lending, credit cards, and account fees. This makes the bank different than the other big U.S. banks, as the business model looks more like a traditional savings and loan than what we've become accustomed to from our massive financial institutions. From an investing standpoint, Wells Fargo's more narrow focus on its core business has resulted in stronger and more consistent growth than most of its peers. Wells Fargo is a financial institution that does a better job of running an efficient and safe consumer banking operation than most, and the bank sticks with what it's good at. ","
      
    How Wells Fargo & Company Makes Most of Its Money -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. By now, the Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) fake accounts scandal is widely known, and it has left many shareholders wary of continuing their investment in the bank. Despite the scandal, which was a horrible error by the bank, there's still a good long-term investment case to be made for the bank. If you somehow aren't familiar with Wells Fargo's infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal, you can read a good discussion of it here by my colleague John Maxfield. The short version is that in early September 2016, news broke that 5,300 Wells Fargo employees were fired for creating as many as two million unauthorized checking and credit card accounts in order to meet aggressive sales targets. Image source: Getty Images. Clearly, this was a major error by the bank. Warren Buffett, whose company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) owns just under 10% of the bank's outstanding shares, said Wells Fargo made a ""terrible mistake"" by creating an incentive system based on getting customers to sign up for as many accounts as possible, whether they needed them or not. Although Buffett didn't sell any of his shares in the wake of the scandal, he wasn't alone in his disappointment with Wells Fargo. Not surprisingly, Wells Fargo stock dropped like a rock in the days following the September 2016 announcement of the scandal. Within a few weeks, Wells' stock was down more than 10%. Sure, the post-election rally in the financial sector helped, but Wells Fargo has still lagged the rest of the sector since the news broke. In fact, the bank has underperformed the overall banking sector by more than half. XLF data by YCharts. To be fair, there were some bright spots in Wells Fargo's first-quarter earnings report. For example, total deposits rose 7% year over year, and net interest income grew by $633 million, or 5%, thanks to rising interest rates. Also, loan-loss provisions were down 44% from the same time last year, as energy sector loan defaults turned out to be much less than expected. However, the fallout from the fake accounts scandal is apparent. Noninterest income fell year over year, including a 23% drop in mortgage banking income. Also, noninterest expenses grew by 6% from last year, and while it's tough to pinpoint exactly how much of the increase is a direct result of the scandal, it's fair to assume that it didn't help keep costs low. The item from the first-quarter's earnings that was most concerning is the four-percentage-point increase in the bank's efficiency ratio from 62.7% from 58.7% in the same quarter last year. Wells Fargo has consistently been a highly efficient bank, which is why this is particularly troubling to investors. However, the other big draw to Wells Fargo is its consistently strong profitability, and this hasn't changed in the wake of the scandal. The bank's return on equity (ROE) of 11.54% and return on assets (ROA) of 1.15% are still well above the industry benchmarks of 10% and 1%, respectively, as they have consistently been for some time. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. CEO Tim Sloan said the bank ""continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders."" In a nutshell, the fake accounts scandal isn't completely in the rearview mirror just yet, but the fallout from the scandal should eventually subside. And when it does, Wells Fargo will still be an incredibly strong banking institution -- and well-positioned to benefit from rising interest rates and potentially looser banking regulations. Despite the fake accounts scandal, which admittedly was a terrible mistake, Wells Fargo is still one of the best-run banks in the U.S. It consistently runs the most profitable banking operation out of the ""big four"" U.S. banks, and it does so without taking on excessive risk. I believe the drop in efficiency is temporary and will subside sooner rather than later. In a nutshell, not only do I think Wells Fargo shareholders have nothing to worry about, but the sector underperformance is making me consider adding the bank to my own portfolio. And if I reduce my exposure to certain other bank stocks I own, as I've written about recently, I may do just that. ","

It isn't often that a bank's entire board of directors comes within the line of fire, so to speak, but that's the situation at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) right now, with shareholder advisory firms urging investors to vote against most of the board at the bank's upcoming annual meeting. One silver lining for the board is that it has the support of the bank's biggest shareholder, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). This story traces back to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's revelation last September that thousands of Wells Fargo employees had opened millions of fake accounts for customers in order to meet strict sales quotas and drive up the bank's coveted cross-sell ratio -- the number of its financial products used by its average customer. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. The bank initially responded by minimizing the extent of the scandal, saying it wasn't material and placing the blame on rogue employees in its branches. As the details of the scandal were revealed, however, it became clear that the bank's top executives had known about the illicit practices for years but swept the problem under the rug. To add insult to injury, when employees started blowing the whistle about the creation of fake accounts as early as 2004, sometimes emailing former-CEO John Stumpf directly, they risked demotion and termination. Managers at the bank would even insert defamatory information in whistleblowers' regulatory paperwork to ensure they could never work in the financial services industry again. After an amateurish attempt to explain away the scandal to the media and Congress, Stumpf resigned as chairman and CEO. He turned the corner office over to new CEO Tim Sloan and the chairmanship to Stephen Sanger, the former CEO of General Mills who joined the bank's board in 2003. A subsequent investigation commissioned by the independent directors found that Stumpf and former retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt had misled the board for years about the extent of illicit cross-selling. All told, $136 million in compensation was clawed back from the two executives with once-sterling reputations. Former Chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo John Stumpf. Image source: Wells Fargo. But these changes haven't been enough to appease all shareholders. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises institutional investors on how to vote in corporate referendums, is urging shareholders to vote for only three of Wells Fargo's current slate of 15 directors -- two who joined this year and new CEO Sloan. New York City's Office of the Comptroller, which oversees pension funds with sizable stakes in the bank, will vote against 10 of the current directors. And proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. recommends against voting for six members. The saving grace for Wells Fargo's board may be the 86-year-old billionaire from Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway is the bank's biggest shareholder. According to CNBC's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio tracker, the conglomerate owns $25 billion worth of Wells Fargo stock, equating to a little under 10% of the bank's shares outstanding. It was reported last week that Berkshire Hathaway will vote all of its shares in favor of reelecting the current board, and Buffett intends to do the same with his personal stake in the bank. Whether this is enough to overcome proponents of change remains to be seen, but given Buffett's deep understanding and appreciation for well-run banks, his perspective is good food for thought. Investors will know either way this week, following Wells Fargo's annual meeting on Tuesday. ","
      
    Can Warren Buffett Save Wells Fargo's Board of Directors? -- The Motley Fool

Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), in addition to its dozens of businesses, also owns a portfolio of 47 different common stocks, many of which were hand-selected by Buffett himself. And many of these stocks pay dividends. In fact, from all of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio, the company is generating more than $6,700 in dividend income every minute. Image source: The Motley Fool. It's also important to point out that Berkshire's portfolio is rather top heavy -- that is, there are a handful of big holdings and a bunch of smaller ones. The same is true for the dividends. Most come from these six stocks: Company Expected Dividends -- Second Quarter 2017 Kraft Heinz $195,380,981 Wells Fargo $182,287,623 Coca-Cola $148,000,000 IBM $113,723,224 Phillips 66 $50,834,632 American Express $48,515,424 Source: The Motley Fool's own calculations, using dividends and Berkshire holdings according to most current data as of 3/31/2017. To be clear, there are plenty of reasons to like dividend stocks, both as a group and Buffett's choices individually. For example, you can read complete discussions of why Buffett likes Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo. In a broad sense, Buffett loves dividend stocks for the same reason he loves most of the businesses that he and his team have acquired over the years. Dividend stocks generate a steady, and hopefully growing, stream of cash. And because Berkshire owns dozens of businesses, regularly acquires companies, and buys individual stocks, he can use this cash in whichever way suits Berkshire best at the time. As an example, if one of Berkshire's subsidiaries needs a new factory, this dividend income can help finance it. This is actually Buffett's number one priority for cash generated by Berkshire -- making sure its existing businesses have their capital requirements met. As an alternative, if Berkshire's capital needs are met and management perceives Berkshire's stock as cheap, the dividends can be used to buy back shares -- or they can be used to buy shares of any stock that looks attractive to Buffett and his stock-pickers. And if nothing looks attractive, this dividend income can be added to the company's stockpile of cash to help fund the next big acquisitions. You might notice by the stocks mentioned here, as well as some of the other dividend stocks in Buffett's portfolio, Berkshire especially loves to invest in stocks that raise their dividends consistently. Coca-Cola is an excellent example, and has increased its payout for 54 consecutive years without fail -- one of the best dividend track records in the market. This is important to Buffett for the same reason it's important to everyday investors like you and me. Consistent income streams are important, especially when you rely on the income from your investments to finance other expenses. And when your income stream grows every year, it not only helps you keep up with inflation, but increases your long-term compounding power. ","

Bank stocks have been surging again over the past few days, as the outcome of the presidential election in France, as well as Donald Trump's vow to lower the corporate tax rate, is buoying investor sentiment toward the sector. Most recently, Trump reiterated his support earlier this week for lowering the corporate income tax rate from a high of 35% down to only 15%. Given that taxes impact a bank's net income in the same way operating expenses do, a substantial drop in the top rate as envisioned by Trump would translate into a meaningful increase in most banks' bottom lines. That said, some banks stand to benefit more than others. At the top of the list are JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. These are the nation's four biggest banks, with assets ranging from $1.8 trillion in Citigroup's case up to $2.6 trillion at JPMorgan Chase. Not surprisingly, these banks also outearn their peers, with net incomes over the trailing 12 months ranging from $15 billion to $26 billion. Those aren't just big numbers in the bank industry, either. Aside from Apple, no other company on the S&P 500 generated more earnings than JPMorgan Chase did over the past year. And Wells Fargo and Bank of America aren't far behind, ranking fourth and sixth, respectively, on the large-cap stock index. Image source: Getty Images. But there's a downside to massive profitability: corporate income taxes. All told, these four banks paid $33 billion in taxes since this time last year. That's a lot of mullah that, under Trump's tax proposal, could be redirected toward dividends and stock buybacks. Wells Fargo would see the biggest benefit. According to data from YCharts.com, the California-based bank would see its annual tax liability drop by $4.8 billion if it was taxed at 15% as opposed to the 30% effective tax rate it paid over the last 12 months. JPMorgan Chase would come in second, realizing a $4.3 billion benefit. And Bank of America and Citigroup round out the top four; they would save around $3.2 billion each. Bank Income Tax Paid (ttm) Savings Under a 15% Tax Rate (ttm) Wells Fargo $9.57 billion $4.82 billion JPMorgan Chase $9.64 billion $4.34 billion Bank of America $7.11 billion $3.24 billion Citigroup $6.44 billion $3.22 billion ttm = trailing 12 months. Data source: YCharts.com. There's no getting around the fact that this would be good news for these banks, as well as their shareholders. At the same time, however, the expectation that the corporate income tax rate will in fact fall already appears to be priced into these banks' stock. This helps to explain why their shares are up between 18% and 44% since the beginning of November. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is up 13% over the same stretch, while the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, has climbed 24%. The net result is that, if Trump's tax plans don't come to fruition, which doesn't seem entirely unlikely given the impact of the cuts on the federal deficit, these four bank stocks and others could be in for a correction.

    These 4 Banks Paid $33 Billion in Taxes Over the Past Year -- The Motley Fool

One of the reasons bank stocks have surged since the presidential election is that investors expect the current administration to follow through on Trump's campaign vow to lower the top corporate tax rate from 35% to as low as 15%. But while all banks would benefit from this, as would all other profitable companies, few would gain as much as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The nation's second-biggest bank by assets paid $7.3 billion in income taxes last year. Only five companies on the S&P 500 paid more than that, with two of those also happening to be banks -- JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. Why do banks pay so much in taxes compared to other companies? The simple answer is that they earn more money. Apple is the only company in the country that earns more than JPMorgan Chase. Wells Fargo and Bank of America aren't far behind. Their net incomes over the past 12 months rank them fourth and sixth on the S&P 500, respectively. Unlike most other leading blue-chip companies, banks use an enormous amount of leverage, typically holding $10 worth of assets for every $1 in shareholders' equity. This allows banks to scale up their profits relative to other types of companies. Every $1 in shareholders' equity at Apple, for instance, translates into a comparatively modest $2.50 worth of assets. Cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35% down to 15% would therefore be a boon for Bank of America. It would have reduced the North Carolina-based bank's tax liability in 2016 by nearly half, or 48%, leaving $3.5 billion in additional net income to hit the bank's bottom line. That would make a huge difference, boosting Bank of America's net income by 19%, or approximately $0.35 per share. Bank of America's headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: Getty Images. The challenge for investors right now, however, is that much of this already appears to be priced into Bank of America's stock. This explains why its shares are up 44% since the beginning of November. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is up only 13% over the same stretch, while the KBW Bank Index has climbed 24% -- the latter tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. If Trump's tax plans don't come to fruition -- and that could very well be the case, given the impact of the cuts on the federal deficit -- bank stocks could be in for a correction. It's too early to say if that will happen, but investors in bank stocks should keep it in the back of their minds. ","
      
    How Much Would Trump's Tax Cuts Help Bank of America? -- The Motley Fool

All four of the nation's mega banks have now reported first-quarter earnings, which allows investors to compare their performances through the three months that ended March 31. It was a good quarter for banks, fueled by higher interest rates and income from their trading operations, but none could match Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) performance. Net income at the nation's second largest bank by assets surged 40% in the first quarter compared to the year-ago period. And for the third time in four quarters, its return on tangible common equity came in above 10%, an important threshold in the bank industry. Bank Year-Over-Year Change in Net Income (1Q17) Return on Tangible Common Equity (1Q17) Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 40% 10.3% JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 17% 13% Citigroup (NYSE:C) 17% 8.2% Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 0% 13.9% Data source: Quarterly earnings releases. The atypically large increase in Bank of America's bottom line was a function of three things: This isn't to say that Bank of America doesn't still have room to improve. Its return on tangible common equity proves that it does, as both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report meaningfully higher numbers. Wells Fargo leads the way with a 13.9% return on tangible common equity, followed by JPMorgan Chase at 13%. Image source: Getty Images. At the same time, as Bank of America's CFO Paul Donofrio emphasized on the North Carolina-based bank's conference call, it's nevertheless on track to meet two of its three main performance targets on an annualized basis by the end of this year. ""Many of you have been waiting patiently for us to approach our long-term targets,"" said Donofrio. ""I hope you noted that if one allocates annual retirement-eligible incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax throughout the year, we are basically at our return targets this quarter. We know we have more work to do to be consistently achieving all our targets, but we have more confidence than ever that responsible growth will get us there."" In sum, while JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup also saw their earnings surge in the first quarter, no other big bank made as much forward progress as Bank of America did to start out 2017. ","

Image source: Getty Images Last summer, Gallup conducted a poll that revealed Americans' faith in key institutions continued ""to lag below historical averages."" While the confidence of the American public in a number of institutions, including organized religion, the military, and government entities, had dropped significantly in the last decade, no institution has fallen further than banks. In June 2006, the same poll showed that 49% of Americans had ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in the nation's financial institutions. By last year, only 27% answered the same, a stunning drop of 22 percentage points. That's not to suggest this lack of faith in our nation's banks isn't deserved. Over the past decade banks have shelled out record amounts in fines and settlements after wronging their account holders in a variety of ways. Here is a countdown of the nine largest bank settlements in history. Not coincidently, all were paid out in the past decade. Image source: Getty Images. In February 2012, 49 states and the federal government reached an agreement, in what is now known as the National Mortgage Settlement, with the five largest banks in the country, including JPMorgan Chase. The settlement was the second largest civil suit settlement in U.S. history, only losing out to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement of 1988. The five banks agreed to pay out a total of $26 billion in fines; $5.29 billion of which came from JPMorgan Chase. One of the primary offenses the banks were accused of was participating in the practice of robo-signing. While this term meant different things to different banks, the end result was the same: Documents were being signed and notarized prior to the financial crisis without any verification procedures in place for what was being attested to. Something tells me this won't be the last bank that makes this list from this particular settlement. Image source: Getty Images. Before he left office, President Obama's administration made a major push to resolve the final investigations persisting from the great recession. One of these final settlements was with Credit Suisse, which agreed to fork over $5.3 billion to finally resolve the investigations stemming from the selling of toxic debt prior to the financial crisis. About $2.48 billion of the settlement will be paid as a civil penalty and $2.1 billion will go toward consumer relief. Many Wall St. banks lined their pockets with Americans' money during the financial crisis. Image source: Getty Images. Wells Fargo's contribution to the $26 billion National Mortgage Settlement was just a shade more than JPMorgan's (see #9). Besides robo-signing, the banks in the settlement were accused of cutting corners on and even losing important mortgage paperwork. Every single state and the District of Columbia, with the exception of Oklahoma, participated in the lawsuit. Will this be the last bank to make this list from this same settlement? Doubtful. Image source: Pixabay. In December 2016, Deutsche Bank agreed to cough up $7.2 billion for selling toxic assets in the lead up to the housing crash. As of last September, Deutsche Bank had set aside about $6.2 billion for legal costs. Not all of this will be paid as a fine to the U.S. Department of Justice, however, since about $4.1 billion will be directed toward loan modifications and consumer relief spread out over the next five years. Will this massive fine cripple Germany's largest bank? Not likely. After the settlement was announced, Deutsche Bank announced in a memo to employees that it did not expect the news to affect the bank's credit rating or its operations in the U.S. At least one portfolio manager was bullish on the news, calling the hit to Deutsche Bank's capital ""modest"". Image source: Bank of America. In 2008, Bank of America acquired Countrywide, the largest home lender in the United States prior to the financial crisis. In 2011, Bank of America agreed to shell out more than $8.5 billion to finally absolve Countrywide's sins in selling $174 billion worth of subprime mortgage-backed assets. Ouch! Most banks made this list for wrongs committed during the financial crisis. Not BNP Saribas. This bank violated U.S. sanctions against several countries. Image source: Getty Images. Many Americans lost fortunes during the financial crisis. Image source: Getty Images. Bank of America paid out the most money from the 2012 National Mortgage Settlement -- a whopping $11.8 billion. Approximately $1 billion of this settlement was paid to the Federal Housing Authority to address charges that Bank of America's subsidiary, Countrywide Financial, conned the agency. Besides this additional fine, Bank of America's principal mortgage deductions came in at $100,000 per mortgage while the other banks' same reductions only averaged $20,000. Besides fines and principal reductions, much of the settlement went toward offering homeowners refinancing options. Image source: Getty Images. In October 2013, JP Morgan reached this massive settlement with federal regulators. So, what exactly did JPMorgan do to deserve this? Well, it basically bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual at fire sale prices during the depths of the recession. Unfortunately for JPMorgan, it also took on all existing and future legal obligations of these two banks when it did so. Both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual were heavily involved in bundling and reselling subprime mortgage securities to investors in the run-up to the financial crisis and, indeed, this is what practically caused the crisis. Two of the biggest investors in these securities were none other than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Many believed bank executives should have gone to jail for their role in the financial crisis. Image source: Getty Images. Who deserves the No. 1 spot more than Bank of America? This settlement marks its third entry in the top five and dwarfs all others on this list. The enormous penalty was the largest settlement in United States history between a corporation and the U.S. government. The payment was levied against Bank of America for packaging mortgage-backed securities that were not nearly as financially sound as investors were led to believe. Many of these subprime mortgages were sold by Countrywide and Merrill Lynch before the two companies were acquired by Bank of America. As for the settlement itself, $5 billion of it was a penalty under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA). Another $7 billion was directed to relieve U.S. homeowners and borrowers victimized by the bank's misdeeds. At the time of the agreement, Attorney General Eric holder stated: ""This historic resolution-the largest such settlement on record-goes far beyond 'the cost of doing business.' Under the terms of this settlement, the bank has agreed to pay $7 billion in relief to struggling homeowners, borrowers and communities affected by the bank's conduct. This is appropriate given the size and scope of the wrongdoing at issue."" ","

Heartland has a significant WFC position purchased during the stock’s weakness last year. Still, says McWey, some big questions loom. Chief among them: “What is the fallout with the brand, and is it so significant that it materially changes customer behavior in a way that precludes them from earning the superior returns?” The answer: “We think their profitability is going to stand the test of time. Over time, they are still going to be a top-tier bank,” says McWey. He’s not the only one who thinks so. A starting point for me with most of the names I suggest in my stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks, is the right kind of insider buying. And that’s exactly what we have at Wells Fargo. At this bank, we have what I like to call “buying in size,” one of the key signals I look for to find the best insider buying signals. CEO Tim Sloan and board chair Stephen Sanger recently bought $5 million worth of stock. Sloan bought $2 million worth and Sanger purchased $3 million. That’s the highest level of quarterly insider buying at Wells Fargo in at least five years. They purchased near current levels. So you can get close to the same price they got: $51.65. The two top insiders at the company were probably buying, in part, because the stock looks cheap. The discount is striking relative to other banks and Wells Fargo’s own history. It is also remarkable, given the bank’s solid profitability. “The vast majority of banks are trading at the high end of their historical ranges,” says McWey, at Heartland Funds. But you can now buy Wells Fargo stock at a discount to its own historic range and the banking group in general. “That is unheard of,” he says. “It screams attractive.” Here are some numbers. Wells Fargo currently goes for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12. Its median over the past 20 years has been 13. The industry average right now is 13.6, according to Thomson Reuters.

All of this is remarkable given that Wells Fargo has a return on equity (ROE) of 12.6%, even after the scandal, compared with an industry average of 8.4%. “The bank that has a better ROE should have a better valuation,” says McWey. One pushback here is that Wells Fargo’s relatively rich historical valuations and profitability are no longer meaningful. That’s because they were “bogus,” as they were base on fraud, suggested NAB Research analyst Nancy Bush during the bank’s most recent conference call. But this doesn’t really make sense to me. It’s hard to see how the creation of a bunch of fake accounts that customers never used could boost revenue or profits if they were inactive. CEO Sloan also takes issue with this analysis. “I might just push back a little bit on the ‘bogus’ comment,” Sloan said during the call, “because that would indicate that our statements were materially inaccurate, and they weren’t.” “If the bank is run properly, and I presume that is going to happen, there’s no reason it should not get back to its traditional valuation,” says bank analyst Chris Whalen of Whalen Global Advisors. One of the major fears about Wells Fargo was that its storied brand will be permanently damaged by the scandal. Customers might flee, eroding the banks’ valuable low-cost source of funds gathered in deposit and checking accounts. “But we’re not seeing major deposit flight,” says McWey. Indeed, customers are sticking around at a time when industry competition for their funds is picking up for the first time in almost a decade, because interest rates are finally going up. Other metrics show the scandal is not hurting Wells Fargo’s reputation or business too much: • Loan and deposit growth are “in sync” with the industry, says Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke. “The growth in average consumer and small-business banking deposits has remained strong, up 6% from a year ago,” Sloan said in the most recent quarterly earnings call. • Retail bank customer satisfaction scores are nearly back to levels before the fraud settlement was in the headlines last September. • The decline in customer “interactions” with branches has slowed. Online interactions are up 8% from a year ago. Overall customer attrition rates are back down to pre-settlement levels. • In March, the company saw its second month-over-month increase in checking accounts. Consumer credit card applications increased 10% compared with February, the largest month-over-month increase since September. • The value of customer assets made in referrals from community banks to Wells Fargo’s investment management side are back up to $1 billion a month, around the levels seen before the settlement. • Employee turnover is down. “The business itself is still very solid,” says Whalen, of Whalen Global Advisors. He predicts it will continue to improve. “They will get back on their game. It’s a great franchise. It’s a tarnished name at the moment, but that’s going to be forgotten soon if management can stay out of the headlines. You give this thing five or six months, and all will be forgiven.” “As we get further away from the events, client confidence should improve and their operating metrics should benefit,” agrees Macrae Sykes, a bank sector analyst at Gabelli & Co. One of the long-standing positives for Wells Fargo investors is that its core business is retail and small-business banking. It does very little business in trading, and mergers and acquisitions. That’s good, because these kinds of businesses can hurt shareholders.

They don’t live and die on mergers and acquisitions, and trading,” says Whalen. “That’s why Warren Buffett likes it.” There are risks, though. • One is more shoes to drop in the scandal. “There is uncertainty about how long these investigations will go on, including potential for criminal referrals,” says J.P. Morgan analyst Vivek Juneja, who has a “neutral” rating on the stock. “Longer term, we expect management to turn this around.” But the timing is uncertain, he says. In a worst-case scenario, the scandal and ongoing investigations permanently damage the brand. “The company is not going to fail. But this takes some of the respect away. It tends to infect the whole company, and it takes them a long time to pull out of it,” says Dave Ellison, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund

But the bank is working on cost cutting, and investors should hear more details at an investor day in May. • Another problem is the recent slowdown in bank loan growth, and the delays in expected tax and regulatory reform proposed by President Trump, says Baird analyst David George. If the lack of progress on reform continues, 2018 bank earnings estimates look high, he says. Whalen thinks bank stocks could fall another 10%-15% in the ongoing retrace of the “Trump bump” in banking names. Wells Fargo would get caught up in this. But it might fall less because it rose less than other banks after the election. One thing you don’t need to worry about is the ongoing Buffett selling. He’s recently sold close to 10 million shares. But that’s just because he wants to stay under a 10% position, for regulatory reasons. Buffett still owns about 491 million shares, or $25.6 billion worth. Wells Fargo is still a favorite investment.

One answer that kept popping up was one word: “nothing.” “Not interested, will drag my feet,” said one franchisee. “Not much!” said another. “Have paid no attention, not doing it,” said a third. Not all of the franchisees were that bleak. Some said the kiosks and fresh beef were worth noting. Others see “potential” in mobile ordering. See also: Adding calorie counts on menus might make Americans eat better - but not in the way you’d think Others were even more optimistic. “The overall plan is the best we have ever been offered from the partnering standpoint,” said another. “Should provide a springboard for a great future.” McDonald’s was upgraded at Wells Fargo this week based on the company’s plan to roll out a mobile-order-and-pay platform, which analysts said is in keeping with the way customer preferences are moving.

                                   Gillette has been the leading player in the razor blade market for more than a century. P&G said last year it had a 65% market share globally in shave care as of June 30. The company’s razors, including the Fusion, Mach3 and ProShield, are used by about 750 million men in more than 200 countries, according to a February study by Euromonitor, that calculated that the market is worth about $13 billion in annual sales. But Gillette has come under pressure from the growing popularity of shave clubs, a craze started by Dollar Shave Club, which offers a razor and supply of blades by mail every month for as little as $3. Since it was launched in 2012, Dollar Shave Club has inspired a wave of low-cost competitors to emerge. Anxious to retain market share, P&G addressed the competition earlier this month by cutting prices on some of its shaving products. Euromonitor said Gillette has lost market share for the last six years. The data firm estimates the company’s share at just 54% in 2016, down from 59% in 2015 and as much as 70% in 2010. Moeller acknowledged the erosion of share, telling analysts the company’s shave care volume is down 3.6 points in the last 12 months, down 0.8 of a point in the last three months and up 0.7 of a point in the past month. See: 5 ways to save on shaving “There’s underlying progress that we’re starting to see in terms of the share from a volume basis, and again that’s before the price reductions and the other interventions in the marketplace,” he said. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said Wednesday she was expecting P&G’s grooming business to deliver organic sales growth of 2% in the first quarter. “Organic sales were weak, but likely somewhat expected given recent HPC (home and personal care) reports,” she wrote in a note after the earnings. “We expect share reaction will depend on commentary surrounding the category/competitive environment. Given top-line pressures, we remain cautious on shares and maintain our Market Perform rating.” P&G shares closed down 2.5% but are up 4% in 2017, while the S&P 500

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"BEVERLY HILLS (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said recruiting and retention have improved dramatically in the wake of a sales scandal, as the third-largest U.S. bank has made big changes to how it pays and evaluates employees in its branches. The bank’s reputation took a severe hit last year after employees created as many as 2.1 million accounts without customer authorization to hit aggressive sales targets. Scrambling to contain the fallout, Wells Fargo stopped paying branch workers based on how many products they sold and increased its minimum pay rate to between $13.50 and $17 per hour, depending upon the market in which they work. “Turnover now in our retail bank is the lowest it’s been, that I can recall, in my 30 years at the company,” Sloan said Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California. Sloan, who got a battlefield promotion to the top job in October after his predecessor, John Stumpf, resigned under fire, said the bank has not had trouble attracting new employees since it changed its policies. “When you put your shareholders first – I hope Warren Buffett isn’t listening by the way – but when you put them first, then you’re going to make mistakes. Because you’re going to make short-term decisions that aren’t focused on creating a long-term, successful company,” Sloan said. Buffett is Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"The bank has had a difficult seven months since a sales scandal that severely damaged its reputation and led to the departure of then-Chairman and CEO John Stumpf in October. Stumpf’s sudden retirement came after he was slammed by U.S. lawmakers. Still, David Moskowitz, the newly-promoted head of the lobbying and policy unit, said the overhaul was not a response to the scandal, nor to the bank’s failure of a “living will” test administered by federal regulators that led to the bank’s decision to temporarily halt the growth of its balance sheet. “This is not a reaction to all the events of the last year,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. Instead, he said the bank’s decision was about having a more coordinated public policy approach, rather than each business unit operating somewhat independently. While that siloed structure was one of the criticisms mentioned in an investigative report released by the Board of Directors, Moskowitz said the new structure was not a response to the report. “I don’t think there had been duplication of effort,” he said. “I need to integrate these things better into the business priorities of the company, to the needs of its customers, to help us rebuild trust and build the better bank that we’re going to work for.” The new unit will bring together several responsibilities that had been in different areas of the bank, including federal, regulatory, state and local government relations, political programs, external relations and public policy. Moskowitz said he would hire more people for the unit, though he would not yet say how many. When Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia at the start of 2009, it more than doubled its size and became the fourth largest U.S. bank. It eventually passed Citigroup and became the third largest. Following the Wachovia acquisition, its government relations team had two people. That number has since grown to six. Moskowitz, executive vice president and general counsel, most recently led the consumer lending and corporate regulatory division of the Wells Fargo law department. He will report to Hope Hardison, the bank’s chief administrative officer. The outgoing head of government and community relations, Jon Campbell, will stay at the bank in a modified role. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled that cities may sue banks over predatory mortgage lending to minorities that harms municipal finances, but cast doubt on whether such cases can succeed by throwing out a lower court decision that had allowed litigation brought by Miami to move forward. The court, ruling 8-0, tossed out a ruling by the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that had permitted Miami’s lawsuits against major banks but gave the city another chance to make its case before a lower court. Miami said Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup steered non-white borrowers into higher-cost and riskier loans they often could not afford, even if they had good credit. As a result of this alleged discriminatory lending, Miami said, property values declined because of the high rate of loan defaults that led to foreclosures. The city said it lost property tax revenue and was forced to pay to repair and maintain properties that went into foreclosure. Writing for the court, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said Miami had the legal standing to sue the banks but needed to present more evidence that the injuries it claims to have suffered were tied to alleged violations of the federal Fair Housing Act. The ruling was a partial victory for both sides. In Miami’s favor, the justices, on a separate 5-3 vote with     conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joining the court’s four liberal justices, did not throw out the lawsuit altogether and embraced the principle that cities can in some circumstances sue under the law. “We are pleased that the Supreme Court validated the city’s standing to bring its claims under the Fair Housing Act. We look forward to litigating this case further in federal court,” said Victoria Mendez, Miami’s city attorney. The banks can point to the fact that the lower court ruling permitting Miami’s lawsuits was thrown out unanimously. They now get a second chance to argue why Miami’s claims should not move forward. “We believe these claims are without merit and we will continue to defend our interests in this matter,” Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said. Tom Goyda, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said that under the standard set by the court, “it will be very difficult for Miami or any other municipality to show the required connection between the claimed damages and unsubstantiated allegations about our lending practices, which do not reflect how we operate in the communities we serve.” Miami accused the banks of a decade of lending discrimination in its residential housing market. Other U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Oakland, have launched similar lawsuits. Miami filed the cases in 2013, in the aftermath of the U.S. financial crisis. The city sued under the housing law, which prohibits discrimination in housing sale, rental and financing. Three of the court’s conservative justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy, said they would have thrown out the lawsuit altogether. In order to demonstrate the connection between the alleged violation and the harm suffered, “a plaintiff must do more than show that its injuries foreseeably flowed from the alleged statutory violation,” Breyer wrote. Business interests have sought to narrow the scope of the Fair Housing Act in an effort to ward off expensive litigation. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in a major Fair Housing Act case from Texas, upholding a broad interpretation of discrimination claims allowed under that law, in a setback to lenders and insurers. Then, Kennedy joined the liberal justices in the majority. Newly appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was not on the court when the case was argued in November, did not participate in Monday’s ruling.

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday took its first step in replacing Obama-era banking regulators, naming a veteran financial lawyer as interim head of the watchdog for federally chartered banks. Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, will be first deputy comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and will run the OCC on an interim basis when Comptroller Thomas Curry leaves on May 5, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. Former banker Joseph Otting, who worked with Mnuchin at Californian lender OneWest, is considered the lead contender to permanently replace Curry, several people familiar with the matter have said. That appointment requires Senate confirmation and analysts said they expected Noreika to be in charge for much of this year. U.S. President Donald Trump wants to overhaul regulation of the financial services system to make it easier for banks to lend and has asked Mnuchin to review the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law by June 3. The OCC is one of several regulators that monitors the health of Wall Street banks but has a particularly influential role in scrutinizing lending practices. Under Curry, OCC bank examiners have clamped down on what they perceive as overly risky loans, particularly the type used to fund private equity buyouts. Curry used his position to warn banks when he thought they were talking on too much risk in loans to energy firms and property developers. “Curry did use the bully pulpit to warn banks against risky activity and I think you’re likely to see less of that going forward,” said Ian Katz, financial policy analyst at research firm Capital Alpha. The appointment of Noreika and the expected nomination of Otting meant limits on how much banks can lend to highly indebted companies may be loosened in the future, said Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group. “This is the most bullish sign yet for the biggest banks that the Trump administration will pursue a traditional Republican approach of financial regulation rather than adopt a more populist tone that could include high leverage capital requirements,” Seiberg said. Trump’s plans to overhaul regulation are being held up by the government’s current lean crew of regulators. While the Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, the OCC’s changing of the guard might not be so smooth. Democrats have criticized practices at OneWest, the lender created by Mnuchin after the 2008 housing crisis that foreclosed on 36,000 California families. Mnuchin hired Otting as chief executive of the bank in 2010 and he held that role until it was bought by CIT Group in 2014. Noreika’s background as a lawyer who has advised banks on M&A, including Ant Financial’s acquisition of Moneygram, as well as on the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making speculative bets, is also controversial. “It is disturbing that the President is rushing to replace Mr. Curry with an acting appointee who has clear conflicts of interest, and lacks any experience in running such an important agency,” Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. Noreika’s appointment does not require Senate approval. Curry, a career regulator, was appointed by the Obama administration for a five-year term that expired last month and has since been serving under an extension. While Curry took a tough line on risky lending, the agency did come under fire for its failure to tackle a sales practice abuse scandal at Wells Fargo & Co. The OCC is also trying to establish itself as a regulator of online lenders and financial technology firms. State authorities have argued that is their job and are suing the OCC, arguing it lacks the legal authority to offer a banking charter for technology companies. There are also three vacant spots on the Federal Reserve Board, including the post of vice chair of supervision, which will play a key role in any overhaul of bank regulation. Earlier on Wednesday, Mnuchin told a conference of community bankers that Trump had signed off on a nominee to fill the vice chair role but did not name the person. Reuters had previously reported that Randal Quarles, who worked as under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury under President George W. Bush, was a leading candidate. Mnuchin said the administration was also close to naming the two other Fed selections. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Labor unions and civil rights groups staged May Day rallies in several U.S. cities on Monday to denounce President Donald Trump’s get-tough policy on immigration, a crackdown they said preys on vulnerable workers in some of America’s lowest-paying jobs. Protests and marches challenging Trump’s efforts at stepping up the deportation of illegal immigrants drew crowds by the thousands to the streets of New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with smaller gatherings popping up across the country. A broad coalition of groups behind the events also took aim at various other Trump policies they saw as discriminatory or xenophobic, including his bid, so far blocked by the courts, to ban travelers from several Muslim countries and temporarily turn away all refugees. But the primary impetus cited by civil liberties and labor activists was Trump’s strict new immigration enforcement policy - falling most heavily on undocumented workers who toil in low-paying, non-unionized sectors such as fast-food, hospitality, child care and agriculture. A May Day gathering grew unruly in Portland, Oregon, where a group of black-clad protesters roamed downtown streets in the late afternoon, setting fires, breaking storefront windows, throwing projectiles and vandalizing a police cruiser. Police, referring to the perpetrators as “anarchists,” said they made more than two dozen arrests. Nine people were also arrested in Olympia, the state capital in Washington, where protesters threw rocks, bottles and pepper-spray at police officers and broke the windows of downtown businesses, according to a Fox affiliate. Rallies elsewhere across the country were boisterous but mostly orderly, even festive. In some cities, immigrant-run convenience stores and other businesses closed their doors in solidarity with the May Day rallies, and many protesters themselves gave up a day’s wages to make their voices heard. “Money will come back later, but not this opportunity, not this day,” said David Anaya, 44, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, who chose to forfeit the $300 he would have otherwise earned at his job as a welder. He was one of thousands who gathered at MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles for what organizers called a show of “resistance, unity and defiance,” then set off on an animated but peaceful march across town to City Hall. A crowd of several thousand also assembled in Washington’s Dupont Circle for a rally ahead of a planned procession to Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. The two banks were targeted because of their dealings with private companies that have built or manage some immigrant detention centers for the government, according to Jose Lopez, Make the Road New York’s co-director of organizing. “The messaging for today was to stop financing immigrant detention facilities,” Lopez said. May Day, also known as International Workers’ Day, has typically been a quieter affair in the United States than in Europe, where it is a public holiday in many countries. May Day unrest flared on Monday in France and Turkey, where demonstrators clashed with police. The U.S. protests focused on Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration as he presses police agencies around the country to assist federal efforts at rounding up individuals sought for deportation and threatens to withhold federal dollars from “sanctuary cities” that do not cooperate. Retired social worker Christina Reilly Vaccarino, 78, who emigrated from Ireland at age 15 with a green card allowing her to work as a nanny, said she was “disgusted” by Trump’s policies on immigration, taxes and workers’ rights. “I came to America at a time when everyone in Ireland believed that America is so wonderful, so great. And now, after all these years, to experience this? It’s not America anymore,” she said at an afternoon rally in Lower Manhattan. Some Trump supporters said they would also turn out on May Day. Activist Joey Gibson said he and other conservatives would travel to Seattle to defend against what he described as communist and anti-fascist groups who have in the past faced off with police in the evening, after the conclusion of the usually peaceful daytime marches.

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The most junior investors in US Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) funds will try to boost their flagging returns by forcing managers into expensive refinancings. Managers that do not co-operate may have their fees cut or lose control of their funds in the worst case scenario, sources said. CLOs are the largest holders of US leveraged loans. Equity holders are getting ready to play hardball as their returns have been eroded by a repricing wave that saw a record US$195.8bn of US leveraged loans refinanced in the first quarter alone, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. This mass refinancing has led to lower payments to equity investors, which are paid last with the interest left over after senior debt holders are paid and are therefore most exposed to falling costs on the loans that they invest in. Junior CLO investors’ returns were down 32% in the first quarter, according to Wells Fargo, compared to a year earlier. They are now starting to call for 2015 vintage funds to be refinanced to improve their position as CLO returns come under pressure. Applying pressure to force a refinancing is something that Tricadia Capital has not used yet but would consider, said Michael Barnes, founder and co-chief investment officer of Tricadia, which invests in and manages CLOs. “Those levers that can be pulled to create value are going to be utilized,” he said. “You’ll have that additional card you can play at the table.” Refinancing is expensive for 2015 funds, as they will have to comply with risk-retention rules that require CLOs to keep ‘skin in the game’ and hold 5% of their vehicle’s risk. A record US$50bn of 2013 and 2014 CLOs were refinanced in the first quarter after a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision allowed them to refinance without having to pay for risk-retention stakes. Like most CLOs, 2015 vintage funds typically have two-year non-call periods and are just becoming eligible for refinancing. Some have coupons more than 100bp higher than CLOs that have refinanced, which would flow to equity investors if the deals are refinanced. Many funds raised in 2015 include provisions that give investors leverage and encourage managers to refinance or face penalties, including losing some of their fees, or even control of their funds. Oak Hill Advisors and Ares Management have 2015 vintage CLOs that give managers higher fees if they refinance and make their CLO risk-retention compliant, Thomson Reuters LPC reported at that time. Alcentra and Neuberger Berman also issued funds at that time with provisions that said that management fees would be cut if their deals were not refinanced and made compliant. Equity holders have the option to push for a refinancing or to call a deal entirely in order to improve their returns, according to Bjarni Torfason, a CLO analyst at Deutsche Bank. Several options are discussed when CLOs consider refinancing, including cutting management fees to increase payments to equity holders, said David Wishnow, principal at Tetragon Financial Management, which invests in CLO equity. “You discuss each of these levers and there is a push and pull as you come up with solutions,” he said. Managers have to hold 5% of their fund under the risk-retention rules, which are part of the Dodd-Frank Act and came into effect on December 24, 2016. Managers of CLOs that do not currently comply and refinance or reset will be required to hold 5% of each refinanced class, according to Deborah Festa, a partner at law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. Forcing 2015 CLOs to refinance is most likely to succeed on deals where managers have management fee step-down structures, which may range from 5bp to 25bp, according to Jeff Herlyn, a principal at Tetragon.

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - While a national fiduciary rule for retirement accounts has been put on hold in Washington, a civil enforcement action by Massachusetts against Morgan Stanley shows a state regulator moving ahead in enforcing fiduciary duty. The state alleged that the brokerage ignored a fiduciary responsibility by offering cash bonuses for account openings. The case illustrates (here) not only the growing regulatory risk coming from states, but also highlights the need for firms to look at sales incentives to see if they aligned with consumers. The risk of alienating clients with such programs is high. Some see consumer cases playing to the strength of state regulators. State agencies have experience and expertise in the field that can rival U.S. securities and banking agencies. While federal authorities are best at market manipulation and systemic threats, state regulators are “complaint-driven.” The U.S. Department of Labor this month delayed, pending further study, the implementation deadline of a national “fiduciary rule” that brokers handling retirement accounts must act in the best interest of their clients. Brokers, rather than adhering to the best-interest standard required of registered investment advisers, now adhere to a national standard that their sales must be suitable for their clients. But as the Morgan Stanley case shows, individual states can see a higher standard for brokers. “The regulator employed the ‘equitable principles’ catch-all doctrine, which looks very much like a fiduciary standard,” said Cipperman Compliance Services in a note to clients on the Massachusetts case. “Even if the DoL rule dies and the SEC refuses to move on a fiduciary standard, watch out for the state regulator. Risk and compliance experts warn firms that they should not dismiss state actions such as the Massachusetts settlement with Morgan Stanley as minor concerns that can be settled with relatively small fines. States are capable of digging deeper into sales practices to find fraud. Penalties may be lower, but damage can be just as profound. A sales practice scandal could upend a brokerage marketing effort as surely the Wells Fargo sales-practice scandal hurt that banks. What started as a local problem mushroomed into a huge national concerns. The damage to Wells Fargo in lost account openings and a slowdown in its retail banking has already cost multiples of the $185 million it paid in fines. To be sure, the Morgan Stanley allegations implicated only a handful of offices. There was nothing to compare with Wells Fargo’s pattern of sales practice that covered its national footprint. The alleged Morgan Stanley violations took place in five local offices — in Springfield, Wellesley, Waltham and Worcester, Massachusetts and in Providence, Rhode Island. Massachusetts alleged that the firm’s compliance team was unaware of the practice for at least a year and that the firm had a rule against running sales contests. The alleged “dishonest and unethical conduct” stemmed from an offer of cash payouts of $1,000 to $5,000 for brokers who sold securities-based loans to 10 to 30 clients. Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin saw it as a “high pressure” sales practice that took place from 2013 to 2015.. “Rather than respond to the needs of their clients, financial advisers began to push PLAS (portfolio loan accounts) in order to win the BDA (business development allowance) incentives awarded under the sales contest.” The state’s complaint alleged that managers coached brokers on what to say for clients who said, “I don’t borrow.” The complaint alleged that for clients “to whom Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors owe a fiduciary duty, this is not an objection that should be overcome.” Morgan Stanley said in response to the complaint filed last October that “the securities-based loan accounts were opened only after discussing the product with each client and obtaining their affirmative consent.” Following the settlement announced this month, it said “Morgan Stanley is pleased to resolve this matter with the Massachusetts Securities Division. The order contains no finding of fraudulent activity or that any client took a loan that was unsuitable or unauthorized.” Contests are normal practice at many firms and considered by many brokers part of their compensation. While contests in the past have involved special bonuses for pushing products firms wanted to sell, they have increasingly focused on broader goals such as diversified portfolios and completing financial plans, or overall sales targets. Prizes often include “making trip,” with company-paid vacations. Regulators see them raising conflict of interest questions by encouraging brokers to pursue prizes instead of clients’ interests. Compensation specialists say they can be run in ways that avoid such problems. “You have to be really careful with rewards based on specific products or encouraging aggressive behavior of sales staff,” said Alain Johnson, of the compensation firm Johnson Associations. “That’s not a healthy practice. It can cause real damage in the retail space.” The use of incentives “can be a healthy way to motivate people,” he added. “The best contests are one that have no limit on how many people can win — and you hope everyone does because it’s good for the firm if people hit their goals.” While rewards for overall production are given at many firms, those that boost single products “have never been that common,” Johnson said. “You can run contests that reward your brokers for doing more business with more clients, and not a particular product, which means you are doing more business with more clients. So you get a trip to Hawaii.” The Securities and Exchange Commission commissioned a compensation study in 1995 that provided guidelines. It recommended “prohibiting sales contests, or permitting contests based only on broad measures, rather than on single products” and avoiding “incentives to encourage the sale of proprietary investment products.” (Richard Satran is a financial journalist covering daily and emerging issues for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.)

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"WILMINGTON, North Carolina (Reuters) - Japan’s Ryo Ishikawa, once one of the brightest young talents in golf, is struggling to retain his PGA Tour exemption after a back injury and loss of form with his driver. Ishikawa has only seven tournaments, including this week, to earn $354,700 (or 218 FedEx Cup points) to keep his card as he plays his way back via a medical extension after missing about five months last year. Needing a top-three finish, or perhaps a couple of top-10s, the 25-year-old did not help his cause by bogeying two of his final four holes for an opening four-over-par 76 at the Wells Fargo Championship on Thursday. He was nonetheless was patient enough to spend nearly 30 minutes afterwards talking to Japanese reporters, who still hang on his every word even though he has long been supplanted as Japan’s best player by world number four Hideki Matsuyama. “I’m still trying to fix my golf swing, driver through middle-iron,” Ishikawa told Reuters. “My short iron and around the green and putting it works not too bad but my long game is not consistent. I’m not afraid to hit hard, but still golf ball’s not straight, right-to-left, left-to-right sometimes.” Ishikawa first won on the Japan Tour a decade ago as a 15-year-old amateur and has since added 13 more titles on his home circuit. He shot a record 58 on the Japan Tour on the same day as Rory McIlroy carded 62 to win the 2010 Wells Fargo. At the time they were often mentioned in the same breath, but while McIlroy has kicked on and then some, Ishikawa has not. With his slight stature, he does not naturally hit the ball as far as many of his peers, which has perhaps hindered his progress. Nonetheless, he still retains hopes of representing his country in the Olympics on home soil in 2020. “I’ve played team events, including Presidents Cup and World Cup ... but not in Japan, always other countries,” he said. “If I played the Olympics in Tokyo in three years, that would be fantastic.” In the meantime, he was trying to remain upbeat, despite the stress of struggling to retain his playing status on Tour. “To just enjoy golf and have fun, that’s always my goal,” he said.

Matthew Johnston,05042017,Investopedia,04272017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs New legislation proposed last week could free up over $200 billion worth of banking capital, which is currently serving as a safety buffer against what is known as operational risk. Rather than remaining on banks’ balance sheets, successful passage of the bill would likely see that capital find its way into the pockets of the banks’ investors, either through bigger dividend payments or stock buybacks. Six major banks will benefit, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America Corp (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C), JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Goldman Sachs (GS). The 600-page legislative proposal, introduced by Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, aims to repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank Act, according to the Wall Street Journal. (To read more, see: Dodd-Frank: Republicans’ New Plan to Replace It.) Analysts at Barclays PLC estimate that as much as $236 billion in capital sitting on the balance sheets of the largest U.S. banks is locked up in order to satisfy the regulatory capital buffer against operational risk. Guidelines under Basel II define operational risk as “the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.” Such risks are specific to each individual bank and are thus largely influenced by the unique history of each bank. A history of paying out large legal settlements frequently would translate into higher operational risk. The concept gained importance following the 2008 financial crisis with regulators establishing specific capital requirements concerning operational risk within Dodd-Frank. Like other types of regulatory capital, the magnitude of capital required to act as a cushion against any single asset depends on the assets risk-weighted value. The greater the risk, the greater the weight, and consequently, the greater the capital buffer needed. (To read more, see: Operational Risk: A Must-Know For Investors.) Within the five biggest U.S banks, operational-risk weightings represent, on average, about 29% of their risk-weighted assets. All together, these banks hold $1.5 trillion of operational risk, equal to around 18% of their total assets, according to the Journal. While completely eliminating the regulation on operational risk is unlikely, any reduction in the size of the required buffer would free up capital that banks could use to give back to shareholders or reduce their costs of making additional loans. Needless to say, bankers are making their dissatisfaction with the current rule heard. Jamie Dimon, head of JP Morgan Chase & Co., wrote in a letter to shareholders earlier this year, “If you are going to have operational risk capital, it should be forward looking, fairly calculated, coordinated with other capital rules and consistent with reality.” ","Banks Could Unlock Over $200 Billion for Investors (MS, BAC, C) | Investopedia"

After P&G posted its weakest quarter of the fiscal year, with organic sales up just 1%, CFO Jon Moeller said that there are “probably more sources of volatility today than at any other time in history.” The Wall Street Journal estimates that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1% in the first quarter over last month, compared to a rough average of 2%.   The dichotomy, however, is that U.S. consumer confidence in March reached its highest level since December 2000, with the Consumer Confidence Index reaching 125.6, up from 116.1 in February.   The problem for major consumer packaged goods companies, however, is that household staples don’t necessarily benefit to the same degree from increased consumer spending as, say, the automotive, home improvement and entertainment sectors. Further, the companies are more vulnerable to changing consumer habits and preferences. In today’s disrupted consumer space, driven by long-term shifts such as healthily living and ecommerce, whether or not consumers shell out more for things like dog food and shampoo in no way translates into sales gains for the traditional leaders. New players have entered the field, striking out the old-timers, and the new generation of fans are joining the underdog team by the masses.

Jeff Cox,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Efforts by Wells Fargo to move beyond its bogus accounts scandal have been set back by the loss of a big government contract. The Philadelphia City Council voted Monday to change handlers of its $2 billion payroll account, according to published reports. Instead of continuing the arrangement with Wells, the city chose to hire Citizens Bank for the next fiscal year starting in July. The move comes under the dark cloud that has enveloped Wells since the second-largest bank by assets in the U.S. agreed to pay $185 million in fines for opening some 2 million accounts for customers without their knowledge. More than 5,000 Wells Fargo employees lost their jobs, and several top executives were sacked. The scandal emanated from aggressive cross-selling goals in which sales people were encouraged to enroll customers in as many programs as possible. Philadelphia city officials said the decision to switch payroll providers was not related directly to the scandal, though it seemed to play at least some role. ""Time and time again their actions have revealed them to be the antithesis of corporate social responsibility,"" Councilwoman Cindy Bass said in a statement. ""I want to thank my colleagues on the committee for doing the right thing and sending a message that we will not do business with companies that engage in unethical business practices."" For its part, the bank said it understood the city's decision and said it will cooperate with the transition to Citizens. ""We are proud of the support that we have diligently and professionally provided to the city in a number of capacities as its operating bank for the past several years and our highly experienced and proven government banking, securities, and treasury management teams stand ready to continue delivering outstanding service to the City of Philadelphia,"" the bank said, according to a statement cited by the Philadelphia Business Journal. Wells Fargo will remain a depository bank for the city. Several other cities have stopped doing business with the bank. The bank's public standing has suffered even as it has taken measures to correct its internal problems. The sales goals have been removed, several top executives have been forced to give back pay, and multiple other measures have been taken to ensure proper practices. However, Wells' directors faced withering criticism during a shareholder meeting last week, and public perception continues to wane. A recent survey by Morning Consult showed Wells Fargo second-to-last in terms of overall impressions among banks, ahead of only Goldman Sachs.

Luqman Adeniyi,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"President Donald Trump said he is considering breaking up big banks, but former Wells Fargo chairman and CEO Richard Kovacevich thinks ""it would be a mistake."" Kovacevich said during CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Monday that history and, more recently, the latest financial crisis, show that adding regulations on banks and limiting their lending ability has not helped the U.S. economy and the average American. ""The key to safe and sound banking is diversity,"" Kovacevich added. ""You can't depend on any one sector, and when you become concentrated you have a very high possibility of failing sometime in the future."" He added that ""it's the worst thing [Trump] can do,"" and he hopes the president will reconsider. ""The president has said things on many occasions that after thinking about it and getting input from others, decided to change those positions so this could be one of them,"" Kovacevich said Deregulation for Community Banks In the same meeting with community bankers where Trump suggested reinstating big bank regulations, he pledged to reduce regulations on community banks, according to Camden Fine, president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America. Trump does not unilaterally have power over deregulating community banks, however, and ""it takes mostly congressional action,"" Fine noted in the joint CNBC interview on Monday. ""One of the good things is most community bank regulatory relief legislation is fairly bipartisan — and that helps us a long way, particularly in the Senate,"" Fine added. Kovacevich also said community banking reform is needed. ""It makes no sense that the same regulations are for big banks and small banks,"" Kovacevich said.

Eric Rosenbaum,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Earlier this week the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a case brought by the city of Miami, suing Wells Fargo and Bank of America for discriminatory lending during the housing bubble, could proceed. In court documents revealed last week, shareholders had brought a lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleging that Latinos, and even undocumented workers, were targeted in the sales scandal that has roiled the bank since last year. But on Tuesday night in New York City, something interesting occurred: Wells Fargo received an honor for diversity, making the annual DiversityInc list of the 50 most diverse companies in the world. It even cracked the top 10 for the first time this year. Wells Fargo hasn't had much good news to crow about amid the fraudulent accounts scandal — on Tuesday the city of Philadelphia fired Wells Fargo as manager of its $2 billion payroll account. ""Time and time again their actions have revealed them to be the antithesis of corporate social responsibility,"" Philadelphia Councilwoman Cindy Bass said in a statement. One of the reasons the bank was honored for diversity: the Wells Fargo board. The same board that many shareholders and grassroots organizations contend was negligent in its oversight of the sales culture. But it gets high marks for its diverse composition, including women and minorities. It's fair to ask whether there's a diversity bubble at work here — board diversity that makes a corporation look to be on the right side of history isn't honestly reflecting the bank's impact in the real world and on communities, where allegations of discriminatory lending and minority-targeting of customers persist. These are just allegations — the Supreme Court was not ruling on the merits of the case, and justices indicated they think Miami will have a hard time proving it. But it's an issue that I thought would make for an interesting interview with Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, who agreed to give me 45 minutes over the phone this week to discuss the diversity honor. But there were a few strings attached — the sales accounts scandal couldn't be discussed, and my questions had to be sent ahead of time (I didn't do that). I did give Wells Fargo PR a brief rundown over the phone of the issues I would like to discuss (and, I admit, I even tried to be nice). A day later the 45 minutes allotted was reduced to 20 minutes. Then I realized there was even more that had to be weighed in an article about diversity, including the decision in March by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to give Wells Fargo a ""needs to improve"" rating under terms of the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law intended to promote lending in low-income neighborhoods. The OCC stated it had uncovered ""an extensive and pervasive pattern and practice of discriminatory and illegal credit practices across multiple lines of business within the bank, resulting in significant harm to large numbers of consumers."" If ""needs to improve"" sounds OK — who shouldn't strive to do better? — consider the way community activists describe the rating downgrade. ""We don't think any bank of this size has ever gone from 'outstanding' straight to 'needs to improve.' That is, in the least, extremely rare — a double downgrade. They are the ones who tend to get the 'outstandings' and care. There is no comparison to the double downgrade I know of,"" said Kevin Stein, deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition. So I ambushed the CEO of DiversityInc, Luke Visconti. I'm usually a mild-mannered guy, but I got a little testy in asking him how Wells Fargo not only made the DiversityInc list but moved up this year. He struggled to answer. John Stumpf, the former CEO, was ""fair-minded and passionate about providing opportunities."" The scandal does not take into account the ""entirety of the business situation."" The acquisition of Wachovia Securities forced on the bank by the government was partially to blame (which sounded sort of like what conservative editorial pages said after the housing bust — government forced banks to make mortgage offers to bad credit risks). ""Bad behavior is everywhere,"" Visconti said. I've always known Visconti to encourage provocative questions — he's even set me up in the past with officials who are skeptical of his ranking. So his struggle to answer wasn't BS — it was a struggle because there isn't a clear-cut answer. And he added that none of this ""absolves them for what went wrong and hurting people."" But he does think Wells Fargo will respond in an ""ethical and moral way."" Visconti also noted that corporate diversity often follows scandal rather than being proactive. Novartis and Sodexo are companies that first made the DiversityInc list after issues involving gender discrimination. ""Part of diversity is, you screw up and you get equal blame,"" he said. The DiversityInc list also takes into account many more factors than just board composition. Julie Goodridge, founder and CEO of NorthStar Asset Management, a socially responsible investing firm, said that her company hasn't owned Wells Fargo in a long time — and only when it inherited holdings that new clients brought with them. But when it did back in 2002, it promoted a shareholder resolution linking executive compensation to putting an end to predatory lending practices. ""I think there is a lot of Wells Fargo bad behavior that has been happening for almost two decades,"" Goodridge said. ""Diversity is incredibly important, but there are so many additional factors that need to be part of the question about companies behaving properly in the world,"" she said. Mark Molumphy,  a principal at Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy representing shareholders in the lawsuit filed last week alleging minority-targeting within the broader sales accounts scandal, put it this way: ""Governance breakdown has real-life impacts; decisions made or not made at the board level had real-life impacts for customers and for its rank-and-file employees."" Molumphy said his firm didn't know about the targeting of minorities when it first filed — and still does not know the full extent of it — but it has collected a handful of declarations related to the targeting of undocumented workers, and he added, ""Ever since we filed the case, we've been contacted by dozens and dozens of employees as well as former customers. ... People are especially upset about those types of practices,"" especially salespeople desperate to meet aggressive sales tactics going out to solicit accounts from day laborers or at bottling plants, he said. ""It's just one more piece, one more red flag from our perspective about an active, vigilant management and board. They should have asked questions about this targeting,"" Molumphy said. Wells Fargo has called the allegations ""offensive."" In situations requiring equal measures moral compass and compassion, I can't see a better perspective to seek than that of a spiritual person, so I asked Sister Nora Nash, the director of corporate responsibility for the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, and a Wells Fargo shareholder activist. ""The board has historically been very conscious of diversity,"" Sister Nora told me. ""[The board] includes women and people of color and has been a leader in the board diversity area. But we don't appreciate the other side, where there's possibly discriminatory practices, especially in the mortgage industry, and that's a little bit of a conflict there, and we know there have been quite a few problems."" Sister Nora has met with Tim Sloan and said she is ""cautiously optimistic."" But she was quick to add that she ""won't be going away."" The shareholder resolution she supported to get a full accounting of the root causes of fraudulent activity received support from 22 percent of shareholders at the bank's recent annual meeting. She noted the 110-page report from the Wells Fargo board on the sales scandal was ""very transparent and well done, except it blamed basically one person."" A woman, too — the former head of the community bank division, Carrie Tolstedt. Sister Nora noted that several years ago the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility did a survey of banks asking for a comprehensive review of business standards. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America completed it. Citigroup completed it, in a slightly different fashion that the ICCR asked for. Wells Fargo's response was the least satisfactory, and it received the lowest score.""Like I told them, this is emergency work that needed to be done. ... Now they have to resolve problems — lots of them. ... This is about more than retribution, it's restorative justice,"" Sister Nora said. And then Sister Nora told me something interesting. As a shareholder, she's not that interested in board diversity anymore and has a much greater focus on environmental, social and broader governance issues (ESG). She said the ICCR, of which she is a member, considered lack of women and people of color on boards as one of its biggest issues years ago. But it's moved away from that in recent years, since it seems to her that it's the outlier corporations that lag on that issue now. ""Diversity is independently a good thing, and to the extent they are on this list, it is to their credit,"" said Stein of the California Reinvestment Coalition. ""But I think we need to step back and say a diverse board, and a diverse company, that's good, but it's also important that a corporation is a force for good and all communities. ... All too often, too much harm is disproportionately concentrated in neighborhoods of color. And the good doesn't reach these same neighborhoods. That's where there's a disconnect at Wells."" NorthStar Asset Management officials worry about any softening in corporate diversity activism — they still believe a focus on board diversity is critical. ""The issue of women and minorities on boards has gained traction, but it's absolutely still an issue we feel we need to be addressing. It's still a top issue,"" said Mari Schwartzer, NorthStar's assistant director of shareholder activism, engagement and social research. Northstar CEO Goodridge said I should ask Sloan the following questions: I had at least a few more to add: Sister Nora said that investors have been successful getting grassroots environmental activists onto boards where environmental concerns are an issue. Should there be grassroots community activists, those whom work directly with low- and moderate-income citizens, represented on a bank's board? We've been told for years that one of the benefits of board diversity is improved risk management because diverse backgrounds help avoid the type of group-think that has become synonymous with ""The Best and the Brightest"" and the all-white male, Ivy-educated entry into the Vietnam War. Does the Wells Fargo scandal damage that belief? Can a board member who was raised in a low-income family even lose touch? Consider Lloyd Dean, a director at Wells Fargo. Though not on the risk committee, specifically, he is on the corporate responsibility committee. The African-American CEO of Dignity Health, a faith-based, predominantly Catholic nonprofit hospital network, was raised in a family ""on and off welfare"" and without health insurance. Dean is now reported to be the highest-paid hospital CEO in California, earning a total compensation of $5.1 million. In a rare move, influential proxy voting firm Institutional Shareholder Services had advised Wells Fargo shareholders to vote against all 12 of the existing directors at the bank's late April annual meeting, a recommendation Wells Fargo called extreme — Sloan called it ""crazy."" The entire board was re-elected by slim margins. My interview with Sloan was scheduled for Tuesday morning. On the previous Friday, I had let Wells Fargo PR know that I could not in good faith do the interview without asking about the OCC downgrade, among the other issues, including the lawsuits alleging discriminatory practices. Late Sunday, I received an email from Wells Fargo PR saying Sloan's schedule had changed and he was no longer available for the interview. ""I hope it is not too much of an inconvenience but it cannot be helped. Sincerest apologies,"" the Wells Fargo spokeswoman wrote.

Jeff Daniels,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Shipt, a grocery delivery start-up, is expanding its partnership with Costco and plans to double its overall market size this year. Shipt announced Thursday it will add nine Florida markets — six markets with Costco home delivery and three with regional grocer Publix. CNBC reached out to both retailers for comment. At the same time, a new report released Wednesday by Wells Fargo reveals most consumers still are ""reluctant to shift food purchases online."" ""Our biggest competitor is really the habits that consumers have developed over so many years,"" said Shipt founder and CEO Bill Smith, who started the internet-based service in 2015. ""We have to convince customers to try grocery shopping a different way."" Smith said the company has focused its efforts on service and ""delivering a really high-quality experience so we can retain customers."" He said the effort seems to be paying off with Shipt ""running neck and neck"" with AmazonFresh in terms of share of wallet spend. ""Literally, every month it switches back and forth,"" said Smith. ""We're growing at a faster pace than all these companies."" According to Second Measure data, Shipt had a share of wallet spend in the online grocery delivery segment of nearly 20 percent as of March 1, while AmazonFresh during the same period was 23 percent. Yet Shipt beat AmazonFresh in share for several months during 2016. CNBC reached out to Amazon for comment for this story. ""We took a very different approach to this business,"" said Smith, explaining that most of the rival companies are mainly focused on the coasts while Alabama-based Shipt is going for the ""mainstream, hometown America type of customer."" Added Smith, ""What I tell people is our customers are a lot more likely to be buying Cheerios than they are kale."" Shipt supplied the Second Measure share information, which is based on anonymized data from billions of consumer credit card transactions. It provides data to show exactly where consumers are spending their money. To be clear, the share data provided to CNBC tracks four companies in the grocery delivery service category: AmazonFresh, Google Express, InstaCart and Shipt. It doesn't appear to include FreshDirect, an online grocery delivery service known in the New York market. As for InstaCart, the San Francisco-based company holds a dominant share of just more than 50 percent, according to the Second Measure data. Shipt is a little over 40 percent of the size of InstaCart, based on share but still far from its rival in terms of overall markets served. Shipt closed out 2016 with 30 markets served, and the company plans to reach 60 markets or more by the end of 2017. With the new launches announced Thursday, the company already has about 40 markets. InstaCart, which got a three-year head start and has raised far more money from outside investors, is currently in about 50 markets and expects to close the year ""somewhere between 85 and 100 markets,"" according to Nilam Ganenthiran, the company's chief business officer. ""By 2018, 80 percent of the households in the United States will be able to order [groceries through] InstaCart,"" said Ganenthiran. ""We're growing extremely fast."" InstaCart works with 160 grocers across the country, including Whole Foods Market, Kroger, Costco and many others. The online service even has some retailers such as Whole Foods as an investor. ""The mission that we're on is we're trying to enable brick-and-mortar grocers to get online to compete in an increasingly Amazon world,"" said Ganenthiran. He also pointed out that the company isn't just focusing on the coasts but growing in Texas, Florida and mid-Atlantic states as well as Midwest markets such as Missouri, Indiana and Illinois. Besides same-day delivery, InstaCart also offers a so-called click-and-collect service where customers can pick up online orders curbside at many locations. Shipt plans to launch curbside service in a few months with one of its retail partners. Meantime, brick-and-mortar supermarket giants such as Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger's ClickList service are also expanding their online order and store pick-up programs. Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem estimates Wal-Mart has about 13 percent or more of its U.S. stores with a click-and-collect service. As for Kroger, he estimates almost a quarter of its stores offer pick-up service. ""E-commerce represents the fastest growing channel within food retail,"" Fadem said in a research note Wednesday. However, the analyst pointed out that the online grocery category still is ""underpenetrated at just 1 to 2 percent share of total grocery spending."" Wells Fargo's research concluded that ""consumers appear more resistant"" to online grocery services than investors may realize. It cited a recent survey by the research firm showing 82 percent U.S. consumers are still ""reluctant to shift food purchases online."" Even so, the analyst said the research shows about one-fifth of people surveyed had purchased food on the internet. ""I would say that online grocery is still in its infancy stages,"" said Fadem. ""Investors are obviously anticipating it will be larger. But the question is whether it will play out over a 10-year period or a period much shorter than that.""

""Two big trends are happening: the digitization of money, so from cash to digital, and then in retail, that is fundamentally being redefined by the mobile phone,"" Schulman told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Tuesday. Schulman said PayPal's network of 203 million users and 16 million merchants stands to benefit hugely from shifting retail trends, especially the rise of e-commerce. Watch the full segment here: ""So much of what [once] happened offline or in-store is now moving online. It's sort of buy online, pick up in-store. And so you're seeing both of those trends play into the strengths that PayPal can offer into the market,"" the CEO said. Take Venmo, PayPal's millennial-oriented peer-to-peer payment service that went viral with very little marketing. Venmo just saw its 15th straight quarter in which its user volume doubled, and Schulman said that the time has come to visualize the app's next chapter. ""Now, we're looking to take Venmo to the next level where we can add even more value for Venmo users and allow them to do transactions at merchants,"" the CEO said, adding that the upgrade would allow PayPal to monetize the service. Along with Venmo's millennial-driven success, Schulman credited PayPal's rise to the company's core beliefs and its many partnerships. ""Our overriding mantra is to be customer champion,"" Schulman told Cramer. Considering that drove management to give PayPal customers the option to choose how and where they pay, which Schulman said opened the door to partnerships worldwide. Now, whether PayPal customers are paying in-app, online, or in-store, with their credit cards or their bank accounts, they can do so with networks like Visa, MasterCard, or Discover, through banks like Wells Fargo or Citi, or via technologies like Facebook or Alphabet's Google. ""All of them have now started to become allies in this move to digitization where we can take the best of their assets, and what we have to offer as PayPal, our platform and our scale, put those together and really drive the digitization of payments,"" Schulman said. And as the world moves online and more and more customers sign on to PayPal's services thanks to the rise of the smartphone, Schulman predicts many changes not only in retail, but the financial services industry as a whole. ""I think there's going to be more change in the next five years than has happened in the last 30 years, and that's because of mobile,"" the CEO said. Questions for Cramer?

"Neil Ainger, Writer at CNBC.com",05042017,CNBC,04272017,"A federal plan to issue national 'special purpose' bank charters in the U.S. to financial technology (fintech) companies, in order to encourage innovation, is under threat due to the imminent departure of comptroller of the currency head, Thomas Curry, at the behest of President Donald Trump. Curry had planned to stay on after officially finishing his five-year term as Comptroller last month so that he could push through his controversial fintech charter, which has encountered opposition from state bodies in the U.S., but the Trump administration has moved to announce his departure on May 5. His replacement as acting head will be Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is an independent agency within Treasury and is responsible for overseeing the nation's biggest banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Noreika is a member of the Trump transition team and has extensive experience advising banks on regulatory issues. His opinion about Curry's fintech plans are not known, but without a strong supporter in the government they are likely to fall by the wayside. It could take months to get Curry's long-term replacement approved by the Senate. Joseph Otting, a former associate of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at OneWest Bank, has been mentioned as a possible nominee. The Special Purpose National Bank (SPNB) fintech charter plans championed by Curry have encountered strong opposition from U.S. state supervisors who want to protect their own existing policies that are in place to nurture innovation and protect consumers at the state level of government. The dispute reached crisis point late last month when the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. district court of Columbia on 26 April, alleging that the OCC is over-stepping its authority in granting charter status to non-banks. Fintech challenger banks do not necessarily face the same prudential and regulatory rules that established banks that take deposits do. This disconnect is at the heart of the conflict, along with long-standing tensions about where state and federal rules should apply. The potential elimination of the fintech charter may retard the number of new tech-enabled 'challenger' banks that arise in the U.S. to compete with established incumbents. It is feared some may be put off by the complicated and expensive process of applying for a full banking license if the fintech charter fails. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Patti Domm,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Rick Rieder of BlackRock said the Fed's intentions are clear: ""Only a significant ... deterioration in the economic data, or a financial market shock ... is likely to force the central bank from that route."" As expected, the Fed gave a nod to a temporary weakness in the economy and signaled it is still moving ahead with policy tightening. ""They're looking past the first-quarter weakness. They are laying the groundwork for a June rate hike, in my opinion,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Lindsey Group. Fed funds futures indicated just about a 75 percent chance of a June interest-rate hike, up about 5 percentage points after the announcement, according to Michael Schumacher, head of rates strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. ""It seems pretty optimistic. ... There's no big difference between this statement and the last one. The comment that they are ignoring weak first-quarter growth is the big thing. There's nothing really changed in their path,"" Schumacher said. First-quarter growth grew at a weak 0.7 percent, but economists expect a bounce back and some see growth over 3 percent. The Fed acknowledged the softness in its statement. ""The Committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term,"" they wrote. The Fed also noted that inflation edged lower in March but that it expects it to stabilize. ""While many have suggested that recent data softness, such as the 0.7 percent initial print on first quarter GDP could slow down the Fed's actions, we think that the Committee will be unwavering in its path toward at least two more hikes this year, and today's statement reflects that contention,"" wrote Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer and co-head of global fixed income. Rieder said the Fed has been clear in articulating its intentions. ""In our view, only a significant and sustained deterioration in the economic data, or a financial market shock due to an unexpected political event, is likely to force the central bank from that route,"" he said. The statement did not mention changes to the Fed's balance sheet, which officials were expected to have discussed at length during the two-day meeting. That discussion should be revealed in the minutes of the meeting, expected to be released May 24. Instead, the Fed noted in its statement that it was maintaining its strategy of balance sheet reinvestment, meaning it replaces securities as they roll down. The Fed has forecast two more rate hikes this year, and many strategists expect it to tackle its balance sheet after those moves. The Fed has said it would like to begin shrinking its balance sheet as early as this year. Many market pros expect some action on the balance sheet around the December meeting or in early 2018, after it raises interest rates in June and September. The Fed ""will also be very deliberate in reducing the amount of securities held on its balance sheet from roughly $4.3 trillion to ultimately something closer to $2.75 trillion [over a long period of time],"" Rieder added. The Fed could reduce its balance sheet by ending its policy of reinvesting in Treasurys and mortgage securities when they reach maturity. Earlier Thursday, the Treasury noted in its refunding statement that it would have to increase issuance when the Fed stops reinvesting. Treasury yields, at the short end of the curve, rose after the Fed's 2 p.m. EDT announcement. The 2-year, which most reflects Fed policy, rose to 1.30 percent from about 1.28 percent. The 10-year also edged higher to 2.31 percent. Yields move inversely to price. Stocks were mixed, and the Dow turned positive after the announcement. ",Fed to markets: June rate hike coming your way

Few people would be surprised to hear that Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) fake-account scandal, revealed last year by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, negatively affected the bank's customer loyalty scores. What might come as surprise, though, is how quickly the downward trend reversed course. Before the scandal came to light last September, Wells Fargo's internal estimate of customer loyalty was 62.6%. It isn't entirely clear exactly what the percentage refers to, but it's safe to say that higher is better. And, for our purposes, it's the trend in the score that matters most. You can see the trend in the chart below. From August through October, customer loyalty waned at Wells Fargo, dropping from 62.6% down to 52.3%. That equates to a decline of more than 10 percentage points. Data source: Wells Fargo. Chart by author. Since bottoming out, Wells Fargo's customer loyalty score has been on the mend. By March, it was back up to 57.9%. According to this measure, Wells Fargo has already made up roughly half the distance it lost with customers in the immediate wake of the scandal. ""Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results,"" noted CEO Tim Sloan in prepared remarks issued with the bank's first-quarter earnings release. ""We have taken significant actions throughout the company to date and we are committed to building a better bank as we move Wells Fargo forward."" Among other things, Wells Fargo has: Image source: The Motley Fool. The question for investors to decide is this: Will Wells Fargo emerge from its scandal as a better and stronger company, as the best types of institutions do when confronted with adversity, or rather as a less profitable shell of its former self? Holding all else equal, it's almost certain that the scandal will cause Wells Fargo's growth rate to at least nominally drop. After all, according to its own estimates, new checking account and credit card applications are down by between a third and a half compared to before the scandal. That doesn't impact short-term results because neither of these are revenue generators in and of themselves. However, once a bank gets a customer and cross-sells them additional financial products, they do become profitable. It's by missing out on those sales where the impact will be felt quantitatively, albeit probably by a relatively immaterial amount. But the scandal could also cause Wells Fargo to reassess certain ways in which its culture had evolved for the worse – whether that was by giving its business units too much autonomy or by refusing to entertain critical feedback, even if offered by a large number of employees. Addressing the latter could help the bank avoid similar mistakes in the future. For current and prospective investors in Wells Fargo, in turn, it's worth pondering which of these two outcomes is the most likely. ","

Last September, bank regulators revealed that thousands of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) employees opened millions of fake accounts for customers, in some cases, causing them to accrue account and overdraft fees. One would think this would decimate Wells Fargo's customer satisfaction scores -- but just the opposite happened. A new report by J.D. Power shows that Wells Fargo performed better across the board when it came to customer satisfaction, improving its score in all 11 of the geographic regions broken out by the survey.

Here's its CEO Tim Sloan on the bank's first-quarter conference call (emphasis added): Yet, if you dig into Wells Fargo's own estimate of customer satisfaction, it's clear that the fake account scandal has had an impact -- albeit a small one. While the numbers are improving since the immediate aftermath of its scandal, they're still down from this time last year. Image source: Getty Images. According to its analysis, Wells Fargo scored 77.6% in March in terms of customers' overall satisfaction with their most recent branch visit. This had dropped to 73.9% in October, but was 78% in August, the month before its sales scandal came to light. So, how is it possible that J.D. Power's latest retail banking satisfaction survey showed that Wells Fargo improved its scores in all 11 regions? The answer is: All banks saw an improvement, with the average score across the regions improving by 3%. Wells Fargo, by contrast, saw its average rating grow by only 2.1%.

Over the past decade, the world's biggest banks have only gotten bigger, as growth and industry consolidation have continued to bolster their balance sheets. The 10 largest financial institutions in the world now have market capitalizations of at least $100 billion each. Bank Market Capitalization at End of Q1 2017 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) $319 billion Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $282 billion Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) $257 billion Industrial & Commercial Bank of China $246 billion China Construction Bank $202 billion Citigroup $165 billion HSBC $161 billion Agricultural Bank of China $157 billion Bank of China $155 billion Commonwealth Bank of Australia $119 billion Data source: Bank of America. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America can all thank major acquisitions for their places at the top of the list. In 2008 alone: Moreover, given that most banks are leveraged by a factor of 10-to-1 or more, market capitalization gives only a partial hint of these banks' true size. To this end, JPMorgan Chase has $2.6 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet, compared with $2.3 trillion at Bank of America and $2.0 trillion at Wells Fargo. Image source: Getty Images. And you can even take this one step further by including assets under management and/or custody. These aren't held on a bank's balance sheet but instead are merely administered on behalf of clients, who retain the assets on their own balance sheets. That would add $481 billion to Wells Fargo's heft, $2.6 trillion to Bank of America (if you factor in all of its clients balances), and nearly $25 trillion to JPMorgan Chase, which serves as one of only a handful of custodial banks, overseeing trillions of dollars' worth of assets for institutional investors. Most of the other banks on this list, aside from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and HSBC, are based in China. This illustrates the point that Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has made repeatedly over the past few years: If regulators in the United States break up the country's biggest banks, they'll cede the apex of global finance to institutions in China. ""I do not want any American to look back in 20 years and try to figure out how and why America's banks lost the leadership position in financial services,"" Dimon wrote in his 2015 shareholder letter. ""If not us, it will be someone else and likely a Chinese bank."" The thing to watch going forward, in turn, is whether China's banks will in fact eventually emerge on top. The country is growing faster, it faces less stringent financial regulations, and its banks have the express backing of the government, given the blurring between public and private institutions in the East Asian country.

Most Americans, as well as millions of other people around the world, are familiar with American Express (NYSE:AXP), mainly because of its charge and credit card products. However, the company has a history that dates back nearly 170 years, and many people don't know much about Amex's roots and its products, many of which are structured differently than traditional credit cards. American express was formed in 1850 as an express mail business, after three express mail companies combined: The first two are the same two people who founded Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which was formed two years later in 1852, when some of American Express' directors opposed expansion into California. Image Source: American Express. For the first 108 years of its history, American Express wasn't in the charge or credit card business. I mentioned that American Express was founded as an express mail business, but the company has also operated in several other areas over the years. To name some of the most significant: The most well-known product issued by Amex is arguably the American Express Platinum card, which was the first premium credit card product when it was introduced in 1984, and continues to be seen as a prestigious and high value card. The platinum card was the successor to the American Express Gold Card, which was introduced in 1966, and remains a popular product issued by Amex today. And, the ultra-exclusive Centurion, or black, card, which has a $7,500 initiation fee and $2,500 annual fee, is considered to be the world's most high-end credit card. According to Interbrand, American Express is the 25th most valuable brand in the world. In fact, the value of the American Express brand name alone is estimated to be about $18.4 billion. This is one of the major reasons Warren Buffett is a major investor in Amex, as a strong brand gives a company pricing power and a ""wide economic moat"" that can help prevent the company from losing market share. Many investors have questioned why Buffett has stuck with Amex, since its ""business model is under attack,"" as Buffett himself put it. The rock-solid American Express brand name could be the reason. ","

One area where Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has emerged as a leader is in the mobile banking space. As of the first quarter of this year, 22.2 million customers of the nation's second largest bank by assets were active users of its mobile banking app. This is an impressive number when you consider that mobile banking is still relatively new. In 2013, only 12.6 million people actively used Bank of America's mobile app. That has since grown by 76%. Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author. To be fair, Bank of America doesn't have the top banking app when it comes to the number of users. That distinction goes to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which also happens to be the nation's biggest bank by assets. At the end of the first quarter, JPMorgan Chase had 27.3 million active users of its app. Rounding out the top three consumer banks, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) came in at 20.3 million active mobile users.

The upward trend in Bank of America's digital customers is important for two reasons. First, new generations of bank customers expect a slick and efficient way to bank on their smartphones. Mobile banking apps are thus necessary to attract and retain these customers. Additionally, serving customers through digital banking channels -- both online and through a mobile app -- is more efficient for banks, costing them a tenth as much as teller-assisted transactions. This is why Bank of America's progress on the mobile banking front is so important. Mobile devices accounted for one out of every five deposit transactions at Bank of America in the first quarter, said Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. That represents the volume of nearly 1,000 financial centers. Digital devices are now responsible for 22% of Bank of America's total sales. Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America. This helps explain why Bank of America has been able to trim its branch count so significantly over the past decade, shuttering approximately 1,500 locations since the beginning of 2009 alone. It also sheds light on why the North Carolina-based bank expects to soon meet its profitability and efficiency targets, which, at least in the case of profitability, could happen by the end of this year. Suffice it to say, this is an area current and prospective investors in Bank of America will want to continue watching closely. ","

Banking is changing. It used to be that people had to drive to a branch to deposit a check or transfer money between their accounts. Nowadays this can all be done online. Combine this with the onslaught of fintech companies edging themselves into the financial services sector with slickly designed apps, and it becomes immediately obvious that traditional banks need to master online and mobile banking to stay competitive. Image source: Getty Images. Some banks are better at this than others. USAA, for example, has long been recognized as one of the most innovative financial companies in the United States, rolling out remote deposit capture well ahead of most other banks. But if the measuring stick for determining success is website visits, then four companies prevail above the rest: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).

Quite frankly, none of these names should surprise you. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are the three biggest banks in the country. Each has trillion of dollars' worth of assets, as well as millions of customers, a significant portion of whom prefer online and mobile banking. Bank of America has 34.5 million customers who use its digital channels. JPMorgan Chase has even more, at 45.5 million. While Wells Fargo comes in at 28.1 million.

It's also important because it drives down expenses, which goes a long way toward explaining why big banks disclose how many customers actively use their digital channels in the first place. Generally speaking, it costs roughly a tenth as much to service a customer over a mobile banking app or online compared to in a teller-assisted transaction in a branch.

The nation's biggest banks have gotten a bad name over the past decade, given their role in the financial crisis combined with the recent sales scandal at Wells Fargo. But there's one big bank that's bucking the trend: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). This week, J.D. Power released its 2017 U.S. retail banking satisfaction survey. The results show that JPMorgan Chase earned a higher customer satisfaction score than the average bank in all 11 of the geographic regions broken out by the survey.

By contrast, the average bank's score last year was 793, while the average this year was 817, translating into a 3% gain.

PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported a vigorous start to the year in its first-quarter earnings report filed on April 26. Let's take a birds-eye view of the quarter, then focus on a staggering number, as well as several other important details from the filing. Data source: PayPal Holdings Inc. PayPal added 6 million new active accounts, a significant number of additions, and the single most impressive number in the report. The customer haul represents a 35% increase over new accounts added in Q1 2016, and management tagged it as the largest organic quarterly increase in active accounts in the last three years. Indeed, it's a 20% increase over the 5 million account additions in the previous sequential quarter alone. The Q1 account ""adds"" are significant because they're the single best indicator of PayPal's revenue potential. It's understandable for the rate of new PayPal customers to slow as the company matures. Yet active customer adds have now averaged 11% annualized growth for the last six quarters, and if anything, the trend may be accelerating. This type of growth mitigates shareholders' fears that numerous competitors in the payments space will upend PayPal's business model. The company reported 32 transactions per active account, marking an increase of 12%. PayPal ended the quarter with 203 million active customer accounts, and 16 million merchant accounts. Total payment volume (TPV), a measure of the total dollar volume of payments PayPal facilitates, rose 23% over the prior year quarter, to $99 billion. PayPal continues to scale its mobile transactions. During the quarter, 32% of TPV occurred through mobile devices, and mobile TPV rose 51% to $32 billion. PayPal repurchased $517 million of its own shares during the quarter. It also announced that its board has authorized a massive $5 billion share repurchase program, to begin once the 2016 share repurchase program, with $488 million of authorization remaining, is completed. The organization continued to tack on new partnerships to its payments ecosystem. During the quarter, PayPal announced an agreement with Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), which allows Wells Fargo debit and credit card holders to use PayPal to make contactless in-store payments. PayPal also extended its relationship with Alphabet Inc's Google, adding PayPal as a payment method in Android Pay for online, in-store, and in-app payments. In fact, PayPal has embarked on a frenzy of deal making over the last five quarters, as it teams up with potential payments adversaries to expand its reach. The following graphic from the company's first quarter investor presentation provides a great visual representation of the pace of partnership additions. It also demonstrates the variety of wide-reaching merchants, card issuers, banks, and social platform companies that PayPal is pulling into its ecosystem: Image source: PayPal Holdings, Inc. Transaction take rate, which is the percentage of revenue PayPal records per transaction it facilitates, declined 14 basis points from the prior year quarter, to 2.62%. This is due to a higher percentage of Venmo person-to-person payments, on which PayPal doesn't generate revenue. PayPal's take rate has declined since 2015 as it processes a higher percentage of payments through its Braintree subsidiary (which has a higher transaction expense than the overall company). However, over the last three quarters, PayPal's take rate appears to have stabilized in a range of between 2.62% and 2.65%. Image source: Getty Images. CEO Dan Schulman made two observations during the company's earnings conference call with analysts that illuminate PayPal's future potential. The first is related to the customer additions discussed above: ""...we're just beginning on this journey here. We're beginning to see an acceleration of our net adds coming in. Consumers are beginning to recognize sort of the network effect that we have. Merchants are beginning to see that. And we have huge international expansion opportunities, just better performance that we can do on that side."" The second is the sense that PayPal's recent approach to competition has yielded many advantages early on: ""2017 continues the strong efforts we've undertaken to create strategic partnerships across multiple ecosystems. We have seen the transformative power of these partnerships across our business. It's hard to overstate the difference in the relationships we now have with companies across multiple sectors who were previously viewed as potential competitors. We are now collaborating as strong and supportive allies to create value for our mutual customers."" The two trends reinforce each other. As PayPal continues to pull in new customers, competitors see a benefit in cooperation versus battling for market share. And as it turns adversaries into collaborators, the company gains access to a bigger universe of potential customers. PayPal's extremely healthy trends in customer acquisition, engagement, and TPV have given management the confidence to raise the company's 2017 outlook. While still within a 15% to 17% growth rate, the company now projects full-year revenue to land between $12.52 billion and $12.72 billion, an increase from the former band of $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to fall between $1.28 and $1.33, versus a previous range of $1.26 to $1.31. These bumps may seem modest given the platform's acceleration in customer growth, but of course, shareholders should remember that it's early in the year yet. ","

For months, analysts on Wall Street have been singing the praises of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), arguing that AMD is gaining strength in PCs, in artificial intelligence, and in computer deep learning. But yesterday, AMD reported its financial results for fiscal Q1 2017, and all of a sudden, not all analysts are certain AMD is as good as it looked before. Shares of AMD tumbled as much as 20.6% in Tuesday morning trading after those earnings came out, and analysts are deeply divided on what they mean. Here are three things you need to know. Few analysts were shocked when historically unprofitable chipmaker AMD lost money again in Q1. Image source: Getty Images. On the plus side, AMD satisfied analyst expectations for earnings yesterday, reporting 18% growth in revenue, and quarterly losses just one third ($0.04 per share) of what the company lost one year ago ($0.12 per share). TheFly.com confirms that these numbers basically met the expectations that analysts had set for the stock -- $0.04 per share in losses, on revenue of $984.4 million. Investment banker Wells Fargo, which has an outperform rating on AMD stock, quickly hailed the results as proof that AMD is ""continuing to execute well,"" as the TheFly reports. Accordingly, Wells raised its price target on AMD stock to a range of $13 to $15 per share. Canadian banker Canaccord -- likewise an AMD backer with a buy rating -- argued that AMD's Ryzen line of desktop CPUs is gaining traction in the market. The analyst doubled down on its buy rating, and continues to insist that AMD's stock, which was priced at $13 and change before earnings, and which sold as low as sub-$11 on Tuesday, is worth at least $17 a share. But not all analysts are enthusiastic. Goldman Sachs for example, which made a bold call against AMD stock earlier this year, zeroed in on weak guidance at AMD as supporting its thesis that the stock is ""priced for perfection."" Operating costs are rising, warns Goldman, while free cash flow has already turned negative at AMD. Accordingly, Goldman is also doubling down on its rating -- sell -- and cutting its price target to $10.60 per share. Finally, Australian banker Macquarie has just chimed in with an actual downgrade of AMD stock, cutting AMD to underperform (with a $10 price target). In a note covered on StreetInsider.com, Macquarie echoes Citi's concerns that margin expansion ""will prove to be a challenge,"" and warns that any market share AMD is gaining from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will quickly be lost again to Intel when it cuts prices on its chips to win back customers from AMD. And with AMD warning that its gross margin is already starting to ebb, AMD may not be able to survive a price war against Intel. So how bad was AMD's report, actually? Pretty bad -- and certainly worse than media reports, which have been focusing on AMD's pro forma numbers, let on. By the pro forma standard of non-GAAP financial results, AMD lost only $0.04 per share last quarter, which as I said above was a two-thirds improvement from last year's Q1 pro forma loss of $0.12. Under GAAP accounting standards, however, AMD lost $0.14 per share in Q1 2016, and cut that loss by less than half in Q1 2017, to $0.08 per share -- twice the size of the pro forma loss that AMD bulls are citing. Free cash flow, as Goldman Sachs pointed out, ran negative to the tune of $322 million in cash burnt during the quarter. Meanwhile, on the guidance front, AMD: So how should investors make sense of all the above? Here's how I look at it: Meanwhile, AMD is guiding toward only moderate growth in sales next quarter, and promising weakening profit margins, which sounds a lot like what the AMD doomsayers have been predicting -- that AMD might gain market share temporarily, but would quickly suffer the ill effects of a price war as Intel, NVIDIA, and other chip rivals fight back for their lost share. To me, none of this sounds like a scenario that will end in AMD breaking its historical pattern of losing money and burning cash. Put me in the bears column on this one. If you own AMD stock, now seems like a good time to declare victory, take profits, and seek a more viable business to put them to work in. ","

Buffett already loved Heinz for its valuable brand and dominant market position (think about it -- can you even name the number two brand of ketchup?). The combination with Kraft Foods was a no-brainer, as it added economies of scale to two already solid food businesses. Construction materials company USG (NYSE:USG) is Berkshire's second-largest stake by percentage and is known for its Sheetrock brand of drywall, as well as other building materials, such as roofboard, insulation, and more. Warren Buffett played a major role in USG's turnaround a few years ago and is now well-positioned to profit from the expected increase in U.S. infrastructure spending, as my colleague Neha Chamaria recently explained. Healthcare company DaVita (NYSE:DVA) provides dialysis services in the U.S. and has more than one-third of the market. What's more, the company's revenue has steadily grown over the past decade or so. And since the company provides a non-discretionary (needed) service, its business should do just fine, no matter what the economy is doing. American Express (NYSE:AXP) has a lot of qualities that Buffett loves to see. According to Interbrand, American Express has the 25th most valuable brand in the world, worth more than $18 billion. That's more than Visa or MasterCard, which ranked 61st and 76th, respectively. The company also has a desirable, affluent cardholder base that gives it pricing power over rivals. Even with the emergence of new payment technologies, Buffett has recently stated that he's sticking with Amex as a long-term investment. Warren Buffett has been an investor in Moody's (NYSE:MCO) for some time now. The credit rating agency is in a high-barrier-to-entry industry and generates a lot of capital without requiring much money to grow. Basically, as long as the need for credit ratings exists, Moody's should do just fine. Furthermore, its shareholder-friendly management has done a great job of returning capital to shareholders through aggressive buybacks and ever-increasing dividends. Warren Buffett -- or more likely, one of his stock-pickers -- picked up a stake in Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN) in 2013. And just like the other stocks on this list, the internet registry company has several Buffett-stock qualities. The company is a leader in its industry, has a strong brand, and produces excellent recurring cash flow. It's also worth mentioning that there are several other companies in Berkshire's portfolio that are just under 10% stakes. Most notably, Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake was over 10% until very recently, when Buffett announced that he was selling some of Berkshire's shares for the specific purpose of remaining under the 10% threshold, which is significant in the banking industry. In addition, Berkshire's stakes in Coca-Cola, Axalta, and American Airlines are all above 9% of each company's total outstanding shares. The bottom line is that in addition to its wholly-owned businesses, Berkshire has some rather large (and in some cases, very influential) stakes in publicly traded businesses, many of which are large, household names.

                                   shed 17% to $1.61, the lowest price seen since August 1983, according to FactSet data. Volume ballooned to 115.3 million shares, nearly triple the full-day average of about 43.0 million shares. The company said late Tuesday it would pay a second-quarter dividend of 4 cents a share, which was 62% below the first-quarter dividend of 10.5 cents a share, in an effort to provide some “financial flexibility.” The new dividend will be payable June 30 to shareholders of record on June 15. Although investors were already bracing for a dividend cut, Jefferies analyst Scott Goldman said he was assuming a cut of about 50%. Goldman cut his stock-price target to $2.00 from $3.50, but kept his rating at buy, as he likes the message management appears to be sending. “The magnitude of the dividend cut was greater than expected, but it is likely the prudent approach given balance sheet and operational challenges,” Goldman wrote in a note to clients. UBS analyst Batya Levi downgraded the stock to neutral, after being a by for more than three years. Levi had previously believed the dividend would be sustained, as management appeared to have time to execute its turnaround strategy. “We are stepping to the sidelines until we get more visibility on execution going forward,” Levi wrote. Analyst Jennifer Fritzsche at Wells Fargo kept her rating at market perform, saying that while the reallocation of capital to reduce debt leverage is good for the company over the long term, she said she believes the company’s leverage target is “somewhat optimistic” without a “significant” operational turnaround. “This is hard for us to see given the increasingly competitive push from cable,” Fritzsche wrote. Frontier also reported late Tuesday a first-quarter net loss that narrowed to $129 million, or 11 cents a share, from $240 million, or 21 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. But excluding nonrecurring items, the company’s adjusted per-share loss of 8 cents was wider than the FactSet consensus of 6 cents. Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan kept his rating at outperform and price target at $4.50, saying that although the quarter was “messy,” the dividend cut removes a key overhang that had been concerning both institutional and retail investors for the past few weeks. “Longer term, we believe the value of Frontier’s fiber-based network assets is much higher than where the stock trades today, and consistent leadership should drive value,” Louthan wrote. Separately, the company said it would set the reverse-stock-split it was planning at 1-for-15. The company had proposed the reverse split in March, subject to shareholder approval on May 10. If implemented at current levels, the stock price would adjust to $25.35. “The board of directors believes that the increased trading price of our common stock expected as a result of the reverse stock split may improve marketability and liquidity of our Common Stock and further encourage interest and trading in our common stock,” Frontier stated in its proxy statement. “For example, the board of directors believes that some institutional investors and investment funds may be reluctant to invest, and in some cases may be prohibited by their investing guidelines from investing in lower priced stocks, and that brokerage firms may be reluctant to recommend lower-priced stocks to their retail clients.” The stock has lost more than half its value since the start of the year, while the iShares U.S. Telecommunications exchange-traded fund

Ryan Vlastelica,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: May 1, 2017 3:07 p.m. ET BlackRock CEO: Passive investors ‘have to be a change agent, if necessary’ By Index-fund operators, who have grown into market heavyweights, aren’t opposed to throwing that weight around. While passive investing may be, at its heart, a do-nothing strategy, that doesn’t mean passive investors are doing nothing with their holdings. The founders of major passive-centric asset managing firms have spoken about the need to take a more active role in the companies they have no choice about owning, a shift that could lead to changes in environmental policies and corporate governance practices. Whereas active managers individually select the holdings of their portfolios, passive fund managers simply track a benchmark like the S&P 500

                                   holding whatever the underlying index does, and in the same proportion. While data have repeatedly shown that index funds boast better long-term performance (and lower fees), the structure of the funds means they can’t avoid names in troubled industries, or which are suffering through scandals or other problems. This puts passive managers in an unusual position, as while they are officially agnostic about the companies they own, the funds control sizable stakes that the managers can use—through their voting rights—to enact changes that may boost returns or achieve other goals. “Active managers, if they don’t like a company’s management, can just sell the stock. Passive managers can’t, but what they can do is pressure the company to improve the management,” said Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, who spoke at last week’s Morningstar Investment Conference. Bogle, who pioneered the idea of index-tracking funds, said that Vanguard was requesting more “ESG” data from companies, referring to information on their environmental, social, and governance policies. While there are ESG-dedicated funds, which favor companies with strong environmental or corporate governance policies, passive managers can push for companies to improve performance on these metrics. See also:  Jack Bogle on how to invest in a time of Trump: ‘Be realistic’ Passive funds are hardly majority shareholders, and considerably fewer assets are held in passive products compared with active—$5.3 trillion versus $9.3 trillion, according to Morningstar. Still, the passive category is getting an increasingly large slice of the pie, and it is where investors have been trending for years. According to The Wall Street Journal, which in October looked at data from Morningstar and S&P Global Market Intelligence, U.S.-based index funds own 11.6% of the S&P 500, up from 4.6% a decade ago. In June, Vanguard held a stake of at least 5% in 468 of the S&P’s 500 components through the funds it oversees.

While passive investors may not be as aggressive with their voting rights as an activist hedge-fund manager—who can swoop in to buy controlling stakes and force fundamental changes to structure or operations—they’re hardly hands off, weighing in on executive pay, management, and mergers. “Passive managers have to become more active—not to the point that they’re becoming activists, but they need to be more active in the dialogue they’re having with the management,” said Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc.

Joseph Adinolfi,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: May 1, 2017 2:00 p.m. ET Growing acceptance of digital currencies is helping to push prices higher By Two of the world’s most popular digital currencies rose to records on Monday, with the Bitcoin price eclipsing the $1,400 level for the first time ever. Ethereum, the world’s second-largest digital token, climbed above $80 for the first time. Both currencies have surged since the beginning of the year as investors remain optimistic that the Securities and Exchange Commission could soon approve the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund after saying last week that it would reconsider an earlier rejection. However, some market strategists cautioned that the SEC’s review is part of routine due diligence, and that investors shouldn’t read too much into it. The market regulator rejected two proposed bitcoin ETFs in March; a third is still under consideration, but a decision isn’t imminent. In April, Japan cleared the way for large institutional money managers and banks to get involved in the space. And Russian authorities said last month that they would recognize bitcoin and its peers as soon as next year, while the Indian government is leaning toward legalizing bitcoin and other digital currencies, according to local media reports. And although China has cracked down on money laundering and market manipulation, which has driven volume in digital currencies sharply lower, it also has forced the largest cryptocurrency exchanges to upgrade their anti-money-laundering systems. “These small things are helping the public at large to feel safe in the investment of Bitcoin,” said Marco Streng, chief executive officer of Genesis Mining. “The more acceptance it gets from around the world, and the more it hits the newspapers with positive headlines, the higher the price will boom.” Chris Dannen, founder of New York-based cryptoasset fund Iterative Instinct, said the growing adoption of so-called alt-coins—a category that includes every cryptocurrency aside from bitcoin—has in turn benefited bitcoin. “I think it’s the excitement over alt-coins that’s driving the bitcoin price higher,” Dannen said.

As a result, the price of bitcoin traded on Bitfinex has rocketed to $1,500 as worried customers swallow a more than $100 premium to safely move their assets off Bitfinex’s platform. Chris Burniske, blockchain analyst and products lead at ARK Invest, said bitcoin’s foray into record territory is partly the result of a delayed reaction to a slowdown in the bitcoin supply’s rate of growth. Approximately every four years, the number of bitcoins awarded to bitcoin miners is cut in half, effectively reducing the rate of bitcoin inflation.

                                   said Thursday that it raised $225 million after offering 15 million shares at $15, the midpoint of its targeted price range of $14 to $16. At that price, Carvana now has a fully diluted market cap of $2.1 billion and enterprise value of $1.8 billion. Carvana has been approved to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CVNA.” Wells Fargo Securities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank Securities were the lead underwriters on the offering. Here are four things to know about Carvana as its goes public. How it works Carvana sells used cars online, with a current inventory of 7,300 used and reconditioned vehicles. Customers pick out the cars online and then can schedule a delivery of the car or go pick it up from Carvana’s multistory, coin-operated vending machines, primarily located in Texas. In about two dozen markets, Carvana offers next-day delivery. Read also: Four things to know about the Cloudera IPO The service launched in January 2013, starting in Atlanta, and as of Dec. 31, 2016, had sold about 27,500 vehicles. Carvana began in 2012 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DriveTime Automotive Group Inc., the used-car dealership chain mostly aimed at subprime borrowers that was formerly known as Ugly Duckling, but it was spun off in November 2014. Growing losses Carvana recorded growing revenue of $365 million in 2016, up from $130.4 million in 2015 and $41.7 million the year before. Net losses grew at the same time, however, with the company losing $93.1 million in 2016 after a loss of $36.8 million in 2015, which Carvana attributed to investing “heavily” in growth. Carvana has raised $460 million from unnamed investors. In January, Ally Financial said it would provide $600 million in financing. Subject to regulation Carvana offers financing to its customers for the purchase of the used cars, and uses its own proprietary models to forecast loss rates for the loans it originates. It then looks to sell the loans to third parties “at a premium.” Carvana recorded $13 million in other sales and revenues, which includes the sale of its loans, in 2016. The sales of receivables make up a “substantial portion” of the company’s revenue, but that could be affected by pending regulations from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the uncertain status of the Dodd-Frank Act under President Donald Trump, the company says in the prospectus. Other factors that could affect Carvana’s revenue include competition from other used car businesses, particularly if they cultivate more of an online presence, and slowing demand for used cars, which Carvana said could be perpetuated by increased usage of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. Voting power Though shareholders will receive one vote per share of the 15 million shares sold, this amounts to 1% voting power in the company, while holders of the class B common stock will have 99% voting power. Ernie Garcia, Carvana’s chief executive, and his father Ernest Garcia II, will control about 97% of the voting interest in the company, making it a controlled company. The Garcia group has said they would like to buy up to $20 million in shares of class A common stock at the IPO price. Ernie Garcia has indicated an interest in buying $2 million of those shares. These purchases would take away from the overall number of shares offered to the public. ",Carvana IPO: 4 things to know about the car vending machine company - MarketWatch

This was Johnson’s first earnings call in the role. “We’ve got this early spark with Unicorn out there that has really ignited, I think, interest in the product,” he said. For this year’s Frappuccino Happy Hour, there will be a new beverage and extended hours. The Unicorn Frappuccino was available from April 19 through April 23. In that period, it trended on Twitter, sparking both positive and negative feedback. #ImSoGladIFound the modern-day unicorn! #unicornfrappuccino @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/Q84Ae3xp51 Putting the #unicornfrappuccino where it belongs. 🤢😷 pic.twitter.com/CwW7YHGlXc The colorful concoction was made with mango syrup, sour blue drizzle, sweet pink powder and vanilla whipped cream.

On a downbeat note, Starbucks said it’s reviewing its 350 Teavana mall stores, which have been having a negative impact on results. Teavana, the company’s tea business, is accretive, according to Johnson. However, the brand’s stores have fallen victim to the traffic declines that are hurting malls across the country. Executives remain bullish on the brand, saying Teavana along with the company’s iced beverages and Starbucks “Refreshers” contributed to an additional one point of second-quarter same-store sales in the Americas. And Teavana sales are accelerating in the China/Asia-Pacific region. But the mall stores are a weak spot, reporting negative same-store sales and operating losses “for some time,” according to Scott Harlan Maw, chief financial officer of Starbucks. “Since the acquisition we’ve invested in new store designs and improved merchandising, but the rate of the decline coming through the last holiday and into the second quarter is worse than we had forecast and we are expecting further declines at a number of at-risk Teavana mall stores,” Maw said. In Starbucks stores, Teavana outperforms, according to Maw, with sales growing almost 10% globally. Wells Fargo isn’t concerned by the news, focusing instead on the digital focus at the company, particularly mobile order and pay. “Starbucks is increasing its planned spend on value creating investments (a good thing in our view), and is negatively impacted in one of the worst retail environments in recent history by poor results of 350 stores (out of 26,000 globally),” analysts wrote in a Thursday note. “[A]ll in all, nothing to be overly concerned about in our view.” Mobile order and pay now makes up 8% of transactions, with mobile payment reaching 29% of transactions, and Starbucks Rewards representing 36% of U.S. company-operated sales for the quarter. However, mobile order and pay has had issues with filling the high volume of orders, with customers complaining about wait times, issues that Johnson says the company is addressing with results. See also: Starbucks is trying to perfect mobile ordering - using its own employees “We expect these issues to be gradually resolved as the year progresses, and remain very encouraged by the long-term opportunity of this initiative,” Wells Fargo wrote. Analysts believe that the company’s ongoing investments in digital to “stay ahead of the curve and capitalize on the accelerating evolution of consumer behavior should be viewed favorably.” Wells Fargo rates Starbucks shares outperform with a valuation range of $64 to $66. Starbucks also announced a downward guidance revision. Full-year EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.06 to $2.10 and adjusted EPS of $2.08 to $2.12. The previous guidance was for a range of $2.12 to $2.14. Maw said the guidance reflects investments primarily in the Roastery Reserve and Princi businesses, as well as digital opportunities.

UBS rates Starbucks shares buy with a $70 price target. Buckingham Research Group analysts aren’t quite as optimistic. Though they believe Starbucks is a “strong brand” with “excellent financials,” they believe there is “clearly a sharp deceleration in the business.” “We see incremental risk to this revised guidance and believe the company will need to soon walk away from the long-term revenue and earnings growth outlook provided during this Spring’s analyst day,” the note said. Analysts think traffic issues and competition will offset product and digital innovations. Buckingham rates Starbucks shares neutral with a $52 price target.

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"But the move, detailed at Wells Fargo’s investor day, failed to impress Wall Street, because management also indicated that revenue growth is suffering from the scandal, which involved employees creating as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts in customers’ names to hit sales targets. The San Francisco-based bank’s stock was down 1.7 percent at $53.81 in afternoon trading. Wells Fargo plans to reduce expenses by another $2 billion through the end of 2019, on top of a $2 billion cost-cutting target management previously announced. The cuts come after repeated questions from analysts and investors about why Wells Fargo was not doing more to reduce costs, which have been high by some measures when compared to U.S. banking rivals. But the scandal has only increased costs, as the bank has tried to fix practices internally and respond to regulatory inquiries and public backlash. During the investor day event, executives said they understood investor concerns and would take action. Chief Executive Tim Sloan used the word “unacceptable” at least twice, in reference to prior sales practices and expense levels. Management had been trying to keep expenses in a range of 55 percent to 59 percent of revenue, but in the first quarter that ratio soared to 62.7 percent. “Operating at this level is completely unacceptable,” Sloan said. As Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry began his presentation, he joked to the crowd: “Raise your hand if you’re interested in hearing about expenses at Wells Fargo.” He said the bank plans to get back into its targeted ratio in the coming years. The sales abuses in Wells Fargo’s branch banking operation led to a $190 million regulatory settlement, launches of other government probes, the firing of several bankers, the departure of CEO John Stumpf and shareholders offering scant support for most directors at the bank’s annual meeting last month. Nearly all of the executives speaking on Thursday, including Sloan, are in new positions entered after the scandal erupted in September. Wells Fargo’s investor day is typically a biannual event, but management held it a year early to provide more information about how they are running the bank. Sloan and his deputies indicated that the scandal had impacted revenue, either because some customers may be less inclined to do business with the bank or because reforms to business practices have hurt sales. For instance, Wells Fargo has changed pay structures so that instead of being incentivized to boost sales figures, employees are encouraged to deliver products and services customers actually need. While executives have described such reforms as necessary, they may also be hurting revenue. “We had an incentive program and high-pressure sales culture in our community bank that drove behavior that was at times inappropriate and inconsistent with our values,” Sloan said, noting that management “took too long to appreciate seriousness of the problem.” Wells Fargo bankers are getting fewer referrals from branches for personal loans and home-equity loans, said Franklin Codel, an executive in the consumer lending unit. That has led to a 3 percent decline in business, though trends appear to be stabilizing, he said. The credit card business has also been hurt by the scandal, said Avid Modjtabai, who heads Wells Fargo’s payments, virtual solutions and innovation group. The rate of new credit card account openings has recently picked up, but Modjtabai did not say when she expects the business to fully recover. Overall, Wells Fargo expects net interest income to grow in the low-to-mid single percentage points this year, which some analysts characterized as disappointing, as were executives’ assertions that Wells will not hit its cost efficiency ratio this year. The new cost-cutting guidance fell roughly in the middle of analyst expectations. A big chunk of the savings will come from Wells Fargo’s plan to close 450 branches in 2017 and 2018, roughly 10 percent more than its previous target. Through Wednesday’s close, Wells Fargo’s shares had risen 6 percent over the past six months, lagging gains of 14.1 percent for JPMorgan and 28.7 percent for Bank of America. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"(Reuters) - Patrick Reed matched the best score of the day, a five-under-par 67, to earn a one-shot lead after the third round at the Wells Fargo Championship in Wilmington, North Carolina on Saturday. Reed handled another windy day as well as anyone at Eagle Point, surging to the front with birdies at his final two holes to post an eight-under 208 total ahead of Spaniard Jon Rahm (69) and Swede Alex Noren (69). Italian halfway leader Francesco Molinari (72) is in a group of four players two shots behind Reed, while world number one Dustin Johnson is equal 14th, four shots back after matching Reed’s 67. Johnson is seeking to win his fourth consecutive start, something that has not been done on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods in 2007-08. He barely made the halfway cut but fought into contention with four birdies on his back nine on Saturday, capping off his day by coaxing in a 10-footer at his final hole, the par-four ninth. Reed played patiently, picking off six birdies without taking too many risks. “I didn’t get ahead of myself today,” said the 26-year-old, who played conservatively for the middle of the greens. “Seems kind of like what I’ve been doing all week, just let the putter go to work and it’s been doing pretty well.” Rahm, meanwhile, continued his sizzling season to move into contention for a follow-up win, after his breakthrough victory at Torrey Pines in January. “My putter was really hot on the back nine. I was able to make a lot of clutch putts from difficult situations,” said the 22-year-old. Noren has not won on the PGA Tour but triumphed four times on the European Tour last year and arrived in Wilmington ranked 12th in the world, the third highest-ranked player in the field. “I would have taken 69 in the beginning of this day,” he said. “I managed to pull a good round and I’m happy with that.” ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"Wells Fargo, whose largest shareholder is Berkshire with a 10 percent stake worth roughly $27 billion, gave employees too much autonomy to engage in “cross-selling” multiple products to meet sales goals, Buffett said. This “incentivized the wrong type of behavior,” and former Chief Executive John Stumpf, who lost his job over the scandal, was too slow to fix the problem, Buffett said. Wells Fargo was among many topics discussed at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, where Buffett, 86, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, fielded dozens of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. “If there’s a major problem, the CEO will get wind of it. At that moment, that’s the key to everything. The CEO has to act,” Buffett said. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it.” Still, Buffett’s support of current management and board was key to ensuring the re-election of the entire board last month. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said “we agree” with Buffett’s comments, and have taken “decisive actions” to fix the problems and “make things right for customers.” Buffett likened the situation to Salomon Brothers Inc, where in 1991 he was installed as chairman to clean up a mess after the former chief executive failed to tell regulators a trader was submitting fake bids at Treasury auctions. Asked whether Berkshire’s decentralized structure could lead to a similar scandal, Buffett said “as we sit here, somebody is doing something wrong at Berkshire,” whose units employ 367,000 people. But he said Berkshire has an internal “hotline” to flag possible misbehavior, which gets 4,000 calls a year. The meeting also included discussions about Berkshire’s succession plans, its controversial partnership with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, and whether it will start paying dividends or make a monster acquisition. Buffett has said Berkshire could have a new chief executive within 24 hours if he died or could not continue, and that nothing had changed just because he praised fewer managers than usual in his February shareholder letter. He said it may have been harder to single people out because “we have never had more good managers.” But he also said it would be a “terrible mistake” if capital allocation were not the “main talent” of his successor. Buffett did lavish much praise on top insurance executive Ajit Jain, who some investors believe could be that successor, saying “nobody could possibly replace Ajit. You can’t come close.” But, he said, “it is absolutely essential to America that we become more productive, and 3G was “very good at making a business productive with fewer people.” Buffett also raised the possibility Berkshire could pay its first dividend since 1967, if “reasonably soon, even while I’m around,” the company had too much cash it could not reasonably deploy. “It could be repurchases, it could be dividends,” he said. Berkshire ended March with more than $96 billion of cash and cash-like instruments, and Munger said it could do a “$150 billion” acquisition now if it wanted. He had long disdained the industry, which had gone through many bankruptcies, but said he is confident it will not resort to “suicidally competitive” pricing strategies that could spell doom. Munger added: “You’ve got to remember railroads were a terrible business for decades and decades and decades, and then they got good.” Berkshire bought the BNSF railroad in 2010. He also addressed criticism that Berkshire discloses too little about businesses such as aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, which it bought last year for $32.1 billion. “We want you to understand what you own,” he said, and “there are just a million things that are of minor importance” at Berkshire, whose market value is about $411 billion. Buffett also noted that Berkshire reported far fewer investment gains in the first quarter, which dragged on results, but said the company now has a slight preference for taking tax losses, which could lose value if Washington lawmakers reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate. Shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have required Berkshire to disclose its political contributions twice a year. The annual meeting, expected to draw more than last year’s estimated 37,000 shareholders, is the main event of a weekend of events that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.” Buffett and Munger took questions after the traditional shareholder movie, and after Buffett had roamed a nearby exhibit hall featuring products from Berkshire companies. Hundreds of shareholders lined up early outside downtown Omaha’s CenturyLink Center for the meeting. Several said they got there nearly five hours before doors opened around 6:45 a.m. “Every year it seems I have to come earlier,” said Chris Tesari, a retired businessman from Pacific Palisades, California who said he arrived at 3:20 a.m. for his 21st meeting. “It’s a pilgrimage.” ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"Shares of Tribune, which operates 42 U.S. television stations, rose 5.2 percent to $42.42. Sinclair shares fell about 3 percent to $35.90. A recent U.S. Federal Communications Commission vote to reverse a 2016 decision limiting the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy helped pave the way for the deal. Sinclair may still have to sell certain stations such as St. Louis and Salt Lake City in order to comply with FCC regulations, Chief Executive Chris Ripley said on a conference call. The sale will mark the end of a long road for Tribune, whose name was long intertwined with the city of Chicago, where the Chicago Tribune newspaper was founded more than 150 years ago. The company once owned the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The sale comes after a decade of turmoil for the company, which was acquired by real estate mogul Sam Zell and then by private equity firms. It emerged from bankruptcy in late 2012 and completed a spinoff of its newspaper assets in 2014 into a company now known as Tronc Inc TRNC.O. Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker said the deal’s biggest cost savings will come from retransmission fees, which are the payments station groups like Sinclair make to broadcasters such as Fox, CBS and NBC to carry their programming. Tribune’s portfolio would help expand Sinclair’s already vast network of 173 stations in 81 U.S. markets and marks the largest acquisition for the Baltimore-based company. Sinclair also gets cable network WGN America and a stake in the Food Network, a joint venture between Tribune and Scripps Network Interactive Inc SNI.O. The combined company could have more leverage in negotiations with Fox since it will own a large chunk of Fox broadcast affiliates around the country. The $43.50 per share offer represents a 26 percent premium over Tribune’s closing price on Feb. 28, a day before Reuters broke the news that Sinclair had approached Tribune about an acquisition. Tribune stockholders will receive $35 in cash and 0.23 share of Sinclair stock for each Tribune share. Sinclair will assume about $2.7 billion in debt in the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"FRANKFORT, Ky./SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For nearly three years, Democrats and former President Barack Obama pointed to Kentucky as one of the Affordable Care Act’s biggest success stories. A poor, rural state that straddles the North and South, Kentucky was an early adopter of the healthcare law commonly known as Obamacare and saw one of the country’s largest drops in the uninsured rate. Now Kentucky is poised for a new distinction: to be the first state to save money by reducing the number of people on Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled and a central tenet of Obamacare. If successful, Kentucky would provide a roadmap for other states who are worried about paying an increasing share for people on Medicaid. A new Republican health law that passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, along with state initiatives like Kentucky’s, would dramatically change the national healthcare system and cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years. The Republican bill still faces a long road ahead in the U.S. Senate and its final passage is far from assured, making initiatives like Kentucky’s all the more important. Kentucky has proposed to lessen its financial burden before it grows by reducing the number of residents on Medicaid by nearly 86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million in the process. (For a graphic click tmsnrt.rs/2on0HVK) Kentucky’s plan also calls for new work requirements for able-bodied adults to get insurance. Plus, it would establish new fees for all members based on income and lock out some people who miss a payment or fail to re-enroll. By following these proposed rules, Kentucky believes Medicaid enrollees will over time graduate from Medicaid to private and employer insurance plans. “One of the most remarkable lies that has perpetrated in recent years in the healthcare community in America is that expanded Medicaid was working well in Kentucky,” Republican Governor Matt Bevin, who is leading the state effort, told Reuters from the governor’s mansion in Frankfort, Kentucky. That view is in line with President Donald Trump’s administration, which has criticized Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and urged states to pursue similar Medicaid reforms to what Kentucky is now attempting. “If Kentucky is successful, you’ll see this spread through the more conservative-leaning states. It’s possible even a Democratic blue state could do it,” said George Huang, director and senior municipal healthcare research analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. “It’s the flexibility that some states are seeking.” Kentucky, a state Trump won handily last November, has been devastated by the loss of coal mining jobs and an opioid epidemic. The state sits near the bottom of health rankings for smoking rates, cancer deaths and diabetes. “To me, morally, it was the right thing to expand Medicaid, but I had a responsibility to not to do something that would bankrupt the state,” said former Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, referring to the increased costs of caring for a larger population with Medicaid insurance. More than 30 states, about a dozen of which are led by Republican governors, expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. In Kentucky, more than 400,000 people gained health insurance through the program, the highest growth rate of Medicaid coverage of any state. Beshear commissioned independent studies by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte on the financial and health impacts of expanding Medicaid. Both studies found health and economic gains. Deloitte reported that 90,000 newly covered residents received cholesterol screening and 80,000 got preventative dental care within a year. It estimated Kentucky would see an economic boost of $30 billion and 40,000 new jobs by 2021. Beshear’s successor, Republican Governor Bevin, was elected in 2015 on a promise to repeal and replace the healthcare law on the view that thousands of Kentuckians had unaffordable premiums and only one health insurer to choose from. He dismissed the projections in the Beshear-commissioned studies as “preposterous,” and says the state’s share of expanded Medicaid - $74 million in 2017 and totaling $1.2 billion over five years - was too expensive and unsustainable. “We want this to be a helping hand for people at a time when they need it, but then be able to return to the commercial marketplace,” Bevin said. Last year, Bevin submitted the waiver to restrict Medicaid eligibility by requiring enrollees to work or volunteer at least 20 hours per week and to pay monthly premiums based on income. He’s still awaiting approval. Bevin said he has spoken with several governors about the waiver and has had extensive conversations with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price about fast-tracking the approval process in order for other states to quickly adopt similar programs. Such conversations are occurring across the country in response to encouragement from the new administration to reform state Medicaid programs, said Alleigh Marre, a Health and Human Services spokeswoman. Louisiana and Wisconsin are considering work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. The Obama administration rejected previous attempts by other states, including Ohio and Arizona, to require work programs and monthly premiums for Medicaid, historically a free program for those eligible. “Every state is watching this to see what happens,” said Bevin of Kentucky’s waiver. “It’s the first one in the queue.” The odds look good for Kentucky to get the waiver in the coming months, based on the track records of health officials that Trump named after his inauguration. Seema Verma, the new head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which approves Medicaid waivers, said during congressional testimony that the agency will usher in “a new era of state flexibility and leadership.” Verma helped craft Kentucky’s waiver, but said she will recuse herself from the approval process to avoid conflicts of interest. She and Tom Price wrote a letter to governors in March encouraging Medicaid reforms that more closely resemble commercial insurance plans. In the letter, they suggested features such as premium fees, health savings accounts, and emergency room co-payments that encourage the use of primary care. CMS declined to comment on Kentucky’s waiver and said it does not speculate on the process while ongoing. Under federal law, waivers must promote Medicaid’s objective of delivering healthcare services to vulnerable populations who cannot otherwise afford them. “Waivers have never been used to cut people from the rolls,” said Emily Parento, associate professor at the University of the Pacific’s law school and the former executive director of Kentucky’s Office of Health Policy. But Verma’s office is encouraging changes to Medicaid that make the government program look more like private insurance policies - goals that are similar to Bevin’s in Kentucky. “I think what will happen is that other states will look at it and go, ‘We want everything they got,’” Bevin said.

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"WILMINGTON, North Carolina (Reuters) - Japan’s Ryo Ishikawa, once one of the brightest young talents in golf, is struggling to retain his PGA Tour exemption after a back injury and loss of form with his driver. Ishikawa has only seven tournaments, including this week, to earn $354,700 (or 218 FedEx Cup points) to keep his card as he plays his way back via a medical extension after missing about five months last year. Needing a top-three finish, or perhaps a couple of top-10s, the 25-year-old did not help his cause by bogeying two of his final four holes for an opening four-over-par 76 at the Wells Fargo Championship on Thursday. He was nonetheless was patient enough to spend nearly 30 minutes afterwards talking to Japanese reporters, who still hang on his every word even though he has long been supplanted as Japan’s best player by world number four Hideki Matsuyama. “I’m still trying to fix my golf swing, driver through middle-iron,” Ishikawa told Reuters. “My short iron and around the green and putting it works not too bad but my long game is not consistent. I’m not afraid to hit hard, but still golf ball’s not straight, right-to-left, left-to-right sometimes.” Ishikawa first won on the Japan Tour a decade ago as a 15-year-old amateur and has since added 13 more titles on his home circuit. He shot a record 58 on the Japan Tour on the same day as Rory McIlroy carded 62 to win the 2010 Wells Fargo. At the time they were often mentioned in the same breath, but while McIlroy has kicked on and then some, Ishikawa has not. With his slight stature, he does not naturally hit the ball as far as many of his peers, which has perhaps hindered his progress. Nonetheless, he still retains hopes of representing his country in the Olympics on home soil in 2020. “I’ve played team events, including Presidents Cup and World Cup ... but not in Japan, always other countries,” he said. “If I played the Olympics in Tokyo in three years, that would be fantastic.” In the meantime, he was trying to remain upbeat, despite the stress of struggling to retain his playing status on Tour. “To just enjoy golf and have fun, that’s always my goal,” he said.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost ground, while the Nasdaq closed at a record high. Trump said he fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey over his handling of an email scandal involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. However, Comey had also been leading an investigation into whether Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia. Wall Street viewed the turmoil in Washington as the latest of several distractions from Trump’s promises to cut taxes and boost spending on infrastructure. The stock market has surged to record highs under Trump due to expectations he will stimulate the economy and boost corporate earnings. “This certainly is not reducing that contentious environment,” said Eric Wiegand, a New York-based senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. “The focal point for investors is tax reform.” With first-quarter earnings season nearly over, investors were looking toward April retail sales data, due out on Friday, for new clues about the economy’s health. “A lot of us have Q2 significantly stronger. Economic data really needs to show they can support our forecasts,” said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.16 percent to end at 20,943.11 while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.11 percent to 2,399.63.

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Start-up lenders that reach customers online should be able to choose between a federal or state banking license as they grow, a leading U.S. banking regulator said on Thursday as he prepares to step aside. Consumers increasingly go online to manage their money and some financial services start-ups, so-called “fintech” companies, would like a national license for that business. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the leading regulator for national banks, has promised to offer a fintech charter. But state authorities have argued that is their job and are suing the OCC. The question of who will regulate the fintech business should not hinder the industry, said Thomas Curry, the outgoing head of the OCC. “I don’t think this is about turf,” said Curry, who steps down on Friday. “I think this is really about the strategic direction of the banking industry.” Fintech companies do not lend from customer savings and their money-managing tools are sometimes ahead of traditional banks’. Regulators have scrambled to keep pace with the development of online lenders and payment companies, which act like banks but do not take in deposits. Last week, an alliance of state banking regulators took its case to federal court and asked that a judge block the OCC from developing a federal charter. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors said in a statement that the OCC plan “is an unprecedented, unlawful expansion of the chartering authority given to it by Congress.” Curry was appointed by former President Barack Obama and completed his five-year term in early April. Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, will run the OCC on an interim basis starting Friday. [L1N1I522F] The OCC drew fire in September when Wells Fargo & Co announced that rogue bank employees opened as many as 2 million bank accounts without customer agreement. Curry has said his agency should have detected that fraud earlier. He has also said the agency’s money-laundering controls must be carefully calibrated. In recent months, the OCC has told bank examiners to clamp down on illegal transfers but not halt legal money transfers - particularly to and from immigrant communities. [nL2N1GV0DX] “I don’t think we’re struggling with this,” Curry said of recent memos, phone calls and speeches on anti-money laundering policy. “Where we explain what our policies are and what our approach is, the better off we are.” ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"Mylan President Rajiv Malik said the FDA was asking it to comply with standards set out in draft guidance the agency issued, but that it believes it is not required to do so. An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment, saying she was prohibited by law from discussing a pending application. Mylan made the comments while reporting first-quarter earnings, in which it flagged declining sales for emergency allergy treatment EpiPen but said it will still meet previously announced earnings targets for the year. Malik said the company could not comment further on the length of the delay for approval until it meets with the FDA to discuss their disagreement, but that the FDA had designated it as requiring a “major” amendment to its application. A “major” amendment means a delay of 10-months for an FDA response, according to agency guidelines. Mylan shares fell 0.8 percent to $37.73 in afternoon trading. The company still backed its full year profit and revenue forecast, despite the delay for generic Advair. The company said earlier this year that its projections always account for possible delays and rejections. “It’s sort of a ‘Trust me, we have other stuff that will make up for it,’” said Wells Fargo analyst David Maris. “This is a really big product so I don’t know what that could be, but they did mention Copaxone, and that would be an upside surprise.” Mylan had originally targeted a 2013 launch for its generic version of Teva’s multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, but it was delayed. It now expects to hear from the FDA next month. Mylan reported a first-quarter profit that edged past expectations, helped by demand for products it gained through the acquisition of Swedish drugmaker Meda. Mylan has come under fire for sharply increasing the price of EpiPen and classifying the life-saving treatment as a generic rather than a branded product, which led to much smaller rebates to state Medicaid programs. The company said first-quarter sales of EpiPen in North America declined due to increased competition and the launch of its authorized generic, which costs $300. Mylan posted net income of $66.4 million, or 12 cents per share in the first quarter, up from $13.9 million, or 3 cents per share, last year. Excluding one-time items, Mylan earned 93 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ","

Michelle Zhou,05112017,Investopedia,05042017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Too much success can sometimes draw the ire of colleagues, as demonstrated by Morgan Stanley’s announcement on Wednesday that it will no longer offer Vanguard mutual funds to clients starting next week. According to the brokerage firm, which has close to 16,000 brokers and $2.2 trillion in assets under management, the move is part of a broader overhaul of its mutual fund offerings. Since April, Morgan Stanley has been reducing its mutual fund menu by about 25% to eliminate those it deems to be unpopular, underperforming or a conflict of interest. The purge is part of the firm’s commitment to complying with the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule on retirement advice. A spokesman of Morgan Stanley told The Wall Street Journal that Vanguard mutual funds are not popular with its clients, and represent less than 5% of its total mutual fund assets. Industry insiders however believe Morgan Stanley is retaliating against Vanguard for its longstanding policy of not paying brokerage firms to sell its funds, otherwise known as “shelf space,” which is part of the reason why the asset manager can offer record-low expense ratios to investors. Most of Vanguard’s competitors pay Morgan Stanley $250,000 to $850,000 a year, reported AdvisorHub. Morgan Stanley is not the first to adopt this strategy. A year ago, Merrill Lynch began restricting new sales of Vanguard mutual funds to clients who do not have an existing position. A similar policy applies to Morgan Stanley accounts, the WSJ article shows. Clients who are currently invested in Vanguard mutual funds will not be forced to sell, but only have until the first quarter-end of 2018 to add to their positions. Both Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch continue to offer Vanguard exchange-traded funds. Since launching the first index mutual fund in 1976, Vanguard has become the industry leader in index investing and low-cost funds. It is currently the second-largest asset manager in the world, after BlackRock, and boasts $4 trillion in AUM. An estimated $1 billion a day has flown into Vanguard funds since the 2016 U.S. election, more than 8.5 times the rest of the mutual fund industry, according to Morningstar data. Vanguard’s near-monopoly position is part of the reason behind Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch’s efforts to stymie some of the firm’s incredible growth and protect their own revenue models. The brokerage arms of Wells Fargo and UBS, the other two of the “big four” brokerage firms, or so-called wirehouses , have not followed suit and continue to offer Vanguard mutual funds.

(JPM) is encouraging regional banks to merge while they can because a deposit drain is looming, according to Bloomberg News, citing a copy of a confidential presentation confirmed by a JPMorgan spokesperson. The New York-based bank is warning depository clients that a byproduct of the Federal Reserve’s moves to stimulate the economy during the financial crisis will pressure midsize U.S. banks, or those with $50 billion or less in assets. As the Fed now shrinks its balance sheet, midsize banks face a funding problem, JPMorgan says in a 19-page report. (See also: Why Fed May Take a Summer Breather on Rate Hikes.) During the Fed’s quantitative easing from about 2009 to 2014, in which it went on a bond-buying spree, banks saw deposits rise dramatically as investors put money from the securities sales into commercial bank accounts. Banks saw a wave of some $2.5 trillion in extra bank deposits, JPMorgan’s report says. Now, with the Fed pumping the breaks on bond-buying, the extra bank deposits will steadily begin to dwindle as the Fed’s roughly $4.5 trillion in securities begin to mature without the central bank purchasing new ones. As bank deposits deplete from withdrawls for, say, a homeowner's mortgage payment, they will now not be replaced with Fed money, which essentially causes a deposit drain. (See also: How New Bank Rules Will Buoy Banks.) While bigger banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup have the clout to manage the outflows with investments in technology, branding and customer acquisition, regional banks struggle to preserve their market share. So, JPMorgan is anticipating more midsize bank acquisitions and mergers as they try to grow retail deposits, which in turn fund loan growth. “The need for retail deposits to fund loan growth, the challenge of organically originating new relationships and the scale required to support technology and brand investments will drive consolidation,” JPMorgan’s report says, according to Bloomberg.

CEO James Quincey, who took the helm on May 1 after serving as chief operating officer (COO), has made a series of bold remarks including officially giving employees permission to admit if Coke isn’t their favorite soda brand. “If we’re not making mistakes, we’re not trying hard enough,” said Quincey, at a recent interview at his headquarters office in Atlanta, indicating Coke must be more experimental with its strategy. The 52-year-old Briton says the company must shake off its culture of cautiousness, nicknamed the “New Coke syndrome.” As soda sales decline, and governments around the world push new regulations such as local soda taxes to curb public health problems like obesity and diabetes, the multinational soft drinks leader has been forced to evolve its business model. In response to mounting pressure and new consumer demands for healthier alternatives, Coke has pushed into new dairy, tea and bottled water markets, although 70% of its sales by volume remain in the soda category. Quincey has been a long-time proponent of Coke’s health shift, urging the company to drop its fight in the U.K. against voluntary health labels on its beverage packaging. Quincy has also been a driving force behind the global consumer products company’s cost cutting, planning to slash another 20% of corporate staff with 1,200 job reductions. With Quincey at the helm, Coke is charging forward on its path to become a “total beverage company,” indicating that in a decade or so, soda could represent less than 50% of the company’s total sales by volume.

Jeff Daniels,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"The state of California just awarded a $500 million deal to Wells Fargo Bank, perhaps a sign the state is ready to move past the sanctions it slapped on the bank last year. The bank is providing the state with short-term funds to cover repairs at Oroville Dam, which was damaged earlier this year after major erosion to its emergency and primary spillways. CNBC has reached out to Wells Fargo for comment. Treasurer John Chiang — the state's top banker — has been critical of Wells Fargo previously for setting up fake accounts without the permission of customers. In fact, Chiang announced in September he would suspend the state's relationship with Wells Fargo and one month later came on CNBC saying the resignation of the bank's CEO was still not enough. Tim Schaefer, deputy treasurer for public finance at the Treasurer's office, said in a telephone interview Monday the decision to get a loan from Wells Fargo essentially came down to better deal terms. ""What he (the Treasurer) didn't do last September – and we didn't encourage the Department of Water Resources to do it either – was to reject a financially advantageous arrangement that was obtained through a competitive bid process and which resulted in lower costs to California,"" said Schaefer. ""To refuse to do that kind of business with them would be to punish California, not the bank."" Nearly $70 million has already been drawn from the available line of credit. Under the credit terms, the amount borrowed can reach up to $500 million, but must be repaid within a year. According to Schaefer, the Treasurer's moratorium announced in September was on certain types of business with Wells Fargo, but also one where the Treasurer ""gets to choose what we're doing with Wells Fargo."" Specifically, the Treasurer's suspension announced last fall applied to three areas: the state buying investment securities from the financial institution, using them to sell the state's bonds, and purchasing securities that are issued by Wells Fargo. Schaefer said the Treasurer in September sought to ""send a message that he doesn't condone or encourage — and in fact is outraged — by bad behavior from a financial institution that hurts Californians."" As for repair work at Oroville Dam, the state last month awarded a contract to Nebraska-based Kiewit for repair work on the dam's emergency and primary spillways. The employee-owned firm's bid was just over $275 million. The state also incurred more than $100 million in costs earlier this year as workers dropped boulders and concrete into holes created by the damaged emergency spillway. Engineers and crews also removed debris below the spillways to allow water to flow from the channel and to reopen a hydroelectric power facility at the dam. California could eventually get reimbursed for the Oroville crisis with federal funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Still, it is unlikely the federal government will fund all the Oroville costs. Any uncovered repair costs not paid by FEMA, though, are expected to be financed through long-term bonds repaid by user fees from the roughly 20 million Californians who receive water from local contractors through the State Water Project.

Eric Rosenbaum,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Earlier this week the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a case brought by the city of Miami, suing Wells Fargo and Bank of America for discriminatory lending during the housing bubble, could proceed. In court documents revealed last week, shareholders had brought a lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleging that Latinos, and even undocumented workers, were targeted in the sales scandal that has roiled the bank since last year. But on Tuesday night in New York City, something interesting occurred: Wells Fargo received an honor for diversity, making the annual DiversityInc list of the 50 most diverse companies in the world. It even cracked the top 10 for the first time this year. Wells Fargo hasn't had much good news to crow about amid the fraudulent accounts scandal — on Tuesday the city of Philadelphia fired Wells Fargo as manager of its $2 billion payroll account. ""Time and time again their actions have revealed them to be the antithesis of corporate social responsibility,"" Philadelphia Councilwoman Cindy Bass said in a statement. One of the reasons the bank was honored for diversity: the Wells Fargo board. The same board that many shareholders and grassroots organizations contend was negligent in its oversight of the sales culture. But it gets high marks for its diverse composition, including women and minorities. It's fair to ask whether there's a diversity bubble at work here — board diversity that makes a corporation look to be on the right side of history isn't honestly reflecting the bank's impact in the real world and on communities, where allegations of discriminatory lending and minority-targeting of customers persist. These are just allegations — the Supreme Court was not ruling on the merits of the case, and justices indicated they think Miami will have a hard time proving it. But it's an issue that I thought would make for an interesting interview with Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, who agreed to give me 45 minutes over the phone this week to discuss the diversity honor. But there were a few strings attached — the sales accounts scandal couldn't be discussed, and my questions had to be sent ahead of time (I didn't do that). I did give Wells Fargo PR a brief rundown over the phone of the issues I would like to discuss (and, I admit, I even tried to be nice). A day later the 45 minutes allotted was reduced to 20 minutes. Then I realized there was even more that had to be weighed in an article about diversity, including the decision in March by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to give Wells Fargo a ""needs to improve"" rating under terms of the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law intended to promote lending in low-income neighborhoods. The OCC stated it had uncovered ""an extensive and pervasive pattern and practice of discriminatory and illegal credit practices across multiple lines of business within the bank, resulting in significant harm to large numbers of consumers."" If ""needs to improve"" sounds OK — who shouldn't strive to do better? — consider the way community activists describe the rating downgrade. ""We don't think any bank of this size has ever gone from 'outstanding' straight to 'needs to improve.' That is, in the least, extremely rare — a double downgrade. They are the ones who tend to get the 'outstandings' and care. There is no comparison to the double downgrade I know of,"" said Kevin Stein, deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition. So I ambushed the CEO of DiversityInc, Luke Visconti. I'm usually a mild-mannered guy, but I got a little testy in asking him how Wells Fargo not only made the DiversityInc list but moved up this year. He struggled to answer. John Stumpf, the former CEO, was ""fair-minded and passionate about providing opportunities."" The scandal does not take into account the ""entirety of the business situation."" The acquisition of Wachovia Securities forced on the bank by the government was partially to blame (which sounded sort of like what conservative editorial pages said after the housing bust — government forced banks to make mortgage offers to bad credit risks). ""Bad behavior is everywhere,"" Visconti said. I've always known Visconti to encourage provocative questions — he's even set me up in the past with officials who are skeptical of his ranking. So his struggle to answer wasn't BS — it was a struggle because there isn't a clear-cut answer. And he added that none of this ""absolves them for what went wrong and hurting people."" But he does think Wells Fargo will respond in an ""ethical and moral way."" Visconti also noted that corporate diversity often follows scandal rather than being proactive. Novartis and Sodexo are companies that first made the DiversityInc list after issues involving gender discrimination. ""Part of diversity is, you screw up and you get equal blame,"" he said. The DiversityInc list also takes into account many more factors than just board composition. Julie Goodridge, founder and CEO of NorthStar Asset Management, a socially responsible investing firm, said that her company hasn't owned Wells Fargo in a long time — and only when it inherited holdings that new clients brought with them. But when it did back in 2002, it promoted a shareholder resolution linking executive compensation to putting an end to predatory lending practices. ""I think there is a lot of Wells Fargo bad behavior that has been happening for almost two decades,"" Goodridge said. ""Diversity is incredibly important, but there are so many additional factors that need to be part of the question about companies behaving properly in the world,"" she said. Mark Molumphy,  a principal at Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy representing shareholders in the lawsuit filed last week alleging minority-targeting within the broader sales accounts scandal, put it this way: ""Governance breakdown has real-life impacts; decisions made or not made at the board level had real-life impacts for customers and for its rank-and-file employees."" Molumphy said his firm didn't know about the targeting of minorities when it first filed — and still does not know the full extent of it — but it has collected a handful of declarations related to the targeting of undocumented workers, and he added, ""Ever since we filed the case, we've been contacted by dozens and dozens of employees as well as former customers. ... People are especially upset about those types of practices,"" especially salespeople desperate to meet aggressive sales tactics going out to solicit accounts from day laborers or at bottling plants, he said. ""It's just one more piece, one more red flag from our perspective about an active, vigilant management and board. They should have asked questions about this targeting,"" Molumphy said. Wells Fargo has called the allegations ""offensive."" In situations requiring equal measures moral compass and compassion, I can't see a better perspective to seek than that of a spiritual person, so I asked Sister Nora Nash, the director of corporate responsibility for the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, and a Wells Fargo shareholder activist. ""The board has historically been very conscious of diversity,"" Sister Nora told me. ""[The board] includes women and people of color and has been a leader in the board diversity area. But we don't appreciate the other side, where there's possibly discriminatory practices, especially in the mortgage industry, and that's a little bit of a conflict there, and we know there have been quite a few problems."" Sister Nora has met with Tim Sloan and said she is ""cautiously optimistic."" But she was quick to add that she ""won't be going away."" The shareholder resolution she supported to get a full accounting of the root causes of fraudulent activity received support from 22 percent of shareholders at the bank's recent annual meeting. She noted the 110-page report from the Wells Fargo board on the sales scandal was ""very transparent and well done, except it blamed basically one person."" A woman, too — the former head of the community bank division, Carrie Tolstedt. Sister Nora noted that several years ago the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility did a survey of banks asking for a comprehensive review of business standards. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America completed it. Citigroup completed it, in a slightly different fashion that the ICCR asked for. Wells Fargo's response was the least satisfactory, and it received the lowest score.""Like I told them, this is emergency work that needed to be done. ... Now they have to resolve problems — lots of them. ... This is about more than retribution, it's restorative justice,"" Sister Nora said. And then Sister Nora told me something interesting. As a shareholder, she's not that interested in board diversity anymore and has a much greater focus on environmental, social and broader governance issues (ESG). She said the ICCR, of which she is a member, considered lack of women and people of color on boards as one of its biggest issues years ago. But it's moved away from that in recent years, since it seems to her that it's the outlier corporations that lag on that issue now. ""Diversity is independently a good thing, and to the extent they are on this list, it is to their credit,"" said Stein of the California Reinvestment Coalition. ""But I think we need to step back and say a diverse board, and a diverse company, that's good, but it's also important that a corporation is a force for good and all communities. ... All too often, too much harm is disproportionately concentrated in neighborhoods of color. And the good doesn't reach these same neighborhoods. That's where there's a disconnect at Wells."" NorthStar Asset Management officials worry about any softening in corporate diversity activism — they still believe a focus on board diversity is critical. ""The issue of women and minorities on boards has gained traction, but it's absolutely still an issue we feel we need to be addressing. It's still a top issue,"" said Mari Schwartzer, NorthStar's assistant director of shareholder activism, engagement and social research. Northstar CEO Goodridge said I should ask Sloan the following questions: I had at least a few more to add: Sister Nora said that investors have been successful getting grassroots environmental activists onto boards where environmental concerns are an issue. Should there be grassroots community activists, those whom work directly with low- and moderate-income citizens, represented on a bank's board? We've been told for years that one of the benefits of board diversity is improved risk management because diverse backgrounds help avoid the type of group-think that has become synonymous with ""The Best and the Brightest"" and the all-white male, Ivy-educated entry into the Vietnam War. Does the Wells Fargo scandal damage that belief? Can a board member who was raised in a low-income family even lose touch? Consider Lloyd Dean, a director at Wells Fargo. Though not on the risk committee, specifically, he is on the corporate responsibility committee. The African-American CEO of Dignity Health, a faith-based, predominantly Catholic nonprofit hospital network, was raised in a family ""on and off welfare"" and without health insurance. Dean is now reported to be the highest-paid hospital CEO in California, earning a total compensation of $5.1 million. In a rare move, influential proxy voting firm Institutional Shareholder Services had advised Wells Fargo shareholders to vote against all 12 of the existing directors at the bank's late April annual meeting, a recommendation Wells Fargo called extreme — Sloan called it ""crazy."" The entire board was re-elected by slim margins. My interview with Sloan was scheduled for Tuesday morning. On the previous Friday, I had let Wells Fargo PR know that I could not in good faith do the interview without asking about the OCC downgrade, among the other issues, including the lawsuits alleging discriminatory practices. Late Sunday, I received an email from Wells Fargo PR saying Sloan's schedule had changed and he was no longer available for the interview. ""I hope it is not too much of an inconvenience but it cannot be helped. Sincerest apologies,"" the Wells Fargo spokeswoman wrote.

Tom Anderson,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Your mortgage may come with a bonus: credit-card reward points. Chase recently announced it will give 100,000 reward points, worth up to $1,500, to existing credit-card customers who take out a home loan with the bank between now and Aug. 6. The bank is not the first to offer credit-card perks in exchange for home loans.  In the last year, Capital One offered cardholders earned air travel miles if they purchased property or refinanced their home with the bank, Wells Fargo gave out rebates to cardholders to use for its mortgages and home equity loans, and Quicken Loans doled out points for some of its borrowers. However, the sheer size of the mortgage offer from Chase is new. ""The 100,000 points is one of the most generous — and perhaps tops — that we've seen for financial products,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. ""But it doesn't negate the need to shop around for the best deal or justify settling for an inferior loan that could cost far more in the long run."" Banks are spending more on credit-card rewards to build loyal customers for other parts of their businesses, said Nick Clements, co-founder of MagnifyMoney.com, a price-comparison website. Millennials are a prime target. For example, at Chase, 36 percent of mortgages last year were taken out by borrowers who were under 35 years old or younger, up from 20 percent in 2015. A recent MagnifyMoney analysis found that the six largest credit-card issuers spent $22.6 billion on rewards, more than double the $10.6 billion they paid in 2010. (See chart below.) A mortgage is usually the biggest financial transaction anyone will make, Clements said, so borrowers should focus more on the rate and closing costs to select the best deal rather than how many reward points they will earn. Keep in mind that credit-card rewards may be fleeting and are ever-changing, said Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com. For example, when Chase Sapphire Reserve debuted last summer, the card initially offered a sign-up bonus worth $1,500 to people who spent $4,000 on the card in the first three months. Earlier this year, Chase cut the generous sign-up bonuses for the card in half, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jaime Dimon said the perks cost the bank at least $200 million to $300 million.

Jeff Daniels,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Shipt, a grocery delivery start-up, is expanding its partnership with Costco and plans to double its overall market size this year. Shipt announced Thursday it will add nine Florida markets — six markets with Costco home delivery and three with regional grocer Publix. CNBC reached out to both retailers for comment. At the same time, a new report released Wednesday by Wells Fargo reveals most consumers still are ""reluctant to shift food purchases online."" ""Our biggest competitor is really the habits that consumers have developed over so many years,"" said Shipt founder and CEO Bill Smith, who started the internet-based service in 2015. ""We have to convince customers to try grocery shopping a different way."" Smith said the company has focused its efforts on service and ""delivering a really high-quality experience so we can retain customers."" He said the effort seems to be paying off with Shipt ""running neck and neck"" with AmazonFresh in terms of share of wallet spend. ""Literally, every month it switches back and forth,"" said Smith. ""We're growing at a faster pace than all these companies."" According to Second Measure data, Shipt had a share of wallet spend in the online grocery delivery segment of nearly 20 percent as of March 1, while AmazonFresh during the same period was 23 percent. Yet Shipt beat AmazonFresh in share for several months during 2016. CNBC reached out to Amazon for comment for this story. ""We took a very different approach to this business,"" said Smith, explaining that most of the rival companies are mainly focused on the coasts while Alabama-based Shipt is going for the ""mainstream, hometown America type of customer."" Added Smith, ""What I tell people is our customers are a lot more likely to be buying Cheerios than they are kale."" Shipt supplied the Second Measure share information, which is based on anonymized data from billions of consumer credit card transactions. It provides data to show exactly where consumers are spending their money. To be clear, the share data provided to CNBC tracks four companies in the grocery delivery service category: AmazonFresh, Google Express, InstaCart and Shipt. It doesn't appear to include FreshDirect, an online grocery delivery service known in the New York market. As for InstaCart, the San Francisco-based company holds a dominant share of just more than 50 percent, according to the Second Measure data. Shipt is a little over 40 percent of the size of InstaCart, based on share but still far from its rival in terms of overall markets served. Shipt closed out 2016 with 30 markets served, and the company plans to reach 60 markets or more by the end of 2017. With the new launches announced Thursday, the company already has about 40 markets. InstaCart, which got a three-year head start and has raised far more money from outside investors, is currently in about 50 markets and expects to close the year ""somewhere between 85 and 100 markets,"" according to Nilam Ganenthiran, the company's chief business officer. ""By 2018, 80 percent of the households in the United States will be able to order [groceries through] InstaCart,"" said Ganenthiran. ""We're growing extremely fast."" InstaCart works with 160 grocers across the country, including Whole Foods Market, Kroger, Costco and many others. The online service even has some retailers such as Whole Foods as an investor. ""The mission that we're on is we're trying to enable brick-and-mortar grocers to get online to compete in an increasingly Amazon world,"" said Ganenthiran. He also pointed out that the company isn't just focusing on the coasts but growing in Texas, Florida and mid-Atlantic states as well as Midwest markets such as Missouri, Indiana and Illinois. Besides same-day delivery, InstaCart also offers a so-called click-and-collect service where customers can pick up online orders curbside at many locations. Shipt plans to launch curbside service in a few months with one of its retail partners. Meantime, brick-and-mortar supermarket giants such as Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger's ClickList service are also expanding their online order and store pick-up programs. Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem estimates Wal-Mart has about 13 percent or more of its U.S. stores with a click-and-collect service. As for Kroger, he estimates almost a quarter of its stores offer pick-up service. ""E-commerce represents the fastest growing channel within food retail,"" Fadem said in a research note Wednesday. However, the analyst pointed out that the online grocery category still is ""underpenetrated at just 1 to 2 percent share of total grocery spending."" Wells Fargo's research concluded that ""consumers appear more resistant"" to online grocery services than investors may realize. It cited a recent survey by the research firm showing 82 percent U.S. consumers are still ""reluctant to shift food purchases online."" Even so, the analyst said the research shows about one-fifth of people surveyed had purchased food on the internet. ""I would say that online grocery is still in its infancy stages,"" said Fadem. ""Investors are obviously anticipating it will be larger. But the question is whether it will play out over a 10-year period or a period much shorter than that.""

Elizabeth Gurdus,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"When Warren Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday that he made a mistake not investing in Alphabet's Google, Jim Cramer reeled at the legendary investor's admission. ""It finally happened! A money manager came on television and admitted that he had made a mistake, that he had an obvious win on his hands and he punted, he didn't take advantage of it,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""That's the good news. Accountability at last."" The bad news was that it happened to be one of the most successful money managers of our time. ""Maybe the takeaway is that only the world's greatest investor can afford to openly admit making a mistake. Everyone else just must be too insecure to do the same thing,"" Cramer said. Watch the full segment here: Buffett's self-proclaimed flubs aside, Cramer touted the investment guru's legacy, from buying into best-of-breed companies trading at discounts to his unrelenting optimism about the future of the United States. ""He's genuinely curious; he's skeptical without being cynical; and despite his folksy demeanor, he doesn't suffer fools gladly, which is why he's willing to make harsh judgments if a CEO's got it wrong,"" as he did with former Wells Fargo chief John Stumpf. All that said, Buffett's statements about his Google miss intrigued Cramer. Buffett admitted that he realized the value of Google early, when Berkshire's auto insurance subsidiary, GEICO, was seeking advertising outlets. Buffett understood the power of Google's advertising business even then. People who wanted to buy insurance quickly would search it via Google for instant gratification. ""He admitted that he recognized Google's cost of taking that ad was virtually nil, that it represented nearly 100 percent profit. He even met with the founders of Google,"" Cramer said. Still, Buffett did not pull the trigger on buying shares, which he attributed in part to being unsure who would ultimately win in the advertising space. Back then, Google, now Alphabet, traded at $300 a share and has since soared to $950. ""What can we learn from this mistake? First, we have to recognize a humbling, humbling thing: stock picking is really difficult. Few people would've had the kind of insight that Buffett had about Google, and yet he didn't buy it,"" Cramer said. Buffett later purchased shares of IBM, a move he would come to see as preemptive because the company's promising technologies did not grow as quickly as he expected. ""When you put Buffett's IBM pick alongside his failure to pull the trigger on Google, you have to conclude that nobody in this business gets it right all the time. If even the 'Oracle of Omaha' can make this kind of mistake, then you can understand why I'm so adamant that you keep your retirement money in a low-cost index fund that mirrors the S&P 500,"" Cramer said. The S&P 500 sidelines the worst companies and benefits from takeover activity, so investing in a low-cost fund like the Buffet-praised Vanguard would be a smart move, Cramer said. ""How about takeaway number two? Once you have your bedrock index fund investment and you keep adding to that every year, if you do have some spare cash, why not try to put it to work in some stocks that you can find yourself?"" the ""Mad Money"" host asked. The best example of this in Buffett's world was his call on Apple. When he saw younger generations glued to their Apple devices, he began to see it not as a technology company, but as a consumer products powerhouse that sold at a major discount to the other consumer goods plays. Even now, measured against similarly structured companies, Apple remains very cheap, Cramer argued. Cramer's final takeaway was that keeping your eyes open is key to picking and buying the right companies at the right time. ""I could argue that Google itself, now that it's expanding beyond just search into YouTube video, data centers, [and] self-driving cars — that may be a big bargain given the misperception that it's still merely a search play hostage to the advertising market,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. And while Cramer does not recommend simply piling your favorite companies into a portfolio and hoping things work out, there is much to be said about playing the field like Buffett does. ""If you want to augment your index fund with a few stock picks of your own, I think that's a totally responsible and, frankly, thrilling way to try your hand at growing wealth beyond the ordinary, even if the ordinary has done pretty darned well all by itself,"" Cramer said.

"Neil Ainger, Writer at CNBC.com",05112017,CNBC,05042017,"A federal plan to issue national 'special purpose' bank charters in the U.S. to financial technology (fintech) companies, in order to encourage innovation, is under threat due to the imminent departure of comptroller of the currency head, Thomas Curry, at the behest of President Donald Trump. Curry had planned to stay on after officially finishing his five-year term as Comptroller last month so that he could push through his controversial fintech charter, which has encountered opposition from state bodies in the U.S., but the Trump administration has moved to announce his departure on May 5. His replacement as acting head will be Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is an independent agency within Treasury and is responsible for overseeing the nation's biggest banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Noreika is a member of the Trump transition team and has extensive experience advising banks on regulatory issues. His opinion about Curry's fintech plans are not known, but without a strong supporter in the government they are likely to fall by the wayside. It could take months to get Curry's long-term replacement approved by the Senate. Joseph Otting, a former associate of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at OneWest Bank, has been mentioned as a possible nominee. The Special Purpose National Bank (SPNB) fintech charter plans championed by Curry have encountered strong opposition from U.S. state supervisors who want to protect their own existing policies that are in place to nurture innovation and protect consumers at the state level of government. The dispute reached crisis point late last month when the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. district court of Columbia on 26 April, alleging that the OCC is over-stepping its authority in granting charter status to non-banks. Fintech challenger banks do not necessarily face the same prudential and regulatory rules that established banks that take deposits do. This disconnect is at the heart of the conflict, along with long-standing tensions about where state and federal rules should apply. The potential elimination of the fintech charter may retard the number of new tech-enabled 'challenger' banks that arise in the U.S. to compete with established incumbents. It is feared some may be put off by the complicated and expensive process of applying for a full banking license if the fintech charter fails. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Warren Buffett said Monday that United Airlines made a mistake in its initial response to the worldwide backlash over its treatment of a passenger. Buffett, whose company has a stake in United, told CNBC he wondered if CEO Oscar Munoz had seen the video of passenger Dr. David Dao being dragged from his seat before making his response. ""If so, it was a bigger mistake by far than if he hadn't seen it. And I don't know the answer to that,"" the billionaire investor said on ""Squawk Box."" ""But, the natural tendency if you've got 80,000 employees ... is to defend your employees."" Buffett said psychologically it can be hard for management to hear customers telling them they don't know how to do their jobs. ""A certain number people may behave badly. But what you hope is someone doesn't behave really badly,"" he said. Buffett's comment came six days after Munoz appeared on Capitol Hill, where he apologizedagain for the forcible removal of Dao. Munoz at first supported the action. The airline has since announced that Munoz will no longer take over as chairman of United's board in 2018, as planned. United will also offer passengers who give up their seats in an overbooked situation up to $10,000.

Dan Caplinger,05112017,Fool,05042017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has been among banking's blue-chip giants, having performed reasonably well during the financial crisis and quickly regained its footing in the aftermath of the 2008 recession and bear market. Investors have liked the bank stock for its solid dividend yield and long-term growth prospects, and its track record of conservative asset management paid off during the industry's turbulent times a decade ago. Yet more recently, the scandal over employees fraudulently opening fake accounts led to the departure of Wells Fargo's CEO and damaged the bank's reputation. Still, the stock didn't plunge, and many see better times ahead because of potential easing of regulatory hurdles and a more favorable interest rate environment. That could begin a new chapter in Wells Fargo stock history and keep investors happy for the long run. WFC data by YCharts. Wells Fargo has done a good job of growing over its history. Much of the growth that you see in the stock chart above actually belongs to fellow banking giant Norwest Corporation, with which Wells Fargo merged in 1998. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, bank consolidation ran rampant, with a huge number of small local banks joining forces or getting gobbled up by larger national and regional competition. The Norwest-Wells Fargo merger created the nation's sixth-largest bank, but it also brought an end to Wells Fargo's status as a key independent player in the banking industry. It also cemented Wells Fargo's concentration in the West, and some still referred to the post-merger company as a regional bank. After that, Wells Fargo did a good job of avoiding the market downturn in the early 2000s, and it carried its momentum through to the housing boom later in the decade. Even once the housing bubble had burst and many banks faced difficult times, Wells Fargo was remarkably stable. Despite its concentration of banking locations in California, which saw some of the most volatility in the housing boom and bust, Wells didn't suffer as much as peers elsewhere. Indeed, much of the later difficulty that Wells Fargo faced came from assets it bought in its acquisition of Wachovia during the financial crisis. Current CEO Tim Sloan. Image source: Wells Fargo. It didn't take long for Wells Fargo to make back most of its losses from the housing meltdown. By late 2009, the stock had tripled from its crisis lows had climbed back above where it had ended 2007. In 2013, the bank began a new run toward all-time record highs, taking advantage of more favorable conditions and using its leadership advantage to win business from less successful banks. It wasn't until 2015 that Wells Fargo stock really took a major pause. Shares fell a modest 10% as investors were uncertain about how a change in Federal Reserve policy might affect the bank, and further declines in early 2016 reflected that ongoing uncertainty. Then late last year, investors found out that Wells Fargo employees had created 2 million unauthorized accounts , claiming to be acting on customers' behalf. Many critics cited the bank's ambitious targets for bringing in new customers and cross-selling existing clients on other bank products. Now, though, investors seem happy about Wells Fargo's future prospects. The bank has seen its stock rebound, in part because the results of the 2016 presidential election point to the possibility of reduced bank regulation going forward. In addition, more favorable interest rate conditions could help Wells Fargo widen its net interest margin, and that in turn could bolster profits and create a new wave higher for the bank stock. However, Wells Fargo will still have to work hard to overcome negative perception about its false-account snafu. To some degree, all banks encourage customers to use additional banking products, so Wells Fargo is far from unique in creating incentives for its employees to take extraordinary measures to meet sales goals. Still, it might take a while for current and would-be customers to overlook the blemish on its record. The stock has held up extremely well over the years, helping shareholders get through crisis situations in the financial sector without the huge declines that some of its banking peers have suffered. Despite its recent setback, Wells Fargo has the potential to emerge even stronger once it puts this episode behind it once and for all. ","

John Maxfield,05112017,Fool,05042017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. One thing that would really help banks right now are higher interest rates. But just how much they'd help depends on the bank. In Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) case, a 100-basis-point increase in both short- and long-term rates would bolster its net interest income by between 2% and 5% over the 12 months following the increase. Given that the California-based bank generated $47.8 billion in net interest income last year, that equates to a benefit of between $1 billion and $2.4 billion in added revenue. Image source: The Motley Fool. The extra revenue would be a welcome relief for Wells Fargo. It has now recorded two consecutive years of falling earnings, a rarity for the once highly regarded bank. And Wells Fargo's fake-account scandal, revealed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last September, has only made things worse. Higher legal expenses combined with lower revenue from cross-selling -- Wells Fargo eliminated product sales goals in its branches in response to the scandal -- has caused its efficiency ratio to climb from 58.7% in the first quarter of last year up to 62.7% in the first quarter of this year. This means operating expenses are eating up an additional 4 percentage points' worth of revenue today compared to this time in 2016. The impact of higher rates isn't exclusively positive for Wells Fargo. While they will boost the amount of money it earns from its $1.8 trillion portfolio of earnings assets, Wells Fargo's cost of funds would go up as well. The latter is tied to the interest rate paid on deposits, as well as the rate a bank pays to borrow from institutional investors, both of which should roughly track the trend in the Federal funds rate, the principle short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. To this end, Wells Fargo estimates that a 100 basis point increase in short- and long-term rates will boost the yield on its earning assets by 50 to 60 basis points, or 0.50 to 0.60 percentage points. The same scenario will cause its cost of funds to climb 40 to 50 basis points, according to the bank's asset sensitivity analysis. The net result is that Wells Fargo expects its net interest margin, which captures the difference between a bank's yield on earning assets and its cost of funds, to climb by 5 to 15 basis points under this scenario. It's unlikely the Federal Reserve will in fact raise rates by 100 basis points this year, as its dot plot shows that the central bank expects to raise rates only two more times this year, for a total of 75 basis points, including the March rate hike. But even this would be positive news for Wells Fargo and other banks, which stand to benefit from any increase in rates, however large or small it turns out to be. ","

How does a company that's had a sterling reputation since the California Gold Rush in the 1850s sully its image after more than a century and a half of prudent and profitable operations? The answer in the case of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), says Warren Buffett, is a combination of hubris and procrastination. Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Image source: The Motley Fool. ""At Wells Fargo, there were three very significant mistakes, but there was one that dwarfs all the others,"" said Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) annual shareholder meeting. ""At some point if there's a major problem, the CEO gets wind of it, and the CEO has to act. They didn't act when they learned about it."" Buffett is talking about Wells Fargo's fake-account scandal, in which thousands of its employees opened millions of fake accounts in customers' names. The scandal came to light last September, when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that it had fined the nation's third biggest bank by assets $100 million. ""Wells Fargo employees secretly opened unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses,"" said CFPB Director Richard Cordray at the time. ""Because of the severity of these violations, Wells Fargo is paying the largest penalty the CFPB has ever imposed. Today's action should serve notice to the entire industry that financial incentive programs, if not monitored carefully, carry serious risks that can have serious legal consequences."" Wells Fargo's executives knew of the illicit sales practices for years yet allowed them to go on. A report issued by its board of directors in April found that the sales abuses date back to at least 2002. I've opined that they probably go back to 1998. Either way, beginning in 2011, Wells Fargo began firing 1,000 employees a year for opening up accounts for customers without their knowledge or approval. Yet despite ultimately terminating around 5% of its branch-based employees, Wells Fargo's executives refused to address the root of the problem: the bank's overly aggressive sales quotas. Employees were forced to work nights and weekends, not infrequently without pay, to increase their cross-sales. And when that didn't work, they cut to the chase and opened accounts for customers without their approval to do so. Since the current lineage of leaders took over following Wells Fargo's 1998 merger with Norwest, they've put cross-selling at the center of the bank's culture. They refer to its branches as ""stores,"" they proudly announced the bank's cross-sell ratio on its quarterly conference calls, and they aspire to sell every customer at least eight of its financial products -- checking and savings accounts, mortgages, car loans, and so on. ""Clearly at Wells Fargo there was an incentive system built around cross-selling a number of services per customer,"" Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday. ""There's nothing wrong with incentive systems, but you have to be very careful about what you incentivize."" Image source: The Motley Fool. Wells Fargo's now-former chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, fumbled his first public comments on the scandal, laying the blame on low-level employees in a CNBC interview with Jim Cramer. Then, Stumpf, in Congressional testimony, came across as unprepared and unrepentant. ""They totally underestimated the impact"" of the issue, Buffett said of the bank's response. To make matters worse, after the sales scandal came to light, the media was awash with stories of whistleblowers inside the bank who had been bringing the issue to executives' attention for years, sometimes emailing Stumpf directly. But instead of rewarding these employees, or at the very least protecting them against adverse employment actions, Wells Fargo engaged in a systematic effort to retaliate against them, generally firing whistleblowers in such a way that they had no chance of ever again getting a job in the financial-services industry. Buffett is the first to admit that no company is perfect. And when you employ hundreds of thousands of people, as both Wells Fargo and Berkshire Hathaway do, it's inevitable that inappropriate behavior will take place. ""You're going to have problems. We have around 367,000 employees,"" said the 86-year-old billionaire. ""People are doing something wrong as we talk about it today – there's no doubt about it."" To Buffett's point, however, while a company's executives can't police everything its employees do, once they are made aware of inappropriate behavior, there's a duty to stop it. That didn't happen at Wells Fargo. ","

One area where Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has emerged as a leader is in the mobile banking space. As of the first quarter of this year, 22.2 million customers of the nation's second largest bank by assets were active users of its mobile banking app. This is an impressive number when you consider that mobile banking is still relatively new. In 2013, only 12.6 million people actively used Bank of America's mobile app. That has since grown by 76%. Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author. To be fair, Bank of America doesn't have the top banking app when it comes to the number of users. That distinction goes to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which also happens to be the nation's biggest bank by assets. At the end of the first quarter, JPMorgan Chase had 27.3 million active users of its app. Rounding out the top three consumer banks, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) came in at 20.3 million active mobile users. Bank Mobile Banking Active Users Digital Banking Active Users (Online and Mobile) JPMorgan Chase 27.3 million 45.5 million Bank of America 22.2 million 34.5 million Wells Fargo 20.3 million 28.1 million Data source: First-quarter earnings releases. The upward trend in Bank of America's digital customers is important for two reasons. First, new generations of bank customers expect a slick and efficient way to bank on their smartphones. Mobile banking apps are thus necessary to attract and retain these customers. Additionally, serving customers through digital banking channels -- both online and through a mobile app -- is more efficient for banks, costing them a tenth as much as teller-assisted transactions. This is why Bank of America's progress on the mobile banking front is so important. Mobile devices accounted for one out of every five deposit transactions at Bank of America in the first quarter, said Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. That represents the volume of nearly 1,000 financial centers. Digital devices are now responsible for 22% of Bank of America's total sales. Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America. This helps explain why Bank of America has been able to trim its branch count so significantly over the past decade, shuttering approximately 1,500 locations since the beginning of 2009 alone. It also sheds light on why the North Carolina-based bank expects to soon meet its profitability and efficiency targets, which, at least in the case of profitability, could happen by the end of this year. Suffice it to say, this is an area current and prospective investors in Bank of America will want to continue watching closely. ","

Ever since the financial crisis, people have bemoaned too-big-to-fail banks, yet these institutions continue getting bigger. Following first-quarter earnings season, here are the 10 biggest banks in America: Bank* Total Assets (Millions)** JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) $2,546,290 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) $2,247,701 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $1,951,564 Citigroup (NYSE:C) $1,821,635 US Bancorp $449,522 PNC Financial Services $370,944 BB&T $220,501 SunTrust Banks $205,642 Citizens Financial $150,285 Fifth Third Bancorp $140,200 *Includes only commercial banks based in the United States. **As of March 31, 2017. Data source: YCharts.com. While most people tend to associate size with strength and competitive advantage, it cuts both ways in the bank industry. The nation's biggest banks, the so-called global systematically important banks, or G-SIBs, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, all have to hold more capital than smaller and simpler banks. JPMorgan Chase must set aside 3.5% more of its capital, Citigroup faces a 3% surcharge, and Bank of America is at 2.5%. This may not seem like a lot, but every bit of lost leverage matters in an industry as fiercely competitive as banking. Another benefit that smaller banks have is that they can continue to grow by merging with or acquiring other banks. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo aren't as lucky. Because they each hold more than 10% of the nation's deposits, they're prohibited by law from acquiring more depository institutions. Being big isn't all it's cracked up to be when it comes to banking. Image source: Getty Images. On the other hand, there are advantages when it comes to size. In the first place, bigger banks tend to benefit from economies of scale, making them more efficient on a size-adjusted basis than regional or community banks. With size also comes diversity of assets, reducing a bank's concentration in any particular area. Big banks tend to operate nationally or globally, instead of regionally or locally. Large banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, in particular, also balance out their commercial banks with investment banks, further diversifying their revenue streams and reducing risk. Finally, big banks have big budgets to invest in things like heightened compliance requirements or innovative new technologies. This has helped all of these banks emerge as leaders of both online and mobile banking. At the end of the first quarter, for instance, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo had a combined 70 million active users of their mobile banking apps. There are thus pluses and minuses to being among the nation's 10 biggest banks by assets. In the final analysis, in turn -- at least when it comes to bank stocks -- size alone matters less than one might think. ","
      
    10 Biggest Banks in America -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,05112017,Fool,05042017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Digital banking is transforming bank business models, but it isn't the biggest long-term threat to banks. That distinction goes to open application programming interfaces, or open APIs. These are dedicated channels through which data is exchanged between a bank and third-party financial service providers, such as fintech companies. In January, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) said that it would ""use technology that will allow customers to authorize Chase to electronically share financial data securely with Intuit's financial management applications, such as Mint, TurboTax Online and QuickBooks Online."" That technology, as the press release went on to note, consisted of open APIs: Chase and Intuit will use a business-to-business, data-sharing connection called an application-programming interface to download the information quickly and safely. It uses a token to authorize Intuit to download the requested account information on behalf of the customer without requiring customers to give Intuit their Chase user name and password. JPMorgan Chase is the first big bank to announce an agreement like this. Previously, Intuit used screen-scraping technology to get the data. It would log into customers' online bank accounts, copy the data from the screen, and then paste it into whatever app(s) the customers used. But screen-scraping puts pressure on a bank's servers, which explains in part why JPMorgan Chase prefers to route the data through an API. APIs are akin to pipes through which data flows. Image source: Getty Images. Additionally, screen-scraping tends to gather more information than necessary, as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon pointed out in his 2015 shareholder letter: When we all readily click ""I agree"" online or on our mobile devices, allowing third-party access to our bank accounts and financial information, it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that information might be used by a third party. We have analyzed many of the contracts of these third parties and have come to the following conclusions: - Far more information is taken than the third party needs in order to do its job. - Many third parties sell or trade information in a way customers may not understand, and the third parties, quite often, are doing it for their own economic benefit -- not for the customer's benefit. - Often this is being done on a daily basis for years after the customer signed up for the services, which they may no longer be using. While there's no question that open APIs offer considerable benefits, and to a certain extent are inevitable, they could also transform how people bank, as well as how sticky they are as customers. For instance, JPMorgan Chase customers that use Intuit's Mint app will almost certainly log on to Chase's app less frequently to check their account balance or transaction history. If they can do so on Mint, and that's where they manage their finances, there's no reason to also check the Chase app. This interjects a third party between a bank and its customers, reducing a bank's opportunity to cross-sell additional financial products. The impact of this can be substantial. When Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) eliminated product sales goals in its branches after its fake-account scandal, new credit card applications fell by over 40%. The iconic Wells Fargo stagecoach. Image source: Wells Fargo. Open APIs also seem destined to make it easier for customers to switch banks. Think of the hassle and headache it takes to switch primary banking relationships today. This is especially true for customers with multiple financial products. Direct deposit and automatic bill pay further increase switching costs, especially for customers who live paycheck to paycheck and thus don't have the funds to seed a new account at a different bank. Open APIs could ease this by automating the process of transferring accounts between banks. And it could be done in a way that minimizes the risk of an overdraft in the course of the transfer. This would trim the time, cost, and inconvenience of changing banks. And by doing so, open APIs would dramatically reduce, if not eliminate, switching costs. It's hard to say exactly how this would play out for banks, but it'd almost certainly open them up to a wave of new competition. ","
      
    The Greatest Threat to Banks May Surprise You -- The Motley Fool

Earlier this year, the now-former Federal Reserve governor in charge of regulatory matters, Daniel Tarullo, made a subtle but significant announcement that could free Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and other big banks up to return more than 100% of their earnings to shareholders. Since the financial crisis, the nation's biggest banks have had to ask for the Fed's permission to increase their dividends and stock buybacks. The regulator's newfound veto power over bank capital plans came as part of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which significantly scaled up banks' compliance burdens. The U.S. Federal Reserve Building at sunset. Image source: Getty Images. The Fed could reject a bank for one of two reasons. First, on quantitative grounds, if the bank wasn't projected to have enough capital to remain well-capitalized through the most extreme version of the annual stress test. And second, on qualitative grounds, if the Fed concluded that a bank didn't have an adequately sophisticated capital planning process in place. Few banks have problems with the quantitative aspect, as they can forecast relatively accurately the impact on their capital given the underlying stress test assumptions. It's the qualitative grounds that banks take issue with, as they're fuzzier and more subjective. Wells Fargo's new CEO Tim Sloan made this point at an industry conference last year: When you step back and think, should large financial institutions be stressing their balance sheet and their business model before they decide how much capital to pay out to shareholders? Of course, they should. I mean, it makes all the sense in the world. But we've moved from an objective standard to now maybe subjective [standards] are more important than objective. That would be something that you look at. Bank of America's Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan echoed these remarks at the same conference: For us as a company, just because of where we are, it's about capital return. ... It's about getting certainly around the ability to have access to your capital return once you've met all the hurdles. And whether those hurdles move up or down because of various peoples' points of view, the issue is the industry's above them, and now we need to be able to get the capital out. The good news for banks, in turn, is that this aspect of the test could soon go away. Former Fed governor Tarullo made this point on his way out the door earlier this year, suggesting that it may be time to end the qualitative part of the annual stress test. And it seems safe to say that the people most likely to be selected by President Trump to fill the three open seats on the Fed's governing committee will agree, given his vow on the campaign trail to reduce regulations on banks and other financial service providers. Of all the banks that would benefit from this change, few would welcome it as much as Bank of America. Its efforts to meaningfully increase the amount of capital it returns to shareholders have been throttled since the crisis in large part because of the qualitative portion of the stress tests. Bank of America has increased its dividend only twice since the financial crisis, compared to annual raises at JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Image source: YCharts.com. If that were to go away, it would enable the North Carolina-based bank to purge its balance sheet of an enormous surplus of pent-up capital, easily translating into a total payout ratio in excess of 100% beginning as early as next year.

    Bank of America Could Soon Return More Than 100% of Its Earnings to Shareholders -- The Motley Fool

Asit Sharma,05112017,Fool,05042017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported a vigorous start to the year in its first-quarter earnings report filed on April 26. Let's take a birds-eye view of the quarter, then focus on a staggering number, as well as several other important details from the filing. Data source: PayPal Holdings Inc. PayPal added 6 million new active accounts, a significant number of additions, and the single most impressive number in the report. The customer haul represents a 35% increase over new accounts added in Q1 2016, and management tagged it as the largest organic quarterly increase in active accounts in the last three years. Indeed, it's a 20% increase over the 5 million account additions in the previous sequential quarter alone. The Q1 account ""adds"" are significant because they're the single best indicator of PayPal's revenue potential. It's understandable for the rate of new PayPal customers to slow as the company matures. Yet active customer adds have now averaged 11% annualized growth for the last six quarters, and if anything, the trend may be accelerating. This type of growth mitigates shareholders' fears that numerous competitors in the payments space will upend PayPal's business model. The company reported 32 transactions per active account, marking an increase of 12%. PayPal ended the quarter with 203 million active customer accounts, and 16 million merchant accounts. Total payment volume (TPV), a measure of the total dollar volume of payments PayPal facilitates, rose 23% over the prior year quarter, to $99 billion. PayPal continues to scale its mobile transactions. During the quarter, 32% of TPV occurred through mobile devices, and mobile TPV rose 51% to $32 billion. PayPal repurchased $517 million of its own shares during the quarter. It also announced that its board has authorized a massive $5 billion share repurchase program, to begin once the 2016 share repurchase program, with $488 million of authorization remaining, is completed. The organization continued to tack on new partnerships to its payments ecosystem. During the quarter, PayPal announced an agreement with Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), which allows Wells Fargo debit and credit card holders to use PayPal to make contactless in-store payments. PayPal also extended its relationship with Alphabet Inc's Google, adding PayPal as a payment method in Android Pay for online, in-store, and in-app payments. In fact, PayPal has embarked on a frenzy of deal making over the last five quarters, as it teams up with potential payments adversaries to expand its reach. The following graphic from the company's first quarter investor presentation provides a great visual representation of the pace of partnership additions. It also demonstrates the variety of wide-reaching merchants, card issuers, banks, and social platform companies that PayPal is pulling into its ecosystem: Image source: PayPal Holdings, Inc. Transaction take rate, which is the percentage of revenue PayPal records per transaction it facilitates, declined 14 basis points from the prior year quarter, to 2.62%. This is due to a higher percentage of Venmo person-to-person payments, on which PayPal doesn't generate revenue. PayPal's take rate has declined since 2015 as it processes a higher percentage of payments through its Braintree subsidiary (which has a higher transaction expense than the overall company). However, over the last three quarters, PayPal's take rate appears to have stabilized in a range of between 2.62% and 2.65%. Image source: Getty Images. CEO Dan Schulman made two observations during the company's earnings conference call with analysts that illuminate PayPal's future potential. The first is related to the customer additions discussed above: ""...we're just beginning on this journey here. We're beginning to see an acceleration of our net adds coming in. Consumers are beginning to recognize sort of the network effect that we have. Merchants are beginning to see that. And we have huge international expansion opportunities, just better performance that we can do on that side."" The second is the sense that PayPal's recent approach to competition has yielded many advantages early on: ""2017 continues the strong efforts we've undertaken to create strategic partnerships across multiple ecosystems. We have seen the transformative power of these partnerships across our business. It's hard to overstate the difference in the relationships we now have with companies across multiple sectors who were previously viewed as potential competitors. We are now collaborating as strong and supportive allies to create value for our mutual customers."" The two trends reinforce each other. As PayPal continues to pull in new customers, competitors see a benefit in cooperation versus battling for market share. And as it turns adversaries into collaborators, the company gains access to a bigger universe of potential customers. PayPal's extremely healthy trends in customer acquisition, engagement, and TPV have given management the confidence to raise the company's 2017 outlook. While still within a 15% to 17% growth rate, the company now projects full-year revenue to land between $12.52 billion and $12.72 billion, an increase from the former band of $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to fall between $1.28 and $1.33, versus a previous range of $1.26 to $1.31. These bumps may seem modest given the platform's acceleration in customer growth, but of course, shareholders should remember that it's early in the year yet. ","

The firm noted dozens of stocks that are not only scheduled to host analyst days ahead of their June expiration, but which also carry low levels of implied volatility. “Based on our analysis of past volatility and current options prices, we think the options market is missing many of these historically important catalysts,” the firm wrote in a note to clients, adding that the options market was “overlooking the potential for these events to move shares.” Johnson & Johnson

Volatility could come in that name because of uncertain prospects for the department store going forward. “Our analyst is concerned about the 12-month outlook but sees upside risk to [first-quarter] estimates,” the note read. Kohl’s is scheduled to report its quarterly results May 11. A straddle is an options strategy where an investor buys a bullish call option and a bearish put option at the same strike price, betting that a stock will move by a certain amount, rather than in a particular direction. It is essentially a bet on stock volatility, something Goldman sees as likely after the company management teams present to the analysts covering them.

Wearables represented 7% of sales, according to Chief Financial Officer Dennis Secor, about $40.7 million. Three-quarters of those sales were smartwatches. The company added five brands to this platform, including DKNY and Marc Jacobs, bringing the wearables portfolio of brands to 14. “With our ambitious plans, we don’t expect we will get all the distribution we had initially anticipated in place this year, though with the expansion of wearables across a larger portion of our brand portfolio, we continue to expect that we could roughly triple our penetration of wearables revenues, which represented roughly 5% of last year sales,” Secor said on the earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. Read also: The retail sector is shedding jobs like it’s a recession Fossil expects second-quarter sales to decline in the range of 8% to 11.5%. Prior year sales totaled $685.4 million; the FactSet consensus is $619.7 million. The company is expecting its per-share loss to range from 83 cents to $1.00, including 15 cents of restructuring charges. The FactSet consensus is for a loss of 84 cents a share. “Fossil once again reported a quarter that raised more questions than answers, demonstrating the severe lack of visibility in the business today,” wrote Wells Fargo in a Tuesday note. Analysts also highlighted the failure of the company’s wearables to meet expectations. See also:  Kate Spade acquisition will add millennial shoppers to Coach customer base “Another way to put the underperformance of wearables into perspective is to look at the sequential decline versus the fourth quarter,” they wrote. “Historically, Fossil’s traditional watch business experienced sequential declines of 30% to 35% from fourth quarter to first quarter, but their wearables business just declined 60% from fourth-quarter’s $105 million contribution,” the note said. Wells Fargo rates Fossil shares underperform with a price target of $12, down from $13.50. Instinet analysts don’t share the optimism of Fossil management’s in wearables. “We continue to believe that Fossil is selling a challenged product into a challenged channel, with the hype pinned on wearables, despite the category remaining unproven and too small to counter the drop-off in traditional watches,” a Tuesday note said. “And we continue to believe the company is stuck between a fossil and a hard place, as the one category that is growing is margin dilutive and its ultimate scalability remains unproven.” Instinet rates Fossil shares neutral, and lowered the price target to $13 from $15.

                                   making low-cost alternatives more widely available. Moreover, the “authorized generic” EpiPen — made available by Mylan in December and at about $300 for a two-pack — has gained an about 40% share of the auto-injector market, Mylan said. Hits to EpiPen sales and Mylan’s gross profit margins are relatively recent developments. The product has brought in as much as $1 billion a year for Mylan, and as the product’s price increased over the years, margins also soared, according to industry estimates. Read:  Mylan is making a cheaper EpiPen available North American business grew 5% in the first quarter, but would have been up 20% if not for the EpiPen’s impact, said Mylan President Rajiv Malik. The EpiPen makes up less than 5% of the company’s global revenue and less than 10% of North American sales, he said. The company presented EpiPen declines as in line with its expectations. The company said at its investor day “that year-over-year EpiPen profitability at the operating profit level, we’re down $400 million year-over-year, a huge number,” said Chief Financial Officer Ken Parks, according to the FactSet transcript of the company’s earnings call. “And that’s exactly where we are moving through right now... everything is exactly how we expected it.” Related:  EpiPens can stay potent for years after they expire But others had a different perspective. Recent acquisitions, including Swedish drugmaker Meda and Renaissance Acquisition Holding’s dermatology business, are masking “organic contraction” in Mylan’s business, said Wells Fargo analyst David Maris. EpiPen concentration of sales and profits remain among Mylan’s risks, Maris — who rates the company market perform with a $40 price target — said, with EpiPen pricing scrutiny continuing as an overhang. Mylan shares declined 2.1% to $37.19 on Wednesday, after the company reported a first-quarter profit beat and revenue miss.

The offer will be available through August 6 to customers who had any Chase Sapphire card as of May 7. Chase’s credit cards have been popular in recent months, particularly the Sapphire Reserve card, which debuted in 2016 and initially offered a 100,000-point sign-up bonus, which was later reduced to 50,000 points. Credit card experts estimate some 900,000 people signed up for that card between September 2016 and November 2016. (Chase has declined to confirm that number.) As a result, J.P. Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said in December the Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card reduced the bank’s profit by $200 million in the fourth quarter, to $300 million. Now, Chase is attempting to capitalize on the young consumers it captured with that card. Half of Chase Sapphire customers are millennials, who may be looking to buy their first home soon, said Pam Codispoti, the president of Chase Branded Cards, in a statement. And customers under age 35 made up 36% of Chase’s mortgage originations in 2016, up from 20% in 2015, a spokeswoman for the bank said. Offers like this one may encourage customers who signed up for their cards to develop “a relationship” with Chase instead of using the card for its sign-up bonus and then abandoning it, a company spokeswoman said. Chase’s Ultimate Rewards points are worth about 2.1 cents each, according to sites that track point values, including the loyalty rewards site The Points Guy. The 100,000-point sign-up bonus would be worth about $2,000, and customers can redeem those points for rewards including flights, hotel stays and cash back. The current APR for a Chase 30-year fixed rate mortgage is 4.073%, compared with 4.168% at Bank of America

                                   , according to the banks’ websites. The banks may also charge additional lending fees, known as “points.” Also, other lenders including smaller banks and credit unions may have better rates. Several websites including the personal-finance company Bankrate allow consumers to compare rates online. That said, it’s unlikely customers will sign up for mortgages just to get those points. Indeed, failing to shop around for a mortgage in order to pick up credit-card points is a bad idea, said Rachel Podnos, an attorney and financial planner based in Washington, D.C. “It’s absolutely insane to make miles a consideration in any major life purchase decision,” she said. Anyone shopping for a mortgage should first find out how much house they can afford, Podnos said. A consumer’s total debt payments, including student loans, car loans and mortgages, should ideally not equal more than 36% of annual income, or lower for those who find debt stressful, she added. Then, consumers should compare several mortgage offers before choosing the one with the lowest interest rate and best terms possible, she said. Choosing a mortgage with even a slightly higher interest rate could cost thousands of dollars over one’s lifetime, wiping out any benefits from an initial sign-up bonus, she said. “A mortgage is probably the biggest purchase most people will make in their lifetime.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

Rex Nutting,05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"Published: May 11, 2017 10:30 a.m. ET Ryan Sweet of Moody’s Analytics looks for higher wages as labor market tightens further By Don’t worry too much about a slump. The U.S. economy is going to shrug off that misleading 0.7% growth rate for the first quarter and keep adding jobs at a strong pace for the rest of the year, said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics and the winner of MarketWatch’s Forecaster of the Month contest for April. In fact, it’s quite possible that by early next year the unemployment rate will drop below 4% for the first time since 2000, Sweet said in an interview. Working under chief economist and founder Mark Zandi, Sweet is the director of real-time economics for Moody’s Analytics and the editor-in-chief of Economy.com, the firm’s web portal for its in-depth analysis of global, national and regional economics. He is modestly upbeat about the economy, despite some of the dreadful data that’s come in recently, including the weak gross domestic product growth, the slump in auto sales, and two straight declines in retail sales. Read: Whew: U.S. economy really isn’t slowing “The hard data would tell you that the economy is very weak, but the soft data suggest that the economy was taking off,” he said. “The true health of the economy is somewhere in between.” By hard data, he refers to the reports on actual activity, such as sales volumes, prices and hiring. Soft data, by contrast, is based on surveys and includes a fair amount of subjective opinion about how consumers and business leaders feel. He dismisses the weak first-quarter GDP report, chalking it up to some unseasonable weather and the continuing inability of the statistical agencies to get the seasonal adjustment right. “The only certainties in life are death, taxes and a weak first-quarter GDP report,” he joked. One excellent reason to ignore the GDP report: Continued strong job growth averaging about 175,000 per month, considerably more than the 100,000 needed each month to absorb the increase in the working-age population, he said. “We’re not at full employment yet,” Sweet said. He thinks wage growth will keep rising, in part because accelerating investment in software and other intellectual property will boost productivity growth. Slightly higher consumer price inflation will push companies to give slightly bigger raises to make sure their workers’ purchasing power doesn’t decline. The growth in household incomes this year and next should keep the economy on track, he said. With unemployment falling into the 3% range and inflation bubbling into the 2% range, the Federal Reserve will probably raise its short-term target rate two more times this year — in June and September, Sweet said. Read: U.S. producer prices jump 0.5% in April The Fed will probably pause on rate hikes in December when it takes the first step to reduce its balance sheet, he said. He expects further rate hikes in 2018, along with steady declines in the balance sheet. In the April contest, Sweet had the most accurate forecasts among 47 forecasting teams on two of the 11 indicators we track — the consumer price index and the trade deficit. On six others — nonfarm payrolls, housing starts, durable goods orders, consumer confidence, retail sales, and industrial production — his forecasts were among the 10 most accurate. With the first four months of the year in the books, Sweet is leading the contest for the 2017 Forecaster of the Year, which has been won by Jim O’Sullivan for the last six years in a row. O’Sullivan, of High Frequency Economics, is hot on his heels. The runners up in the April contest were Richard Moody of Regions Financial, Ted Wieseman of Morgan Stanley, Jan Hatzius’s team at Goldman Sachs, and Gus Faucher, the new chief economist at PNC Financial. The forecasts MarketWatch publishes in our Economic Calendar are the median forecasts of the 15 forecasting teams that have done the best in our contest over the preceding 12 months, plus the forecast of the most recent winner of the Forecaster of the Month. Our enhanced consensus is much more accurate than the Bloomberg consensus that’s widely followed. The economists in our consensus forecast are: Jim O’Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, Spencer Staples of EconAlpha, Ryan Sweet of Moody’s Analytics, Sam Coffin at UBS, Christophe Barraud at Market Securities, Avery Shenfeld’s team at CIBC, James Sweeney’s team at Credit Suisse, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro Economics, independent forecaster Brian Jones, John Silvia’s team at Wells Fargo, Stephen Stanley of Amherst Pierpont Securities, Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics, Jan Hatzius’s team at Goldman Sachs, Brian Wesbury and Bob Stein at First Trust, and Richard Moody at Regions Financial.

Proceeds are earmarked for the catchall “general corporate purposes,” but that includes shareholder returns, along with working capital, debt repayment and acquisitions. Apple said this week it is increasing and extending its shareholder-returns program and said it would tap the bond market at home and overseas to fund the program. Apple first issued bonds to finance huge buybacks and dividend payments, rather than repatriate the roughly $250 billion in cash it holds outside of the U.S., which would be subject to a 35% corporate tax rate. Since Apple began its investor return program in 2012, it’s debt load has increased from zero to $84.5 billion, as of the end of the last quarter. While much was made of Apple’s cash reserves topping $250 billion in Apple’s quarterly report Tuesday, Apple actually added more debt than cash in the quarter, with long-term debt rising nearly $11 billion and cash reserves increasing nearly $10.8 billion, the second time in three quarters debt has increased faster than cash. President Donald Trump has pledged to implement a one-time repatriation tax to encourage U.S. companies to bring home their cash as part of a wider tax reform, but the timing of that move remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Apple has just $17 billion in cash in the U.S. and had $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding in its recent quarter, without a backstop credit facility. CreditSights reiterated its underperform rating on Apple’s bonds, noting that the company missed expectations for iPhone sales in its latest quarter. The company’s leverage is rising and it could decide to boost the shareholder returns program even more if the repatriation holiday materializes, said the firm. See:  Apple stock falls after iPhone maker reports revenue, forecast miss: Live blog recap Don’t miss: Calm the iPhone 8 buzz, Apple analyst warns “In particular, we think it could be a catalyst to refocus creditors’ attention from Apple’s cash hoard to its business profile, and we think this will lead to a steepening of its credit curve,” CreditSights analyst Jordan Chalfin wrote in a note. CreditSights’s rating of Apple’s bonds is based on the 30-year bonds, which are trading at the second-tightest level among the “super investment grade” tech companies in the firm’s coverage.

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"But the move, detailed at Wells Fargo’s investor day, failed to impress Wall Street, because management also indicated that revenue growth is suffering from the scandal, which involved employees creating as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts in customers’ names to hit sales targets. The San Francisco-based bank’s stock was down 1.7 percent at $53.81 in afternoon trading. Wells Fargo plans to reduce expenses by another $2 billion through the end of 2019, on top of a $2 billion cost-cutting target management previously announced. The cuts come after repeated questions from analysts and investors about why Wells Fargo was not doing more to reduce costs, which have been high by some measures when compared to U.S. banking rivals. But the scandal has only increased costs, as the bank has tried to fix practices internally and respond to regulatory inquiries and public backlash. During the investor day event, executives said they understood investor concerns and would take action. Chief Executive Tim Sloan used the word “unacceptable” at least twice, in reference to prior sales practices and expense levels. Management had been trying to keep expenses in a range of 55 percent to 59 percent of revenue, but in the first quarter that ratio soared to 62.7 percent. “Operating at this level is completely unacceptable,” Sloan said. As Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry began his presentation, he joked to the crowd: “Raise your hand if you’re interested in hearing about expenses at Wells Fargo.” He said the bank plans to get back into its targeted ratio in the coming years. The sales abuses in Wells Fargo’s branch banking operation led to a $190 million regulatory settlement, launches of other government probes, the firing of several bankers, the departure of CEO John Stumpf and shareholders offering scant support for most directors at the bank’s annual meeting last month. Nearly all of the executives speaking on Thursday, including Sloan, are in new positions entered after the scandal erupted in September. Wells Fargo’s investor day is typically a biannual event, but management held it a year early to provide more information about how they are running the bank. Sloan and his deputies indicated that the scandal had impacted revenue, either because some customers may be less inclined to do business with the bank or because reforms to business practices have hurt sales. For instance, Wells Fargo has changed pay structures so that instead of being incentivized to boost sales figures, employees are encouraged to deliver products and services customers actually need. While executives have described such reforms as necessary, they may also be hurting revenue. “We had an incentive program and high-pressure sales culture in our community bank that drove behavior that was at times inappropriate and inconsistent with our values,” Sloan said, noting that management “took too long to appreciate seriousness of the problem.” Wells Fargo bankers are getting fewer referrals from branches for personal loans and home-equity loans, said Franklin Codel, an executive in the consumer lending unit. That has led to a 3 percent decline in business, though trends appear to be stabilizing, he said. The credit card business has also been hurt by the scandal, said Avid Modjtabai, who heads Wells Fargo’s payments, virtual solutions and innovation group. The rate of new credit card account openings has recently picked up, but Modjtabai did not say when she expects the business to fully recover. Overall, Wells Fargo expects net interest income to grow in the low-to-mid single percentage points this year, which some analysts characterized as disappointing, as were executives’ assertions that Wells will not hit its cost efficiency ratio this year. The new cost-cutting guidance fell roughly in the middle of analyst expectations. A big chunk of the savings will come from Wells Fargo’s plan to close 450 branches in 2017 and 2018, roughly 10 percent more than its previous target. Through Wednesday’s close, Wells Fargo’s shares had risen 6 percent over the past six months, lagging gains of 14.1 percent for JPMorgan and 28.7 percent for Bank of America. ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"The new estimate was provided in a filing late Thursday night in the federal court in San Francisco, and is 1.4 million accounts higher than previously reported by federal regulators, in what became a national scandal. Keller Rohrback, a law firm for the plaintiff customers, said the higher estimate reflects “public information, negotiations, and confirmatory discovery.” The Seattle-based firm also said the number “may well be over-inclusive, but provides a reasonable basis on which to estimate a maximum recovery.” Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez in an email said the new estimate was “based on a hypothetical scenario” and unverified, and did not reflect “actual unauthorized accounts.” Nonetheless, it could complicate Wells Fargo’s ability to win approval for the settlement, which has drawn opposition from some customers and lawyers who consider it too small. “This adds more credence to the fact there is not enough information to assess whether the settlement is fair and adequate,” Lewis Garrison, a partner at Heninger Garrison Davis in Birmingham, Alabama who represents some objecting customers, said in an interview. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco is scheduled to consider preliminary approval at a May 18 hearing. The accounts scandal mushroomed after Wells Fargo agreed last September to pay $185 million in penalties to settle charges by authorities including the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells Fargo employees were found to have opened the accounts in part because of pressure to meet sales goals. John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, who were respectively the San Francisco-based bank’s chief executive and retail banking chief, lost their jobs and had tens of millions of dollars clawed back over the scandal, and 5,300 employees were fired. The $142 million settlement covers accounts opened since May 2002. Wells Fargo originally agreed to pay $110 million covering accounts since 2009, but boosted the payout after discovering more problems. Keller Rohrback said the settlement “fairly balances the risks” of further litigation, including the possibility their clients might lose, against the benefits. Garrison’s firm said in a filing the accord underestimated the potential maximum damages by at least 50 percent, and did not properly address whether Wells Fargo committed identity theft by using customers’ personal data to open accounts.

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"(Reuters) - The City of Philadelphia sued Wells Fargo & Co on Monday, accusing the largest U.S. mortgage lender of predatory lending, which violates the federal Fair Housing Act. The lawsuit came two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a case also involving Wells Fargo, said cities can sue lenders for alleged discrimination that causes many defaults by minority borrowers, and harms cities through lower property tax revenue and increased costs to combat crime and blight. Philadelphia’s complaint adds to legal woes afflicting San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which has since September been beset by a scandal over its employees’ creation of unauthorized customer accounts to meet sales goals. “The city’s unsubstantiated accusations against Wells Fargo do not reflect how we operate,” Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said in a statement. “Wells Fargo has been a part of the Philadelphia community for more than 140 years and we will vigorously defend our record as a fair and responsible lender.” Philadelphia accused Wells Fargo of having since 2004 steered minority borrowers into higher-cost, riskier loans than white borrowers, even if they qualified for loans with easier terms, and refused to let minority borrowers refinance. The city said black borrowers were more than twice as likely to receive high-cost or high-risk loans than similar white borrowers, and Hispanic borrowers were roughly twice as likely. It also said home loans in predominantly minority neighborhoods were 4.7 times more likely to be foreclosed. Wells Fargo suffers from a “long history” of “red-lining,” and practices that reflect a “total breakdown of appropriate internal controls” similar to its creation of bogus customer accounts, the complaint said. Philadelphia had 1.57 million residents in 2015, ranking just ahead of Phoenix as the fifth-most-populous U.S. city. According to the 2010 census, roughly 43 percent of Philadelphians were black and 12 percent were Hispanic. The complaint filed in Philadelphia federal court seeks unspecified damages, plus an injunction against discriminatory lending. It was brought by many of the lawyers who represented the city of Miami, Florida, in its Supreme Court case against Wells Fargo and Bank of America Corp. In that case, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the majority that cities could sue under the Fair Housing Act by showing a “direct” link between the alleged misconduct and the asserted injuries. The case is City of Philadelphia v Wells Fargo & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, No. 17-02203. ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"(Reuters) - Brighthouse Financial, the consumer life insurance and annuity unit created by MetLife Inc, on Monday unveiled its first new product, a deferred annuity whose performance is tied to one of three investment indexes. Wells Fargo Advisors, a unit of Wells Fargo & Co, will initially distribute the index annuity, known as Shield Level 10, Brighthouse said. It is part of a group of annuities that were previously sold under the MetLife name. MetLife announced last year that it planned to spin off its Brighthouse business, which sells life insurance and annuities to individuals. The insurer is still awaiting regulatory approval for the move. MetLife will continue to focus on its U.S. employee benefits and overseas businesses, the company has said. An annuity is an insurance product that offers investors steady income payments, typically in exchange for a lump-sum investment. Payments from an indexed annuity are tied to a percentage of the gain of an investment index that tracks equities, such as the S&P 500 Index.

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"(Reuters) - A private gauge of U.S. home builder sentiment unexpectedly rose in May to its second strongest level since the housing bust nearly a decade ago, as the existing supply of homes remained tight. The National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo said on Monday their index of builder confidence in newly built, single-family homes climbed to 70 points from 68 in April. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the reading to be unchanged in May from April. In March, the index reached 71 which was the highest since June 2005 during the height of the prior housing boom. “This report shows that builders’ optimism in the housing market is solidifying, even as they deal with higher building material costs and shortages of lots and labor,” NAHB Chairman Granger MacDonald, said in a statement. Some analysts cautioned the rise in mortgage rates this year would limit a pickup in home construction. “While we expect a slight moderation in housing activity in the near term owing to higher mortgage rates, the picture for 2017-18 remains one of modest trend improvement,” Barclays economist Blerina Uruci wrote in a research note. The NAHB index is seen as a proxy on domestic housing starts. The government will release its April housing starts report at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters forecast builders likely broke ground at an annualized rate of 1.260 million units, faster than a 1.215 million unit pace in March. The survey’s gauge on current single-family home sales rose to 76 points from 74 in April, while its six-month sales outlook index increased to 79, which was the highest since June 2005, from 75. On the other hand, the barometer on prospective buyers dipped to 51 in May from 52. On a regional basis, three of the four U.S. regions NAHB tracks, the Northeast, South and West, showed improved builder sentiment in May, but the Midwest recorded a decline. ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several big-name hedge fund investors trimmed their stakes in financial companies in the first quarter as hopes for immediate tax cuts and loosening of regulations after President Donald Trump’s victory in November began to fade. Boston-based Adage Capital Management cut its position in Wells Fargo & Co, which has come under fire for its sales practices, by 3.9 million shares, according to regulatory filings, while John Burbank’s Passport Capital cut its stake in the company by 947,000 shares. Third Point cut its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co by 28 percent, to 3.75 million shares, while Suvretta Capital Management sold all of its shares of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup Inc. Overall, financial companies in the S&P 500 were up 2.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for the  index as a whole. Financials significantly outperformed the broad market following Trump’s Nov. 8 election. Trump had pledged to do a “big number” on the landmark Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which raised banks’ capital requirements and restricted their ability to make speculative bets with customers’ money. The Treasury Department is still filling vacancies and will not be able to complete a review of the law by Trump’s June deadline, sources told Reuters. Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come out 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Bank of America Corp was one of the few large banks to gain favor among hedge fund investors in the first quarter. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management took a new stake in the company, buying 8.7 million shares, while Dan Och’s Och-Ziff Capital Management added 12.78 million shares, increasing its position by 156 percent. Separately, several hedge fund managers added new positions in media companies. Tiger Global bought 429,000 shares of Netflix Inc. Shares of Netflix are up 29.2 percent for the year. Omega Advisors, which is facing a U.S. Securities Exchange Commission insider trading case, added positions in Netflix, AMC Networks Inc and Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. Tiger did, however, halve its position in Google parent Alphabet Inc, whose shares are up 21 percent since Jan. 1. ","

Nathan Reiff,05182017,Investopedia,05112017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs When Warren Buffett, the celebrated investor, billionaire, and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, makes an investment move, thousands of investors around the globe instantly follow suit. The investment guru is known for his level-headed approach and for his long-range planning, and when he makes a major shift in his positions it tends to draw attention. That was the case in recent months with IBM (IBM). Buffett has long been a vocal supporter of the tech giant, and so it shocked many of his followers when he sold off stock in the company. As is the case with most stocks that Buffett holds positions in, there was speculation as to whether or not the billionaire's shifting interests would spur a larger-scale downshift in investor interest. It seems that has come to pass in at least one potentially embarrassing area: International Business Machines' own pension fund has also recently sold off most of its stake in its parent company stock, according to recent filings. IBM's Retirement Fund reportedly cut its holdings in the parent company stock from 82,802 shares as of December 31, 2016 to just 12,451 shares as of March 31 of 2017. The shift in position was reported by Barrons and is made available to the public via the pension fund's 13-F filing, released in recent days to the SEC in compliance with federal regulations. The shift marks a significant change of perspective for the pension fund. Though pension funds across the country have been commanding unusual attention in recent months, thanks in large part to a widespread shift in hedge fund investments, this one is particularly interesting for its implications for IBM's business health in the future. While it was assumed that Buffett's sale of IBM stock would trigger a broader sell-off, it is unlikely that many analysts expected the company's own retirement plan to mostly exit its position in IBM. It's not immediately clear what this means in terms of the future of the retirement fund or the parent company. In any event, IBM Retirement Fund also sold off shares in Wells Fargo (WFC). Wells Fargo was another significant holding for Buffett, and another that the billionaire also trimmed considerably in the past quarter. Buffett decimated his IBM holdings, trimming down his position for Berkshire Hathaway's class B stock from more than 178,000 shares to just 27,000 shares in January, February, and March of this year. IBM wasn't the only stock that the Retirement Fund cut down on in the past few months. According to the 13-F, the IBM fund also reduced its stake in Apple (AAPL), its one-time rival company, dropping from 516,000 to just 78,000 shares. Nonetheless, 78,000 shares of Apple was still more valuable than the remaining shares of IBM in the fund's holdings, at least as of the end of the first quarter.

Home sales figures in the first quarter were the best since the same quarter of 2007, per the National Association of Realtors, as reported by the Journal. Census Bureau data shows the percentage of first-time home buyers increasing towards its long-term average, and online real estate listings company Trulia finds that new households are more often seeking to buy homes than rent them, per the Journal.  These trends are also positives for building supply and home improvement retailers such as The Home Depot Inc. (HD) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW). On Tuesday, Home Depot announced first quarter earnings per share of $1.67 that were about 5% above the same period in 2016 and which beat analysts' estimates by 6 cents, or nearly 4%, according to Barron's. Year to date through Wednesday's close, shares of Home Depot are up 17% ($133.27 to $156.09), while Lowe's has gained 19% ($70.48 to $83.75). These companies have P/E ratios of 23 and 24, respectively. Both Home Depot and Lowe's have been called Amazon-proof, Barron's says, since they offer bulky products that are hard to ship, and professional contractors prefer to shop in store. Nevertheless, Home Depot's online sales were up 23% in the first quarter, Barron's notes. (For more, see also: Top U.S. Housing Market Indicators.)

Economists had been forecasting a rate of 1.26 million units, Reuters notes. Other concerns going forward are the impact of rising interest rates on the affordability of mortgages, the possibility of tax cuts being threatened if President Trump is beset by new crises, and worries that GDP growth (and thus growth in disposable personal income) will remain in the doldrums.

Dawn Giel,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"Attorneys for alleged victims of the Wells Fargo fake account scandal are now saying that the bank may have been responsible for more unauthorized accounts than previously thought. In a legal filing, plaintiffs' attorneys in a class-action lawsuit say: ""Based on public information, negotiations, and confirmatory discovery, the parties estimate the number of unauthorized accounts for the period 2002-2017 is approximately 3.5 million. This number may well be over-inclusive, but provides a reasonable basis on which to estimate a maximum recovery."" It's important to note that based on the results of the independent board review of the scandal, former CEO John Stumpf was not made aware of the systemic nature of the bank's sales practice problems until 2012, but was first aware of specific cases as early as 2002. ""The unauthorized account number reported in yesterday's filing are estimates made by the plaintiff attorneys based on a hypothetical scenario and have not been verified,"" Wells Fargo representative Ancel Martinez said in a statement. ""The number of unauthorized accounts estimated in the filing do not reflect actual unauthorized accounts."" Wells Fargo disclosed it entered into a settlement agreement in April 2017 in the company's most recent 10-Q. The bank disclosed it planned to pay $142 million for remediation, attorneys' fees and settlement fund claims administration. It also noted that the settlement was still subject to approval by the District Court. The case is being handled in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, in San Francisco.

Jeff Cox,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"The City of Philadelphia has taken another swing at Wells Fargo, this time alleging that the bank has been discriminating against minorities. In a federal court complaint, the city alleges that Wells Fargo pushed minorities into riskier loans with higher rates, even in cases where the borrowers had credit profiles that would have qualified them for lower-rate loans. The complaint charges that the problem has been ongoing since 2004 and is a violation of the Fair Housing Act, and comes in the wake of an important Supreme Court decision on the legislation. On May 1, the high court ruled that Miami could sue Bank of America for predatory lending practices that allegedly increased segregation. ""The City of Philadelphia's investigation revealed that both the resources of the city and the lives of Philadelphia's citizens have been negatively affected by Wells Fargo's discriminatory lending practices,"" city Solicitor Sozi Pedro Tulante said in a statement. ""The Law Department must take action in light of this evidence and halt these discriminatory practices on behalf of the citizens of Philadelphia."" The lawsuit comes amid a brutal period for Wells Fargo after the bank last September settled charges that it had created millions of fake accounts for customers without their knowledge. Recent disclosures from plaintiffs attorneys involved in other litigation against the bank show that the total accounts in question could number 3.5 million, from the original estimate of 2 million. In a related matter, Philadelphia City Council recently voted to change handlers of its $2 billion payroll account, switching from Wells Fargo to Citizens Bank. Wells Fargo recently faced a rowdy reception at its shareholders meeting, during which it faced a barrage of questions over the fake account scandal. Bank officials were contrite, promising to do better in the future. In the latest Philadelphia case, though, the bank fired back at the lawsuit, which it called ""unsubstantiated."" The allegations in the lawsuit ""do not reflect how we operate in Philadelphia and all of the communities we serve,"" the bank said in a statement. ""Wells Fargo has been a part of the Philadelphia community for more than 140 years and we will vigorously defend our record as a fair and responsible lender,""  the statement added. ""We will continue to focus on helping customers in Philadelphia and its surrounding communities succeed financially, and on expanding homeownership in Pennsylvania and across the United States."" Philadelphia is charging that it used loan data to conclude that Wells Fargo was unfairly targeting minorities for high-cost products. Experts the city hired found that 23.3 percent of the bank's loans to minorities were high-risk, compared to just 7.6 percent for whites. The city is charging that blacks with FICO credit scores above 660 were 2.5 times more likely to receive high-cost loans than whites. For Latinos, the figure was 2.1 times. In addition to getting Wells Fargo to stop the alleged discriminatory practices, the city is also seeking unspecified monetary damages.

Michelle Fox,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"It's time for President Donald Trump to reflect on his management style if he wants to right his presidency, former Wells Fargo CEO Dick Kovacevich told CNBC on Wednesday. Trump is unpredictable and puts his foot in his mouth, and that is taking away from many accomplishments, he said in an interview with ""Closing Bell."" ""Unless he does make some changes, it's going to make it almost impossible"" to get his new policies done at all, or it will take a lot longer to get done, Kovacevich noted. The drama unfolding in Washington, D.C., reached new levels after reports on Tuesday that former FBI Director James Comey said Trump asked him to back off the investigation into ex-national security advisor Michael Flynn. The allegations come after a week of big developments in the nation's capital, including the firing of Comey, who was investigating the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and reports that Trump revealed highly classified information to Russians in a closed-door meeting. Kovacevich said while Trump had success on the campaign trail, presiding over a bureaucracy and the world's economies is a completely different process. ""His natural personality helped him in the campaign, and his natural personality is hurting him in becoming a great president,"" he said. Kovacevich's comments followed those made by former GE CEO Jack Welch earlier Wednesday, who said Trump has ""crappy management practices."" ""I give him a D minus, and I'm being an easy grader,"" Welch said on ""Squawk Box."" Don Peebles, CEO of The Peebles Corporation, said newcomers to politics always have a difficult time making the transition.

He called its plans to offer special purpose charters to financial technology (fintech) firms, allowing them to compete with banks nationwide, ""unlawful"" and ""harmful"". ""CSBS strongly supports the lawsuit filed by the New York Department of Financial Services against the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),"" said Ryan in a forcefully worded statement. ""The OCC does not have the authority to issue federal charters to non-banks, and its unlawful attempt to do so will harm markets, innovation and consumers."" Even before New York joined the federal versus state stand-off, the OCC's federal fintech charter was already under threat from CSBS' own lawsuit filed in Washington last month and the departure of its champion Thomas Curry on 5 May at the behest of President Donald Trump. The turf war over who gets to supervise fintechs is escalating with CSBS's rival 'Vision 2020' regulatory plan appearing to gain ground against the federal fintech charter. Acting OCC head Keith Noreika, is not known to be a strong supporter of the Special Purpose National Bank (SPNB) fintech charter, which was previously championed by Curry. The OCC is an independent agency within the Treasury and is responsible for overseeing the nation's biggest banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Other countries have nationwide fintech policies and support groups such as the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission's (SFC) Fintech Contact Point, unveiled last year, and the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) Innovation Hub in the U.K. But the drive to introduce similar initiatives in the U.S. have been stymied by arguments over whether federal or state governments are best placed to encourage fintech innovation, while still providing effective consumer protection. Ryan called the OCC's SPNB plan, ""an unauthorized expansion of its authority"" in a statement released late on Friday that went on to claim the federal fintech charter ""threatens state sovereignty"". ""State regulators already supervise a vibrant financial services marketplace that includes non-banks and banks,"" he said. ""Where there are opportunities to further modernize state regulation of financial services providers, including fintechs, state regulators are committed to doing so through our recently launched 'Vision 2020' initiative."" Vision 2020 The state-backed 'Vision 2020' plan released by CSBS last week aims to make the U.S. state system of financial regulation pre-eminent, while still recognizing standards that can be applied across state lines to enable nationwide fintech innovation. According to CSBS its rival plan, outlined in a statement released on 10 May, ""will create consistent and data-driven solutions"" that support innovation ""by minimizing friction in the state regulatory system."" By 2020, state regulators plan to adopt an integrated fintech licensing and supervisory system across 50 States that will transform the interaction between industry, regulators and consumers. ""We are committed to a multi-state experience that is as seamless as possible,"" said CSBS chair and board member, Charles Cooper, in a statement. He is also the Texas Commissioner of Banking. ""Through Vision 2020, state regulators will transform the licensing process, harmonize supervision, engage fintech companies, and assist state banking departments,"" he said, while adding he wants to, ""make it easier for banks to provide services to non-banks"" and ""make supervision more efficient for third parties.""

Patti Domm,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"The U.S. doesn't usually rise to the top of the list of major markets with political risk, but with stocks near record highs and volatility low, analysts say one of the biggest threats to the bull market currently comes from Washington. ""There are political risks in this country because of uncertainty,"" said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He said the last time he felt U.S. political risk this much was in 2008 when Washington was attempting to resolve the financial crisis. Now, he's finding it's risk of a different sort, but it's a new concern for some investors, who are used to weighing political risk in Europe and emerging markets. ""What about political uncertainty in this country? If Trump and Congress don't deliver tax reform or health care by the midterm election, is the Republican majority in the House or Senate at risk? I would say possibly. It's not like leaving the euro zone but there's certainly more risk that would impact the economy going forward,"" said Christopher. Analysts say the loss of the Republican majority would be a concern for markets, since it is viewed as having an opportunity to make unimpeded pro-business and pro-growth decisions. The markets are supported by those expectations, though many of the Trump-specific trades, such as small caps and infrastructure plays are no longer as hot as they were after the election. Christopher said investors are increasingly concerned about the timing of tax reform, and that it could be kicked into next year. ""The closer we get to the [2018 midterm] election, the more likely you get nothing done,"" he said. Christopher said if there's a lack of action, his other worry — concern China's economy could be slowing — becomes more worrisome. ""The prospect you're not going to get reflation in the U.S. and China might slow further, that's something where people would have to evaluate the magnitudes,"" he said. ""Maybe, it's just that we can't get used to the fact that someone's president whose going to act in ways we're not comfortable with, and is not easy to predict. Even if you like Trump, sometimes his tweets get you off guard. Maybe if you like Trump, you're surprised by his slapping of a 20 percent tariff on Canadian lumber,"" said Christopher. Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategist at UBS, said the market has been pricing improved earnings but also the expectations of better growth due to tax reform, stimulus and other pro-growth policy. He says political risk is not all that uncommon in the U.S., but now market expectations are high that there will be action. Confidence measures have soared based on the idea Washington policy will boost growth and profits. ""There is a definite expectation that those are in the works. The political risk is not any discrete event in and of itself. It's the whole idea that if there is a perceived delay or perceived incremental difficulty on what the market believes is coming. That's where confidence is affected. What we've shown in our work is when confidence is affected and starts to turn down, that's when multiples and stock prices are vulnerable,"" Emanuel said. Investors had been pricing in an 80 to 85 percent chance of some tax reform this year, but that has fallen. ""We now think they're pricing the likelihood of tax reform is on the order of 55 to 65 percent and they think it could be late 2017 or early 2018,"" said Emanuel. If there's no signs of action before the summer congressional recess, that could pressure on confidence and possibly stock prices. Some of those indicators have begun to fall off the highs reached postelection. The NFIB small-business optimism index for instance, edged down to 104.5 after reaching a high of 105.9 in January. Both Christopher and Emanuel said President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey this week so far was not a big concern for markets, but there is the perception it could create distractions that would take focus off policy and potentially cause a delay in legislation for tax reform. Keefe Bruyette Wood analysts said the Comey firing is indicative of other issues that could slow tax reform. ""While we do not think there is a direct link between the firing and tax policy, the way it was handled by the White House reinforces a narrative that the White House and the president are impulsive and reactive and that the president still does not fully appreciate the way Washington works,"" they wrote in a note. The analysts said the announcement ""undercuts confidence that the administration can see a complex issue like tax reform through to completion."" Strategas Research policy analyst Dan Clifton said some of the chaos in Washington could actually spur tax reform efforts if Republicans believe they are at risk of losing congressional seats. In a note, he pointed to how success in midterm elections is tied to the approval rating of the president. Trump's approval rating has fallen to 38 percent, according to Gallup. Some analysts take as positive the fact that the House was able to finally approve health-care legislation, but the fact that the Senate will propose a whole new bill worries them that the road to tax reform will become even longer. Christopher said the economy is now growing at a good pace after the first-quarter lag, but he said a risk is that as time drags on, the Federal Reserve could be hiking interest rates with no boost from tax breaks or fiscal spending to offset the impact on the economy. Some analysts say the market is reflecting its doubts even as stocks hold near highs. ""I'm concerned that small caps are not doing anything. It's an indictment or skepticism this policy will occur. I think people are starting to discount what Trump says. Why is Mexico outperforming the U.S. so much with all this talk about a wall and NAFTA? Why are municipal bonds keeping pace with taxable bonds. I thought they were supposed to go down with tax reform,"" said Jack Ablin, CIO at BMO Private Bank.

A senior White House official said the reports were ""not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey,"" according to a statement provided to NBC News. As a result, some traders worried that the latest political developments could prevent Trump's proposed tax reforms, deregulation and infrastructure spending from being implemented. ""If it's delayed that's a problem. That causes a correction. If it's canceled this market is going to go down so hard that we haven't seen anything like it in the last few years,"" said Ilya Feygin, managing director and senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital. Policy-sensitive sectors like financials did lead Wednesday's decline. However, most technical analysts noted the magnitude of the drop did not mark the beginning of a significant sell-off yet. Frank Cappelleri, technical analyst at Nomura Instinet, pointed out in a note that a decline of at least 1 percent in the S&P 500 on Wednesday would only mark the second such drop since the middle of October, despite a barrage of controversial Trump tweets and press remarks. Cappelleri is watching whether the S&P can hold 2,350. After that, he said the lower end of the March-to-April trading range at 2,322 is another level to watch. S&P 500 one-month performance A sell-off from Wednesday's lows to that point would still mark only a 2 percent decline. From a fundamental standpoint, first-quarter earnings have mostly beat expectations and are tracking for their best quarter of earnings per share growth since 2011. Global growth is also improving. The major averages remain within 3 percent of their all-time highs and haven't fallen into correction, or more than 10 percent from a recent high, since the beginning of last year. ""For the most part we really do see this contained,"" said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""If we do get that bigger pullback [to] 2,200, 2,280, from a technical standpoint the trend still looks higher."" Still, ""this is not something that's screaming buy either,"" Samana said. Wells' year-end target is a range between 2,230 and 2,330, slightly lower than Wednesday's levels.

If you invest in bank stocks, then you probably won't be surprised to hear that U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is one of the nation's best-run banks. And you don't just have to take my word for it, because a recent Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) presentation does an excellent job of showing just why this is the case. The presentation, given by Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry at the bank's annual investor day last week, offers a host of charts that show the multiple areas in which U.S. Bancorp has emerged at the top of the industry. For example, take the chart below, which shows that U.S. Bancorp's book value and dividends per share have grown at a faster annualized rate over the past four years compared to Wells Fargo and the four other biggest banks in America: Data source: Wells Fargo. Or take this chart, which shows that U.S. Bancorp is the nation's most profitable big bank, generating a 17.4% return on tangible common equity last year compared to runner-up Wells Fargo's 13.9%: Data source: Wells Fargo. There's the one below as well, which looks at return on assets, a measure of profitability that excludes the impact from leverage: Data source: Wells Fargo. Finally, Wells Fargo included a chart that compared these six banks' efficiency ratios. This is calculated by dividing a bank's noninterest expenses by its net revenue, with a lower number being better than a higher number: Data source: Wells Fargo. But you get what you pay for, as U.S. Bancorp's profitability isn't only the highest, but it's also the most consistent, as you can see in another chart included in Wells Fargo's presentation for its 2017 investor day: Data source: Wells Fargo. In sum, if you're looking for a bank stock to hold for the long term, you could do a lot worse than U.S. Bancorp. While its high valuation will likely muzzle significant short-term gains, the appreciation of its shares over the long term should make up for this. ","

John Maxfield,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's now clear that the former chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), John Stumpf, was wrong when he said last year that the bank's fake-account scandal wouldn't have a material impact on the bank's financial performance. Whether he believed this at the time or not, it's hard to say. But by claiming it wasn't material, Stumpf was able to keep the issue a secret from shareholders even though the bank had fired the equivalent of 5% of its branch-based employees from 2011 to 2015. Former chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf. Image source: Wells Fargo. Either way, Wells Fargo's latest quarterly regulatory filing proves that the scandal is, in fact, having a material impact on the nation's third-biggest bank by assets. There's the $327 million that it's already agreed to pay in legal fines and settlements. Then there's the fact that Wells Fargo eliminated product sales goals in its branches, which has caused new checking account openings and credit card applications to fall by between a third and a half compared to the prior-year period. The scandal has also sullied the bank's once-sterling reputation. But it wasn't until Wells Fargo filed its first-quarter 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission that investors got a sense of the extent of the California-based bank's ongoing legal travails. In the three months ended March 31, Wells Fargo spent $264 million more on outside professional services than it did in the same quarter last year. Some of that was for project and technology spending, but higher legal expenses related to its sales scandal was also a cause. All told, the bank now predicts that ""reasonably possible"" losses from legal actions could exceed its current litigation provisions by $2 billion. The higher expenses are coming from Wells Fargo's two-front legal war. On one front, it's dealing with a variety of governmental investigations. As the bank explained in its 10-Q: Federal, state and local government agencies, including the United States Department of Justice, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Labor, and state attorneys general and prosecutors' offices, as well as Congressional committees, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, investigations or examinations arising out of certain sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. On the second front, it's dealing with lawsuits filed by consumers, shareholders, and employees. The net result is that Wells Fargo is likely to be tied up in the courts for years before its fake-account scandal is fully resolved. That doesn't mean investors should necessarily avoid the bank's stock, but it does imply that Wells Fargo's performance will, at least for the time being, continue to be materially impacted by cleanup costs.

    Wells Fargo Is Fighting Legal Battles on Two Fronts -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A lot of people don't take Jim Cramer seriously, which probably has something to do with the theatrics of his show on CNBC. But I tend to agree with the substance of what he says. Yet, I think he's wrong to compare Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) recovery from its fake-account scandal to Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) recovery from a handful of foodborne-illness outbreaks that struck in 2015. Image source: The Motley Fool. Cramer's main point, which he made earlier this week, is that it takes 18 months for scandals like these to wash over, regardless of whether it's a restaurant chain or the nation's third biggest bank by assets: Wells Fargo is just like Chipotle. When you have this kind of disaster, it takes 18 months. Wells Fargo shot itself in the foot. In nine months, you will start thinking: ""What did Wells Fargo do?"" That's the way the American mind works. CMG data by YCharts. But investors need to be careful about taking this analogy too far, because these are actually very different scenarios. Chipotle's stock fell more than 50% in the wake of its food-safety issues, while Wells Fargo's dropped a maximum of 13%. Wells Fargo's stock has since rallied alongside other banks, as rising interest rates and expectations of regulatory relief emanating from Washington, D.C. have convinced investors that banks will soon make a lot more money. Today, in fact, Wells Fargo's stock is 6% above where it was right before its fake-account scandal came to light last September. WFC data by YCharts. Wells Fargo's stock price has thus already recovered. It's not a turnaround situation. And quite frankly, it never was. Wells Fargo is instead a long-term play on interest rates and on the California-based bank's deeply entrenched position in the financial services industry. The story in Chipotle's case is different. Its stock is still off by 35%. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a turnaround story, as its stock may have been egregiously overvalued before the food-safety scare, but it does put the burrito chain into a different investment category. This is why I think Cramer is wrong to analogize Wells Fargo to Chipotle. There are similarities between the two, but the differences are much more meaningful. ","

At Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) investor day on Thursday, the bank shared an interesting chart that clearly delineates between the nation's best-run banks and the rest. The chart shows the relationship between bank profitability, measured by return on equity, and the volatility of a bank's earnings over the past five years. It looks specifically at Wells Fargo and five of its peers: U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Data source: Wells Fargo. The chart reveals two interesting things. The first is that there's a cluster of banks that have both stable earnings and comparatively high returns on equity. U.S. Bancorp is at the top, followed by Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and PNC Financial. All of these banks are considered among the best-run financial institutions in the country, though Wells Fargo has certainly lost much of its luster in the wake of its fake-account scandal. These banks also tend to have the highest valued stocks, measured by the price-to-book value ratio. This makes sense given the logical correlation between the profitability and valuation of banks that I've discussed previously. The second interesting thing, though it's a corollary of the first, is that the two banks on the chart that have the lowest returns on equity also have the most volatile earnings. These are Bank of America and Citigroup. Image source: The Motley Fool. It isn't a coincidence that these two banks were hit hardest by the financial crisis. Citigroup came within a hair's breadth of failure in 2008, and spent the next five-plus years retreating and retrenching from its former strategy of securitizing and selling derivatives and securities backed by toxic subprime mortgages. And Bank of America was in a similar situation, though its troubles were largely inherited via its acquisition of Countrywide Financial. Since then, Bank of America has spent upwards of $200 billion on crisis-related costs, though the North Carolina-based bank has more recently turned the corner. All of this matters because the size and consistency of a bank's earnings plays a role not only in the annual stress tests, which are administered each year by the Federal Reserve and dictate how much capital a bank can return to its shareholders, but also in a bank's credit rating. At Moody's, which is one of the three main ratings agencies, 15% of a bank's credit rating relates directly to profitability, as I dig into here. In short, when it comes to picking bank stocks, it isn't only how much a bank earns that matters; it's also about the consistency of earnings. ","

"Steve Symington, Jason Hall, and Dan Caplinger",05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. As arguably the world's most successful stock picker, it's no surprise that Warren Buffett is watched closely by investors around the world. At the end of last quarter, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)(NYSE:BRK-A) boasted an investment portfolio worth a staggering $187 billion, including more than $133 billion in equity securities. But with that size comes decreased flexibility. In some cases, that's due to the fact that -- short of an outright acquisition -- Buffett can't buy enough shares of smaller companies to move the needle in his enormous portfolio. In other cases, it's not in his best interests to allow his stakes to grow any larger. So we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to offer examples of stocks that you can buy that are out of Buffett's reach. Read on to learn why they chose Netgear (NASDAQ:NTGR), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and BofI Holding (NYSE:AX) IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL Steve Symington (Netgear): Buffett has crushed the market for decades while mostly eschewing tech stocks. To be fair, he does own roughly 50 million shares of IBM even after trimming his stake in the computing juggernaut earlier this year. And SEC filings in March revealed Berkshire opened a sizable position in Apple last quarter. But I think investors could do even better buying shares of Netgear, a networking hardware specialist that's just too small to have any meaningful influence on Buffett's overall returns. Meanwhile, sales of Netgear's Arlo wireless security cameras, services, and accessories jumped an impressive 150% year over year last quarter to $60.7 million. And Netgear continues to enjoy solid retail demand for Connected Home products, including strong demand for its high-margin Nighthawk routers and Orbi Wi-Fi products. But perhaps most enticing are the impending launches of Netgear's Arlo Baby and Arlo Go weatherproof camera products this quarter, which should together significantly expand Netgear's addressable markets and help reaccelerate growth even if service provider sales continue to wane. In the end, I think investors willing to pick up shares of Netgear before that happens should handily beat the market in the coming years. Dan Caplinger (Wells Fargo): Warren Buffett has recently sold off some of his shares of Wells Fargo, and many investors erroneously assumed that his sales came due to the banking giant's recent scandal involving employees fraudulently opening customer accounts in order to meet sales goals. However, Buffett was quick to explain the real reason behind his Wells Fargo sales, showing that he still sees the bank's stock as a smart investment. Buffett had accumulated a large enough stake in Wells Fargo that stock buybacks by the bank had pushed his position above the 10% mark. That would have triggered additional regulatory scrutiny under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, and after discussions with the Federal Reserve, Buffett came to the conclusion that it made sense to sell off enough shares to push the position size back below 10%. With Buffett having said that he intends not to make any sales beyond whatever is necessary to keep the position below 10% going forward, potential new investors can still feel the confidence that investing alongside the Oracle of Omaha can bring. Given Wells Fargo's historically strong management and the leadership of new CEO Tim Sloan, your ability to buy where Buffett can't would give you a chance to enjoy in the banking giant's future growth. Jason Hall (BofI Holding): One of the problems with Berkshire's success is that the company has gotten so big, it can't invest in many high-growth companies that otherwise might be right up Warren Buffett's alley. BofI Holding is one of those companies. But that doesn't mean BofI isn't a stock that you should avoid. To start, it has numerous advantages over traditional banks, including an operating model without physical branches which makes it fare more profitable and efficient. Last quarter, BofI's efficiency ratio -- how much of its revenues go toward operating expenses -- was 31.7%, less than half that of most traditional banks. BofI has also steadily grown assets and profits at double-digit rates, mostly from residential mortgage growth. But management is aggressively investing in building out multiple other lending businesses, including auto, commercial and industrial, and business equipment lending. Not only will this provide more growth potential, but will also help diversify its risk. Lastly, BofI is cheap, for such a high-quality, profitable bank, mostly because the bank has had some PR issues. Trading for less than 14 times last year's earnings and less than 2 times book value, BofI is trading at a nice discount for its profitability and growth potential. ","
      
    3 Stocks Warren Buffett Can't Buy, but You Can -- The Motley Fool

When Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG) went public in 2014, becoming the largest commercial bank to ever file an initial public offering, you would have been excused for thinking its future wasn't bright. But times have changed, and so have Citizens' prospects. Two and a half years ago was an inopportune time to debut as one of the nation's biggest banks. Low interest rates and rising compliance costs made it hard for even elite banks to earn their costs of capital and create value for shareholders. On top of this, Citizens was in the midst of a turnaround, having been spun off from the Royal Bank of Scotland, which made mistakes in the lead-up to the financial crisis that have since cost Citizens' former parent company $58 billion in losses. Bruce Van Saun, the chairman and CEO of Citizens Financial Group. Image source: Citizens Financial Group. Fast-forward to today, however, and Citizens' future looks much more promising. Interest rates are heading higher, and appear poised to continue doing so. Policymakers in Washington, D.C., have vowed to roll back onerous regulations enacted since the crisis. And Citizens' fundamental performance has improved across the board. Its profitability has nearly doubled, it's become more efficient, and its stock has handily outperformed the KBW Bank Index. This isn't to say that Citizens is satisfied with where it is today, because it isn't. Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun's goal is to transform the $150 billion bank into one of the top-performing regional banks in the United States, along the likes of U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial. This won't be easy, as formidable hurdles still lay in Citizens' path. But Van Saun was clear in a recent conversation that he thinks the Providence, Rhode Island-based bank is up to the task. ""When I came over to Citizens in October 2013, our goal was to benchmark our performance against peers, start playing offense, and turn the company around,"" says Van Saun. ""The plan was fairly straightforward and we've executed on it well. Our performance was initially behind our peers, but now we've pretty much caught up with them. We like to say now that we're turning the corner. We're moving out of our turnaround phase."" Citizens' performance last year corroborates Van Saun's optimism. The bank grew loans on a year-over-year basis by 7.7% compared to a 5.4% peer group average. Its revenues climbed even faster, rising 8.9% versus 5.4% for its average competitor. And its efficiency ratio, which measures the percent of revenue consumed by a bank's operating expenses, fell 376 basis points (bps), exceeding the 62 bps drop recorded by the typical bank in its peer group. Things improved further in the first quarter of this year. Citizens finished with a 61.7% efficiency ratio, closing in on the 60% benchmark that most banks strive to achieve. Its return on tangible common equity came in at 9.68%, marking a substantial improvement over the first three months of last year, when it generated a 6.61% return on tangible common equity. The net result is that Citizens is now on the verge of passing the 10% threshold that, as a general rule, distinguishes between banks that are earning their costs of capital, and thus creating value for shareholders, and those that aren't. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. The progress at Citizens stems in part from the fact that it had been undermanaged by RBS, which was forced by regulators to shrink and de-risk after the 2008 crisis. At one point, RBS went so far as to stop making commercial real estate loans, forcing Citizens to tell even long-standing customers at the time that it wasn't open for that kind of business. But that's no longer the case, says Van Saun, who flipped the sign around to say ""shop open"" after Citizens detached from RBS: So we went out and recruited experienced commercial bankers, many of whom have relationships with companies that are above the middle market -- ones with more than $500 million in annual revenue. To serve these companies you need industry expertise. So we set up a healthcare group, a technology group, an energy group. And we've been bringing over bankers who have strong relationships in these industries. When there's an opportunity to enter into a credit relationship with these companies, we're there to do so. Then we hopefully move over and become a more important bank for them. Citizens has pursued a similar strategy in its consumer banking business. It jumped into education refinance loans, becoming one of the bigger players in that space. It's grown in the personal unsecured market by introducing a debt-consolidation product for people with high-interest credit card loans. It hired 200 new mortgage officers, increasing the bank's total to 550. And it introduced a new platinum status for customers who maintain higher balances and want more account features, fewer fees, better rates, and additional products and services. Under Van Saun's watch, Citizens has also invested heavily in technology to improve the customer experience and navigate the unfolding institutional imperative in the financial services market. As the 58-year-old executive explained in his latest shareholder letter: In digital technologies we are building next-generation experiences in key areas, including mobile, wealth advisory, lending and commercial services. We are focused on delivering a more consistent and integrated customer experience across all of our distribution channels. And to ensure that the technologies we deploy are relevant and valuable to our customers, we have invested in advanced analytical tools that give us real insight into each customer's needs. In 2016, moreover, Citizens announced a partnership with SigFig, a financial technology company, or fintech, to roll out a robo-advisory service to the bank's wealth management clients. And the bank has ""strategies in place to take advantage of further technology innovations, such as leveraging open applications and moving to a cloud-based infrastructure,"" wrote Van Saun. ""You have to be judicious about where you're playing, and be innovative on the consumer side, but that's what's allowed us to grow,"" he told me. It's this combination of factors, combined with Van Saun himself, that has caught the attention of industry observers. ""I like Citizens a lot,"" says veteran bank analyst Richard Bove, pointing to Citizens' capital levels, strategic relationships with companies like SigFig, and risk discipline. ""And I think Van Saun is top quality,"" Bove continued. ""He's an excellent banker."" Even though Citizens has made considerable progress since going public in 2014, plenty of obstacles remain on its journey to emerge as a top-performing regional bank. In the first case, loan growth across the industry has decelerated. Loans on commercial bank balance sheets have increased over the past two years by 8%. Starting at the end of 2016, however, the rate has steadily dropped. Recent data from the Federal Reserve shows that total loans at commercial banks expanded only 4.1% in March compared to the same month last year. Data source: Federal Reserve. Chart by author. Moreover, while rising interest rates will increase the yield on loans and fixed-income securities, which will be especially beneficial to asset-sensitive banks like Citizens, higher rates may also eventually cause depositors to look elsewhere to improve on the rates offered by checking and savings accounts. ""If [banks] continue to keep money at zero and slightly higher rates, they are likely to be severely criticized,"" noted Bove in a recent note to clients. ""These banks are going to lose deposits. They are going to be forced by market conditions to raise rates. If they choose not to do this, they will lose hundreds of billions in deposits."" This is an important issue for Citizens. ""The one thing we have to focus on is that, while we have plenty of capital, our loan-to-deposit ratio ended the first quarter at 97%,"" says Van Saun. ""So if we're going to grow loans at a good clip, we need to continue growing deposits as well, because we fund each dollar in loan growth with a dollar of deposit growth. And we want to find those deposits in a cost-effective manner."" Citizens' credit rating also serves as a headwind. It ranks in the middle of its peer group in this regard, thanks principally to its condition upon its spinoff from RBS. This acts as a signal to corporate customers who have become more discerning over the past decade about the banks they partner with. Just as importantly, a lower credit rating increases a bank's cost of funds, not unlike how a person with a lower credit score must pay a higher interest rate on their mortgage. Bank Credit Rating (Standard & Poor's Long-Term Senior Debt) U.S. Bancorp A+ PNC Financial A- BB&T A- Citizens Financial BBB+ Fifth Third Bank BBB+ SunTrust Banks BBB+ Regions Financial BBB Data source: Company filings. The good news is that Citizens' credit rating should improve with time. The bank is more than adequately capitalized, has plenty of liquidity, and, barring missteps, should see its profitability rise as interest rates climb and the bank's strategic initiatives gain momentum. Van Saun also emphasized that Citizens is working with the ratings agencies to bolster its score: We've been in active dialogue with the ratings agencies about making sure they understand our plan and the progress we've made. They've taken comfort in our fortress balance sheet and I think the reason our rating isn't where we'd like it at this point is that our earnings levels have been lower than peers. That gap is rapidly diminishing, but the ratings agencies tend to look more out of the rearview mirror than the front windshield. So we'll need to have a more sustained level of improved operations at the current level to get us a better rating. It's important to appreciate that the allegations against Citizens are different both qualitatively and quantitatively from Wells Fargo's unsavory sales practices. The latter amounted to an outright fraud that was perpetrated against millions of Wells Fargo customers over a decade and a half, if not longer. By contrast, Citizens' program was only rolled out in February 2016. And while it's not good if the initiative inadvertently incentivized illicit behavior, setting up fake appointments is far less egregious than opening fraudulent accounts for customers and then retaliating against employees who brought the scandal to the attention of their superiors, as was the case at Wells Fargo. Furthermore, unlike Wells Fargo, the allegations against Citizens remain just that. Aside from the inevitable wave of class action lawsuits filed against the bank by attorneys seeking to pad their own pockets, it's telling that there haven't been additional media reports confirming the claims. That contrasts sharply with Wells Fargo, which has been under a constant barrage of corroborating media reports for eight months. ""We have a full review going on to see if there's ways to sharpen how we've implemented the program,"" says Van Saun. ""But it's a great program and it's here to stay. It's not scandalous. It's actually something that I think is very admirable and it's a great way to up our game in terms of knowing our customers and having more interaction with them."" While no stock is a guaranteed home run, Citizens' future looks bright. Its shares give investors an opportunity to profit from an improving economic and regulatory environment, as well as the bank's ongoing efforts to bolster its efficiency and profitability. It's also well positioned to grow through acquisitions, giving it a leg up on the nation's megabanks, three of which control over 10% of domestic deposits each and are thus legally prohibited from acquiring other depository institutions. And the icing on the cake is that Citizens is one of the few big bank stocks that trade for less than book value -- currently, for a 6% discount. The onus remains on Citizens to grow in a responsible manner and to successfully navigate the digital divide confronting banks today. But assuming it does so, current and prospective investors in the bank could benefit handsomely. ","
      
    Citizens Financial Group Is Moving Out of Its Turnaround Phase, Says CEO Bruce Van Saun -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Digital banking is transforming bank business models, but it isn't the biggest long-term threat to banks. That distinction goes to open application programming interfaces, or open APIs. These are dedicated channels through which data is exchanged between a bank and third-party financial service providers, such as fintech companies. In January, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) said that it would ""use technology that will allow customers to authorize Chase to electronically share financial data securely with Intuit's financial management applications, such as Mint, TurboTax Online and QuickBooks Online."" That technology, as the press release went on to note, consisted of open APIs: Chase and Intuit will use a business-to-business, data-sharing connection called an application-programming interface to download the information quickly and safely. It uses a token to authorize Intuit to download the requested account information on behalf of the customer without requiring customers to give Intuit their Chase user name and password. JPMorgan Chase is the first big bank to announce an agreement like this. Previously, Intuit used screen-scraping technology to get the data. It would log into customers' online bank accounts, copy the data from the screen, and then paste it into whatever app(s) the customers used. But screen-scraping puts pressure on a bank's servers, which explains in part why JPMorgan Chase prefers to route the data through an API. APIs are akin to pipes through which data flows. Image source: Getty Images. Additionally, screen-scraping tends to gather more information than necessary, as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon pointed out in his 2015 shareholder letter: When we all readily click ""I agree"" online or on our mobile devices, allowing third-party access to our bank accounts and financial information, it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that information might be used by a third party. We have analyzed many of the contracts of these third parties and have come to the following conclusions: - Far more information is taken than the third party needs in order to do its job. - Many third parties sell or trade information in a way customers may not understand, and the third parties, quite often, are doing it for their own economic benefit -- not for the customer's benefit. - Often this is being done on a daily basis for years after the customer signed up for the services, which they may no longer be using. While there's no question that open APIs offer considerable benefits, and to a certain extent are inevitable, they could also transform how people bank, as well as how sticky they are as customers. For instance, JPMorgan Chase customers that use Intuit's Mint app will almost certainly log on to Chase's app less frequently to check their account balance or transaction history. If they can do so on Mint, and that's where they manage their finances, there's no reason to also check the Chase app. This interjects a third party between a bank and its customers, reducing a bank's opportunity to cross-sell additional financial products. The impact of this can be substantial. When Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) eliminated product sales goals in its branches after its fake-account scandal, new credit card applications fell by over 40%. The iconic Wells Fargo stagecoach. Image source: Wells Fargo. Open APIs also seem destined to make it easier for customers to switch banks. Think of the hassle and headache it takes to switch primary banking relationships today. This is especially true for customers with multiple financial products. Direct deposit and automatic bill pay further increase switching costs, especially for customers who live paycheck to paycheck and thus don't have the funds to seed a new account at a different bank. Open APIs could ease this by automating the process of transferring accounts between banks. And it could be done in a way that minimizes the risk of an overdraft in the course of the transfer. This would trim the time, cost, and inconvenience of changing banks. And by doing so, open APIs would dramatically reduce, if not eliminate, switching costs. It's hard to say exactly how this would play out for banks, but it'd almost certainly open them up to a wave of new competition. ","

Todd Campbell,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett's ability to pick long-term winners for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) portfolios has made his buying decisions must-know news. Fortunately, big investors like him have to file a 13F report with the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter that shows what he's been buying. According to Warren Buffett's latest 13F, his top stocks for new money include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK). Should you be buying these stocks, too? Warren Buffett once told Steve Jobs to use Apple's cash to buy back stock, but it took Buffett until 2016 to follow his own advice. Image source: The Motley Fool. Now, Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's third largest position. In the first quarter, Buffett bought nearly 72 million shares of Apple, bringing the total number of shares owned by Berkshire Hathaway to over 129 million. At current prices, that position is worth over $19 billion. Why is Buffett betting so big on Apple? At the time of his first purchase, Apple shares had sunk to lows on fear that slowing sales in China was a signal of weakness to come. Since then, China has shown signs of recovery, and with rumors suggesting Apple's next iPhone will include new features like 3D sensing, Apple could be about to see demand surge as device owners upgrade. While Apple was a cheap stock when Buffett first began buying, it's gotten more expensive since then. In the past year, Apple's shares have rallied over 60%. There could be more room to run higher, but Buffett did recently hint that he's having trouble buying more shares now that prices have run up so much. Nevertheless, the potential for this technology behemoth to enjoy a rush of sales remains a key catalyst heading into 2018, and for that reason, investors might want to join Buffett in buying Apple if shares dip. In the past, Warren Buffett has said a surefire way to become a millionaire is to start out a billionaire and buy an airline. Yet, shares in Southwest Air were among his biggest buys in the first quarter. Southwest is a discount airline that's known for folksy, fun service, and Warren Buffett lists co-founder Herb Kelleher as a friend. In Q1, Buffett added over 4.4 million shares in Southwest Airlines to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, bringing its total stake north of 47 million shares. Coming out of the first quarter, Berkshire Hathaway is Southwest Airlines' second biggest shareholder. By his own admission, one of Buffett's worst stock picks in his career was USAir, an operator he bought back in the late 1980s that declared bankruptcy twice. He ultimately made money on USAir, but he still refers to it as a ""dumb"" buy because, historically, the industry has suffered from too much capacity, too much price competition, and too high costs. Today, Buffett appears to believe that those headwinds have eased. Bankruptcies and mergers have rightsized capacity and airlines are far less willing to sell seats at bargain-basement prices. A strong economy is also helping increase load factors, and rising oil production in the U.S. due to shale drilling has helped keep jet fuel prices in check. As a result, operators including Southwest have been delivering solid growth. LUV Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett's also been buying Southwest's competitors, including American Airlines, so he seems to like the industry as a whole. However, I'm not convinced that airlines will remain a staple holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The industry has made significant changes to its business model that have paid off, but it's still a cyclical industry with high capital expenses. Because of these reasons, Buffett could view these bets on airlines as opportunistic rather than long-term investments. If I'm correct, then he could sell at any point; especially since shares have rallied considerably higher. In spite of a high-profile scandal at his biggest holding, Wells Fargo, Warren Buffett hasn't soured on banks. In Q1, he added 11.3 million more shares to his existing position in Bank of New York Mellon, and as a result, he now owns 33 million shares in it. Banking's appeal is understandable. Following the Great Recession, bank earnings have been weighed down by the government's low-interest policies, but now that those policies are ending, banks are poised to see their net interest margins climb. Bank of NY Mellon, however, isn't an ordinary bank. The company is a leader in asset management, and while it makes money lending to businesses and high-net-worth clients, it's benefiting significantly from rising equity markets' positive impact on fees. Last quarter, a record $30.6 trillion in assets under management or administration helped revenue grow 2.7% year over year to $3.84 billion. In the quarter, investment services revenue accounted for $3 billion of total sales. Meanwhile, the bank's cost controls helped non-interest expense grow more slowly than sales, providing leverage that allowed the company to report earnings per share of $0.83, which was $0.03 better than Street forecasts, and 14% higher than last year. Its improving financials suggest there's plenty of financial firepower to continue returning a lot of money to investors. Last quarter alone, buybacks and dividend payments totaled $1.1 billion. As long as global markets are strong and high-net-worth clients finances are holding up, Bank of NY Mellon should perform well, and since there's little evidence of a pending recession, it's not surprising that Buffett continues to warm up to this one.

Shares of Yelp (NYSE:YELP) took a beating last week, plunging 19.6% after the company posted mixed financial results. The provider of local venue reviews would go on to offer up disappointing guidance -- again -- resulting in a couple of analyst downgrades. Yelp is checking in with revenue of $197.3 million, 24% ahead of the prior year. The top-line showing is in the middle of the guidance it provided three months ago, targeting $195 million to $199 million in revenue. However, analysts were holding out for $198.6 million. Things look better on the bottom line, where it posted a loss of $0.06 a share or a profit of $0.19 on an adjusted basis. Wall Street pros were forecasting a deficit of $0.08 a share. Mixed results can typically send growth stocks slightly lower, but it's Yelp's outlook that turned a potentially negative day into a disastrous one. The former dot-com darling is initiating guidance of $202 million to $206 million for the current quarter, a lot less than the $215.4 million analysts were modeling. Yelp also lowered its forecast for all of 2017. It's now eyeing adjusted EBITDA of $130 million to $145 million on revenue of $850 million to $865 million this year. Just three months ago Yelp was projecting $150 million to $165 million in adjusted EBITDA on $880 million to $900 million in revenue. Image source: Yelp. This isn't the first time Yelp's stock has experienced a double-digit percentage decline after the company offered up uninspiring guidance. We saw this same scenario play out three months ago, when the stock took a nearly 15% hit the week it posted disappointing guidance following its fourth-quarter results. We've now seen back-to-back reports triggering double-digit percentage dives, and that's not going to turn the investment into a hotbed of bullish analysts. A few Wall Street pros soured on the stock following the soft outlook. Rob Sanderson at MKM Partners  downgraded the shares from ""buy"" to ""neutral."" He thinks it will take several quarters before Yelp has a chance to win back investors and is slashing his price target from $48 to $27. Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital also lowered his rating from ""outperform"" to ""sector perform."" He joins Sanderson at a price target of $27, down from $49. Back-to-back quarters of advertising account issues are weighing on his confidence. A few analysts rushed to the stock's defense, taking advantage of the sell-off as a buying opportunity. However, even those upgrades were sweet and sour. Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs and Peter Stabler at Wells Fargo upgraded the stock but lowered their price targets. Growth is slowing at Yelp, and that's not a surprise. Revenue growth has decelerated in nine of the past 10 quarters. This first quarter's 24% showing is the weakest by Yelp in its publicly traded tenure. Yelp is still growing, Reviews continue to build, and Yelp has seen a 17% increase in business owners willing to pay to advertise on its site. The pressure will be on in three months for Yelp to live up to its guidance, but it's clear enough people still believe in Yelp as an investment, even after last week's slide. ","

Rex Nutting,05182017,MarketWatch,05112017,"Published: May 11, 2017 10:30 a.m. ET Ryan Sweet of Moody’s Analytics looks for higher wages as labor market tightens further By Don’t worry too much about a slump. The U.S. economy is going to shrug off that misleading 0.7% growth rate for the first quarter and keep adding jobs at a strong pace for the rest of the year, said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics and the winner of MarketWatch’s Forecaster of the Month contest for April. In fact, it’s quite possible that by early next year the unemployment rate will drop below 4% for the first time since 2000, Sweet said in an interview. Working under chief economist and founder Mark Zandi, Sweet is the director of real-time economics for Moody’s Analytics and the editor-in-chief of Economy.com, the firm’s web portal for its in-depth analysis of global, national and regional economics. He is modestly upbeat about the economy, despite some of the dreadful data that’s come in recently, including the weak gross domestic product growth, the slump in auto sales, and two straight declines in retail sales. Read: Whew: U.S. economy really isn’t slowing “The hard data would tell you that the economy is very weak, but the soft data suggest that the economy was taking off,” he said. “The true health of the economy is somewhere in between.” By hard data, he refers to the reports on actual activity, such as sales volumes, prices and hiring. Soft data, by contrast, is based on surveys and includes a fair amount of subjective opinion about how consumers and business leaders feel. He dismisses the weak first-quarter GDP report, chalking it up to some unseasonable weather and the continuing inability of the statistical agencies to get the seasonal adjustment right. “The only certainties in life are death, taxes and a weak first-quarter GDP report,” he joked. One excellent reason to ignore the GDP report: Continued strong job growth averaging about 175,000 per month, considerably more than the 100,000 needed each month to absorb the increase in the working-age population, he said. “We’re not at full employment yet,” Sweet said. He thinks wage growth will keep rising, in part because accelerating investment in software and other intellectual property will boost productivity growth. Slightly higher consumer price inflation will push companies to give slightly bigger raises to make sure their workers’ purchasing power doesn’t decline. The growth in household incomes this year and next should keep the economy on track, he said. With unemployment falling into the 3% range and inflation bubbling into the 2% range, the Federal Reserve will probably raise its short-term target rate two more times this year — in June and September, Sweet said. Read: U.S. producer prices jump 0.5% in April The Fed will probably pause on rate hikes in December when it takes the first step to reduce its balance sheet, he said. He expects further rate hikes in 2018, along with steady declines in the balance sheet. In the April contest, Sweet had the most accurate forecasts among 47 forecasting teams on two of the 11 indicators we track — the consumer price index and the trade deficit. On six others — nonfarm payrolls, housing starts, durable goods orders, consumer confidence, retail sales, and industrial production — his forecasts were among the 10 most accurate. With the first four months of the year in the books, Sweet is leading the contest for the 2017 Forecaster of the Year, which has been won by Jim O’Sullivan for the last six years in a row. O’Sullivan, of High Frequency Economics, is hot on his heels. The runners up in the April contest were Richard Moody of Regions Financial, Ted Wieseman of Morgan Stanley, Jan Hatzius’s team at Goldman Sachs, and Gus Faucher, the new chief economist at PNC Financial. The forecasts MarketWatch publishes in our Economic Calendar are the median forecasts of the 15 forecasting teams that have done the best in our contest over the preceding 12 months, plus the forecast of the most recent winner of the Forecaster of the Month. Our enhanced consensus is much more accurate than the Bloomberg consensus that’s widely followed. The economists in our consensus forecast are: Jim O’Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, Spencer Staples of EconAlpha, Ryan Sweet of Moody’s Analytics, Sam Coffin at UBS, Christophe Barraud at Market Securities, Avery Shenfeld’s team at CIBC, James Sweeney’s team at Credit Suisse, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro Economics, independent forecaster Brian Jones, John Silvia’s team at Wells Fargo, Stephen Stanley of Amherst Pierpont Securities, Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics, Jan Hatzius’s team at Goldman Sachs, Brian Wesbury and Bob Stein at First Trust, and Richard Moody at Regions Financial.
