A source told Reuters that the deal, which could come as soon as this week, will entail Verizon and Yahoo sharing the liability from potential lawsuits related to the data breaches. Another person familiar with the situation said the price cut was likely to be around $250 million, a figure that Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday. A representative from Verizon declined to comment. Yahoo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “Maybe this isn’t quite as much of a discount as initially thought, but it’s at least something,” said Dave Heger, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones. Verizon hopes to combine Yahoo’s search, email and messenger assets, as well as advertising technology tools, with its AOL unit, which Verizon bought in 2015 for $4.4 billion. Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside an oversaturated wireless market. But Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo has been under scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers since disclosing the largest known data breach in history in December, months after disclosing a separate hack. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a probe into whether Yahoo should have disclosed the breaches, which occurred in 2013 and 2014, sooner, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal last month. On Wednesday, Yahoo sent a warning to users whose accounts may have been accessed by intruders between 2015 and 2016, as part of a data security issue related to the breach it disclosed in December. A person familiar with the matter said notifications have gone out to a mostly final list of users. Yahoo shares rose 1.5 percent to $45.69 in afternoon trading. Verizon shares fell 0.7 percent to $47.93. ","

,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc will introduce an unlimited data plan on Monday, its first in more than five years, in its latest effort to lure customers as competition rises between network carriers. The introductory plan, announced on Sunday, will give unlimited data to customers on smartphones and tablets on its 4G LTE network. It comes days after competitor Sprint Corp introduced a new unlimited data plan of its own. The unlimited option appears to be a change in direction for Verizon after one of the company’s top executives said last month it was not looking at unlimited products when asked by analysts whether Verizon needed to be more aggressive in the market. “We constantly look at... what’s out there. Unlimited is one of the things that some of our competition has at this point in time. That’s not something we feel the need to do,” Matthew Ellis, Verizon’s chief financial officer, told analysts during an earnings call on Jan. 24. “But as I say, we continually monitor the market and we will see where we head in the future,” he added. Verizon’s unlimited plan is $80 per month for unlimited data, talk and text for the first line with paper-free billing and autopay, and $45 per line for four lines. The company stopped offering unlimited data plans for most customers in 2011. (Story corrects pricing in paragraph 6.) ","

,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc, the No.3 U.S. wireless carrier, reported quarterly profit and revenue above estimates as promotional offers helped add more subscribers. The company has been gaining market share from rivals Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and Sprint Corp, in an oversaturated U.S. wireless market. T-Mobile had a number of promotional offers in the fourth quarter, including a free iPhone 7 offer with eligible trade-in around Black Friday. But T-Mobile could face more competition following Verizon’s announcement this week that it would reintroduce an unlimited data plan as well as from a new promotion launched earlier by Sprint. On a conference call with analysts and investors, Chief Executive Officer John Legere dismissed such concerns. “The competitive environment so far is based upon moves that others are making out of desperation,” he said. Net income rose to $390 million, or 45 cents per share, for the quarter from $297 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 23.4 percent to $10.18 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of 30 cents per share and revenue of $9.84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For 2017, T-Mobile expects branded postpaid net additions of 2.4 million to 3.4 million. Analysts said the numbers may be viewed as disappointing but noted that T-Mobile tends to give conservative forecasts at the beginning of the year. The company also expects free cash flow to grow between 45 percent to 48 percent annually for the next three years, in line with analyst estimates. Shares were roughly flat in Tuesday trading on the Nasdaq. Industry watchers have long speculated that T-Mobile and Sprint, the No. 3 and No. 4 biggest players in U.S. wireless, will combine. Asked last week about renewed merger talks with T-Mobile, Masayoshi Son, whose SoftBank Group Corp is a majority shareholder in Sprint, said he was keeping his options open. Legere said on the call in response to a question on Sprint that T-Mobile was “a very healthy growing franchise, and if we choose to, we can continue to drive tremendous shareholder value on our own or participate in various forms ... of consolidation.” T-Mobile, which had released its subscriber numbers for the quarter in January, added 933,000 postpaid phone subscribers, or those who pay monthly bills, on a net basis, in the three months ended Dec. 31. Churn, or customer defections, declined to 1.28 percent, from 1.46 percent a year ago. ","

,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"* US blue chips head for Taiwan to lock in flexible funding terms By Daniel Stanton SINGAPORE, Feb 13 (IFR) - Three US blue chips headed to Taiwan’s Formosa bond market last week in a rush to lock in flexible funding ahead of changes in local regulations and a potential shake-up in US tax rules. Verizon Communications issued a $1.475 billion 30-year non-call three bond at 4.95 percent, the largest Formosa issue of the year so far. Also last week, Apple was rumoured to be sounding investors for a potential $1 billion 30 non-call three, indicated at a yield in the 4.3 percent area, and Pfizer was heard to be eyeing the market, too. Global issuers are rushing to Taiwan before a local rule change in March that will effectively prevent them from offering securities with call dates of less than five years. However, US companies have an additional incentive to lock in the most flexible terms possible, with potential changes to the US tax code looming over the horizon. “A lot of issuers are thinking they want to get ahead of this,” said a foreign banker. “If something changes in the US tax rules, they can call back their bonds later.” Many US multinationals keep large piles of cash offshore to limit corporate tax payments and sell bonds to fund dividend payments or share buybacks. However, proposals to cut the US corporate tax rate and remove the deductibility of interest payments against income are likely to spur them to repatriate their cash and potentially reduce bond issuance. Such proposals are unlikely to become law before the end of this year, if at all, but, in the meantime, yield-hungry Taiwanese investors remain an attractive alternative source of US dollar funding. The Formosa market relies heavily on local life insurers, and foreign issuance has rocketed since 2014, when Taiwan’s Financial Services Commission reclassified Formosa bonds as domestic debt. Taiwanese insurers, which cannot invest more than 45 percent of their assets in foreign bonds, were, therefore, freed up to buy more dollar bonds listed in Taiwan. CALLING TIME Insurance investors typically prefer long maturities and the most popular tenor in the Formosa market is 30 years, but most bonds have call options, most commonly at three years. Still, the structure of Formosa bonds is about to change. Last month, the FSC said it would prohibit Taiwanese insurance companies from buying bonds with call options earlier than five years. Since insurers are, by far, the largest buyers of Formosa bonds with about an 80 percent share of all outstanding issues, according to a November estimate by asset manager PIMCO, issuers are expected to stick to non-call five structures after the new rule takes effect on March 25. That means US corporate issuers, in particular, are trying to take advantage of the short-dated call options available in the Formosa market while they can. That may also mean the mix of issuers looking to court Taiwanese investors may change after March. “I don’t think it will mean that we get fewer US corporates issuing into the Formosa market since the economics for them to issue dollars from an economic standpoint is still the most attractive,” said Rick Chan, EVP and portfolio manager, interest rate derivatives, at PIMCO. “There is a potential that it may be different names. We have seen a decrease in Formosa bond issuance from US financials with the slack being made up from Middle East issuers and other corporates. Pfizer, Apple and Vodafone are all working on potential deals this week, for example. The binding constraint will be more from the demand side.” However, another mooted rule change is expected to encourage issues from lower-rated names. Currently, it is impractical for life insurers to buy Formosa rated below Single A, as there are restrictions on how much lower-rated paper they can purchase. However, it is expected that requirement will be eased and it will soon be practical for them to buy Formosa rated BBB+ and above. That could be good news for some foreign financial issuers that want to raise capital in Taiwan, as they are now allowed to sell Tier 2 bonds there up to the same amount they have outstanding in senior bonds in the Formosa market. A head of DCM at a Taiwanese securities house said the huge expected supply of primary deals meant that investors could afford to be selective when it came to yields and industry sectors. “The market will continuously grow, while the demand still remains strong,” said the DCM head. “However, investors’ appetites for those foreign-denominated notes have almost reached their portfolio limit.” US dollar-denominated Formosa bonds tend to price in line with issues in the US dollar market, but undervalue the call option, making them relatively cheap for issuers. In theory, bonds with an embedded call option ought to pay a higher yield than those without, since issuers should pay extra for the option to redeem early and investors ought to be compensated for having their expected flow of coupon payments cut short. Investors in Taiwan and Asia, in general, have tended to take the view that, if a 30-year bond is called after three years, the extra yield over a typical three-year issue is compensation enough. Formosa bond issues are typically sized to meet demand, and investors usually buy and hold.   (Reporting by Daniel Stanton; Editing by Vincent Baby and Steve Garton) ","

,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said Friday that bidding in the wireless spectrum auction has ended at $19.6 billion, significantly less than many analysts had initially forecast. The so-called broadcast incentive spectrum auction is one of the commission’s most complex and ambitious to date and should be complete by April. The FCC said last year that 62 bidders made upfront payments to take part, including AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Dish Network Corp, T-Mobile US Inc and Comcast Corp. Of the nearly $20 billion raised, more than $6 billion will go to reduce the U.S. deficit, more than $10 billion will go to broadcasters that chose to relinquish spectrum rights, and up to $1.75 billion for other broadcasters that incur costs in changing channels. The final price for 84 megahertz of spectrum could rise above $20 billion as buyers may hike final bids for specific frequency blocks before the sale is complete. In June, the FCC said sellers had initially sought $86.4 billion for 126 megahertz of television airwaves taken from broadcasters to be sold for wireless use. Many analysts had expected broadcasters to earn substantially more in the auction, with some forecasting in 2016 $30 billion in proceeds. Twentieth-First Century Fox Inc’s Fox Television unit said this week it would receive about $350 million in proceeds from spectrum sales. Tribune Media Co said it expects $190 million in proceeds from the auction. Gray Television Inc said it expects to receive $90.8 million and Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc expects to receive $313 million. Others did not participate. E. W. Scripps Co said Friday it had opted not to take part because it thought prices were too low. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the closing of bidding is a “major milestone,” adding the spectrum will boost wireless service. “These low-band airwaves will improve wireless coverage across the country and will play a particularly important role in deploying mobile broadband services in rural areas,” Pai said. The spectrum will transition over 39 months. Some stations will transition to a new band and a new channel, while others will move off-air. Those going off the air must give at least 30 days notice. Many public TV stations also took part in the auction. FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly raised concerns about the auction. He said it was not a “failed auction” but said “significant review is necessary to understand how the FCC rules and auction design impacted the results.” ","

,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission under President Donald Trump is keeping under wraps his strategy to revise or reverse the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” rules, but emphasized he is committed to ensuring an open internet. Ajit Pai, 44, a Republican lawyer who has served as a FCC commissioner since 2012, strongly opposed former Democratic President Barack Obama administration’s 2015 net neutrality rules that reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility. “I believe, as I think most Americans do, in a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that,” Pai said in an interview in his FCC office, where several storage boxes remain to be unpacked. “Before the imposition of these Depression-era rules, we had for 20 years a bipartisan consensus on a regulatory model.” In December Pai vowed to take a “weedwacker” to unneeded rules and has not backed away from his prior criticism of net neutrality, when he again said net neutrality’s “days are numbered.” [nL1N1E21DU] The net neutrality rules bar internet access providers from slowing consumer access to web content. A federal appeals court upheld the rules last year. Internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and make investment in additional capacity less likely, while websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. Unlike Trump, Pai cannot simply issue an order doing away with the net neutrality rules, but must go through an administrative process. Pai is keeping his cards close to the vest, only saying he will mount a “careful look at the regulatory framework.” Last month, then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said reversing the net neutrality rules “is not a slam dunk” and will face the “high hurdle” of “a fact-based showing that so much has changed in just two short years that a reversal is justified.” Pai faces opposition on Capitol Hill and from many on social media to reversing net neutrality, with Democrats urging him not to favor the “big broadband barons” as one called them. “There is no problem that needs to be fixed,” said Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. “Net neutrality rules ensure those with the best ideas, not simply the best-funded ideas, have the opportunity to share their content with the world.” Pai said in 2015 that the FCC had adopted the sweeping new net neutrality rules at Obama’s behest and would result in “higher broadband prices, slower speeds, less broadband deployment, less innovation, and fewer options for American consumers.” Pai’s goal is “a modern flexible framework that gives everybody a level playing field.”Wheeler last month urged the next FCC not to “undo something that is demonstrably working” and says broadband investment has remained high. Earlier this week, a key Republican on telecommunications policy, Representative Marsha Blackburn said Congress will let the FCC “make the first move” on net neutrality. Last Friday, Pai sent letters to Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc to notify them that the FCC was closing investigations into “sponsored data” or “zero rating” programs in which mobile phone companies give customers free data for using certain video services. FCC had previously raised concerns about their data policies. “My position is the government should not be in the position of prohibiting companies in a competitive marketplace from offering free data,” Pai said. Pai has taken steps to make the FCC more transparent, including a pilot program to circulate proposals before they voted on. “A lot of involves divestment of power from the chairman’s office,” he said.

,02162017,Reuters,02092017,"Advertising sales, which accounts for half of the company’s total revenue, fell 2.8 percent to $1.80 billion partially due to fewer NFL Thursday night football games this quarter as well as lower-than-expected ratings for those games. On a call with analysts Wednesday, CBS Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves said that CBS was in talks with the NFL about new formats to speed up games to help with ratings, but he said CBS would not cut ads. “If there are ways to do advertising in different ways, we are looking at that,” Moonves said. Moonves emphasized he still views NFL as “the premier property in all of media.” CBS, which is home to popular shows such as “NCIS” and “The Big Bang Theory,” has been facing a slowdown in its advertising revenue as advertisers shift more dollars from TV to online. To address this, the New York-based broadcaster, which also owns cable network Showtime, is focused on shifting its revenue stream from advertising to streaming video providers as more viewers watch their favorites shows online. CBS said it is on track to exceed its goal of having 8 million subscribers for its online streaming video service, All Access, and its online streaming Showtime service by 2020. Overall, the company said advertising benefited in the quarter from political spending at local television stations in the wake of U.S. presidential elections late last year. The company is very close to renewing its hit, “The Big Bang Theory” for another two years, Moonves said on a post-earnings call. The company earned $1.11 per share on an adjusted basis, beating estimates of $1.10 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue fell 2 percent to $3.52 billion.

Trump vowed last Thursday to make a major tax announcement over the next few weeks, adding fuel to a rally that had stalled amid worries about the potential impact of his protectionist trade stance and a lack of clarity about other policy reforms. The S&P 500 has surged about 9 percent since Trump’s Nov. 8 election, boosted by expectations he would lower corporate taxes, ease regulations governing banks and increase infrastructure spending. Trump has also held high-profile meetings with senior executives from automakers and Silicon Valley technology companies. “Day after day, corporate executives from a variety of industries are being brought to the White House to consult with the president. Business does seem to be back in the driver’s seat, and I think that’s why people are willing to pay up a little bit more for stocks,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. Strong economic data in recent weeks has been supported by upbeat corporate results. S&P 500 companies are on track for their strongest profit growth in nine quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “What is underlying this whole Trump rhetoric is that fundamentals in the world, including the U.S., are getting better,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.

According to the telecom news website, Verizon confirmed the moves while also confirming it is increasing its activation and upgrade fees to $30 from $20. The move to get rid of two-year contracts comes at a time when most wireless carriers are scraping those plans in favor of EIPs, in which the price of the smartphone is separate than the price for wireless service. With an EIP, customers don’t get hit with interest on the phone and pay off their smartphones on a per-month basis for one, two or three years.

The fee, known as the “Broadcast TV Fee” can be anywhere from $3 to $6 a month and, according to Motley Fool, cable operators pass on the fees they have to pay local channels to rebroadcast their signals. Customers of both Charter and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) can’t waive or decline the fee even if they get rid of local channels, noted the report.

The company also added 99,000 new net FiOS wireline customers and 20,000 FiOS video customers, year-over-year increases of 6.3% and 3.2%, respectively. Verizon's stock price suffered several setbacks throughout the year, mainly due to an employee strike and news of several hacking instances at Yahoo, which Verizon is currently in the process of buying. But it was likely the company's overall stability, and its 4% dividend yield at the time, that kept investors interested in the stock. The company's slow and steady growth has been paired with its increasingly strong network position, which was shored up this past year when Verizon purchased the fiber optic company XO Communications. Going forward, Verizon's network remains strong, and the company is still a great dividend stock for long-term investors. The company's stock price has taken a bit of a hit since the beginning of the year after full-year results came out in January. Verizon finished 2016 with 114.2 million retail connections -- a 1.9 percent year-over-year increase -- while full-year revenue was down 2.7% year-over-year. Year to date, the company's stock is down more than 8%. In 2017, investors will be looking for more details on the final terms of the Yahoo deal, which is expected to close later this year, and for Verizon to successfully test its 5G network and implement its XO Communications purchase to further enhance its network.

    Why Verizon Communications Jumped 16% in 2016 -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has finally followed T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) in offering unlimited data for its customers. The company, along with rival AT&T (NYSE:T) had been a holdout in offering unlimited data largely because of how much money it makes from both overages and people buying larger plans than they actually use. In announcing the new offer via a press release, the company congratulated itself while taking a shot at T-Mobile which now offers only unlimited plans. ""We've built our network so we can manage all the activity customers undertake. Everything we've done is to provide the best experience on the best network – and we've built it for the future, not just for today,"" said Verizon Wireless President Ronan Dunne. ""We also fundamentally want you to have more choice. We're not limiting you to a single plan. If you don't need unlimited data, we still have 5 GB, S, M, and L Verizon plans that are perfect for you."" Offering unlimited of course is only one piece of the puzzle. Consumers also care about the quality of the network and perhaps most importantly how much they will pay. Verizon has become the latest carrier to offer unlimited data. Image source: Getty Images. There was a time when Verizon had a clear advantage when it came to the quality of its network. That's largely no longer true, at least when it comes to T-Mobile. In the just-released OpenSignal State of Mobile Networks: USA report T-Mobile and Verizon rate as the top two networks. The two companies tied for the top spot in both 4G download speeds and overall download speeds. Verizon took first place in ""Latency: 4G"" and ""Availability: 4G"" while T-Mobile won for ""Latency 3G"" and ""Availability: 3G."" Neither AT&T nor Sprint took first place in any category. Essentially T-Mobile and Verizon have the best networks. ""It's a draw,"" OpenSignal declares at one point in its report which ""parsed 4.6 billion measurements collected by 169,683 smartphone users in the fourth quarter of 2016 to gauge the 3G and 4G performance of national operators AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon."" It is worth noting that while Verizon and T-Mobile are the clear leaders, AT&T and Sprint are not far behind. How that translates into actual use scenarios varies based on where you live and how much/where you travel, but Sprint is not being outrageous in its commercials that claim Verizon customers are paying more for a network that's 1% better. Pricing for unlimited plans can be a bit of a moving target since Sprint and T-Mobile sometimes offer specials. It's also worth noting that the three carriers which offer unlimited plans to any customer who wants them have caveats allowing them to slow down data for the heaviest users at various times. These are the current offers as of Feb. 13, 2017: Verizon: The newest player in the unlimited space is offering one line for $80, two for $70 each ($140), three for $54 each ($162), and four for $45 a line ($180). Those prices require enrollment in auto-pay and do not include fees. AT&T: AT&T only offers unlimited data to grandfathered customers who had it before they dropped the plans and customers who bundle it with DirecTV. Sprint: The #4 wireless carrier by size has a limited-time promotion offering five lines for $90 through March 31, 2018. That breaks down to a first line for $50 a month, a second for $40, then up to three lines for free. Those prices require autopay and do not include fees. After the promotion ends customers will pay $60 for the first line, $40 for a second, then $30 for each additional line up to 5 in total. T-Mobile: T-Mobile's plans also require autopay enrollment, but unlike its rivals they are all-inclusive prices which include all fees and taxes. The company charges $70 for one line, $120 for two ($60 each), $140 for three ($46.67 each), and $160 for four ($40 each). Sprint has the lowest price, at least for a little more than a year, through its special offer. The carrier has the lowest single-line price, and the best deal on plans of up to five lines. T-Mobile comes in second when it comes to price -- though it's closer than it appears because of taxes (which vary by market) -- but its deal is not a special offer that expires. When you consider that T-Mobile ties as the top-rated network, it's probably worth it for anyone with one or two lines to go with T-Mobile, while anyone with three to five lines might consider Sprint as the savings start to pile up when you add the extra phones. What's clear is that while Verizon has joined the unlimited party, it's not offering a particularly good deal. Sprint has a much cheaper price while T-Mobile offers a better price along with a comparable network. ","

Nicholas Rossolillo,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) recently reported fourth-quarter results and outlook for the coming year disappointed investors. The report card for America's largest cell service provider demonstrates that the mobile business is getting mature. While this will continue to be Verizon's bread-and-butter, it's time for investors to focus on the other irons the company has in the fire. Image source: Verizon. Verizon's total revenue for 2016 decreased 4.3% from 2015. While the sale of equipment helped the numbers, Verizon's retail wireless and wireline businesses declined 2.7% and 2.3%, respectively. Total profit decreased 26% year-over-year. Subscriber growth in wireless missed estimates badly, with only 591,000 net additions in the fourth quarter instead of the 726,000 estimated by analysts. Management cited an increasingly competitive market for the weak results. Many customers are paying off equipment agreements and keeping their old devices in lieu of upgrading to a newer model. The slowdown in the retail wireless business, Verizon's largest segment, can be seen when comparing the year-over-year numbers. The slowdown in net additions has been accelerating. Chart by author. Data source: Verizon quarterly earnings reports. For the year ahead, the company expects the negative trends to improve. However, management said that will roughly equate into revenue and profit flat with 2016. The good news for investors is that Verizon knows this and has been leading the charge into new businesses to set the stage for future growth. Specifically, the company has been making a foray into the media business, making Internet of Things (IoT) acquisitions, and making progress on its 5G network. The company is gearing up for a new round of growth as people change the way they do business, communicate, and consume entertainment. Verizon made its first push into the media business with its purchase of AOL in 2015. Management reports they are satisfied with that new segment's progress and strides were taken in the last year to bolster it further. A pending purchase of Yahoo! was the big headline last year, but that deal is being reviewed in light of data breaches revealed late in the year. Several smaller media acquisitions were made last year as well. Among them were Complex Media, an online multimedia platform catering to young male trendsetters, and Volicon, a service that helps media companies with monitoring and compliance. The digital media arm led by AOL declined 5% in the fourth quarter due to a particularly strong comparable period last year. IoT continues to be a buzzword in the tech world, and Verizon made several moves to solidify itself as a provider of connected services in that space. Telogis and FleetMatics were both incorporated into the telematics business to provide services for connected vehicles and fleets. Verizon also bought a couple of start-ups that provide connected lighting and monitoring systems and urban Wi-Fi hubs. The IoT business grew 21% on a comparable basis in the last quarter of the year and over 60% including acquisitions. The backbone of the IoT in the years ahead is expected to be a new 5G network. Verizon is leading the way with trial tests of its yet-to-be-released wireless platform, but it is progressing toward making it a reality. The merger with fiber optic provider XO Communications is expected to be finalized this quarter and is a key part of the company's goals in densifying its current 4G LTE network and supporting the next-gen network. The vast majority of Verizon's business still comes from retail wireless and wireline business, so investors will want to keep tabs on that. However, those models are becoming stale, and it hurt the top and bottom lines last year. It's time to give increased attention to the new growth businesses Verizon has developed. Data by YCharts. It may take some time to pay off, but multimedia, the IoT, and a 5G network will be the backbone of Verizon's growth strategy going forward. In the meantime, the recent drop in share price creates a nice buying opportunity for income-oriented investors. Verizon's dividend is currently paying out 4.7%. ","
      
    Wireless Subscriber Growth Should No Longer Be the Focus for Verizon -- The Motley Fool

"Tyler Crowe, Jamal Carnette, CFA, and Sean Williams",02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's hard to go wrong investing in companies that Warren Buffett owns. His acumen for finding great long-term investments is unparalleled, and he has the track record over the years to prove it. So in the spirit of the Oracle of Omaha's brilliance, we asked three of our contributors to highlight a stock currently held in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio worth buying today. Here's why they picked oil and gas pipeline company Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), telecommunications giant Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and industrial manufacturer General Electric (NYSE:GE). Image source: Getty Images Sean Williams (Kinder Morgan): Following a pretty miserable three-year stretch, the Warren Buffett stock that looks like an intriguing buy this February is midstream giant Kinder Morgan. The rapid decline in crude oil and natural gas prices punished Kinder Morgan in 2015 and early 2016. The company, which is responsible for moving about 40% of all natural gas in the U.S., became a target of skeptics, given the high levels of debt it had built up by expanding its leading pipeline network. When commodity prices fell, there was concern that Kinder Morgan's backlog and ability to net future deals would falter. These concerns were further magnified when it cut its dividend payout by 74% in December 2015. But there are reasons to believe that its balance sheet has improved dramatically, and that it's healthier than it's been in years as a company. Kinder Morgan wound up jettisoning a number of non-core assets last year, which, when combined with its dividend cut that'll save the company more than $3 billion a year in distributions, allowed it to handily reduce its outstanding debt. Between the beginning of 2015 and the end of the third quarter of 2016, Kinder Morgan chopped about $3.9 billion off its outstanding debt load, reducing it to $38.5 billion and likely saving face with investors and credit agencies. Best of all, there's probably no need to tap equity markets, given the operating cash flow from its existing pipelines and its now reduced debt levels. The other factor to really like about Kinder Morgan is that 91% of its cash flows are fee-based in 2017, and 97% overall is fee-based or hedged. In other words, it has very little exposure to what's been a pretty volatile crude and natural gas market over the past three years. Given the long-term nature of the company's contracts, it's able to generate pretty predictable cash flow each and every quarter. With crude and natural gas prices stabilizing in recent months, and President Donald Trump seeming to favor a strong domestic energy industry, Kinder Morgan could be the perfect Buffett stock for investors to consider scooping up in February. Jamal Carnette, CFA (Verizon Communications): In 2014, when it was disclosed that Warren Buffett had purchased a stake in Verizon, the general reaction was one of bewilderment. On the surface, there were a host of red flags that would make the average value investor nervous. First off, at that time Verizon was less than a year removed from the largest corporate bond issuance ever, a balance sheet-busting $49 billion offering. Second, earlier that year Big Red had issued 1.3 billion shares, watering down existing shareholders. Finally, Verizon had averaged top-line growth of only 2.8% in the aftermath of the Great Recession. An astute financial writer (spoiler alert: It was me) summed up the purchase by asking, ""Has He Lost His Mind?"" (Second spoiler alert: no). Of course, we know Buffett is no average value investor. I also have to point out the reason for the share and debt issuance -- Verizon didn't fully own its cash-cow Verizon Wireless business. The cash was needed to buy Vodafone's 45% stake. At the time, CEO Lowell McAdam estimated that the transaction would boost earnings 10%. Since then, however, the wireless industry has become more competitive, as upstart T-Mobile has been effective at lowering prices and instituting other consumer-friendly policies that have hit industry margins. T-Mobile's market dynamic-changing run almost didn't occur. In 2011, the Federal Communications Commission rejected AT&T's bid for T-Mobile because of concerns over a concentrated market. In 2014, the FCC again disallowed another suitor, this time Sprint, from purchasing T-Mobile, in an effort to protect consumers. It's likely the new FCC will be friendlier to mergers, and Bloomberg reports that Sprint remains an interested buyer. An acquisition will not be good for consumers, but it should help alleviate pricing pressures in the wireless industry, which is something Verizon shareholders would welcome. In addition, the new FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a fierce opponent of net neutrality. As an internet service provider (ISP), Verizon is well positioned to take advantage of any watering down of these rules. Verizon now owns a host of digital properties and could better take advantage of both content and delivery if the net-neutrality rules are repealed. There will be losers for sure, though, most notably small bloggers and digital publishers, as power would shift to ISPs and larger publishers. Still, a recent poor quarter from Verizon gives long-term investors a great entry point. Currently, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14 times earnings with a dividend yield of 4.7%. For value investors in the vein of Buffett, Verizon looks appealing at these levels. Tyler Crowe (General Electric): Buffett isn't a huge fan of technology stocks. Yet there's one company in his portfolio that's making a big bet on one of the hottest technology trends today: the Internet of Things. Sure, General Electric's developing Predix analytics platform and cloud-based services aren't the kind of technologies you and I will use every day, but its industrial applications will probably have a profound impact on how we operate machinery for decades to come. Predix, and General Electric's more broad strategy of creating an Industrial Internet of Things, is looking to completely change the way we think about things such as maintenance and operational efficiency. As the software platform's name suggests, it's able to predict maintenance issues before they happen, and run systems such as power generators at rates that optimize efficiency thanks to remote sensing and some serious cloud-computing capacity. This ability has been shown to save GE customers millions in maintenance costs, which makes it such a compelling business segment for GE. Management estimates that its Predix software and data-analytics business segment will bring in $15 billion in annual revenue by 2020. This business has also been shown to be a much higher-profit-margin business than its typical manufactured products are. If this business segment can achieve these lofty goals, then things will be looking pretty good for General Electric investors. I'm sure that when Buffett made his initial investment in the company, Predix wasn't really part of the equation. Now that it is, though, it should give him all the more reason to hang on to this stock. It also makes GE a compelling investment for anyone else today. ","
      
    3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in February -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The technology sector isn't always the best place for investment stability, nor are new technology trends ever much of a safe investment. But it doesn't have to be this way. The Internet of Things (IoT) is ushering in a massive wave of technological changes -- nearly 50 billion things will be connected to the IoT by 2020 -- and there are three companies at the forefront of this $7 trillion market that should remain steady, long-term investments: Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Image source: Getty Images. Verizon is stalwart dividend stock that has plenty of long-term potential in the IoT. The company already dominates the wireless network space despite cutthroat competition from AT&T and T-Mobile, and it's only getting stronger. Verizon is making early investments in 5G networks that should give the company an edge over its competitors in the IoT network space, much like the company's early push into 4G kept it ahead of the competition. Verizon calls 5G the ""foundation for creating more internet-connected devices"" and says that it will use the network to bring traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters, and other city systems online. Over the next few months, the company plans on rolling out commercial 5G field tests in a few locations. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said at an investor conference in December that he believes the company is two to three years ahead of the competition for 5G because of its early tests and the company's recent purchase of the fiber-optic network company XO Communications. 5G will allow new types of faster-than-ever device connections, and Verizon's early mover advantage could pay off down the road. Cisco is a perfect example of a company that will plug away in its respective field without offering investors much drama -- and at the same time provide a nice 3.3% dividend yield to boot. Cisco has been talking about the IoT for quite some time, but one of biggest moves came early last year when the company announced it was buying Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion. Jasper is a cloud-based IoT service platform that allows enterprise and service customers to ""launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale."" In short, Jasper allows companies to bring nearly any device online (think cars or jet engines) and then manage those connections through its proprietary software. Jasper brings with it 3,500 enterprise customers from around the world that have devices running on 27 service providers. And Cisco said that it will be able to add to Jasper's services with its own enterprise Wi-Fi, IoT security solutions, and advanced analytics. With Jasper, Cisco transitions further into the the software-as-a-service (SaaS) market that brings recurring revenue, and allows the company to rely a little less on the traditionally cyclical hardware market. Alphabet and its subsidiaries have been extremely aggressive in the IoT space, and given the company's massive market size and its quarterly revenues north of  $26 billion, this is certainly a company investors don't need to babysit. Most of Alphabet's IoT opportunities stem from Google, which is already a leader in the connected home space with Google Home and Nest Labs. By having a slew of IoT devices for the home, along with an embedded smart assistant in Google Home, the company is helping to lead the way in IoT home connections. But one of Alphabet's biggest IoT pushes right now comes from a company called Waymo, which was recently spun out of Google. Waymo is the product of years of research and real-world testing of self-driving cars and Google is looking to the company to now stand on its own and start generating revenue. Waymo has partnered with Fiat Chrysler to bring 100 self-driving minivans to to the roadways to begin testing an autonomous driving service. The company is likely still years away from bringing in any significant revenue for Google, but it's clear that under Alphabet's umbrella self-driving tech is a big part of the company's IoT plans. On top of that, other companies under Alphabet are exploring IoT possibilities, like using nanoparticles to find diseases in the bloodstream, by pairing them to wearable tech devices. Investors looking for steady companies shouldn't overlook the massive opportunities that the IoT has to offer. Nearly 50 billion things will be connecting the internet in just a few years and the IoT market has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. The three stocks above are all big tech names that are tapping into the IoT's potential in their own way, offering investors growth opportunities on top of stable existing businesses. ","
      
    3 Internet of Things Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. We're just over a month into 2017, so let's look at how the Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio has done thus far. Berkshire itself is almost completely flat for the year, down 0.09% as of this writing, but some of the company's stock holdings have done quite well. Specifically, five of Berkshire's stocks have gained 10% or more over the first five weeks of the year. Company Stock Symbol Share Price (2/7/2017) YTD Performance Liberty Media (A Shares) LBTYA $35.54 +16.2% Moody's Corp. MCO $107.06 +13.6% Apple AAPL $131.53 +13.5% Charter Communications CHTR $323.37 +12.3% Visa V $85.78 +10% Performance and share prices as of market close on 2/7/2017. Image Source: Getty Images. Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LBTYK) has been Berkshire's biggest winner thus far in 2017, thanks to impressive growth in its European markets. The company expects the growth to continue as it speeds up its U.K. build activity and makes major investments in its business there. In addition, the company has been aggressively repurchasing its shares, especially in the wake of the Brexit sell-off last year. Ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) has steadily climbed so far in 2017, partially because of its announcement that it had resolved pending civil claims with the Justice Department, 21 states, and D.C. Not only were the claims resolved faster than many experts expected, but the cost to the company will be significantly less than many expected. In part, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) rally has been due to its strong results from the holiday shopping season. For the quarter, Apple's revenue of $78.4 billion was as high as it has ever been, and the company's earnings and revenue both handily exceeded expectations. Perhaps most importantly, Apple's service revenue (which includes sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and others) grew by 18% year-over-year. While this accounts for just 9% of the company's results, it is rapidly becoming an important revenue stream to the company. Furthermore, Apple expects revenue to continue to climb in the current quarter, and CEO Tim Cook said that the company is ""excited"" about the products in its pipeline. In Charter Communications' (NASDAQ:CHTR) case, the reason for the strong stock performance wasn't necessarily due to strong growth or other great business metrics. Rather, the stock spiked in mid-January on rumors that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was considering an acquisition of the company. Many think that the deal is unlikely to happen, for reasons my colleague Anders Bylund explained in a recent article, but the rumors have not faded just yet. In its latest quarterly report, Visa (NYSE:V) reported impressive year-over-year earnings growth of 7%, and revenue growth of 25% thanks to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Service revenue, data processing revenue, and international transaction revenue all soared, and while operating expenses grew by 16%, the company still posted impressive growth. For fiscal year 2017, the company expects net revenue growth of 16%-18%, and EPS growth in the ""mid-teens"" on an adjusted basis. It's fair to say that Visa's fiscal 2017 -- the most recent quarter was the first of its fiscal year -- is going well so far. To be clear, I'm not saying that you should buy these, or any other stocks simply because Warren Buffett owns them. However, Berkshire invested in each of these companies for a reason, and we can learn valuable investing lessons from these purchases, as well as from how the stocks perform over time. Having said that, I would have to call Apple the best buy on this list right now, as it still trades for a compelling valuation even after the recent rally, and I tend to gravitate toward undisputed leaders in their markets.

    Warren Buffett's Best Stocks of 2017 So Far -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Matthew Frankel, CFP",02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. According to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) latest SEC filing, Warren Buffett and company had an active fourth quarter in 2016. After sitting on a company record $85 billion cash hoard at the end of the third quarter, and having said that Berkshire spent $12 billion on common stocks in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, investors have been wondering what Berkshire has been up to. Here's the answer. While we don't necessarily know the reasoning behind Berkshire's latest investments, or whether they were initiated by Warren Buffett himself or one of his trusted stock pickers, we do know what changed in Berkshire's portfolio during the fourth quarter. Here are the most notable buys: Image Source: Getty Images. 1. Apple -- Berkshire already owned Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), although the company's $2 billion stake wasn't a large amount by Berkshire's standards. During the fourth quarter, Berkshire's Apple stake nearly quadrupled to about 57 million shares, which represent more than 1% of all the outstanding Apple stock. It's interesting to note that Buffett's stock-pickers were the ones who initiated the Apple investment, but given the size of the increase, the latest Apple addition could have come from Buffett himself. This investment did not surprise me at all. I've written before how Apple still represented a compelling bargain at the price levels it was trading for during the fourth quarter, and that Berkshire should take advantage. Well, apparently, management agreed. 2. Airlines -- Berkshire surprised many investors when it revealed its third-quarter 2016 investments in several airline stocks. After all, Buffett has spoken out against airline stocks as investments several times in his career, During the third quarter, Berkshire invested in American Airlines, Delta, and United Continental, and increased its stake in all three during the fourth quarter. At the same time the initial airline stakes were revealed, Buffett also said he made an investment in Southwest Airlines. He didn't specify the amount at the time, but we now know it's a stake worth more than $2 billion. 3. Monsanto -- Berkshire revealed a new stake in Monsanto, of about 8 million shares valued at about $872 million. Monsanto currently trades for about $109 per share, and the company plans to sell itself to Bayer for $128 per share. If the deal goes through, Buffett stands to make a quick profit, but the market doesn't seem convinced at this point. 4. Sirius XM -- The final major change was the addition of a nearly 167 million-share position in satellite radio operator Sirius XM. Granted, because of the company's $4.80 share price as of this writing, this stake translates into a relatively small (for Berkshire) $800 million investment. 1. Wal-Mart -- Buffett has been gradually trimming his Wal-Mart stake for some time, but he sold a substantial number of his remaining shares. Berkshire's investment in the retail giant has been cut from about 13 million shares to 1.4 million. As I've mentioned, we don't know the reasoning, but my guess is that the success of online retailers like Amazon has changed the competitive landscape in a way Buffett doesn't like. 2. Verizon -- Berkshire sold nearly all of its 15 million shares of Verizon during the quarter. Since Berkshire also unloaded its AT&T stake earlier in 2016, this didn't come as a huge surprise. 3. Kinder Morgan -- Buffett bought about 20 million shares of Kinder Morgan in early 2016, and sold his entire position during the fourth quarter. Kinder Morgan has nearly doubled from its early 2016 lows, so this could be a matter of the valuation simply not looking attractive to Buffett anymore. 4. Deere -- Just like Kinder Morgan, Deere has rallied sharply, up by about 43% over the past year alone. So, while we don't know for sure, this sale could potentially be due to a valuation issue as well. You shouldn't necessarily follow Buffett's moves. For one thing, by the time we hear about what Buffett is doing, it can be a completely different market. Since the fourth quarter ended, the S&P has risen by more than 4%, and some of the stocks Buffett has bought have risen even higher than that. Apple, for example, has risen by nearly 17% since the end of 2016, and Apple was trading even cheaper for much of the quarter. While I don't necessarily think Apple is too expensive to buy right now, it's fair to say that Buffett and company likely got a far better deal on their Apple shares than investors could get now. ^SPX data by YCharts ","

                                   said Sunday it will start selling unlimited data plans again this week, about 5 1/2 years after dumping that offering. The plans aren't much pricier than its limited plans and are competitively priced with offerings from the other major carriers. On a Jan. 24 conference call following its disappointing fourth-quarter report, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis responded to an analyst’s question about whether unlimited plans would be brought back on the table, given the recent aggressive marketing of such plans by its competitors, by saying: “That’s not something we feel the need to do,” according to a transcript provided by FactSet.

On a conference call on Oct. 20 after third-quarter results, then CFO Francis Shammo said the impact of competitors’ unlimited plans lasted only a few weeks, so there were still no plans to move in that direction. Analyst Mike McCormack at Jefferies Group said he believes Verizon’s sudden shift in strategy was “dictated by market conditions,” such as T-Mobile US.

Verizon’s stock slumped 0.9% in afternoon trade, paring earlier losses of as much as 1.8%. Among its rivals, shares of T-Mobile U.S. shed 2.7%, of Sprint slid 1.4% and of AT&T dropped 1.9%. Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said he believes Verizon’s reversal was “clearly in response to a more competitive environment,” is an indication that Verizon acknowledges that revenue growth will remain “anemic,” and that Verizon will have to go “outside the industry” to find growth. “As the industry adopts unlimited data plans, revenue growth should prove elusive,” Kvaal wrote. Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery said what he’s most surprised about, is that after being adamant in recent years about not offering unlimited plans, Verizon has gone “all in” with a full nationwide rollout with full high-definition video. “It seems Verizon has decided that it needed to step up the level of competitive intensity,” Flannery wrote. “Weak subscriber trends and customer demands for hassle free data plans likely drove this aggressive move.” Meanwhile, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said Verizon’s move sends a “very strong signal” about the strength in its network, and puts Verizon “back in the conversation” for new users. “This announcement is significant as it offers a ‘fightback’ moment for the company,” Fritzsche wrote. Fritzsche said email exchanges with Verizon management indicated there was no change to the company’s 2017 outlook, which implies that this unlimited plan was in the works for a while, despite recent management comments to the contrary. Verizon’s stock has lost 3.1% over the past 12 months, while shares of T-Mobile have soared 73%, of Sprint have more than tripled, of AT&T have climbed 11% and the S&P 500 index

Tomi Kilgore,02162017,MarketWatch,02092017,"Published: Feb 9, 2017 9:02 a.m. ET VALLEY COTTAGE, New York, Feb 09, 2017 (PR Newswire Europe via COMTEX) -- VALLEY COTTAGE, New York, February 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Businesses across several industrial verticals are actively adopting IT-as-a-service (ITaaS) models for improving their operations. With the soaring demand for ITaaS operational models, the scope for incorporating B2B telecommunications is also extending substantially among varied businesses and enterprises. A recent research conducted by Future Market Insights projects that the global demand for B2B telecommunication [http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/b2b-telecommunication-market ] will be largely emanating from the BFSI sector and media & entertainment industry.  According to Future Market Insights' report, the global revenues from B2B telecommunication surpassed an estimated US$ 30 billion in 2016. By the end of 2026, the global B2B telecommunication market is projected to be valued at US$ 107.47 billion, registering expansion at a 13.6% CAGR. More than one-fourth of the global B2B telecommunication revenues throughout the forecast period will be accounted by the BFSI industrial vertical, which will amount to more than US$ 27 billion by the end of 2026. Government and administrative bodies, and healthcare organisations such as hospitals and medical research institutes will also considered lucrative industrial verticals for B2B telecommunication, procuring a combined global market value share of nearly 30% by the end of forecast period. Growth in B2B telecommunication revenues from the media & entertainment industry is predicted to be at a faster pace - with a CAGR of 14.7%.

While cloud-based B2B telecommunication services currently account for half of the global market revenues, their revenue share is expected to drop over the period of next ten years. Increasing adoption of unified communication and collaboration solutions is predicted to partly instrument the dip in cloud services' global market contribution. By 2026, nearly US$ 25 billion revenues are projected to be harvested globally from sales of unified B2B telecommunication services. Furthermore, the demand for VoIP services, WAN solutions and M2M communication solutions is also expected to grow at steady rate over the next decade.

Surging adoption of cloud and VoIP services by US-based businesses has been assessed as the key attributor for growing sales of B2B telecommunication services in North America. Although, B2B telecommunication revenues in North America will increase at a 15.3% CAGR. On the other hand, the B2B telecommunication market in Asia Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) region is projected to register rampant expansion at the highest CAGR of 17.3%. By 2026-end, the APEJ B2B telecommunication businesses will dominate the global B2B telecommunication market with 28.5% global revenue share. Comparatively, the B2B telecommunication market in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East & Africa (MEA) region will incur sluggish expansion over the forecast period. Japan's contribution to the global B2B telecommunication market value is estimated to be over US$ 15 billion by the end of 2026, which will be approximately US$ 3 billion higher than the value of Western Europe's B2B telecommunication market.

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"The closing of the deal, which was first announced in July, had been delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from two data breaches that Yahoo disclosed last year. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier had been trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the agreement following the attacks. Verizon and Yahoo signed the deal on Sunday evening after weeks of talks that included calls with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and a meeting between Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam and Yahoo director Tom McInerney in New York earlier this month to agree on the amount of the price reduction, a person involved in the talks said. The two sides had an agreement in principle about a week earlier that included a liability sharing agreement, something that Verizon decided early on that it needed to reach a deal. Verizon conducted brand studies and found that Yahoo’s reputation was holding up after the hacks, the person said. The company decided to proceed in part because it continued to believe that the deal made strategic sense and that users were loyal and engaged. The companies said on Tuesday they expect the deal to close in the second quarter. The data breach may delay some integration of Yahoo with Verizon after the closing, the person said. The deal brings to Verizon Yahoo’s more than 1 billion users and a wealth of data it can use to offer more targeted advertising. Verizon will combine Yahoo’s advertising technology tools as well as its search, email and messenger assets with its AOL unit, purchased for $4.4 billion in 2015. Verizon’s shares rose 0.3 percent to $49.33 in afternoon trading, while Yahoo’s shares were up 0.8 percent at $45.48. Under the amended terms, Yahoo and Verizon will split cash liabilities related to some government investigations and third-party litigation related to the breaches. Yahoo, however, will continue to be responsible for liabilities from shareholder lawsuits and SEC investigations. Yahoo said in December that data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest breach in history. This followed the company’s disclosure in September that at least 500 million accounts were affected in another breach in 2014. ","

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Wednesday it would offer its high-speed wireless 5G network to certain customers in 11 U.S. cities in the first half of 2017. Verizon will begin pilot testing 5G “pre-commercial services” in cities, including Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, Seattle and Washington, D.C. The company had said last July that it laid out plans to conduct trials for its 5G network this year. New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and up to maybe 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks, with the potential to connect at least 100 billion devices with download speeds that can reach 10 gigabits per second. AT&T Inc said in January that it planned to test its high-speed wireless 5G network for customers of its online streaming television service, DirecTv Now, in Austin, Texas. ","

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"SoftBank has not yet approached Deutsche Telekom to discuss any deal because the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has imposed strict anti-collusion rules that ban discussions between rivals during an ongoing auction of airwaves. After the auction ends in April, the two parties are expected to begin negotiations, the sources told Reuters this week. Two and a half years ago, SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T-Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators. That deal would have put SoftBank in control of the merged company, with Deutsche Telekom becoming a minority shareholder. T-Mobile was worth around $30 billion at the time, but its market value has since risen to more than $50 billion as it overtook Sprint as the No. 3 wireless carrier by subscribers. Sprint’s market value is around $36 billion, roughly the same as in 2014. Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges has said in recent months that the German company is no longer willing to part with T-Mobile, prompting SoftBank to explore a new strategy towards a potential combination, the people said. Deutsche Telekom owns about 65 percent of T-Mobile. While SoftBank is still open to discussing other options, it is now willing to surrender control of Sprint and retain a minority stake in a merger with T-Mobile, the sources said. They asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. The Reuters report sent shares of T-Mobile surging as much as 7.9 percent before they eased back to close up 5.5 percent at $63.92. Shares of Sprint ended 3.3 percent higher at $9.30. Investors have said a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, ranked third and fourth respectively, would still face antitrust challenges, but made strategic sense as the industry moves to fifth-generation wireless technology. Carriers will need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade to 5G networks that promise to be 10 times to 100 times faster than current speeds. SoftBank, Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile all declined to comment. “We may buy, we may sell. Maybe a simple merger, we may be dealing with T-Mobile, we may be dealing with totally different people, different company,” SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told analysts on the company’s latest quarterly earnings call earlier this month. Dish declined to comment and Comcast did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under CEO John Legere, T-Mobile has rolled out unlimited data plans and international roaming packages. Combined with aggressive marketing, this has boosted T-Mobile customer base at the expense of its rivals. T-Mobile said it had 71.5 million total customers while Sprint had 59.5 million at the end of 2016. T-Mobile is now almost as big as Deutsche Telekom’s German business. “We are not in the mood of selling the business,” Hoettges told investors last November. While Sprint’s customer base has also grown under CEO Marcelo Claure and financials have improved, the growth was primarily driven by heavy price discounts. Despite new investment, the company’s network is still viewed by many consumers as weaker than its rivals. Reuters could not determine how much of a premium SoftBank may want Deutsche Telekom to pay for control of Sprint. Barclays analysts wrote in a note in December that a merger of T-Mobile and Sprint could result in $25 billion to $30 billion in synergies but said, “it is not imminently clear to us that the various regulatory agencies would reverse course having already blessed the outcome of a four-player market.” The FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice sent strong messages in 2014 that they did not want Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile to merge among themselves. Since then, AT&T acquired satellite television provider DirecTV and signed an agreement to buy media giant Time Warner Inc TWX.N, though that deal is still under regulatory review and has attracted criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. Verizon has also been exploring other acquisitions. Antitrust experts said it was difficult to predict how the Trump administration would view a T-Mobile-Sprint merger since key antitrust appointments at the Justice Department have not been made. It is also not clear how such a combination would be viewed by the FCC, whose new chairman Ajit Pai is viewed as more business-friendly than his predecessor. “I am of the camp that that will not happen even in a Trump administration,” Christopher Marangi, co-chief investment officer at GAMCO Investors Inc, said on the prospects of a T-Mobile-Sprint combination. “That kind of merger means lots of job cuts in the U.S.” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said price wars between Sprint and T-Mobile have driven down overall wireless prices for consumers. “Antitrust regulators could well argue that this is precisely the dynamic they would want to preserve,” Moffett added. Son has said he expects his company to benefit from Trump’s promised deregulation of the U.S. economy. After meeting Trump in early December, Son pledged to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the United States. ","

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of Frontier Communications Corp. (Frontier, NYSE: FTR) and its  subsidiaries to 'BB-' from 'BB'. The Rating Outlook remains Negative. Additionally, Fitch has affirmed the first mortgage bonds at Frontier Southwest  Inc. and has revised the long-term issue ratings of Frontier and other  subsidiaries as listed at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The downgrade reflects lower than anticipated EBITDA due to weak revenue and  subscriber trends that, when coupled with low free cash flow (FCF) generation,  have resulted in a slower deleveraging path. Frontier will need additional time  to deleverage as it incorporates the Verizon assets into its operations and to  stabilize revenue and subscriber trends in its legacy and new markets. Fitch now  anticipates gross leverage of 4.3x at year-end 2018, versus 3.8x by year-end  2017. The expected range is more reflective of a 'BB-' rating. Frontier's Rating Outlook is Negative, as Frontier is not expected to reach  Fitch's leverage threshold of 4.2x-4.3x for the current rating until  approximately the end of 2018. Improved Scale, FCF Prospects   Frontier nearly doubled in size after acquiring Verizon Communications Inc.'s  wireline properties in California, Texas and Florida (the Verizon transaction)  in April 2016. Pro forma consolidated revenue increases to approximately $10  billion from $5.6 billion in 2015. Fitch believes Frontier's enhanced scale  should lead to improved FCF, defined as net cash provided by operating  activities less capex and dividends, over time. The acquisition is not expected  to require material additional capital spending given past network upgrades by  Verizon. Operational Challenges Pressure Revenue Challenges faced by Frontier at the close of the Verizon transaction resulted in  elevated subscriber churn and weaker than expected revenue. Frontier anticipated  slower subscriber gross additions as a result of the company's decision to  temporarily suspend marketing activities during the first half of 2016. However,  the company faced additional, unexpected headwinds during the second and third  quarters of 2016 after onshoring its call centers. Although the call center  issues appear to have subsided, Fitch believes it will take additional time for  marketing efforts to ramp up and stabilize subscriber gross addition trends. Subsidiary Debt Ratings The 'RR1' Recovery Rating assigned to the approximately $850 million of  outstanding subsidiary debt reflects its structural seniority to all of the  parent debt. Of this amount, $100 million is secured and the remainder  unsecured. The 'RR2' assigned to the secured revolver and secured term loans  reflects the potential limitations in value of Frontier North as the only source  of collateral security, including potential revolver drawings (per Fitch's  approach), if cash flows are stressed. In addition, Frontier North has $200  million of unsecured debt that is structurally senior to the equity pledge  providing security to the parent secured debt. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Frontier include: -- Consolidated revenues rising to just under $10 billion at the end of 2017,  reflecting a full year of revenue contribution from the Verizon wireline  properties. Fitch expects Frontier to slowly regain its footing during 2017  following weak revenue trends after the close of the Verizon transaction; -- Lower EBITDA from elevated customer churn largely offsets the $1 billion of  annualized cost synergies realized by Frontier in 2Q16, resulting in EBITDA  margins of 40% during 2017;  -- Capex around $1.3 billion in 2017. Fitch's assumption reflects capital  intensity of 12.5%, and includes additional capital spending for CAF II, and to  a lesser extent, integration;  -- Cash taxes are expected to be a refund of $100 million to $110 million in  2016, and minimal in 2017 as a result of the tax-basis step-up from the Verizon  transaction and bonus depreciation. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will use gross leverage versus net leverage going forward, comparable to  most Fitch-rated companies across the telecommunications sector. Fitch will take  into consideration any prefunding of maturing debt on a pro forma basis if  necessary. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action would likely coincide with: --Gross leverage sustained above 4.2x-4.3x as a result of weaker than expected  operating trends, shareholder-friendly activities or additional material  acquisitions; --While not expected, a return to mid-single-digit declines in revenue. Rating concerns would increase if Frontier's leverage (as defined by Fitch) is  not below 4.2x-4.3x by the end of 2018. A positive rating action would likely coincide with: --Gross leverage sustained below 3.7x-3.8x; --FCF margins sustained in the mid- to high-single digits. LIQUIDITY Manageable Maturities Upcoming principal repayments are manageable and amount to $509 million and $733  million during 2017 and 2018, respectively. Fitch expects Frontier to rely on  its revolver and the capital markets to refinance upcoming maturities until FCF  improves. Frontier has some capacity under its covenants to issue secured debt,  which could be a way for the company to refinance upcoming maturities and reduce  annual interest expense.  Improving Financial Flexibility Anticipated Financial flexibility is expected to strengthen in step with improvement in FCF.  Pressured EBITDA, heavy integration spending prior to the close of the Verizon  transaction, and sustained dividend payments resulted in a FCF deficit of $711  million at the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2016. However, Fitch expects FCF will  be positive, albeit minimal, in 2017 as the majority of integration costs have  subsided. Fitch also expects FCF margins will improve to the mid-single digits  over the forecast horizon. Frontier's liquidity position was adequate at the end  of Sept. 30, 2016, supported by $311 million of cash and full availability under  its $750 million  (RCF).  The $750 million senior secured RCF is in place until May 2018. Management  stated it is looking to renew and extend the revolver in the coming year. The  facility is available for general corporate purposes but may not be used to fund  dividend payments. The main financial covenant in Frontier's secured facilities  requires the maintenance of net debt-to-EBITDA of 4.5x or less. Net debt is  defined as total debt less cash exceeding $50 million. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded the ratings and maintained the Negative Outlook as follows:  Frontier Communications Corp. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --$750 million senior secured revolving credit facility due 2018 to 'BB/RR2'  from 'BB+/RR2'; --$1.6 billion senior secured term loan due 2021 to 'BB/RR2' from 'BB+/RR2'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures to 'BB-/RR4' from 'BB/RR4'.  Frontier North Inc. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --Senior unsecured debentures to 'BB/RR1' from 'BB+/RR1'. Frontier West Virginia Inc. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --Senior unsecured debentures to 'BB/RR1' from 'BB+/RR1'. Frontier California Inc. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --Senior unsecured debentures to 'BB/RR1' from 'BB+/RR1'. Frontier Florida LLC --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --Senior unsecured debentures to 'BB/RR1' from 'BB+/RR1'. Frontier Southwest Inc. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'. Fitch has affirmed the following long-term issue rating: Frontier Southwest Inc. --First mortgage bonds at 'BB+/RR1'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

Donna Fuscaldo,02232017,Investopedia,02162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs One of the knocks on T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) is that it doesn’t have the same network coverage as rival Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), but judging from what T-Mobile had to say when it reported fourth-quarter results, that gap is narrowing and could close even more this year. As part of T-Mobile’s earnings presentation, it showed two maps showing its current network coverage and where it expects to be by the end of the year. While there are a lot of areas—particularly in Montana, Wisconsin and West Virginia—that won't get T-Mobile 4G LTE coverage by the end of the year, the same map shows coverage pretty much all over the country. According to T-Mobile, 4G LTE coverage currently reaches 314 million people, which is up from zero just four years ago. T-Mobile is forecasting coverage of 320 million  by the end of the year.  The company said it plans on using new technology to improve connection speeds and has been re-farming existing older spectrum. “At the end of Q4 2016, approximately 70% of spectrum was being used for 4G LTE compared to 52% at the end of Q4 2015,” said T-Mobile. “The company expects to continue to re-farm spectrum currently committed to 2G and 3G technologies.” (See also: T-Mobile Posts Q4 Results That Beat Street Views.) For Verizon, a narrowing of the gap between network coverage can’t be welcome news. With T-Mobile rolling out aggressive plans and promotions, Verizon can no longer ignore the third-place carrier. That was evident earlier this week when Verizon caved and announced an unlimited data plan after avoiding them for several . years. Earlier this month, OpenSignal, a research firm that tracks coverage and performance of mobile operators around the world, said in its ""State of Mobile Networks: USA"" report that T-Mobile is narrowing the coverage gap against Verizon. OpenSignal, which drew upon 4.6 billion measurements, found Verizon’s LTE signal was available 88.2% of the time, placing it in the lead among the big four U.S. carriers. T-Mobile, however, is closing the gap, with its 4G availability less than 2 percentage points behind Verizon in the fourth quarter. OpenSignal also found T-Mobile and Verizon are neck and neck in terms of speed. Six months ago T-Mobile was in the lead, but thanks to upgrades of its 4G network Verizon was able to catch up. ​ ",T-Mobile 4G Network Coverage Gap Narrowing | Investopedia

(CHTR), the second-place cable TV operator, was able to post fourth-quarter results that easily surpassed Wall Street views. For the period ended Dec. 31, Charter reported net income of $454 million, or $1.67 a share, which compares to a loss of $122 million or $1.21 a share in the year-earlier fourth quarter. Analysts, according to FactSet had expected Charter to weigh in with earnings of $1.05 a share. Revenue of $10.28 billion was also higher than the analyst consensus for revenue of $10.23 billion. During the quarter, Charter said it added 345,000 customers, but it lost 51,000 on the video side. In its residential business, Charter said video revenue increased 1.9% while internet revenue increased 13.3% and revenue from its voice business declined 0.5% from last year’s fourth quarter. Charter recently acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Cable, which expands its footprint in the broadband and cable markets. (See also: Charter and TWC Receive FTC Merger Approval.) The decline in video subscribers comes at a time when countless consumers are cutting the cord on their set-top boxes, favoring streaming video content that doesn't require a costly device. There are fears in the marketplace cable companies are going to lose more customers to over-the-top streaming video services. “Since the close of our transactions in May, we have been managing the complicated process of integrating three different companies with over 26 million customers and 90 thousand employees. Despite the complexity, our integration is going well. We also continued to grow in 2016, with pro forma customer growth of nearly 5%, revenue growth of 7%, and double digit adjusted EBITDA growth,” said Tom Rutledge, chairman and CEO of Charter, in a press release announcing fourth-quarter results. “In 2017, we remain focused on applying our growth oriented operating strategy across our new footprints, driving more customer satisfaction, growth, and shareholder value.” During the quarter, speculation has abounded that Charter could be a takeout target for one of the telecom players looking to expand more into video. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is seen as the most likely suitor with Chief Executive Lowell McAdam expressing interest in a deal. While Charter's Rutledge has brushed off calls for Charter to buy a content company, he didn’t dismiss the idea of a deal with another cable company.

Brian Stoffel,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it comes to telecom stocks, this is the ultimate battle. In AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), we have a combined market share of over 65% of America's wireless phone subscribers and two battle-tested dividend payers. But which is the better stock to buy today, especially for retirees looking for safe and reliable income? We can't answer that question with 100% certainty, but we can approach the question from three different angles in an attempt to get an idea for what we're most comfortable with. Image source: Getty Images. This is, in my humble opinion, the most important thing for any beginning investor to understand. A company's sustainable competitive advantage -- often referred to as its ""moat"" -- is the most important thing to understand. In its simplest form, a moat is what keeps customers coming back year after year and keeps competitors at bay for decades. But because this competition pits the American wireless duopoly against itself, that's no longer a differentiator. Nor is market share a key differentiator. According to Statista, Verizon owns 34.9% of the market, while AT&T clocks in with 32.4%. Verizon's decision to buyout Vodafone's share of Verizon Wireless helped to solidify this position. And it's important to note that both of these players are transitioning from being traditional telecoms to owning content and content platforms. AT&T has merged or announced mergers with both Time Warner and DIRECTV. Verizon has done the same with AOL, among others. These are major moves that will help put a moat around both companies, but, again, they don't really help us differentiate the two. Telecom investors can't be blamed for wanting cash to be returned to them in the form of dividends. But there are limits to paying out dividends. Tough economic times hit, and when they do, it's important to have cash on hand. Given the debt-heavy nature of telecoms, this is especially important. Here's how AT&T and Verizon stack up in terms of financial fortitude. And remember, AT&T is valued at roughly 25% larger than Verizon. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow AT&T $5.8 billion $114 billion $13.0 billion $16.9 billion Verizon $3.5 billion $105 billion $13.6 billion $5.7 billion Data source: Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Cash includes cash, short-, and long-term investments. There are a few caveats here. Obviously, both have huge debt loads versus not too much cash. That's pretty common with telecoms. And the acquisitions of Yahoo!, AOL, Verizon Wireless, DIRECTV, and Time Warner all help add to the debt levels of the duo. But when it comes to cash flow, there's a clear winner: AT&T. Verizon just reported a pretty brutal quarter that saw free cash flow come in at negative $600 million. While I don't expect Verizon to allow this trend to continue for long, it allows us to declare a clear winner for now. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout AT&T 15 15 1.7 4.7% 66% Verizon 13 36 3.2 4.7% 161% Data source: SEC filings, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Here again, we have a clear winner. Verizon's low free cash flow once again rears its ugly head into the equation. Over the past 12 months, the company has paid out more in dividends than it has been able to keep in its pockets. AT&T, on the other hand, has a very healthy dividend right now. Those 4.7% yields, while equivalent on paper, are of very different sustainability levels. So there you have it. AT&T is the clear winner. While I have no doubt that Verizon's numbers will eventually improve, AT&T cash flow and dividend payment are in a much healthier place right now -- and its stock seems to be offering a fair value given all of the information we have. Retirees looking for solid dividend stocks would do themselves a favor to investigate AT&T even further. ","

In the not too distant future, 5G networks will bring faster speeds, less latency, and more coverage to wireless consumers across the United States. 5G is shorthand for the fifth generation of mobile networks. It will be the next wireless standard implemented beyond the current 4G protocol most American wireless consumers enjoy today. The benefits will be immense and immediately recognizable. Data rates for 5G are expected to be 10 times faster than 4G and LTE systems, with download speeds as fast as 10Gbps (gigabits per second). 5G will connect the internet of things at speeds 10 times faster than 4G. Image source: Verizon Communications Inc. For a little perspective of how significant this upgrade is, consider this example provided by Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS) CEO Liam Griffin: With the 3G system, it took one day to download a full-length HD movie. This same file on a 4G network could be downloaded in minutes. On a 5G network, it would be a matter of seconds before the same movie was downloaded. Of course, a great deal of work remains to be completed before this new technology becomes reality, but much progress has already been made. Last July, the FCC passed a series of rules that laid the foundation for the advancement of 5G in the United States. These rules gave the telecom networks and tech giants the framework needed to experiment with the available spectrum to see what works best. Since the nationwide 5G network is a coming reality, investors would do well to consider which companies might stand to benefit the most in this massive shift in mobile networks. Here are three companies that are leaders in their respective markets and that are especially optimistic about their opportunities as 5G implementation moves closer. Collectively, they cover a wide variety of sectors and industries, and some might be more obvious than others. But together, this telecom giant, semiconductor manufacturer, and specialty glass maker might represent some of the best investments in the race to 5G. Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) is committed to being the first telecommunication company to deploy a 5G network. In the company's 2016 second-quarter conference call, CEO Lowell McAdams stated he learned from Verizon's experience with 4G LTE that ""being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities."" Image source: Verizon Communications Inc. Beyond the obvious benefits of being the first to upgrade its network, 5G would also substantially lower Verizon's Fios costs. Fios by Verizon is the company's effort to bring the advantages of fiber optics straight to the end consumer. In the same conference call, McAdams stated: I think of 5G initially as, in effect, Wireless fiber, which is Wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With Wireless fiber, the so called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure. With the premium pricing inherent to being the first to deploy a 5G network coupled with serious cost-saving benefits, the real question becomes whether Verizon will actually be the first to deploy a 5G network. On that front, CFO Matthew Ellis had encouraging news for investors during the company's most recently reported conference call: 5G wireless technology is a focus for us. We are now launching about 10 precommercial pilots across the country with multiple use cases, including dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. Our goal is to test the 5G fixed wireless technology in different environments in order to successfully operationalize 5G products for a commercial launch. Skyworks Solutions manufactures analog semiconductor products that enable smartphones, IOT devices, wearables, smart home devices, and a host of other products to connect to Wi-Fi or wireless networks. While mostly known as an iPhone supplier, the company is beginning to grow beyond Apple. CEO Liam Griffin is certainly excited about the company's prospects for growth related to 5G. In Skyworks' 2017 first-quarter conference call, Griffin stated the company's expertise, scale, and customer relationships were positioning Skyworks for ""5G leadership."" Later, Griffin added, ""5G represents a massive growth opportunity for our industry and certainly for Skyworks."" Why the sudden optimism? Precise filtering is increasingly important in wireless communications. Among the feathers in Skyworks' cap is they are one of the largest manufacturers of TC-SAW filters, which stands for temperature-compensated-surface acoustic wave filters. This is a quality, low-cost alternative to the more expensive BAW (bulk acoustic wave) filters, which some of Skyworks' competitors make. Traditionally, SAW filters work well on lower frequencies, but not higher ones. However, certain technical design choices (TDD v. FDD, if you're a networking geek) in the evolving 5G standard might open the door for Skyworks' cheaper filters to work at higher frequencies as well. This positions Skyworks to capture more market share in 5G-capable connected devices than previously would have been possible. Upon the news that Skyworks Solutions could play a larger part in 5G devices, shares spiked and are up more than 18% year to date. SWKS data by YCharts. It has been almost 50 years since Corning Inc (NYSE:GLW) invented the first low-loss optical fiber that could transmit data as light. Since that historic day in 1970, optical fiber has become the backbone of network infrastructure. While Corning is probably best known for outfitting LCD televisions with glass screens, its second-largest division is still manufacturing optical fiber. In Corning's most recently reported quarter, earnings from its optical communications segment were up a dazzling 85% year over year. The higher profitability was driven by improved manufacturing costs and the selling of their ""solution products"" in this area. Image source: Getty Images. In the conference call, CFO Tony Tripeny said the company expected strong growth in this division to continue, projecting for ""at least 25%"" growth in the current quarter. Tripeny also stated Corning was prepared to ""leverage the strong growth opportunities"" it sees in the telecom market as the industry leaders looked to invest in ""next generations and network capabilities"". It is no coincidence that Corning's stock price has skyrocketed the past year as this division has grown. A year ago, Corning's shares traded for about $18. Currently, shares are trading around $26.75, highs the stock price hasn't seen since before the Great Recession. ","
      
    3 Top 5G Stocks to Buy and Hold -- The Motley Fool

Todd Campbell,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett loves buying great stocks at fair prices, but he doesn't hold onto every stock he buys forever. Sometimes, he'll sell stocks after he's made a healthy profit. Other times, he'll sell because something has changed to make the company less attractive to him. Knowing what stocks Buffett's selling can be important because his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A), is so big that when he sells, it can cause share prices to drop. That's a risk investors might not want to take! Luckily, Berkshire Hathaway files a 13F report with the SEC every quarter that shows exactly what he's been selling, and that can keep you from being unhappily surprised. For example, Buffett sold shares in Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in Q4. Should you sell those stocks too? Warren Buffett has been a longtime owner of Wal-Mart Stores, but he's been selling shares in the retail giant since last spring, and in Q4, Berkshire Hathaway reduced its position in Wal-Mart by 89% to 1.4 million shares. Image source: Wal-Mart Stores. One reason Buffett may be selling Wal-Mart is because the company has been under fire from online retailers, and maintaining market share against those retailers has been hard. Wal-Mart is nowhere near as troubled as some other traditional retailers, but retail sales figures, and Wal-Mart's own financials suggest Wal-Mart's best days may be behind it. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce industry revenue jumped 15.7% year over year in Q3, 2016, and it now represents 8.4% of total retail sales. Wal-Mart's most recent quarterly earnings report from November shows investors just how tough its been to compete against online retailers like Amazon.com. In Wal-Mart's fiscal third quarter, its sales grew by an anemic 0.7% to $118.2 billion, and through the first nine months of fiscal 2017, its sales also grew by just 0.7% to $355 billion. For perspective, consider that Amazon.com's net sales surged 27% to $136.0 billion in 2016. Based on that comparison alone, it's understandable why Buffett no longer wants Wal-Mart to be one of his biggest holdings. Warren Buffett was betting that Deere & Co. could recapture some of luster last year, and it seems the farm machinery maker lived up to his expectations. Deere & Co.'s shares came into 2016 trading in the $70's. But, after a big run up, they finished the year trading at over $100. With Deere's shares rallying to all-time highs, it appears Buffett decided not to push his luck. In the third quarter, he sold 874,185 shares, and in the fourth quarter, he sold his remaining 21.1 million shares. It's anyone's guess if Warren Buffett will buy shares in Deere & Co. again, but if he does, it's probably not going to be for a while, unless of course, Deere's shares sell-off, or farm income climbs. In 2016, farm income was the lowest since the recession, and that caused Deere's net revenue to fall 8% to $26.6 billion. Deere & Co.'s ability to turn a profit despite slowing equipment demand is impressive, but the outlook for 2017 doesn't provide a lot of conviction to buy Deere's shares at lofty levels. The USDA net farm income forecast for this year puts it at the lowest levels since 2002, and Deere is projecting that equipment sales will dip by another 1% in 2017. Thus, Deere & Co. may be worth buying only if share prices retreat  Until then, patience is probably best. Verizon may be the country's biggest wireless carrier, but that fact alone wasn't enough to keep Warren Buffett a shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway sold almost all of its stake in Verizon last quarter. We may never know exactly why Buffett soured on Verizon, but since Buffett has owned Verizon shares since the middle of 2014, it's possible, depending on the exact timing of his buys and sells, that he was able to book a double-digit percentage profit on his investment in Verizon, and if so, then that gain might have been enough to convince him to sell into growing industry uncertainty. Last year, Verizon decided to buy Yahoo! to merge it with its AOL business, but after a high-profile data breach, pressure has mounted for that deal to be renegotiated to reflect damage to Yahoo!'s brand. Rumors are that Yahoo! may agree to a $250 million haircut to appease Verizon, but even at that lower price, it's not a given that this deal will be a big win. Adding to Verizon's uncertainty is the fact that it might need to do more deals just to keep pace with AT&T. AT&T bought DirecTV in 2015, and this week, Time Warner shareholders approved AT&T's $85 billion acquisition offer. As competitors push deeper into video, Verizon could have to make its own big splash, and that could be costly. Depending on how costly, that could be enough to send investors to the sidelines.

    Top Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling Now -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. According to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) latest SEC filing, Warren Buffett and company had an active fourth quarter in 2016. After sitting on a company record $85 billion cash hoard at the end of the third quarter, and having said that Berkshire spent $12 billion on common stocks in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, investors have been wondering what Berkshire has been up to. Here's the answer. While we don't necessarily know the reasoning behind Berkshire's latest investments, or whether they were initiated by Warren Buffett himself or one of his trusted stock pickers, we do know what changed in Berkshire's portfolio during the fourth quarter. Here are the most notable buys: Image Source: Getty Images. 1. Apple -- Berkshire already owned Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), although the company's $2 billion stake wasn't a large amount by Berkshire's standards. During the fourth quarter, Berkshire's Apple stake nearly quadrupled to about 57 million shares, which represent more than 1% of all the outstanding Apple stock. It's interesting to note that Buffett's stock-pickers were the ones who initiated the Apple investment, but given the size of the increase, the latest Apple addition could have come from Buffett himself. This investment did not surprise me at all. I've written before how Apple still represented a compelling bargain at the price levels it was trading for during the fourth quarter, and that Berkshire should take advantage. Well, apparently, management agreed. 2. Airlines -- Berkshire surprised many investors when it revealed its third-quarter 2016 investments in several airline stocks. After all, Buffett has spoken out against airline stocks as investments several times in his career, During the third quarter, Berkshire invested in American Airlines, Delta, and United Continental, and increased its stake in all three during the fourth quarter. At the same time the initial airline stakes were revealed, Buffett also said he made an investment in Southwest Airlines. He didn't specify the amount at the time, but we now know it's a stake worth more than $2 billion. 3. Monsanto -- Berkshire revealed a new stake in Monsanto, of about 8 million shares valued at about $872 million. Monsanto currently trades for about $109 per share, and the company plans to sell itself to Bayer for $128 per share. If the deal goes through, Buffett stands to make a quick profit, but the market doesn't seem convinced at this point. 4. Sirius XM -- The final major change was the addition of a nearly 167 million-share position in satellite radio operator Sirius XM. Granted, because of the company's $4.80 share price as of this writing, this stake translates into a relatively small (for Berkshire) $800 million investment. 1. Wal-Mart -- Buffett has been gradually trimming his Wal-Mart stake for some time, but he sold a substantial number of his remaining shares. Berkshire's investment in the retail giant has been cut from about 13 million shares to 1.4 million. As I've mentioned, we don't know the reasoning, but my guess is that the success of online retailers like Amazon has changed the competitive landscape in a way Buffett doesn't like. 2. Verizon -- Berkshire sold nearly all of its 15 million shares of Verizon during the quarter. Since Berkshire also unloaded its AT&T stake earlier in 2016, this didn't come as a huge surprise. 3. Kinder Morgan -- Buffett bought about 20 million shares of Kinder Morgan in early 2016, and sold his entire position during the fourth quarter. Kinder Morgan has nearly doubled from its early 2016 lows, so this could be a matter of the valuation simply not looking attractive to Buffett anymore. 4. Deere -- Just like Kinder Morgan, Deere has rallied sharply, up by about 43% over the past year alone. So, while we don't know for sure, this sale could potentially be due to a valuation issue as well. You shouldn't necessarily follow Buffett's moves. For one thing, by the time we hear about what Buffett is doing, it can be a completely different market. Since the fourth quarter ended, the S&P has risen by more than 4%, and some of the stocks Buffett has bought have risen even higher than that. Apple, for example, has risen by nearly 17% since the end of 2016, and Apple was trading even cheaper for much of the quarter. While I don't necessarily think Apple is too expensive to buy right now, it's fair to say that Buffett and company likely got a far better deal on their Apple shares than investors could get now. ^SPX data by YCharts ","

A full transcript follows the video. They also unloaded their stake in Deere and Verizon, and Kinder Morgan was another that we follow at the Fool. So, interesting to see Berkshire dumping Kinder Morgan after less than a year of holding it -- Kinder Morgan is an infrastructure company, a natural gas and oil pipeline -- then, to be loading up on airlines, which tend to benefit from lower energy prices.

Greer: So, if I am an investor and I'm considering some of these stocks, to what extent should I try to mimic what Buffett and Berkshire are doing?

Moser: Yeah, I think a very good example of that -- because I think David is spot on there -- if we look at a business like Markel, which we talk about often here, and we refer to it as a baby Berkshire in many ways, because the business is set up very much in the same way.

If you look at the holdings in Markel's portfolio, they own Apple. They also own Amazon. They don't own Wal-Mart. They own Facebook. So, there's a business where they do a lot of things that Berkshire does as well, but even they aren't mimicking those moves, despite the fact that Gayner and company are professed Berkshire fans, they have a wonderful brunch they're out there the day after the Berkshire Hathaway meeting. There's a lot of similarities in the business there. It's very small comparatively speaking, but you can see there as an example in Markel's portfolio. Sure, they follow some of Buffett's leads there, but they also do their own thinking and come to their own conclusions. We encourage investors out there to do the same.  Greer: Guys, let's talk Shopify. Shares of the e-commerce platform up big on Wednesday after the company reported better than expected earnings. David, I think for a lot of investors, Shopify is not exactly a household name. The stock has really been on a tear, though.  Kretzmann: Yeah, Shopify is a company that's in the background, but you've probably interacted with its platform in some shape or form. The company serves almost 400,000 merchants, mainly small and mid-size businesses. So, if you're a small business looking to get online and have an online shopping cart, Shopify is one of the platforms to go to if you're looking to set up a shopping cart, set up that online platform to offer goods and services online. A lot of smaller businesses are among Shopify's customer base. This was a great quarter. The company is having no problem growing quickly right now. Sales were up 86%, they added 50,000 merchants, bringing that total to 375,000 merchants under their umbrella. That's up more than 50% from where they were at the end of 2015. So, a lot of growth here. And the market opportunity here is still pretty big, and I think that's why, even though the stock is trading at a premium valuation, this level of growth theoretically could continue for a while. If you look at the key geographies where Shopify operates today, there are about 10 million merchants with less than 500 employees in those markets. That's really the key demographic that Shopify is going after. And every time, the average revenue per merchant on Shopify's platform is above $1,200 now. That would suggest a market size of about $10 billion. So, still a lot of room to run here, but the stock is still pricey.  Moser: Yeah. We've looked at Shopify for MDP, it's obviously a recommendation in a number of our services here. A very fascinating business from a number of different perspectives. There are a couple of things, questions I still need answers to here. No. 1 is just from the profitability perspective. They are growing, still not profitable, not cash flow positive. I wonder when is all of that going to change? Because I think if it does change, when it does change, it could be a tremendous catalyst, but I also wonder how much the market is pricing into there today. But the other question I have is just in regard to third-party relationships. With everything that Shopify does well, there is a provider that's helping them along the way. And I'll use payments as an example. They contract with Stripe, I believe, as a provider on the payment side. At some point, Stripe is going to look to become profitable, and they're going to try to exercise a little pricing power, which, in turn, is going to flow through Shopify's financials, unless they figure out a way to diversify from that provider as well. So, I just wonder, from the perspective of those third-party providers, how that plays out on this business down the road, and its profitability.  Greer: And along those lines, they've also got one of those frenemy dynamics with Amazon. They compete with Amazon, but they're obviously a partner of Amazon's. So, David, when you think about that frenemy dynamic, as a potential investor in Shopify, how much should that concern you?  Kretzmann: I think it's something to be aware of. I think some people gave Shopify a little bit more credit than it deserves for the transition Amazon made from its web store business. In 2010, Amazon launched a similar business to what Shopify has done. It was a few years after Shopify had started, and Amazon essentially said, ""We have a lot of third-party sellers on Amazon and we want to build a web store for those sellers to have their own independent website,"" which is essentially what Shopify did. Amazon shut that down in 2016 and basically made it easy for those Amazon webstore sellers to transition or migrate to Shopify's platform. So, Shopify called itself the preferred migration partner. But what a lot of people don't say is that there were only about 1,000 merchants on Amazon's platform last year. So, it's a win for Shopify, but it's not a huge catalyst, I don't think. You want to be aware of all those dynamics. To a similar point, it's not just with Amazon, it's also with those third-party merchants, the payments providers, the shipping solutions, because you have a lot of different companies providing those services. You have other online marketplaces like Etsy, which are branching more and more into Shopify's territory. So, I can see why people are excited about the business, because on the surface, this is a potentially very attractive business, because it's recurring revenue, it's a subscription fee, Shopify is bringing in monthly subscription revenue. If they can retain those enterprises over time, that could be very profitable. But up to this point, the company's losses are expanding, still burning cash. It's a riskier stock, still.  Greer: OK, guys, shares of Fossil down big on Wednesday. When I think Fossil ... OK, I don't really think Fossil. But if I were to think Fossil, I think watches.  Moser: You didn't get your wife something from Fossil for Valentine's Day, Mac?  Greer: What's the story here with Fossil, Jason?  Moser: Listen, leather accessories and watches and tchotchke, if that doesn't scream huge market opportunity, Mac, I don't know what does. This is a business that has been in a lot of trouble here for a while. This is nothing new. I was looking at this back in May of 2016 because of some revised guidance to the downside that really took its toll on the stock. I think we're seeing more of the same here. The bottom line is, retail is tough, but when you're in fashion retail and tchotchke fashion retail, I think it's even more difficult. There's certainly no real pricing power in that market. And Fossil is not known for that aspirational brand that people will pay up for. So, I respect the fact that management is attempting to diversify the revenue streams somewhat. They made an acquisition a little while back to get some exposure to the connected fitness realm. I don't know that I necessarily look at that as the biggest opportunity, either. I mean, it was Misfit, I believe, is the name of the company they acquired. If you look in the release they just put out this morning, they say, ""We'll double our efforts and wearables by launching over 300 SKUs, introducing new brands to the platform and enhancing engineering to enable additional functionality and more stylish and slimmer cases.""   Greer: You sound skeptical.   Moser: Well, I think there's reason to be skeptical. We've seen what happened with Fitbit. We've seen a less than stellar response to other smartwatch products. I think it's fair to question this strategy. And I don't know that it's necessarily the solution for this company. If you look at the top line, it's going in the wrong direction. Margins, going in the wrong direction. This is not something that just happened overnight. It's been happening over the past seven years. I think investors would be very wise to avoid this one.  Greer: And you're not wearing a watch. David ...  Moser: I am wearing a watch. Not a smartwatch, though.  Greer: Oh, you are wearing a watch, sorry.  Moser: This is a gift from my lovely wife when I turned 40.  Greer: You're old school, though. People aren't wearing watches as much, right?  Moser: Maybe not, yeah. I think that's the challenge. You either have your watch aficionados, people who like watches, who probably aren't really going to want to wear something like that, and you have people who don't wear watches at all and you have to convince them to put something on their wrist and they're probably not going to, a la Mac Greer. Or, you have people who are looking for, maybe, a dedicated fitness device, and I think there are more compelling options out there. So, these guys are fighting an uphill battle.  Kretzmann: Apple Watch can get a bad rap, but since it came onto the scene a couple years ago, it still captures over 50% market share in the smartwatch category. And I think the Apple Watch Series 2 is really the crown jewel as far as smartwatches go. Anecdotally, it's interesting seeing Fitbit, Under Armour, and Fossil all getting crushed this quarter. Obviously, they're all in connected fitness in a different way. But, yeah, I was out at CES early January and Fossil was one of the many connected fitness wearable device companies out there. And that's just a category that's getting very crowded, and it's hard to distinguish what's different between what Fitbit, Under Armour, or Fossil are doing.  Moser: And I'll tell you, just from my experience in the golf business years ago, because part of what I did as a golf professional was run the golf shops, that's a retail business and you have to basically stock it with the stuff that people want. And there was a dynamic to it for this type of stuff. It was Brighton, most of the demand there on the club side was for Brighton keychains, watches, purses, things like that. There just is no pricing in this. I mean, inevitably, it all stayed on the shelves until Christmas time when we put everything on sale. So, it's just a really difficult market, and it's not terribly shocking to see Fossil having a tough time.  Kretzmann: I wouldn't rush to see it as a buying opportunity, either. The company is still producing a good amount of free cash flow. So, on the surface, you might be inclined to see this. Maybe it'll bounce back at some point. But revenue has dropped each year since 2014, and expenses have continued to go up, so you've seen margins get crushed. What really highlights it is, the earnings per share was $7.10 in 2014, and for 2017, management is guiding for earnings per share of ($0.50) to $0.20.   Greer: [whistles] That's quite a range.  Kretzmann: Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better, if ever.  Greer: Guys, let's conclude here with SodaStream. This is a stock that has been incredibly volatile over the last couple years. And we have some good news, and the stock up big on Wednesday after reporting better-than-expected earnings. Jason, forget soda, it seems like the story here is sparkling water.  Moser: Well, I liked our conversation earlier this morning: maybe this company, really, it all just boils down to the wrong name, right?  Greer: Terrible name.  Moser: We're sitting here ragging on soda, it seems like, quarter in and quarter out. Maybe it needs to be something like SeltzerStream or whatever. But, I think the real beauty to this business, in the beginning, it's one that we've covered here in the Foolish universe for a while ...  Greer: And what do they do, for people who don't know the company?  Moser: SodaStream basically sells you these machines so that you can make seltzer or soda at home. You can carbonate your own water and make your own sodas at home. And on the surface, it sounds like a pretty neat idea, you don't have to go lugging around 12 packs of Diet Coke anymore, you can just do it all right there at home.  Greer: I hate that idea. I'm sorry, I don't find that appealing at all on the surface.  Moser: [laughs] What, having the machine there?  Greer: Yeah! I don't drink soda, but I wouldn't want to make my own soda if I drank soda. That's like making your own toothpaste. Why? Why?  Moser: I don't disagree.  Greer: So, no, not on the surface, take it back. [laughs]   Moser: Being a Diet Coke guy, SodaStream, as a product, never attracted me from the beginning. Now, I will also say I made a big shift in trying to drink more seltzer. But even as that has occurred, I still have zero interest in having one of these SodaStreams on my counter at home because of the fact that you have to keep on replacing that CO2 cartridge. It's just constant maintenance. And that's the crux of the question here. The beauty of the model has always been the razorblade nature -- the razor being the machine and the blades being the consumables that you use for the machine, the CO2 cartridges, the flavors that you use for whatever you're wanting to drink. And for a long time, it seemed like maybe this had promise. Certainly has gained a lot of traction overseas. U.S., I think, the U.S. market was viewed as a potential opportunity and that never really played out so much, and the stock got pummeled over the past few years because of that. Interesting to see, they're making a little bit of a comeback here. If you look at the numbers, there was about 22.4% unit growth for the quarter, which translated into 37% growth in revenue for those machines. So, they're actually selling machines, and they're getting some decent pricing on them. The growth in the consumables, which is the higher-margin, was less impressive, up 5%. This kind of gets back to the initial question that we always had with these things -- it's one thing to give this thing as a gift to someone, where it's like, ""Oh, that's a neat machine,"" or whatever. But ultimately, at some point, does it not just end up collecting dust on your kitchen counter? And I think that's the hurdle that they still have to clear. This was a decent quarter, I'm not sure it necessarily indicates that they have cleared this hurdle and everything is better again.  Greer: David, looking at the stock chart for the last few years, it's gone from $40 up to around $70 all the way down to $13, and now it's back around $50.  Kretzmann: Yeah, across $50s. I think SodaStream, it's a great time to take a step back and see a lesson there, that you don't want to cut the future winner too early. SodaStream, I think the verdict is still out whether or not it is a winner, but I would much rather hold a loser too long than sell a winner too early. In Rule Breakers, we sold SodaStream right around $13 a year or two ago. Since then, the stock has come roaring back almost four times over the past year. So, I think there is something to be said for the strategy of just buying and forgetting. Even if you have a loser, if it's a small percentage of your portfolio, there is something to be said for just letting that ride. ","

                                   unveiled the terms of their expected new deal, the result of some lengthy negotiations after the discovery of two massive security breaches at Yahoo that affected more than a billion users. The revised terms slashed $350 million from the $4.8 billion purchase price Verizon agreed to pay, and included a clause about legal bills that will push some of the burden of shareholder litigation and a regulatory inquiry onto Yahoo. Specifically, Verizon and Yahoo agreed to share equally each any liabilities resulting from non-SEC related investigations and other third-party litigation associated with the data breach. There are currently 23 consumer class-action lawsuits filed against Yahoo for the breach, according to an SEC filing. But Yahoo will bear the sole responsibility of liabilities associated with the continuing SEC investigation and any shareholder lawsuits. The SEC is investigating whether the two huge data breaches should have been reported sooner to investors. At least one shareholder lawsuit was filed against Yahoo soon after the SEC investigation was announced and is seeking class action status in federal court. That suit alleges that Yahoo and its top executives, Chief Executive Officesr Marissa Mayer and CFO Ken Goldman, made public misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts to investors about the data breaches at the company. See also: Have a Yahoo email account? Here are three things to do after hacks Yahoo, though, may not exist in its current form when the results of all these legal actions are known. Verizon and Yahoo still say that they expect the deal to close in the second quarter; once it does, “Yahoo” will become part of Verizon while everything else that is part of Yahoo Inc. becomes part of a new holding company called Altaba. That means Altaba could be left holding the bag for some legal expenses stemming from the Yahoo hacks, possibly taking a chunk out of the $7 billion in cash and securities that Yahoo held at the end of 2016. For investors who have spent years waiting for Yahoo to figure out a way to spin out its cash and stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

But despite the rally, many investors are nervous. After all, markets front-loaded gains for 2017 in November and December, and it’s now up to President Trump and a Republican Congress to follow through on a business-friendly agenda that investors have already priced in to shares.

That’s a clear sign many traders are feeling uncertain about what the future holds in regards to interest rates and how that may impact the stock market. And let’s not forget that all this optimism in recent weeks may not materialize in the form of real economic growth. Recently, the World Bank warned that economic expansion in the developed world is painfully small, with just a 1.8% a growth rate expected this year. If you’re feeling a bit worried about the state of the stock-market rally, you have good reason. But as the last few years have shown, those who hide out in cash can miss out big by misinterpreting the signs. So what’s an investor to do if he or she wants to limit risk in this uncertain environment, but not bail out on the markets altogether? Simple: hide out in low-risk dividend stocks that offer stability and a steady stream of income that can offset any volatility and provide gains even if the stock market runs out of gas. Here are three such low-risk dividend payers I like right now: Realty Income With dividends paid since 1969, Realty Income Corp.

                                   should be on every income investor’s radar. But equally compelling is the fact that dividends are paid on a monthly basis instead of a quarterly basis — providing much more regular paydays than your typical dividend payer. And with a yield of about 4.2% currently, it’s not chump change. The reason Realty Income can offer such nice payouts is because it generates reliable cash flow from 4,600 properties. These sites are occupied by a wide number of industries that include bulletproof tenants such as Walgreens drugstores, AMC movie theaters and FedEx shipping facilities, just to name a few. With stable long-term leases and high-quality clients, those monthly payout will keep rolling in. And with an amazing track record that spans 76 consecutive quarters of ever-higher payouts, you can be expect this dividend growth name to increase its cash dividend across 2017 as well. If you’re worried about the possibility of a strong dollar dragging down multinationals in 2017, the domestic focus of Realty Income is a great hedge. Furthermore, the long-term leases of Realty Income will provide insulation from short-term market volatility. And heck, if it just so happens that we see a big stimulus that kick-starts retailers, you can indirectly participate in the upside.

recently issued weak guidance amid anemic wireless growth in January, AT&T earnings showed improved its “churn” rate and is making headway. And let’s not forget that it continues to evolve and integrate its DirecTV business, purchased back in 2014. Even without a content arm like Time Warner, it still has a stranglehold on distribution. Bears will note that AT&T didn’t exactly blow the doors off its fourth-quarter earnings report, with revenue down by a tiny amount year-over-year. But this is not a growth stock where double-digit revenue expansion is necessary. Instead, investors should focus on operating cash flow and free cash flow where the dividend payments come from — and both were very strong. Specifically, cash from operations was $10.1 billion, and free cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 19.2%. AT&T yields an impressive 4.8% as of this writing and pays out just 65% of earnings per share. That all but ensures a reliable dividend — and, more than likely, future increases in that payout. At a forward P/E of less than 14, this entrenched telecom is a very safe bet here. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners In any economic environment, dividend investors should be looking for stable investments with reliable cash flow. And if you really want a bit more security, you should also look for “wide moat” companies that have deep pockets to sustain themselves as well as major barriers to entry in their particular market. All these things perfectly describe Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.

However, the diversification across sectors and around the globe helps mitigate those risks. There are many pieces in the global economic puzzle, but key infrastructure like roads and rails and power grids are some of the most important parts — in both good times and in bad.

The company said some of the latest intrusions can be connected to the “same state-sponsored actor believed to be responsible for the 2014 breach”, in which at least 500 million accounts were affected. “Based on the investigation, we believe an unauthorized third party accessed the company’s proprietary code to learn how to forge certain cookies,” Yahoo said in its latest annual filing. These cookies have been invalidated so they cannot be used to access user accounts, the company said. Forged cookies allow an intruder to access a user’s account without a password. Yahoo also said in December that data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest breach in history. The company said on Wednesday that it would not award Chief Executive Marissa Mayer a cash bonus for 2016, following the independent committee’s findings related to the 2014 security incident. Mayer has also offered to forgo any 2017 annual equity award as the breaches occurred during her tenure, Yahoo said. ","

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will block some Obama administration rules that subject broadband providers to stricter scrutiny than websites, a spokesman said on Friday, in a victory for internet providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The rules approved by the FCC in October in a 3-2 vote were aimed at protecting sensitive personal consumer data. Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman appointed by President Donald Trump, believes all companies in the “online space should be subject to the same rules, and the federal government should not favor one set of companies over another,” said FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield. Pai plans by March 2 to delay the implementation the data security rules, Wigfield said. Some other aspects of the rules are under review by the White House Office of Management and Budget. A temporary stay is a first step toward permanently blocking the rules, analysts said Friday. The rules would subject broadband internet service providers to more stringent requirements than websites like Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc or Alphabet Inc’s Google. Providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geo-location, financial information, health information, children’s information and Web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. For less sensitive information such as email addresses or service tiers, consumers would be able to opt out. Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn said in a statement Friday that “Chairman Pai is determined to take action that leaves consumers without a cop on the beat protecting their personal information from misuse by their broadband service provider.” Several Democrats in the U.S. Congress also criticized the move. Republican commissioners including Pai, said in October the rules unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than service providers and dominate digital advertising. Pai said in October the FCC “adopted one-sided rules that will cement edge providers’ dominance in the online advertising market.” Google and Facebook account for about two-thirds of all digital ad revenue. Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who authored the privacy rules, said on Friday that they are necessary because consumers have few options when it comes to broadband providers. “The fact of the matter is it’s the consumer’s information,” he said. “It’s not the network’s information.” Berin Szóka, president of TechFreedom, said Pai’s decision was a good move because “because the real question isn’t a policy question but a legal one: does the FCC even have authority to regulate broadband privacy?” ","

Analysts said at the time that the news reflected an intensifying price war in the wireless industry that could put more pressure on major players to cut costs.

Don't show this again Ask Maggie: CNET's Marguerite Reardon offers advice to an AT&T subscriber considering replacing his long-held unlimited data plan with a new one. Unlimited data is back, and customers who held onto their old grandfathered unlimited plans finally have more choices. It couldn't be a better time to be in the market for an unlimited data plan for your mobile phone. Thanks to T-Mobile, which has been siphoning off customers from AT&T and Verizon, the big carriers have finally succumbed to the pressure. AT&T had been offering an unlimited data plan to customers signing up with DirecTV. But after Verizon launched its unlimited plan and T-Mobile countered by adding perks to its own unlimited options, AT&T came back with an even more compelling offer. Earlier this week it unveiled two new unlimited data plans. The first is a budget-friendly, stripped-down plan with limited speeds and standard-definition video, while its higher-end plan offers full high-definition video streaming and up to 10GB of Wi-Fi hotspot data. The constant back and forth between the carriers is good news for consumers who get to enjoy better prices and more options. In this edition of Ask Maggie, I help a longtime AT&T subscriber decide whether to ditch his old unlimited data plan for the new plan. Dear AT&T-lifer, The short answer is yes, you should definitely switch. AT&T's new pricing makes a compelling case for ditching your old plan. But you may want to shop around. AT&T is just one of the major carriers offering unlimited data plan specials. Even the premium unlimited offer, called Unlimited Plus, which is priced at $145 a month for two lines, will save you $20 a month. And you will get a lot more for your money. Not only will you get unlimited talk time, but you'll also be able to use your phones as mobile hotspots and get up to 10GB of data each month at 4G LTE speeds. That option isn't available under your current unlimited data plan. There are other perks, too. If you subscribe to the Unlimited Plus plan, AT&T will take $25 off the price of a subscription to its DirecTV, U-Verse TV or DirecTV Now service each month. AT&T says that this is a limited-time promotion and that it will start to apply the $25 credit after two to three billing periods. A couple of things to keep in mind. This pricing requires you to sign up for automatic bill paying. Video is set by default to stream at lower quality (480p resolution). But with the Unlimited Plus plan, you can manually turn that feature off to get high-definition streams. And like all the other major wireless carriers, AT&T might slow your data connection if you use more than 22GB of data in a month. If you're looking to save even more money and you don't mind surfing the net at slower speeds, you could consider the Unlimited Choice plan, which costs $115 for two lines. But keep in mind there are big caveats to this plan. Video streaming is only done at a lower-quality resolution. There's no hotspot feature. And all internet speeds are limited to 3 Mbps. And if you use more than 22GB of data in a given month, AT&T will slow you down even more. The good news for you is that the unlimited-data-plan-wars mean you don't have to be held hostage to AT&T's old unlimited data offer. Now you have the freedom to try another carrier without the fear of losing that unlimited data if it doesn't work out. And truth be told, you'll actually get a better deal from any of the other three major wireless carriers if you switch. With Sprint you can get two lines of unlimited data for $90 a month. T-Mobile will give you two lines of unlimited data for $100 a month. And Verizon charges $140 a month for two lines. Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.

 ,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - Moody’s credit rating agency lowered its outlook for the U.S. telecommunications industry to negative from stable on Thursday  amid growing price competition for wireless services. Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer Mark Stodden forecast in a report that U.S. aggregate wireless industry cash flows would fall by 2 percent in 2017. Analysts have said that the industry’s push to compete on unlimited data plans could hurt profit margins, putting more pressure on carriers to control costs. In a shift in the price wars among the four biggest U.S. wireless carriers, Verizon Communications Inc last month said it would once again offer an unlimited pricing plan. Verizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would be making the offer for the first time in more than five years. AT&T Inc , T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp all responded by sweetening their existing unlimited data plans. The Moody’s Corp report said T-Mobile’s strategy has “pushed its bigger peers to an unhealthy level of competition” and said the expansion of unlimited data plans would reduce the industry’s long-term revenue growth potential. At the same time, the new data plans will prompt more data usage and require more capital spending by carriers, Moody’s said, predicting a 7 percent growth in capital investment to fund network traffic volumes this year. The report predicts flat aggregate industry cash flow in 2018 after strong cash flows in 2015 and 2016. The shift is “in response to competitive pressures, with Verizon and AT&T now responding more deliberately, particularly to T-Mobile’s relentless marketing and expanding market share.” Stodden also said cable firms could pose an additional threat. Cable operators Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc have said they will launch wireless services on Verizon’s airwaves in 2017 and 2018, respectively. A tie-up of Sprint and T-Mobile “would reduce price pressure and provide a path back to aggregate industry cash growth,” the report said. Moody’s puts the odds of Trump administration regulators approving a tie-up at around one in three. Reuters reported on Feb. 17 that SoftBank Group Corp  is prepared to cede control of Sprint Corp to Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile to clinch a merger of the two U.S. carriers, citing people familiar with the matter. SoftBank has not yet approached Deutsche Telekom to discuss any deal because U.S. regulators imposed strict anti-collusion rules during an airwaves auction. After the auction ends in April, the parties are expected to begin negotiations. In 2014, SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T-Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U.S. regulators.

 ,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new Republican head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission promised “light-touch” regulation of areas such as the internet, a dramatic shift away from the Obama administration’s approach to telecommunications oversight. Ajit Pai, whom President Donald Trump named in January to chair the FCC, said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that the agency made a “mistake” in 2015 when it adopted landmark “net neutrality rules” reclassifying internet service like a public utility. “The FCC decided to apply last-century, utility-style regulation to today’s broadband networks,” Pai said in prepared remarks released by his office. “Our new approach injected tremendous uncertainty into the broadband market,” he added.  “And uncertainty is the enemy of growth.” The Obama administration’s net neutrality rules, which a federal appeals court upheld, bar internet access providers from slowing consumers’ access to web content. Pai has not disclosed his plans to reverse the rules, but he has emphasized he is committed to ensuring an open internet. “We are confident in the decades-long, cross-party consensus on light-touch Internet regulation — one that helped America’s digital economy thrive,” Pai said. “Our approach will be not zero regulation, but light-touch regulation — rules backed by long-standing principles of competition law.” Pai said on Monday that he would not review AT&T Inc’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. In December he vowed to take a “weed whacker” to unneeded rules and said net neutrality’s “days are numbered.” Internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder for them to manage traffic and discourage investing in additional capacity, while websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. Pai cannot simply issue an order doing away with the net neutrality rules but must go through an administrative process. He has not disclosed his plans, saying he will mount a “careful look at the regulatory framework.” Last month Tom Wheeler, then the FCC’s chairman, said reversing the net neutrality rules “is not a slam dunk.” Earlier this month, Pai sent letters to Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T to notify them that the FCC was closing investigations into “sponsored data” or “zero rating” programs in which mobile phone companies give customers free data for using certain video services. The FCC had previously raised concerns about those policies. Pai also is moving to block some stricter privacy rules on internet providers that are set to take effect Thursday. ","

Charles Bovaird,03022017,Investopedia,02232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs President Donald Trump's proposal to cut the top federal tax rate on business income to 15% would provide windfalls for certain companies such as financial services institution Visa Inc. (V) and retailer Best Buy Co Inc. (BBY), which generally pay close to the top rate of 35%, according to CNBC. Many investors will likely focus on Trump's joint address to Congress on February 28, during which he is expected to discuss his plans for tax reform, The Washington Post reported. However, many firms will likely derive little benefit from such tax reform, as they already have an effective tax rate below 15%. (For more, see also: How Trump's Tax Plan Is Dividing Corporate America.) While there are many companies that have paid a low effective rate in recent years, a perfect example is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The online retailer has enjoyed an effective tax rate of 11% on its domestic income over the last eight years, according to CNBC. Amazon harnessed several special deductions, including ones involving accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation, and research and development credits, according to the company's annual report. Amazon is not alone in benefiting from this special treatment, as companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) are ""routinely able to reduce their tax bill,"" Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at tax policy think tank Citizens for Tax Justice (CTH) told CNBC. Amid this situation, Exxon Mobil and AT&T Inc. (T) paid effective tax rates of 14% and 7% between 2008 and 2012, CTJ data reveals. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and General Electric Company (GE) both had negative rates during that time, paying 2% and 11%,respectively. However, the special deductions that these companies have been leveraging are likely to disappear under Trump's plan, Stephan Unger, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College, told Investopedia during an interview. The ""current special deduction possibilities are likely to get abandoned to make the system more transparent and efficient,"" he said. However, whether or not ""special tax treatments for specific companies"" will end up disappearing completely remains unclear, stated Unger. Tax expert Nate Smith offered a different point of view, stating during a separate interview with Investopedia that while ""certain industries (like oil and gas) benefit from specific deductions ... the deduction provisions that could be disappearing are not the thrust of what Trump's reform would target."" The more important matter is changing tax law so that companies will repatriate profits, said Smith. Currently, multinational corporations can keep these earnings overseas indefinitely, shielding them from the higher tax rates, he told Investopedia. Frequently, managing their international footprint is the means of minimizing tax expenses, said Smith. Originally, Trump's campaign tax proposal sought to rectify this situation, he noted. (For more, see also: Can Trump Tax Plan Bring Back Overseas Cash?) Because of policies like these, many global companies are paying very little in the way of taxes, Tenpao Lee, interim dean and professor of economics at Niagara University, stated during an Investopedia interview. Should lawmakers cut the top corporate income tax rate to 15%, it would give major companies greater motivation to move their profits back to the United States. However, the impact may not take effect immediately, said Lee, as companies would need time to adjust. For companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), the effect would be significant, whereas companies like Exxon Mobil and Amazon would see less of an impact, he told Investopedia.

The $10.54 billion deal for Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline operations in California, Texas, and Florida was initially seen as a way for Frontier to take a big step up. The Verizon deal added 3.7 million landline accounts to Frontier's roster during last year's second quarter, and perhaps more importantly it also picked up 2.2 million high-speed data accounts, including 1.6 million FiOS internet users and 1.2 million FiOS cable television customers. Beefing up its base of accounts for its fiber-optic and copper networks is important, because folks keep cutting the cord. Frontier's residential customer count declined from 5.228 million to 5.073 million as the third quarter played itself out. Monthly churn is on the rise, and average monthly revenue per residential account is declining. It experienced a slight sequential dip in business customers, too, but at least those accounts are spending more. Windstream's report was no treat. It posted a much wider loss than analysts were expecting. However, the market generally liked the $1.1 billion deal to acquire EarthLink (NASDAQ:ELNK) that was made official at the time of its earnings. The EarthLink move prompted an analyst upgrade from Cowen. Wall Street wouldn't have been as warm to Windstream if it had to rely solely on its shrinking legacy business. Image source: Frontier Communications. Windstream shares are back to where they were just before its bumpy third quarter, but Frontier stock has yet to claw its way back from the 23% hole that it dug itself into last time out. The stocks will likely make big moves -- up or down -- based on how their quarterly reports go in the next few days. Analysts see Frontier clocking in with $2.5 billion in revenue, a 76% surge since the prior year, but that includes the needle-moving Verizon accounts it picked up during the second quarter of last year. Wall Street pros see a modest quarterly loss of $0.05 a share -- Frontier's third straight quarterly deficit. Windstream's eyeing another rough quarter. Analysts are forecasting revenue to decline 6% to $1.34 billion in Wednesday's pre-open report. They see a chunky loss of $0.63 a share for the period. Windstream recently received regulatory approval to close on its deal with EarthLink, a move that will create a top-line bounce that, like Frontier, will not be organic. The big draw to both stocks continues to be their fat dividends. Frontier and Windstream are currently yielding 12.5% and 8.3%, respectively. The sustainability of those distributions over the long haul will always be dubious until the companies secure steady organic growth, but the wild trading in both stocks is also proof that yield chasers aren't always buying into risk-averse situations. Things won't be quiet for either stock next week. ","

Daniel B. Kline,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Like a kid who seems smart but always has an excuse for not doing his homework, Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) has posted another drop in customers but has a reason for it. In the first two quarters of the year, the company blamed various factors caused by its $10.54 billion purchase of Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline customers in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) as the reason its subscriber base moved in the wrong direction. At first, the company said falling customer counts were due to problems during the cutover, and after that CEO Dan McCarthy blamed a slowdown in marketing efforts while Frontier normalized operations in the former Verizon territories. During the Q3 earnings call, transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required), the CEO said that ""CTF subscriber trends improved sequentially in the third quarter, although it is not yet at the rate we are targeting."" He also made it clear that in Q4, the company expected improved results. ""As we ramp marketing and adjust our offers, we expect continued improvements in net subscriber performance in the fourth quarter,"" McCarthy said. ""We anticipate exiting the year at or close to normal levels of customer activity that would support a more stable revenue performance in CTF."" At no point did McCarthy mention that the company faced an issue with customers who didn't pay their bills in the territories acquired from Verizon. In the Q4 earnings release, however, Frontier again lost subscribers and placed the blame at least party on the ""resolution of non-paying acquired CTF accounts."" The company added that it has experienced an ""improved trend in broadband in both legacy and CTF markets, excluding impact of non-paying account resolution."" This may not be McCarthy saying the dog ate his homework, but it does sound like an excuse. Subscriber counts were down in Q4, and the company posted a net loss of $80 million, but there was some good news in the earnings report as well. If Frontier customers keep leaving, the company will have a serious problem. Image source: Getty Images. In Q4 Frontier saw its total residential customer base drop from 5.03 million at the end of Q3 to 4.89 million to close the year. That's a drop of 144,000 subscribers, not appreciably different from the 155,000 lost in Q3. In addition, Frontier's business customer base dropped by 16,000, and it lost 96,000 broadband customers, as well as 84,000 video subscribers. That compares with a loss of 12,000 business customers, 99,000 broadband homes, and 92,000 video subscribers in the previous quarter. On top of that, residential average revenue per user (ARPU) dropped by even more than it did from Q2 to Q3, falling from $82.34 to $80.33. In the previous quarter, ARPU fell to $82.24 from $83.20. Business ARPU, which had climbed in Q3 by a little over $10, dropped slightly, losing $3.26 to come in at $6.65.04. Revenue also dropped in Q4, from $2.52 billion in Q3 to $2.40 billion in the year's final quarter. The company blamed $45 million of that dip on ""resolution of CTF accounts that were determined to be non-paying following an intensified effort to address overdue accounts."" Frontier expects the impact of the resolution process to decline to $25 million in Q1 2017 and said the ""initiative is nearly complete"" and that the company ""expects to be processing overdue accounts in a normal manner before the end of the first quarter."" In theory, the non-paying-accounts issue should be a one-time problem, and while it's hard to put a lot of faith in the company's ability to gain or hold customers, it does do a good job managing costs. McCarthy, in his remarks in the earnings release, said the company has made significant progress in its efforts to position ""our company to deliver a better customer experience and improved financial performance, with greater financial flexibility."" He specifically cited Frontier's reorganization into separate commercial and consumer business units, and the earnings release mentioned that the company has reorganized its credit facilities. Under the new terms, all of its agreements are now combined into one, while payment terms have been extended from 2018 to 2022. In addition, as its customer base shrinks, Frontier has once again found new ways to save money. ""We now expect annualized cost synergies of $1.6 billion to be achieved by mid-year 2018, up from the $1.4 billion target outlined in the 2016 third-quarter earnings report, and a full year earlier than anticipated,"" McCarthy said. ""We expect $1.25 billion of the $1.6 billion in synergies will be achieved by the end of the first quarter of 2017, which is a quarter earlier than previously announced."" Frontier has run out of excuses for its troubling loss of subscribers. It paid Verizon $10.54 billion for 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband customers, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers, and it's slowly watching them walk out the door. The company appears to be well managed, and it has done a good job maximizing cost savings, but at some point you have to wonder if maybe those savings are costing Frontier subscribers. Going forward, McCarthy needs to show the needle moving in the right direction, or at least that there's a bottom to these drops. ","
      
    Frontier Loses More Subscribers, Revenue in Q4 -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Sometimes Mr. Market gets confused and prices companies at a premium or discount to their true value. While big companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) historically trade at a discount to the overall market, they're currently trading at an even deeper discount than usual. Verizon's share price has mostly stood still while the market continued to rally over the past year. Apple, meanwhile, is trading around the same P/E ratio as it did at the beginning of last year, while the S&P 500 is trading 21% higher on a P/E basis. Let's look at the numbers and see why both these tech titans are trading at massive discounts. Wall Street might be missing something on these two. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon's P/E ratio for the trailing 12 months is a mere 15.5. On a forward basis, it's just 12.9. That compares with the S&P 500's trailing P/E of 26.9. Verizon is trading at just 0.58 times the P/E ratio of the broader index. The last time it was even below 0.65 was in 2002, when the telecom industry tanked, according to analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Historically, Verizon trades for just an 11% discount. The 42% discount it's trading at today represents a massive buying opportunity for long-term value investors -- not to mention that Verizon is also trading at a lower forward P/E compared with AT&T (NYSE:T), which trades for 14.3 times analysts' 2017 EPS estimates. At the same time, it's worth looking at why Mr. Market is placing such a hefty discount on the wireless carrier. First and foremost, the competition in the wireless industry is increasingly fierce. Pressure from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has finally gotten to Verizon, putting pressure on its pricing. Verizon recently introduced an unlimited-data plan in an effort to compete with the value offered by T-Mobile's plans. AT&T also bowed to the pressure, opening its unlimited-data plan to all customers and dropping the price. Image source: Verizon. However, the strength of Verizon's wireless network and its position on the leading edge of 5G network development give it a significant competitive advantage over the long term. Additionally, its massive retail customer base -- the largest in the U.S. wireless industry -- will continue to throw off cash for its investments in its wireless network and digital advertising and video. That should allow the stock to rise back up toward its usual valuation levels over time. In the meantime, investors can get a juicy 4.6% dividend for their patience. Shares of Apple have been on a tear over the last nine months, increasing 46%. That significantly outpaces the 14% increase the S&P 500 saw in the same period. But Apple was trading for a 35% discount on a P/E basis in 2015 and a 26% discount in 2016. The largest company in the market typically trades for a discount to the S&P 500, but not nearly as deep as Apple's. Over the past 10 years, the average discount for the largest company by market cap was 16% to the S&P 500's P/E, according to BMO Capital's Tim Long. Apple shares traded near that level in 2012, 2013, and 2014, but the market hasn't caught up with the explosion in earnings from the release of the iPhone 6 at the end of 2014. Today, Apple trades around a 25% discount to the S&P 500, below that 16% baseline. While the market is down on Apple's slow iPhone sales growth, there are a few reasons to believe Apple's earnings will continue to expand. The iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple First of all, the company continues to execute on its massive capital returns program. Share buybacks will force earnings per share to increase at a faster rate than net income. Second, Apple's services business continues to grow at a strong pace. Services revenue is higher margin than Apple's core revenue. As such, it has an outsize impact on Apple's profit growth. Investors looking for value have two great options with Verizon and Apple. While the latter is trading at an all-time high, it still has room to run. Meanwhile, Verizon is trading at historic lows while maintaining strong competitive advantages, indicating it should outpace the market from here. ","

Rich Duprey,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 20,000 for the first time last month and continues to set new records. Although investors tend to look at the index as a single entity, it is of course composed of 30 different companies, though they all don't affect the index equally. That's because the Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning pricier stocks in the index have a greater influence over its movements than do cheaper ones. Currently, Goldman Sachs, at more than $252 per share, has the greatest weight in the Dow, some 8.3%, while General Electric has the least, or 1%, as its stock trades at just over $30 a share. Image source: Getty Images. But the makeup of the Dow also changes over time, as companies are added to the index or dropped from it. The last time the components were changed was in 2015, when AT&T was removed and Apple added. Goldman Sachs, in fact, wasn't part of the Dow until 2013, when it, Nike, and Visa were put in and Alcoa, Bank of America, and Hewlett-Packard were taken out. The components have been changed 51 times since Charles Dow created the index in 1896, but the changes aren't made lightly, and you can still find 23 companies in the DJIA today that occupied that same space a decade ago. Unchanged Componentsof the Dow Jones Industrial Average,2007-2017 3M (NYSE:MMM) General Electric Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) American Express (NYSE:AXP) Home Depot (NYSE:HD) Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) Boeing (NYSE:BA) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) IBM (NYSE:IBM) United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) DuPont (NYSE:DD) McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)(NYSE:MCD) Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Merck (NYSE:MRK) Ten years ago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sat at around the 12,700 level and some might see parallels with today. Back then, the index was regularly hitting new highs and would go on to hit almost 14,000 just as the Great Recession hit, after which it would subsequently lose more than half its value. That it's nearly tripled over the past decade speaks to the strength of the components that comprise the Dow, but which one of these nearly two dozen stocks played the biggest role in its climb? Data sources: indexArb and Morningstar. Table by author. Looking at their total returns, the best performer was Home Depot, which generated 14.3% average annual returns for investors over the past 10 years, just ahead of McDonald's and Disney at around 13% each. That outsize performance certainly boosted the index's performance, but because of the Dow's price-weighting, which for the three of them averaged just above 4%, it probably would have muted their overall impact to a degree. So which stock came out on top? Industrial conglomerate 3M, which generated average annual returns of 10.6% and had the heaviest weighting of any of the 23 stocks at 6.07%. The combination of those two factors probably means it played a big role in the Dow index performance, and it should be remembered that this performance includes the 2008-2009 recession. http://www.3m.com.hk/wps/wcm/connect/db1c9bb5-2b2e-4db7-afef-1dd0b79f58fb/MovingIndustryForward_270.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-db1c9bb5-2b2e-4db7-afef-1dd0b79f58fb-kYXl7I6Image source: 3M. Shares of 3M have more than doubled over the past 10 years, and in the past 12 months alone they're up 20%, but with good reason. It generates annual sales in excess of $30 billion, produces huge amounts of free cash, and is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat club, having raised its dividend for 59 consecutive years, most recently by 6% to $1.175 per share. While its fourth-quarter earnings were hampered by a weak performance by its healthcare and consumer divisions that typically do better, its industrial end markets were much stronger, allowing it to reaffirm its growth prospects for the coming year as well as forecast profits of $8.45 to $8.80 a share. While it would have been nice to see its consumer-facing businesses perform well now that the industrial segment is firing properly, the latter represents one-third of its total revenues and will be key to the future. Image source: 3M. Although management is always looking to calve off slower growth businesses to focus on maintaining high-single-digit revenue growth over the long term, 3M plans to invest approximately $1.8 billion in research and development this year to support its organic growth initiatives. Yet even with its uneven performance this past quarter, each segment of the business generated operating margins near 20% or above. If 3M is able to continue producing the kinds of numbers it has been, the industrial and consumer giant may be able to avoid the shades of the downfall that befell the Dow Jones Industrial Average 10 years ago.

                                   first outside hire ever for the CMO role. He spoke with The Wall Street Journal about how the more than 100-year-old company is trying to appeal to the next generation of consumers. Following are edited excerpts of the conversation. WSJ: Tell me about how you arrived at Verizon. Scotti: The first time that I talked to [Verizon CEO] Lowell McAdam I said, ”I’m not a telco person, so why would you want somebody like me for this role?” His explanation was that our brand and our company are going to go through a big transformation. We really need to work on creating an emotional connection with our customers—current and future ones. Because as our industry gets more commoditized, if we don’t take that step, we won’t be as successful. And in order to do that he wanted to bring in somebody who has other experiences, not only the telco industry. Tell me about some of the company’s recent changes. Part of Lowell’s vision was that as we start thinking about the next-generation customers—that being millennials or Gen Z and whatever is coming next—we need to ensure that we are very relevant. And in order to do that, [being simple, personalizable and reliable] becomes really important. So when we heard that our service plans were not simple, we got rid of all our plans, and decided to do small, medium, large and extra large. The same way you buy your T-shirts, now you can get your plan. That’s something that people understand. A lot of people say that I did that because I came from J. Crew and all I do is think about T-shirts. That’s a little simplistic, but whatever, it works. The new My Verizon app was a tremendous innovation for us. Because we said we’re going to take the current app that we have, and we’re going to, like, burn it. And we’re going to start from scratch. If you’re going to create the remote control for your plan, what would it be? For these younger consumers who are dealing with brands like Uber—you can’t separate the app and the Uber service. The service and the app are the same thing. What do millennials look for in a cellphone carrier, and how does Verizon figure that out? There is this misconception that millennials are this very homogeneous group. That they all look, feel and act the same way. I think you can’t make that assertion about any group. We know this based on analytics and customer data: that there are plenty of young people out there who want quality. For these folks, the phone has become an intrinsic part of their lives. They put their phone in the context of, “My phone is everything to me. My phone is the remote control for my life. The phone is my life.” And because they are always on, they want to make sure that they have the best. These folks say “I want the best. I want the fastest speed, I want the best video quality and I also want solid customer service.” And I don’t mean customer service in the sense of calling and talking to somebody, but, “I want the support that I need when I need it.” When you start talking about young consumers, or millennials, there seems to be this understanding that there’s only one way of addressing the needs of millennials, and that is: Everything is free, everything is cheap, and everything is a bunch of young folks jumping around in a commercial with some type of very energetic music. And that’s a gross oversimplification. In our industry, that has caused a little bit of a race to the bottom: Let’s see how free free can be. Let’s not put emphasis on the quality or the experience, but on how free that experience is. But if somebody is looking for quality across a lot of aspects of their lives, then wireless is not different. Your go90 video app is in a totally different position in the market than Verizon. You’ve got something that’s trying to appeal to young people and doesn’t have much brand identity yet. How do you approach that? You want to create brands that have strong appeal with consumers. So we do a lot of consumer research, talking a lot to consumers, and trying to understand the essence of those brands. So not just put a name on there and then launch it. But second of all, what does it take to create a brand? I’m not just talking about putting a lot of advertising dollars to put a name out there. But especially in this day and age, it’s how it’s going to connect with consumers in their lives. So what is the pitch for go90 then, in its essence? What go90 is trying to do is to be a distribution platform for amazing mobile-first content. And that’s something that doesn’t really exist in the marketplace. We talked about the short-form, bite-size content that every millennial loves on YouTube, for example—what’s the HBO-quality equivalent of that? That doesn’t exist. So a lot of the work that we’ve been doing is to say, OK, let’s bring that quality and appeal to this new generation. It doesn’t carry the Verizon brand. No, because we thought that it was a good way to create this separate brand that would carry its appeal on its own. How does it all fit into the bigger challenge? You mentioned that one of the pressures coming on the telecommunications industry is the commoditization of it. It’s been something that telecoms have always been struggling with since the dawn of the iPhone, of not being just a dumb pipe. How does that influence the broader strategy that you’re trying to unveil with go90 and your Hum technology for drivers and the marketing? There is definitely a perspective that says that we want to be the one-stop shop for our customers across the digital world. But that doesn’t mean you can do it with one brand all the time in all cases. In this day and age it’s not like that. And the logo change was trying to be a friendlier appearance? Friendlier, and also our logo was 15 years old. It was just looking tired. We had so many different iterations of the logo that this was a way of appealing to the next generation of customers. Simplifying. The check mark was signaling this notion of reliability. Ryan Knutson is a Wall Street Journal reporter in New York. He can be reached at ryan.knutson@wsj.com.

 ,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"CNET también está disponible en español. Don't show this again Ask Maggie: CNET's Marguerite Reardon offers advice to an AT&T subscriber considering replacing his long-held unlimited data plan with a new one. Unlimited data is back, and customers who held onto their old grandfathered unlimited plans finally have more choices. It couldn't be a better time to be in the market for an unlimited data plan for your mobile phone. Thanks to T-Mobile, which has been siphoning off customers from AT&T and Verizon, the big carriers have finally succumbed to the pressure. AT&T had been offering an unlimited data plan to customers signing up with DirecTV. But after Verizon launched its unlimited plan and T-Mobile countered by adding perks to its own unlimited options, AT&T came back with an even more compelling offer. Earlier this week it unveiled two new unlimited data plans. The first is a budget-friendly, stripped-down plan with limited speeds and standard-definition video, while its higher-end plan offers full high-definition video streaming and up to 10GB of Wi-Fi hotspot data. The constant back and forth between the carriers is good news for consumers who get to enjoy better prices and more options. In this edition of Ask Maggie, I help a longtime AT&T subscriber decide whether to ditch his old unlimited data plan for the new plan. Dear AT&T-lifer, The short answer is yes, you should definitely switch. AT&T's new pricing makes a compelling case for ditching your old plan. But you may want to shop around. AT&T is just one of the major carriers offering unlimited data plan specials. Even the premium unlimited offer, called Unlimited Plus, which is priced at $145 a month for two lines, will save you $20 a month. And you will get a lot more for your money. Not only will you get unlimited talk time, but you'll also be able to use your phones as mobile hotspots and get up to 10GB of data each month at 4G LTE speeds. That option isn't available under your current unlimited data plan. There are other perks, too. If you subscribe to the Unlimited Plus plan, AT&T will take $25 off the price of a subscription to its DirecTV, U-Verse TV or DirecTV Now service each month. AT&T says that this is a limited-time promotion and that it will start to apply the $25 credit after two to three billing periods. A couple of things to keep in mind. This pricing requires you to sign up for automatic bill paying. Video is set by default to stream at lower quality (480p resolution). But with the Unlimited Plus plan, you can manually turn that feature off to get high-definition streams. And like all the other major wireless carriers, AT&T might slow your data connection if you use more than 22GB of data in a month. If you're looking to save even more money and you don't mind surfing the net at slower speeds, you could consider the Unlimited Choice plan, which costs $115 for two lines. But keep in mind there are big caveats to this plan. Video streaming is only done at a lower-quality resolution. There's no hotspot feature. And all internet speeds are limited to 3 Mbps. And if you use more than 22GB of data in a given month, AT&T will slow you down even more. The good news for you is that the unlimited-data-plan-wars mean you don't have to be held hostage to AT&T's old unlimited data offer. Now you have the freedom to try another carrier without the fear of losing that unlimited data if it doesn't work out. And truth be told, you'll actually get a better deal from any of the other three major wireless carriers if you switch. With Sprint you can get two lines of unlimited data for $90 a month.

 ,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - Moody’s credit rating agency lowered its outlook for the U.S. telecommunications industry to negative from stable on Thursday  amid growing price competition for wireless services. Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer Mark Stodden forecast in a report that U.S. aggregate wireless industry cash flows would fall by 2 percent in 2017. Analysts have said that the industry’s push to compete on unlimited data plans could hurt profit margins, putting more pressure on carriers to control costs. In a shift in the price wars among the four biggest U.S. wireless carriers, Verizon Communications Inc last month said it would once again offer an unlimited pricing plan. Verizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would be making the offer for the first time in more than five years. AT&T Inc , T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp all responded by sweetening their existing unlimited data plans. The Moody’s Corp report said T-Mobile’s strategy has “pushed its bigger peers to an unhealthy level of competition” and said the expansion of unlimited data plans would reduce the industry’s long-term revenue growth potential. At the same time, the new data plans will prompt more data usage and require more capital spending by carriers, Moody’s said, predicting a 7 percent growth in capital investment to fund network traffic volumes this year. The report predicts flat aggregate industry cash flow in 2018 after strong cash flows in 2015 and 2016. The shift is “in response to competitive pressures, with Verizon and AT&T now responding more deliberately, particularly to T-Mobile’s relentless marketing and expanding market share.” Stodden also said cable firms could pose an additional threat. Cable operators Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc have said they will launch wireless services on Verizon’s airwaves in 2017 and 2018, respectively. A tie-up of Sprint and T-Mobile “would reduce price pressure and provide a path back to aggregate industry cash growth,” the report said. Moody’s puts the odds of Trump administration regulators approving a tie-up at around one in three. Reuters reported on Feb. 17 that SoftBank Group Corp  is prepared to cede control of Sprint Corp to Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile to clinch a merger of the two U.S. carriers, citing people familiar with the matter. SoftBank has not yet approached Deutsche Telekom to discuss any deal because U.S. regulators imposed strict anti-collusion rules during an airwaves auction. After the auction ends in April, the parties are expected to begin negotiations. In 2014, SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T-Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U.S. regulators.

 ,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"(Reuters) - U.S. electronics chain RadioShack Corp filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday for the second time in a little over two years, faced with a challenging retail environment and an unsatisfying partnership with wireless provider Sprint Corp. The Chapter 11 filing comes after RadioShack, owned by General Wireless Operations Inc, tried to revitalize its business by co-branding stores with the wireless carrier in an effort to compete against their largest rivals. General Wireless, which acquired the RadioShack brand in 2015, listed assets and liabilities in the range of $100 million to $500 million in the U.S. bankruptcy court for the Delaware district. RadioShack will close approximately 200 stores and will evaluate options on the remaining 1,300, the company said in a statement. Sprint will convert several hundred locations into Sprint corporate-owned stores, the wireless provider said in a separate statement. RadioShack’s bankruptcy filing and subsequent store closings are not material to Sprint’s overall sales results, Sprint added. RadioShack, a nearly 100-year-old chain that captured the heart of electronics enthusiasts for its specialty products such as “walkie talkies”, first filed for bankruptcy in 2015 after the rise of mobile phones caught it off-guard and customers abandoned its stores for big box competitors including Best Buy Co Inc and Amazon.com Inc. In an attempt to keep the doors open on 1,740 stores, RadioShack struck a partnership with Sprint during its bankruptcy, inviting the mobile carrier to co-brand with the company and set up smaller stores within its own. At the time, Sprint viewed RadioShack’s retail footprint as a way to quickly scale up its own business and RadioShack hoped to benefit from increased liquidity in the form of rent and commission payments from Sprint. But, in the years since RadioShack has emerged from bankruptcy, both Sprint and RadioShack have been challenged. Sprint, whose network is viewed by analysts as inferior to the country’s largest carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, has been forced to offer heavy discounts to grow its business. Sprint’s challenges, which led to sales dropping “precipitously” toward the end of last year, meant RadioShack received less than expected in commission, RadioShack said in papers filed on Wednesday. “The Sprint relationship did not yield the benefits” RadioShack was anticipating, it said. RadioShack, meanwhile, has struggled to compete against internet behemoth Amazon.com and for the attention of shoppers who increasingly wait for deep discounts before making a purchase. The influx of cheaper copycat consumer products manufactured abroad has also hurt the business. Still, in the years since its first bankruptcy, RadioShack has focused on expanding its private label offerings, which include drones, radios and adapters, and now makes up the majority of its business. The shift away from selling other retailers’ products to its own has helped it reduce operating expenses and increase gross profit. ","

Daniel B. Kline,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Picking Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) over Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) would require believing that both companies would have a major change in direction ahead. Frontier has been sputtering since its $10.54 billion purchase of what were once Verizon's wireline customers in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). Since closing that deal on April 1, Frontier has disappointed. The company has lost subscribers in all three quarters since it purchased the CTF properties, and while it has achieved significant cost savings from roughly doubling in size, there are legitimate concerns it may not be able to reverse its subscriber loss. Verizon, for its part, has not been perfect. The company has been adding customers, but total revenue declined 4.3% in 2016. Still, while Frontier lost $373 million in 2016, almost double its $196 million loss in 2015, Verizon remains decidedly profitable. The company saw its earnings per share dip from $4.38 in 2015 to $3.22 in 2016, a number it expects to be ""fairly consistent with 2016,"" according to its Q4 earnings release. Both of these companies are struggling with at least some of the same problems. Consumers have more choices, and that creates pricing as well as service pressure. Verizon isn't flying as high as it once was, but Frontier has yet to show that it can actually make money. FTR data by YCharts When you're thinking about buying a stock, it's sometimes worth considering where you'll be buying in. Frontier, for example, has been heading steadily in the wrong direction. That slide has been well earned, because so far, through three quarters of owning the CTF properties, very little has gone right. In Q4, Frontier saw its total residential customer base drop from 5.03 million at the end of Q3 to 4.89 million to close the year. That's a drop of 144,000 subscribers, not appreciably different from the 155,000 lost in Q3. In addition, Frontier's business-customer base dropped by 16,000, and it lost 96,000 broadband customers as well as 84,000 video subscribers. That compares with a loss of 12,000 business customers, 99,000 broadband homes, and 92,000 video subscribers in the previous quarter. Average revenue per residential user, which climbed in Q2 after the Verizon deal was completed, has dropped in Q3 and Q4. In addition, overall revenue has fallen steadily, which makes sense, given fewer subscribers and falling revenue per remaining subscriber equation. Where the company has succeeded is in delivering cost-saving efficiencies from the acquisition. It has steadily increased its annualized cost synergy target since taking over the CTF properties. Currently, that number stands at ""$1.6 billion, with $1.25 billion to be realized by end of Q1 2017, and $1.6 billion by end of Q2 2018,"" according to the Q4 earnings release. It's in that operating efficiency where you can make a case for Frontier. Its CEO, Dan McCarthy, has shown a strong ability to manage the company well, and if he can deliver the subscriber turnaround he has promised (and failed to deliver on) for the past two quarters, then the upside here could be high. Verizon stock has much less risk. Image source: Verizon. Verizon may struggle in a changing climate that pushes its margin and profit down. It's unlikely, however, that the company will see a major collapse in its revenue, and it's possible that after a transition it will return to revenue growth. Frontier, on the other hand, is a boom-or-bust proposition. The company may not have hit bottom, but it can certainly see it, and it's either going to make a roaring comeback or sell its currently dwindling-value assets at a less-than-premium price. The company has recently revised its revolving credit line to buy it more time to create its turnaround. It won't take much more than the next year to see if McCarthy can deliver subscriber growth (which would allow it to stay on its own) or at least stabilize things (which would at least allow for a sale at a premium price). Going forward, however, while Verizon has a much pricier stock, it's also the better value. The company has much less downside risk and a better chance of getting things moving in the right direction. Verizon's not going to go bankrupt or be sold under distress. There's a stronger chance that happens with Frontier than with the company actually managed to reverse its negative trends. ","
      
    Better Buy: Verizon Communications Inc. vs. Frontier Communications -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is the last of the four major U.S. wireless carriers to succumb to the pressure and offer an unlimited data plan. For the longest time, Verizon resisted pressure from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) to offer an unlimited plan. As recently as the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, CFO Matt Ellis said, ""That's not something we feel we need to do,"" when asked about unlimited data plans. But Verizon finally made the move, and it has both positives and negatives for investors. What should investors expect, and will the new unlimited plan from Verizon produce positive returns? Image source: Verizon It's only been a few weeks since Verizon launched its unlimited plan, but a lot of people have been signing up. ""We've seen a pretty huge rush to unlimited,"" President of Operations John Stratton said at a Deutsche Bank conference earlier this month. Early demand may be strong enough to break Verizon's two-year streak of postpaid phone subscriber losses in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, Verizon lost 138,000 postpaid phone subscribers, and it lost 8,000 in 2016 during the first quarter. Combined with a promotion for a free iPhone 7, Verizon should be able to post a positive number in the first quarter this year. Stratton also said, ""The first guys that you see come across are typically the ones who benefit greatest sort of on their bottom of the bill."" In other words, customers who were paying more for a limited data bucket are the first to switch to the unlimited data plan. Therefore, Verizon could see a dip in its average revenue per user (ARPU), which has already come under pressure as customers switch to device installment plans and hold onto their phones longer. Verizon's plan pricing is also feeling pressure from lower-priced competitors like T-Mobile and Sprint. In the long run, however, Stratton says: ""This is not a dilutive thing from an ARPU perspective. We think it's at least an even play because of where we priced it and how we laid it in."" Verizon maintains it will return to service revenue growth by next year. With every major U.S. wireless provider offering unlimited data now, the conversation is no longer about how much data you get, but about network quality. This is an area where Verizon shines. It's ranked at the top of RootMetrics' surveys for three years straight. Its pricing, while not as low as T-Mobile's or Sprint's, is still competitive, and with its brand and network strength, it should be able to maintain its premium price point. By focusing the conversation on network quality, Verizon is setting itself up to win more customers. People want the best, even if the best is only the best by a little bit. Verizon holds the least amount of spectrum airwaves of the four major U.S. wireless providers. That's unlikely to change even after the recent incentive spectrum auction. In order to maintain its network advantage, Verizon plans to spend a lot of money densifying its network to improve performance in high-population areas. Analyst Craig Moffett expects Verizon to spend $11.3 billion of its $22 billion capital spending budget on its wireless operations. By comparison, he expects T-Mobile and Sprint to spend just $5.1 billion and $3 billion, respectively. But while Verizon may be seemingly outspending its smaller competitors, on a per-subscriber basis, Verizon is spending about the same amount as T-Mobile, although it's still spending significantly more than Sprint. It will be very difficult for Verizon to maintain its network lead without spending even more. There are a lot of puts and takes with Verizon's new unlimited plan. The potential costs in both capital spending and lost service revenue are significant. Still, investors should consider what Verizon's performance would look like without the unlimited plan at all. With the growing demand for more mobile video and social media, Verizon can't afford not to offer unlimited data. It's more important for it to hold onto customers and attract new ones at a slightly lower price than to stand still and watch service revenue decline year after year. ","
      
    Is Verizon's Unlimited Plan Good or Bad for Investors? -- The Motley Fool

Rough times continue for Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) shareholders. The regional telco's stock took a 14.8% hit following a rough close to 2016. Frontier Communications saw revenue clock in at $2.41 billion, a 71% year-over-year pop but short of the 76% advance that analysts were targeting. We need to frame Frontier's growth appropriately for a fair comparison. The $10.54 billion deal  for Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline operations in California, Texas, and Florida added millions of revenue-padding accounts is inflating Frontier's financial performance. The deal closed during the second quarter, so pitting Frontier's fourth quarter to its third quarter is the best gauge, and the sequential comparison is pretty problematic. Revenue slipped from $2.52 million during the third quarter. A chunk of that shortfall came from the resolution of the Verizon-acquired accounts that were determined to deadbeat customers, but there were still sequential declines in both Verizon and its legacy residential accounts. Frontier Communications went from servicing an 5.04 million residential customers at the end of September to 4.89 million three months later. It had 5.23 million residential accounts at the end of the second quarter. Making matters worse, those who did stick around are paying less for service. Average monthly residential revenue per customer has declined from $82.34 to $80.33 between the third and fourth quarters. There was also a sequential dip in its corporate accounts and the average spent by those clients. Image source: Frontier Communications. The news didn't get any better on the bottom line, where Frontier's net loss widened to $0.12 a share. Income investors flocking to Frontier for its juicy dividend -- yielding 14.6% after last week's slide -- should be rightfully worried about the telco's ability to sustain its lofty distributions as organic revenue shrinks and deficits keep mounting. Frontier is tackling its overhead. Frontier expects annualized cost synergies to come to $1.6 billion by the middle of next year, up from its earlier target of $1.4 billion in savings by mid-2019. Volatility has become an old friend for Frontier shareholders. If last week's nearly 15% slide seems fierce, investors suffered a 23% hit for the week when it posted rough third-quarter results three months ago. Frontier stock also hasn't been kind outside of earnings announcements. The shares hit their lowest level in more than a decade on Thursday. JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick downgraded the stock following the rough quarter, taking his rating from overweight to neutral. Frontier's guidance for free cash flow in the year ahead -- eyeing between $800 million and $1 billion adjusted free cash flow for all of 2017 -- is disappointing, and Cusick wonders about the sustainability of its beefy payouts. He is suspending his price target on the stock. Frontier isn't toast. However, there are some real challenges as it tries to upgrade its offerings and its support while still shaving costs. Investors tempted by the fat dividend will want to make sure that the stock doesn't suffer yet another double-digit percentage hit when it reports first-quarter results in a few months. A big dividend isn't a deal if the stock is falling by a lot more than the distributions. ","

Adam Levy,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Sometimes Mr. Market gets confused and prices companies at a premium or discount to their true value. While big companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) historically trade at a discount to the overall market, they're currently trading at an even deeper discount than usual. Verizon's share price has mostly stood still while the market continued to rally over the past year. Apple, meanwhile, is trading around the same P/E ratio as it did at the beginning of last year, while the S&P 500 is trading 21% higher on a P/E basis. Let's look at the numbers and see why both these tech titans are trading at massive discounts. Wall Street might be missing something on these two. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon's P/E ratio for the trailing 12 months is a mere 15.5. On a forward basis, it's just 12.9. That compares with the S&P 500's trailing P/E of 26.9. Verizon is trading at just 0.58 times the P/E ratio of the broader index. The last time it was even below 0.65 was in 2002, when the telecom industry tanked, according to analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Historically, Verizon trades for just an 11% discount. The 42% discount it's trading at today represents a massive buying opportunity for long-term value investors -- not to mention that Verizon is also trading at a lower forward P/E compared with AT&T (NYSE:T), which trades for 14.3 times analysts' 2017 EPS estimates. At the same time, it's worth looking at why Mr. Market is placing such a hefty discount on the wireless carrier. First and foremost, the competition in the wireless industry is increasingly fierce. Pressure from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has finally gotten to Verizon, putting pressure on its pricing. Verizon recently introduced an unlimited-data plan in an effort to compete with the value offered by T-Mobile's plans. AT&T also bowed to the pressure, opening its unlimited-data plan to all customers and dropping the price. Image source: Verizon. However, the strength of Verizon's wireless network and its position on the leading edge of 5G network development give it a significant competitive advantage over the long term. Additionally, its massive retail customer base -- the largest in the U.S. wireless industry -- will continue to throw off cash for its investments in its wireless network and digital advertising and video. That should allow the stock to rise back up toward its usual valuation levels over time. In the meantime, investors can get a juicy 4.6% dividend for their patience. Shares of Apple have been on a tear over the last nine months, increasing 46%. That significantly outpaces the 14% increase the S&P 500 saw in the same period. But Apple was trading for a 35% discount on a P/E basis in 2015 and a 26% discount in 2016. The largest company in the market typically trades for a discount to the S&P 500, but not nearly as deep as Apple's. Over the past 10 years, the average discount for the largest company by market cap was 16% to the S&P 500's P/E, according to BMO Capital's Tim Long. Apple shares traded near that level in 2012, 2013, and 2014, but the market hasn't caught up with the explosion in earnings from the release of the iPhone 6 at the end of 2014. Today, Apple trades around a 25% discount to the S&P 500, below that 16% baseline. While the market is down on Apple's slow iPhone sales growth, there are a few reasons to believe Apple's earnings will continue to expand. The iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple First of all, the company continues to execute on its massive capital returns program. Share buybacks will force earnings per share to increase at a faster rate than net income. Second, Apple's services business continues to grow at a strong pace. Services revenue is higher margin than Apple's core revenue. As such, it has an outsize impact on Apple's profit growth. Investors looking for value have two great options with Verizon and Apple. While the latter is trading at an all-time high, it still has room to run. Meanwhile, Verizon is trading at historic lows while maintaining strong competitive advantages, indicating it should outpace the market from here. ","

Dividend-paying stocks as a group tend to hold up better during recessions and market crashes than their non-dividend counterparts, and tend to perform better over long periods of time. Since choosing individual stocks isn't right for everyone, there are some solid exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, investors can use to get dividend stock exposure in their portfolios. Two high-paying options are the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) and the WisdomTree High Dividend Fund (NYSEMKT:DHS), so here's a look at the similarities and differences between them. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which currently includes 412 stocks with above-average dividend yields, and specifically excludes real estate investment trusts (REITs). As of this writing, the fund pays a 2.8% dividend yield. Image Source: Getty Images. As I mentioned, the fund has more than 400 stocks in its portfolio, but it is somewhat ""top heavy"", meaning that the fund's largest holdings make up a large portion of its assets. In fact, the 10 largest stock holdings account for nearly one-third of the Vanguard fund's assets. Here's a breakdown of the fund's 10 largest positions, and how much each one accounts for: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets Microsoft 2.43% 5.4% ExxonMobil 3.62% 3.8% Johnson & Johnson 2.59% 3.4% JPMorgan Chase 2.09% 3.4% Wells Fargo 2.59% 3.1% General Electric 3.20% 2.9% AT&T 4.67% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 2.96% 2.6% Chevron 3.82% 2.3% Verizon Communications 4.62% 2.2% Source: Vanguard. Dividend yields are current as of 3/7/17. The Vanguard High Dividend ETF has $25 billion in assets under management, and has a rock-bottom 0.08% expense ratio. This means that on a $10,000 investment, the annual fees and fund expenses you'll pay are just $8. The WisdomTree High Dividend Fund has a similar objective as the Vanguard product. It aims to track the performance of the WisdomTree High Dividend Index, a proprietary index of high-dividend U.S. companies that contains 439 stocks as I write this, just slightly more than the Vanguard fund's underlying index. The WisdomTree fund is significantly smaller, with just $1.3 billion in assets under management and a 0.38% expense ratio. Currently, the fund's dividend yield is about 3.2%. And just like the Vanguard fund, the WisdomTree High Dividend Fund's 10 largest holdings account for about one-third of the fund's assets, although the composition is different: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets AT&T 4.67% 4.6% ExxonMobil 3.62% 4.2% Johnson & Johnson 2.59% 3.5% Verizon Communications 4.62% 3.3% Chevron 3.82% 2.9% Pfizer 3.73% 2.9% Philip Morris 3.79% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 2.96% 2.9% Wells Fargo 2.59% 2.8% General Electric 3.20% 2.8% Source: WisdomTree. Dividend yields are current as of 3/7/17. As you can see, there is quite a bit of overlap between the two. There are eight stocks that are on both top-10 lists. While these funds are similar in many ways, there are a couple of key differences worth mentioning. The Vanguard fund has a significantly lower expense ratio (0.08% vs. 0.38%). Although I wouldn't call either fund's expense ratio excessive, Vanguard's is clearly the lower-cost option. This may seem like a small difference, but it can really add up over a period of several decades. On the other hand, the Vanguard fund specifically excludes REITs, while they are a big part of the WisdomTree Fund's underlying index. I've written many times about the long-term growth power of REITs, so for an investor like me, this can be a big plus. As of this writing, about 12% of the WisdomTree fund's assets are invested in the real estate sector, which could account for its slightly higher dividend yield. In terms of strategy and diversification, these funds are quite similar, even down to the number of stocks each one invests in and the respective dividend yields of each. However, the Vanguard fund is cheaper and the WisdomTree fund includes the real estate sector. While it's difficult to call one of these a better fund product than the other, the cost advantage of the Vanguard High Dividend ETF is the deciding factor for me. However, I have ample REIT exposure elsewhere in my portfolio -- if I didn't, I may be more willing to pay the WisdomTree fund's higher expense ratio. ","

Also Read:  Nobody thinks Snap stock is worth the price Adam Smith, who serves as futures director of GroupM, the parent company of WPP, said the company has recently opened an ad agency in Seattle, where Amazon is based, to “deal with Amazon and cater to Amazon” as the company’s gains for advertising steam. WPP views digital media companies such as Google and Facebook as “frenemies.” It must work with them to meet its clients’ digital ad needs, but also continues to lose traditional advertising share to lower-margin digital advertising, which is weighing on its business.

 ,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"(Reuters) - Ligado Networks, the wireless satellite venture formerly known as LightSquared Inc that emerged from bankruptcy in 2015, is working with financial advisers to explore strategic alternatives, according to people familiar with the matter. Another possibility under consideration is finding a new equity investor through a private placement, the people added, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. Representatives for Ligado, Goldman Sachs and PJT declined to comment. Ligado’s move to explore options comes as the company awaits approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow it to use a portion of wireless airwaves in the so-called mid-band, which are spectrum frequencies that the company has said will help the telecom industry adopt 5G networks. 5G technology promises to be ten times to 100 times faster than current speeds. Ligado’s efforts to attract a new investment may be stymied by its large debt load, and uncertainty over the FCC’s approval for some of its wireless airwaves, according to the sources. Ligado exited bankruptcy in December 2015 with $1.5 billion in senior debt and $2.9 billion in junior debt, according to bankruptcy court documents. The company’s junior debt has recently been trading well below face value, at about 79 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, indicating investor concerns about full repayment. Backed by hedge fund manager Philip Falcone, LightSquared originally planned to build a nationwide wireless network when the FCC proposed to suspend its plans in 2012, saying that the network it was building interfered with global positioning systems (GPS), included ones used by the military. This pushed it into bankruptcy in May 2012. It has since reached agreements with some of the GPS makers. Financial advisers for Ligado pegged the company’s spectrum as worth between $4.5 billion and $6.8 billion during the bankruptcy, based on a certain method of valuing that type of asset, according to bankruptcy court papers.

 ,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government has criminally charged Russian spies for cyber offences. The charges came amid a swirl of controversies relating to alleged Kremlin-backed hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible links between Russian figures and associates of U.S. President Donald Trump. This has given rise to uncertainty about whether Trump is willing to respond forcefully to any action by Moscow in cyberspace and elsewhere. The 47-count Justice Department indictment included charges of conspiracy, computer fraud and abuse, economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, access device fraud and aggravated identify theft. It painted a picture of the Russian security services working hand-in-hand with cyber criminals, who helped spies further their intelligence goals in exchange for using the same exploits to make money. “The criminal conduct at issue, carried out and otherwise facilitated by officers from an FSB unit that serves as the FBI’s point of contact in Moscow on cyber crime matters, is beyond the pale,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord said at a press conference announcing the charges. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) is the successor to the KGB. The Kremlin, which denies Russia tried to influence the U.S. election in any way, said on Thursday Moscow had received no official notification of the indictment, but hoped it would. However, Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, dismissed out of hand the idea that FSB employees could have been involved in the Yahoo hack. “We have said repeatedly that there can be no discussion of any official involvement of any Russian agency, including the FSB...in any unlawful cyber activities,” said Peskov, who has cast U.S. allegations against Russia as part of a political campaign to kill off a U.S.-Russia rapprochement. Yahoo said when it announced the then-unprecedented breach last September that it believed the attack was state-sponsored, and on Wednesday the company said the indictment “unequivocally shows” that to be the case. The charges announced Wednesday are not related to the hacking of Democratic Party emails during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have said they were carried out by Russian spy services, including the FSB, to help the campaign of Republican candidate Donald Trump. The indictment named the FSB officers involved as Dmitry Dokuchaev and his superior, Igor Sushchin, who are both in Russia. Dokuchaev was arrested for treason in December, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. Reuters sent a request for comment to the FSB in Moscow on Wednesday evening but there was no response. The alleged criminals involved in the scheme include Alexsey Belan, who is among the FBI’s most-wanted cyber criminals and was arrested in Europe in June 2013 but escaped to Russia before he could be extradited to the United States, according to the Justice Department. Karim Baratov, who was born in Kazakhstan but has Canadian citizenship, was also named in the indictment. The Justice Department said Baratov was arrested in Canada on Tuesday. Mark Pugash of Toronto police later confirmed the Tuesday arrest. McCord said the hacking campaign was waged by the FSB to collect intelligence but that the two hackers used the collected information as an opportunity to “line their pockets.” The United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, but McCord said she was hopeful Russian authorities would cooperate in bringing criminals to justice. The United States often charges cyber criminals with the intent of deterring future state-sponsored activity. The administration of former President Barack Obama brought similar charges against Chinese and Iranian hackers who have not been extradited. In a statement, White House spokesman Michael Anton said the charges “are part of a broad effort across the government to defend the United States against cyber attacks and cyber-related crimes.” Yahoo in December announced another breach that occurred in 2013 affecting one billion accounts. Special Agent Jack Bennett of the FBI’s San Francisco Division said the 2013 breach is unrelated and that an investigation of that incident is ongoing. At least 30 million of the Yahoo accounts in the 2014 breach were the most seriously affected, with Belan able to burrow deep into their accounts and take user contact lists that were later used for a financially motivated spam campaign, according to the indictment. Belan also stole financial information such as credit card numbers and gift cards, it said. Yahoo had previously said about 32 million accounts had fallen victim to the deeper attack, which it said leveraged forged browser cookies to access accounts without the need for a password. According to the indictment, FSB officers Sushchin and Dokuchaev also directed Baratov to use the information gained in the Yahoo breach to hack specific targets who possessed email accounts with other service providers, including Google. When Baratov was successful, Dokuchaev would reward him with a bounty, the indictment charged. Examples where Google accounts were targeted include an assistant to the deputy chairman of the Russian Federation, an officer of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and a physical training expert employed by the Russian government. Details in the indictment reflect the often murky relationship in Russia between criminal hackers and government intelligence officers. Interpol issued a “red notice” on Belan in relation to an earlier hacking campaign, according to the indictment. Instead of arresting Belan, however, the FSB recruited him to help with cyber espionage and provided tools to evade detection from other authorities. Belan later gained unauthorized access to Yahoo’s network that he shared with FSB, the indictment said. ","

Donna Fuscaldo,03162017,Investopedia,03092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) detailed what life will be like once its sale of its core internet assets to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is complete in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Monday, naming the new CEO and disclosing the value of outgoing CEO Marissa Mayer’s golden parachute. As previously announced, the new company will be named Altaba, which is a play on the word alternate combined with the name Alibaba, as the remaining venture will encompass Yahoo's foreign assets, which includes a stake in Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Holding Group Inc. (BABA) and Yahoo Japan. Altaba will be left with a 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan and a 15% stake in Alibaba, as well as a portfolio of patents under the Excalibur name. Leading the new company, which in essence becomes a holding company for the investments, is Yahoo board member Thomas McInerney. McInerney, formerly the chief financial officer for IAC/InterActiveCorp., has been a board member since 2012 and sat on the independent board committee charged with selling Yahoo’s core internet assets. McInerney will get base salary of $2 million annually and incentive pay based on performance goals. Yahoo also disclosed in the filing that outgoing CEO Mayer will get $23 million once the deal is closed and will not play a role in the new standalone company. It's not clear if she will have a role at Verizon once the deal is complete. Her golden parachute includes close to $3.02 million in cash and roughly $20 million from restricted stock units. Yahoo said in the filing the $23 million doesn’t include close to 2.9 million vested stock options worth $56.8 million. In the same filing, Yahoo, which had been renegotiating its deal with Verizon ever since it disclosed two massive data hacks that may have impacted more than 1 billion user accounts, said Verizon had wanted a $925 million reduction in the price tag and that the deal will close during the second quarter of 2017. In late February, the two sides agreed to reduce the sale price by $350 million and to share in any legal liabilities that come from Yahoo’s data breaches. (See also: Revised Deal: Verizon to Pay $350M Less for Yahoo.) In September, Yahoo disclosed the first of two massive breaches, revealing that a ""state-sponsored acto""r stole information from as many as 500 million user accounts. Yahoo said the stolen information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and hashed passwords. That breach happened in 2014. In December, Yahoo disclosed another larger breach of potentially 1 billion user accounts. In that case, the breach occurred in 2013. ",Yahoo: Life After Sale of Core Internet Assets | Investopedia
 ,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"Verizon Communications sought almost triple the price reduction that it ultimately obtained for Yahoo's core assets following two massive cyber attacks at the internet company, according to a Yahoo filing. The closing of the deal, which Verizon first announced in July for a purchase price of $4.83 billion, had been delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from two data breaches that Yahoo disclosed last year. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier had been trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the agreement following the attacks. In early February, Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam told Yahoo director Tom McInerney a price reduction as high as $925 million could be appropriate, according to the filing. McInerney later told McAdam at a meeting in Verizon's New York offices that Yahoo's board was unwilling to agree to such a big discount. Verizon said in late February it had agreed to a purchase price of $4.48 billion, lowering its original offer by $350 million. A Verizon spokesman declined to comment on why it agreed to a lower discount that it had sought. The filing also said Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer would get a severance package of $23 million if she were terminated.

Giovanny Moreano,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"The second-strongest bull market in history may be about to hit a wall as inflation ticks up, a feat that in the past caused stocks to underperform, according to Jefferies. ""Higher inflation has not been a good thing in the past for equity markets, as performance generally weakens as inflation rises. A faster pace of rising inflation could bring about more rate hikes, which also weakens returns,"" Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, wrote in a research note. In a study released Thursday, the investment firm analyzed the market's performance going back to 1948 versus measures of inflation and found an inverse correlation between the two variables. ""As inflation ticks higher, small, mid, and large [cap companies] tend to weaken and vice versa. Inflation heading higher means that interest rates should also rise, and thus valuations for equities falls,"" McCarthy wrote.

T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) new unlimited data plan, T-Mobile One, has caused a lot of changes in the wireless industry. Every major U.S. carrier has responded to the new plan's introduction last autumn. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) was the biggest holdout, but it finally started offering an unlimited data plan last month. The new plan from Verizon is priced slightly higher than T-Mobile's, but Verizon is promoting the strength of its network in order to justify the higher pricing. As T-Mobile's marketing campaigns had been targeting Verizon for charging overages, it's now forced to battle the big carriers on the basis of its network quality and pricing. That's one less area of attack for T-Mobile. Recently, T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter spoke at a Deutsche Bank conference and talked about how Verizon's new plan impacted the Un-Carrier. Image source: Verizon T-Mobile has consistently seen a net add in subscribers against all three of its major competitors for the last several years. The company regularly reports its porting ratios -- the number of customers that switch to T-Mobile vs those switching from it -- with each of the wireless carriers every quarter. Prior to the introduction of Verizon's unlimited plan, T-Mobile's porting ratio with Verizon was the highest ever in the first quarter -- around 3 to 1, according to Carter. After Verizon launched its unlimited offering, ""For four days we went slightly negative. You know, in the 0.9. I think one day it was in the 0.8's,"" Carter said. ""On the fifth day, it started getting back up into positive territory."" Porting ratios have improved every week since. In the first week of March, Carter reported porting ratios around 1.5. Last week, that climbed into the 2-to-1 range. In the first quarter last year, T-Mobile posted a 1.34 porting ratio with Verizon. Even with a few tough weeks, T-Mobile may still be able to post significantly higher porting ratios with Verizon, despite the competitor's best efforts. One of the biggest factors in T-Mobile's ability to add net subscribers every quarter is its ability to reduce churn -- the percentage of subscribers canceling every month. From 2013 to 2016, churn fell from 1.69% to 1.30%. Last year, T-Mobile climbed to the top of Nielsen Mobile Inisghts' customer satisfaction survey. So, when Verizon launched its unlimited plan, fewer T-Mobile subscribers were actually looking to switch. The biggest factor increasing customer loyalty is T-Mobile's various Un-carrier initiatives. Its latest move centered around pricing. Not only did T-Mobile start including taxes and fees in its advertised pricing, it's giving customers the option to keep their pricing the same for the life of their relationship with the wireless carrier. Some customers don't want to risk trying Verizon and then being unable to return to their current T-Mobile plan at their current pricing. Meanwhile, T-Mobile is giving potential customers every reason to switch and lock in its best pricing. T-Mobile is running a promotional offer for two unlimited lines for $100 per month following the introduction of Verizon's unlimited plan. Earlier this month, customers could have gotten a third line free. Again, the prices are good as long as customers keep the same plan. T-Mobile is making sure it offers the best value in wireless, so its customers have no reason to look elsewhere. From the downward trend in customer churn, it looks like it's working, even as the competition starts fighting back. ","

For the past three quarters, Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) has produced disappointing results. In fact, since the company purchased Verizon's wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF), customer counts have steadily dropped for the internet and cable company. That $10.54 billion deal more or less doubled the size of the company, giving it not only, 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband subscribers, and 1.2 million FiOS video customers, but also the size needed to operate more efficiently. Parts of the deal have worked out, but Frontier has been bleeding subscribers for all three quarters since the purchase closed, losing 144,000 residential customers and 14,000 business subscribers in Q4 alone. The company's stated reason for that continued decline keeps changing. In Q2 and Q3, CEO Daniel McCarthy blamed suspended marketing efforts, due to the company's desire to solve problems for its existing customers before attracting new ones. In Q4, he said that getting rid of subscribers who had not been paying caused the drops. In the Q3 earnings release, McCarthy said he expected a return to normal, and the company wrote that it ""anticipates improved customer additions in the fourth quarter."" In the Q4 release, McCarthy talked about dropping non-paying customers, something that had not been mentioned in previous releases or earnings calls. ""Results for the fourth quarter were impacted by our intensified efforts to resolve acquired accounts in California, Texas and Florida that we have determined to be non-paying,"" he said, promising that improvements would come. ""This process is almost complete, and we expect to return to a normalized trend by the start of the second quarter."" Aside from losing subscribers though, McCarthy and Frontier are doing many things right. But this doesn't mean investors should ignore this glaring problem. Frontier has lost cable, along with broadband customers. Image source: Frontier. The company knows how to be efficient. One of the goals of the Verizon purchase was to allow the company to spread its expenses out over more customers, and lower its overall operating costs. That part of the deal has worked out perfectly. ""We now expect annualized cost synergies of $1.6 billion to be achieved by mid-year 2018, up from the $1.4 billion target outlined in the 2016 third quarter earnings report, and a full year earlier than anticipated,"" McCarthy said in the Q4 earnings release. ""We expect $1.25 billion of the $1.6 billion in synergies will be achieved by the end of the first quarter of 2017, which is a quarter earlier than previously announced."" The second thing Frontier does well is manage its financial obligations. Despite the large debt the company incurred buying the CTF properties, its lenders clearly believe it will eventually get things back on track. In Q4, the company announced that it had amended its revolving credit agreements, including a term loan due in 2021, merging them into a single agreement. That new deal not only simplified things, it also pushed the 2021 obligation back to 2022 and extended the term of its revolving credit line from 2018 to 2022. ""These amendments significantly improve and solidify Frontier's finance picture, and provide us with additional flexibility as we transition to normalized operations in the acquired CTF properties over the coming quarters,"" said CFO Perley McBride in the Q4 earnings release. Being well-managed only will get Frontier so far. Cutting expenses and convincing creditors to give you longer terms only works if, at some point, the company stops losing subscribers, and turns its loss into profit. Frontier lost $587 million in 2016, almost twice the $316 million it lost the previous year. That loss comes despite all the savings the company has managed to deliver in operating expenses because of the expanded size it gained in the Verizon CTF deal. If the company has any hopes of a future, its CEO needs to stop finding excuses for losing customers, and show that Frontier can stabilize, and eventually return to growth. ","
      
    2 Things Frontier Communications Does Right -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Both Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) and Sprint (NYSE:S) have dealt with their fair share of problems in the past few quarters. Frontier has been steadily shedding the customers it paid Verizon (NYSE:VZ) $10.54 billion to acquire in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). Since completing that purchase, the cable and internet company has had three quarters where it reported losses not just in cable customers (which would match industry trends) but also in broadband (where its rivals have been gaining). Sprint has not had the same steadily downward trajectory -- it gained customers in its most-recently reported quarter -- but it has fallen into fourth place among the four major wireless carriers. The company has struggled to find an identity or a marketing strategy, and it has been greatly overshadowed by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), which has positioned itself as the consumer-friendly wireless company. These are, as you can see on the chart below, two stocks going in opposite directions. Shareholders clearly like some of what Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure has done, while investors have not liked Frontier CEO Daniel McCarthy's quarterly promises that the customer base will stabilize only for it to keep dropping. Sprint has the needle pointing up, while Frontier does not, but both companies have growth potential. Frontier, in fact, may even have a very simple path to a stock price turnaround. Image source: YCharts. Frontier has seen subscriber drops in each of the last three quarters. In Q4, the company lost 144,000 residential customers. It also saw 14,000 business customers leave, and average revenue per user (ARPU) fell in both categories. McCarthy has attempted to explain that away, saying in Q2 and Q3 that the declines were due to problems related to the cutover, then saying in Q4 that the drops were due to a one-time problem with non-paying customers. The CEO has also been relentless in explaining why, aside from the subscribe loss issue, Frontier has been meeting its goals. ""During the quarter we made significant progress in positioning our company to deliver a better customer experience and improved financial performance, with greater financial flexibility,"" he said in the Q4 earnings release. ""We now expect annualized cost synergies of $1.6 billion to be achieved by mid-year 2018, up from the $1.4 billion target outlined in the 2016 third quarter earnings report, and a full year earlier than anticipated."" Frontier has largely achieved the synergies it said it would from buying the CTF properties. If it can stabilize and eventually grow its subscriber base, not only will its share price grow, but its attractiveness as an acquisition target will improve. Sprint has been using Verizon's former ""Can You Hear Me Now"" guy in its ads. Image source: Sprint. While the company has faltered in recent years, it seems to be moving in the right direction now. Sprint added 368,000 net postpaid subscribers in Q4, its highest total in four years, according to the company. The wireless carrier also has nine straight quarters of growth in that metric, and it has grown revenue for two straight quarters. The negative, and it's a big one, is that the company had a net loss of $479 million in Q3. However, the company has cut annual expenses by $1.6 billion year to date, and it has also seen its scores rise on the well-regarded RootMetrics wireless network quality report for the second half of 2016. ""Sprint is turning the corner,"" said Claure in the earnings release, continuing: Even with all the aggressive promotional offers from our competitors, we were still able to add more postpaid phone customers than both Verizon and AT&T while continuing to grow revenues, take costs out of the business, and improve the network. Sprint has performed admirably, but some of that success has been priced into its stock price. Conversely, Frontier has underperformed, and its shares have tanked accordingly. Going forward, Sprint faces a tougher path. It's not the innovator in its space -- that's T-Mobile -- nor is it the company with the best network (that's Verizon, according to RootMetrics, with T-Mobile tying for first in another leading study). In some cases, Sprint is the cheapest, and that has helped its growth, but there are obvious drawbacks to the strategy of lowering prices to get customers when after the low-cost deal expires, it's relatively easy for them to leave. Both of these companies face tough roads in competitive markets. However, Sprint has already begun its recovery, and it's more likely to hit roadblocks than it is to go steadily upward. Frontier is currently a bargain as long as you believe McCarthy when he says the company will reverse its subscriber losses. If the company can do that when it reports on Q1 in roughly three months, it should see a decent uptick, making it the better buy. ","

Joe Tenebruso,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With interest rates still at historically low levels in most developed economies, the hunt for yield can be a challenging endeavor for investors. Fortunately, there are some high-quality businesses that currently offer dividend yields of more than 3% -- a sizable bounty in a world where interest rates paid by bank deposit accounts and short-term government bonds are often measured in basis points. In this regard, here are two excellent high-yield stocks worthy of your consideration. Image source: Anheuser-Busch InBev. In the world of beer, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) is as dominant as they come. After its recent $100 billion acquisition of its former No. 1 competitor, SABMiller, AB InBev now commands nearly 30% of the global beer market. The combined company has a portfolio of more than 500 beers, including seven of the top 10 global beer brands and 18 brands that generate more than $1 billion in retail sales. AB InBev is now the world's first truly global brewer with operations in virtually every major beer market. And while growth in beer consumption has recently been sluggish in developed markets such as the U.S., the merger with SABMiller gives AB InBev a stronger position in high-growth developing regions, particularly in Africa. AB In Bev has also been snatching up craft beer brands to expand its presence in this fast-growing segment of the massive U.S. market. Although this is still a small portion of its business, it makes the craft beer craze less of a threat than the bears would have you believe. In fact, higher-priced craft beer has made it easier for AB InBev to raise prices for its popular macrobrews, which has helped the company's revenue growth outstrip volume growth in recent years. But where the beer king really excels is in wringing profits out of each beer it sells. 3G Capital -- the Brazilian group that runs AB InBev -- has a strong track record of helping acquired businesses slash costs and boost profits, and investors should expect more of the same in the coming years. In fact, in its fourth-quarter earnings release, management increased its guidance for synergies and cost savings related to the SABMiller merger to $2.8 billion, up from previous estimates of $2.45 billion. The company has already delivered on more than $800 million of that goal, and it expects to realize the remaining $2 billion over the next three to four years. During that time, management will be (wisely) prioritizing debt repayment, so AB InBev's dividend increases may be modest for the next few years. But its current yield is already sizable, at 3.6%, and the dividend should be well secured by the more than $20 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) the company expects to achieve once SABMiller is fully integrated. Even better, with its shares down about 20% from their 52-week highs due largely to some macroeconomic related -- and likely short-term -- struggles in Brazil, AB InBev's stock is currently trading at about 24 times analysts' earnings estimates for 2017 and 21 times 2018's estimates. That's quite a bargain for such a dominant company that's expected to grow earnings by more than 24% over the next half decade. As such, investors may wish to consider taking a sip of AB In-Bev stock today. Like AB InBev, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) offers investors the potential for solid income generation and capital appreciation. The telecom giant's subscription-based, utility-like business generates strong and stable cash flow that it's then able to pass on to shareholders in the form of a steadily rising -- and currently 4.7% -- cash dividend stream. VZ data by YCharts. Verizon's wireless network consistently ranks as the best in the industry, even as rivals such as T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) claim that they're chipping away at Verizon's lead. That ha helped Verizon continue to add postpaid wireless subscribers -- who are generally the most profitable and sought-after customers -- despite heavy promotions from T-Mobile, Sprint, and other competitors. Moreover, after largely ignoring the competition's heavy promotions and competing almost solely on the reputation of its best-in-class wireless network, Verizon has recently moved to meet its challengers head on. The company announced an unlimited data plan that's likely to prove popular with consumers and that could win some customers away from its rivals. At the very least, it should help to preserve Verizon's high customer retention. Verizon is also making moves to diversify its revenue streams. One exciting area of focus is the Internet of Things space, where Verizon is acquiring assets to strengthen its technology and service offerings. The company's IoT ambitions appear promising, with revenue growth from Verizon's IoT services rising 21% year over year on a comparable basis -- and 60% when including acquisitions -- to $243 million in the fourth quarter. Although the business is currently small (by Verizon's standards), the massive potential of the Internet of Things could help this segment grow to become a significant portion of Verizon's revenue and profits in the years ahead. Verizon is also rumored to be considering beefing up its pay-TV assets. Cable giant Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) is one company that's rumored to be a potential acquisition target, but I'd rather see Verizon snatch up Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH). With a market cap of less than $30 billion (compared to nearly $87 billion for Charter), Dish would be much less expensive and likely easier to integrate. Dish's popular Sling TV product is a gem that could help Verizon advance its beachhead in the rapidly growing Internet TV market and expand its popular ""skinny bundle"" offerings. Moreover, obtaining Dish Network's valuable spectrum as part of the deal would be an added sweetener for Verizon. Regardless of whether any of these rumored acquisitions come to fruition, Verizon's core wireless business -- and more than $40 billion in annual EBITDA -- should allow the telecom titan to continue to do what it has done consistently over the past decade: reward its shareholders with steadily growing dividend income. And with its stock trading at only about 12 times forward earnings -- a significant discount to the S&P 500's forward P/E of 18 -- investors can buy this dividend dynamo at a fantastic price today.

    2 Stocks to Buy With Dividends Yielding More Than 3% -- The Motley Fool

  "
Leo Sun,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of AT&T (NYSE:T) recently hit a 16-year high, but that rally has raised concerns that the market is too optimistic about this slow growth stock. The bears note that AT&T's sluggish growth in postpaid wireless customers, the return of unlimited data plans, its elevated debt levels, and uncertainties regarding its proposed buyout of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) could all make the stock a risky bet. While investors should certainly take note of those headwinds, I believe that AT&T remains a solid long-term play for most investors for four simple reasons. AT&T's flagship store in San Francisco. Image source: AT&T. Many investors, including myself, own AT&T for its dividend. The company has raised its dividend annually for over three decades, making it an elite ""dividend aristocrat"" which has hiked its payout annually for over 25 years. AT&T's 4.6% dividend makes it the highest paying income stock in that elite group. Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) 4.7% yield is slightly higher, but it's only raised its dividend annually for ten straight years. AT&T has a payout ratio of 92%, meaning that it spent that percentage of its earnings on dividends over the past 12 months. AT&T's dividend will remain rock solid as long as that percentage remains below 100%. Even if that ratio briefly rises about 100%, AT&T will likely fund the dividends out of it own pockets to retain its ""aristocrat"" title. Over the past few years, many blue chip dividend stocks climbed to historical highs as their valuations rose, meaning their yields dropped to historical lows. Some analysts attributed that shift to low interest rates making bonds look less attractive than dividend stocks. As interest rates rise, those investors may sell their overvalued dividend stocks in exchange for the fixed income security of bonds. I might be worried if AT&T traded at historically high multiples, but that's not the case. Its P/E of 20 remains much lower than its industry average of 25, as well as the mid-30s it reached in late 2015. Analysts expect AT&T to grow its annual earnings at an average rate of 8% over the next five years, giving it a 5-year PEG ratio of 1.8. That isn't below a ratio of 1 -- which would be considered ""cheap"" -- but it's much lower than Verizon's PEG ratio of 6.6, which is calculated from its estimated 5-year annual growth rate of just 2%. Some investors assume that AT&T's ""wireless"" business only refers to the smartphone market, which is slowing down due to competition and the saturation of the North American market. But that business is still growing -- AT&T added 9.5 million wireless customers (6.2 million in the U.S. and 3.3 million in Mexico) in fiscal 2016, which boosted its North American mobile customer base to 147 million. To reduce its dependence on smartphones, AT&T has expanded its wireless ecosystem to include connected wearables, drones, Internet of Things gadgets, and connected cars. The connected car market remains a major growth market for AT&T. Last January, it announced that it would connect up to 10 million Ford vehicles in North America by 2020. A month later, it tested the world's first LTE-connected drones with Intel. AT&T is adding these devices to its multi-device plans, which could increase its revenue per customer while widening its competitive moat. Intel and AT&T's test drone for LTE networks. Image source: Intel. Lastly, AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner will likely be approved, because the FCC -- which the Trump Administration reportedly pushed to block the deal -- isn't overseeing the regulatory review. That's because AT&T and Time Warner structured the deal in a way which avoids the transfer of any FCC licenses. Meanwhile, the Republican-led FTC recently ruled that AT&T and Verizon's ""zero-rated"" sponsored videos (which don't count toward data caps) didn't violate net neutrality -- indicating that regulators could retain a soft stance toward the megamerger. AT&T may need to make some concessions to clear the regulatory hurdles, but the acquisition could enable AT&T to build a zero-rated video ecosystem -- greatly strengthened by Time Warner's media portfolio -- on top of its own wireless networks. When AT&T links that ecosystem to DirecTV, it will control both the content and the pipes in a way that could be tough for rivals like Netflix and Verizon to counter. AT&T is currently my biggest stock holding and accounts for nearly 7% of my portfolio, so I'm confident in the telco's long-term prospects. The company certainly faces near-term headwinds, but I believe that its dividend, valuations, and the expansion of its ecosystem still make it a solid play for conservative income investors.

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend-paying stocks as a group tend to hold up better during recessions and market crashes than their non-dividend counterparts, and tend to perform better over long periods of time. Since choosing individual stocks isn't right for everyone, there are some solid exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, investors can use to get dividend stock exposure in their portfolios. Two high-paying options are the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) and the WisdomTree High Dividend Fund (NYSEMKT:DHS), so here's a look at the similarities and differences between them. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which currently includes 412 stocks with above-average dividend yields, and specifically excludes real estate investment trusts (REITs). As of this writing, the fund pays a 2.8% dividend yield. Image Source: Getty Images. As I mentioned, the fund has more than 400 stocks in its portfolio, but it is somewhat ""top heavy"", meaning that the fund's largest holdings make up a large portion of its assets. In fact, the 10 largest stock holdings account for nearly one-third of the Vanguard fund's assets. Here's a breakdown of the fund's 10 largest positions, and how much each one accounts for: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets Microsoft 2.43% 5.4% ExxonMobil 3.62% 3.8% Johnson & Johnson 2.59% 3.4% JPMorgan Chase 2.09% 3.4% Wells Fargo 2.59% 3.1% General Electric 3.20% 2.9% AT&T 4.67% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 2.96% 2.6% Chevron 3.82% 2.3% Verizon Communications 4.62% 2.2% Source: Vanguard. Dividend yields are current as of 3/7/17. The Vanguard High Dividend ETF has $25 billion in assets under management, and has a rock-bottom 0.08% expense ratio. This means that on a $10,000 investment, the annual fees and fund expenses you'll pay are just $8. The WisdomTree High Dividend Fund has a similar objective as the Vanguard product. It aims to track the performance of the WisdomTree High Dividend Index, a proprietary index of high-dividend U.S. companies that contains 439 stocks as I write this, just slightly more than the Vanguard fund's underlying index. The WisdomTree fund is significantly smaller, with just $1.3 billion in assets under management and a 0.38% expense ratio. Currently, the fund's dividend yield is about 3.2%. And just like the Vanguard fund, the WisdomTree High Dividend Fund's 10 largest holdings account for about one-third of the fund's assets, although the composition is different: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets AT&T 4.67% 4.6% ExxonMobil 3.62% 4.2% Johnson & Johnson 2.59% 3.5% Verizon Communications 4.62% 3.3% Chevron 3.82% 2.9% Pfizer 3.73% 2.9% Philip Morris 3.79% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 2.96% 2.9% Wells Fargo 2.59% 2.8% General Electric 3.20% 2.8% Source: WisdomTree. Dividend yields are current as of 3/7/17. As you can see, there is quite a bit of overlap between the two. There are eight stocks that are on both top-10 lists. While these funds are similar in many ways, there are a couple of key differences worth mentioning. The Vanguard fund has a significantly lower expense ratio (0.08% vs. 0.38%). Although I wouldn't call either fund's expense ratio excessive, Vanguard's is clearly the lower-cost option. This may seem like a small difference, but it can really add up over a period of several decades. On the other hand, the Vanguard fund specifically excludes REITs, while they are a big part of the WisdomTree Fund's underlying index. I've written many times about the long-term growth power of REITs, so for an investor like me, this can be a big plus. As of this writing, about 12% of the WisdomTree fund's assets are invested in the real estate sector, which could account for its slightly higher dividend yield. In terms of strategy and diversification, these funds are quite similar, even down to the number of stocks each one invests in and the respective dividend yields of each. However, the Vanguard fund is cheaper and the WisdomTree fund includes the real estate sector. While it's difficult to call one of these a better fund product than the other, the cost advantage of the Vanguard High Dividend ETF is the deciding factor for me. However, I have ample REIT exposure elsewhere in my portfolio -- if I didn't, I may be more willing to pay the WisdomTree fund's higher expense ratio. ","

The Dogs of the Dow, popularized by Michael Higgins in his book “Beating the Dow,” is an investment style popular with investors who like to keep things simple. Typically, this low-maintenance strategy usually pays off. High yielding stocks have outperformed the Dow with an annual return of 14.3% versus the benchmark’s 11% between 1957 to 2003, according to Investopedia. But high-dividend stocks, like bonds, are sensitive to inflation and higher interest rate and the Dogs may find it increasingly challenging to replicate the success of the previous years with the Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates at its policy meeting on Wednesday. Even the so-called Small Dogs of the Dow—the five cheapest high dividend stocks—are having a tough time of it despite outpacing the Dogs for now, gaining around 4% year to date. This year’s Small Dogs, alternatively known as the Puppies of the Dow, are Cisco Systems Inc.

Kelsey Sheehy,03162017,MarketWatch,03092017,"Published: Mar 16, 2017 1:34 p.m. ET It depends on your situation By This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Congratulations! You picked an internet provider. The hard part is over, right? Well, almost. After you select your speed — and your bundle, if you go that route — you need to make one last decision: Rent a modem and router from your provider or buy your own. Running the numbers makes the decision easy. You need a modem for your internet to work. If you want Wi-Fi, you’ll need a router, too. Internet providers typically charge $10 to $15 a month to lease an all-in-one modem and router. So, over two years, you’ll pay $240 to $360 for your modem-router combo. But you can purchase your own modem and router, separately or in a combo unit, for less than the cost of renting. A Netgear high-speed cable modem-router combo sells for around $70 on Amazon

                                   Cable or Cox Communications. Most tech experts suggest opting for a separate modem and router over a combo unit. The reason: You can get more out of your router — features, settings and power — if it’s a stand-alone unit. Buying your modem and router will save you money in the long run, but there are a few scenarios in which renting makes sense. You have roommates. Splitting the cost of a modem and router is easy. Figuring out how to divvy up the device should one or more roommates move out — not so much. Unless you can settle on a system that works for everyone, renting and splitting the bill will likely save headaches down the road. Your employer foots the bill. Some lucky folks don’t pay for their internet service. Instead, their company pays the monthly bill. They may not pay for equipment, though. If that’s you, don’t dig into your wallet for a new modem. You’re moving soon. If your living situation is temporary, renting might make the most sense. Especially if you don’t know where you’ll land next and what your internet options will be when you get there. That said, if you know those things, you might be able to buy equipment that will work when you settle into more permanent digs. If you’re particularly tech averse, you may also be inclined to rent, since your internet provider may offer free troubleshooting and repair services only on modems leased or purchased through it. Just keep in mind that most modems and routers are easy to set up and require little to no fiddling once they’re up and running. Routers are universal and can be used with any internet service provider. Modems are a slightly different story. First, you need to make sure the modem’s compatible with your internet provider. Most carriers have a list of approved modems on their website and many major providers allow the same devices. So you can often keep your modem if you switch providers, as long as it’s the same type of internet service (cable, DSL or fiber). Some providers, like Verizon Fios, don’t let customers use their own equipment. But Fios customers can opt to buy their modem directly from Verizon,

                                   an option that will save you roughly $90 over two years compared with renting. The next step: Make sure the modem has staying power. This rule applies even if you’re buying it directly from your provider. Internet speeds are only getting faster and older modems — those with DOCSIS 2.0 technology — top out at 38 Mbps download speeds. If you’re paying for internet speeds of 30 Mbps or higher, or think you might in the future, spring for a model with DOCSIS 3.0 technology. These support speeds up to 150 Mbps, which is plenty fast for even the most connected families. Once you’ve settled on a compatible modem, consider buying a used or refurbished model. You’ll save even more money and lose little to nothing in terms of performance. Just make sure you’re clear on the return policy should you have any issues. Buying a modem and router will increase your upfront costs, but lower your monthly internet bill. Most tech experts suggest buying separate devices, but a combo unit will get the job done if you’re trying to keep things simple. Either way, you’ll save money in the long run. And that’s always a smart decision. More from NerdWallet: Kelsey Sheehy is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website. Email: ksheehy@nerdwallet.com. Twitter: @KelseyLSheehy.

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"The vote was along party lines, with 50 Republicans approving the measure and 48 Democrats rejecting it. The two remaining Republicans in the Senate were absent and did not cast a vote. According to the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. The bill next goes to the U.S. House of Representatives, but it was not clear when they would take up the measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was overturning a regulation that “makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment.” But Democratic Senator Ed Markey said, “Republicans have just made it easier for American’s sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared, and sold to the highest bidder without their permission.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules. In a joint statement, Democratic members of the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission said the Senate vote “creates a massive gap in consumer protection law as broadband and cable companies now have no discernible privacy requirements.” The Internet and Television Association, a trade group, in a statement praised the vote as a “critical step towards re-establishing a balanced framework that is grounded in the long-standing and successful FTC privacy framework that applies equally to all parties operating online.” Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for advocacy group Consumers Union, said the vote “is a huge step in the wrong direction, and it completely ignores the needs and concerns of consumers.” ","

,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"(Reuters) - The decision by a handful of high-profile consumer brands to pull advertising from Google’s YouTube over offensive content could threaten the site’s long-term strategy of stealing ad dollars from television, analysts and ad industry professionals said Thursday. The immediate financial impact of the controversy is likely to be limited, in part because a big chunk of YouTube revenue comes from smaller advertisers who lack the budget for TV campaigns and do not have easy alternatives. Some analysts also believe that departing advertisers, eager to reach YouTube’s millennial audience, will quickly return. But with “brand safety” emerging as a major concern for marketers amid a surge in hate speech and other types of offensive content across the internet, the widespread assumption that major advertisers are ready to shift large chunks of their budgets from TV to digital now looks much more dubious. The timing may also favor television networks as they usually present their fall line-ups and woo big advertisers starting in May, agency executives said. “Video is actually a lot more fragile of an ecosystem than the Silicon Valley, software-eats-everything crowd may want to think,” said Joel Espelien, a senior analyst at the Diffusion Group, which studies the future of television. “The point is all content isn’t actually the same, all advertising isn’t actually all the same. There is an element of taste. And when you ruin that, the whole thing does kind of start to fall apart.” Google offers little visibility into YouTube’s financial performance, but analysts view it as a key driver for the company’s growth as its traditional search advertising business matures. Analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets estimates YouTube will bring in about $14 billion in revenue this year. Alphabet shares have fallen more than 3 percent since Monday, closing at $839.65 on Thursday. Whether the recent events are a mere blip on the radar for Google or a harbinger of bigger problems to come may depend on whether the company can quickly improve its technical tools to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. YouTube has begun reviewing its advertising policies and will take steps to give advertisers more control, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. Google also plans to hire more people for its review team and refine its artificial intelligence – a key step, since much of the ad-serving is handled by automation. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, acknowledged in a Fox News interview that ads appearing next to videos promoting hate speech or advocating violence had slipped through the digital cracks in Google’s elaborate ad-serving systems. “We match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match,” Schmidt said. “We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be OK.” But Google’s public statements have done little to assuage advertisers’ fears, said David Cohen, president, North America, for media buying firm Magna Global. Privately, Google has gone into more detail about how it plans to combat the issue, including ratcheting up its algorithms to better categorize content and being more stringent about how content is labeled, Cohen said. But such additional controls would reduce the percentage of content that carries advertising and could disrupt the vibrant community of independent creators on YouTube, who drive traffic to the site and rely on revenue-sharing from advertising. “YouTube has a decade-long head start, but obviously everyone wants a piece of the pie,” he said. Even before the most recent revelations about YouTube, control over online ad placement had become a hot button topic for advertisers. Social networks and news aggregators came under fire during and after the U.S. presidential election for spreading fake news reports, and advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. “Between non-human traffic and fraud, fake news and hate speech, brands are more concerned than ever,” said Marc Goldberg, CEO of Trust Metrics, a New York-based company that addresses ad fraud.

It's been more than two years since Sprint (NYSE:S) and its parent company, Softbank, ended their merger pursuit of T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), after regulators indicated that they would block such a deal. Since then, rumors have continued to pop up that Sprint is still interested in T-Mobile, and the self-proclaimed un-carrier has indicated that it's open to merger talks. When asked whether T-Mobile would be interested in any type of ""convergence"" with a wireless or cable company at the Deutsche Bank investor conference earlier this month, T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter said: ""I really think it's a question of when, and not if. There are significant benefits that we'll see with convergence. Both from a wireless carrier standpoint as well as a broadband cable standpoint."" But it's becoming increasingly clear that T-Mobile would prefer merging with a cable provider, rather than entertain another proposal from a wireless rival. Image source: T-Mobile. Carter mentioned that when cable and wireless providers are integrated, then companies are able to better understand their individual customers. He said that it could ""provide amazing monetization opportunities."" Reports have surfaced that Softbank would cede control of Sprint if a merger with T-Mobile were to go through, but that might not be enough to entice the wireless carrier into another potential regulation quagmire. ""The true career people inside of these agencies don't really change,"" Carter said at the conference. ""The precedents, the tool sets, the type of analysis that they do doesn't really change."" In short, Carter believes that it may not be worth pursuing a consolidation of the U.S. wireless carriers based on its past experiences. T-Mobile's skittishness is understandable when you consider that not only did the 2014 deal fall apart because of regulators, but an earlier proposal from AT&T in 2011 was also thwarted by the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice because the agencies believed that going from four major carriers to three would reduce competition. T-Mobile's CFO indicated that he strongly believes another merger attempt between his company and a wireless provider wouldn't end well. ""While the odds certainly have potentially increased, I don't think it's the least bit probable with high likelihood that you could actually transact, given some of the precedents that are out there,"" Carter said."" Instead, T-Mobile appears to be building the case that its position in providing end-to-end mobility across the entire country would be a perfect fit for a cable provider looking to expand beyond its regional footprint. T-Mobile has expanded its wireless business at a breakneck pace over the past few years, which could make it an even more desirable merger partner. The company added 8.2 million net customer subscribers in 2016 -- marking its third year of 8 million or more net adds -- and is on track to match rival Verizon Communications' 320 million LTE points-of-presence (POPs) coverage by the end of this year. Carter said that cable companies will never be able to deliver truly ubiquitous video content because of their limitation in specific geographical markets, and a wireless merger could fix that. ""And I think that's why, eventually, we'll get to the point where convergence will become a reality,"" he said. The current merger landscape may bode well for T-Mobile, too. AT&T's $85.4 billion deal to acquire Time Warner valued the cable giant at a 35% premium on its stock price before the deal was announced. Of course, there's no guarantee that T-Mobile cold fetch as high of a premium in a merger deal. But T-Mobile's valuation has risen since Sprint first pursued the company, from about $30 billion to its current $51 billion market cap. That puts T-Mobile in a much stronger position to negotiate. And with its current customer growth and strong network presence, there's no reason why T-Mobile would have to settle for a subpar proposal from any potential merger partners. ","

Daniel B. Kline,03232017,Fool,03162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the wireless space, customer loyalty matters, because retaining a customer costs essentially nothing while luring a new one in involves incentives, paying off phone installment contracts, and sometimes offering lower pricing. That's especially true in a mature wireless market. In the United States, cell-phone adoption moved over 90% in 2013, and it inched higher to 92% in 2015, according to data from the Pew Research Center. That means nearly everyone who wants a wireless phone or smartphone already has one. For carriers, that means the only source of new customers in any significant amount is other carriers. It's an industry where the competition for customers is fierce and loyal customers are especially valuable now that consumers can switch providers easily, without losing their number. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) remain the two biggest carriers, followed by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Sprint (NYSE:S). When it comes to loyalty, however, the Brand Keys Customer Loyalty Engagement Index (CLEI) shows a clear winner -- AT&T. Wireless carriers are competing against each for customers. Image source: Getty Images. In markets where consumers believe all brands are equal, then the cheapest or sometimes the most convenient one tends to win the most customers. For example, while some consumers have loyalty to gasoline brands, many don't. That means a lot of people buy gas at the most convenient station or the one with the best price, and sometimes a combination of those two things. The same could be said for a lot of products, but even when two items are similar or even identical, brand loyalty can not only get a customer to buy a certain item, but it can also have that person pay more for it. It's not always a conscious decision. Many of us buy a certain brand of eggs, milk, or cereal out of loyalty (and habit) when a store brand would in many cases be just as good, as well as cheaper. In wireless, AT&T and Verizon, which took second place on the CLEI in wireless, have built a reputation for having better networks than T-Mobile and Sprint, which came in third and fourth, respectively. Those loyalty numbers from Brand Keys also match a key industry metric. Both AT&T, the largest carrier, and Verizon have markedly lower churn rates than Sprint and T-Mobile. In Q3 2016, Verizon posted a 1.26% churn rate -- that is, customers who left the carrier -- while AT&T came in at 1.45%, T-Mobile had 2.27%, and Sprint was fourth with 2.78%. The numbers vary a little from quarter to quarter, but going back all the way to Q1 2013, AT&T and Verizon consistently have lower churn rates than their rivals. That's important, because in recent years, both T-Mobile and Sprint have not only been cheaper than AT&T and Verizon, but they have also pushed unlimited data, which consumers seem to really like. It's only in 2017 that Verizon added unlimited plans and AT&T opened up its unlimited plans to all customers, not just those who also bundled its DirecTV service. CLEI winner AT&T and runner-up Verizon have loyal customer bases, but both companies clearly realize that loyalty only goes so far. T-Mobile has changed the industry, and the top two carriers have had to make changes to respond, such as dropping contracts, offering unlimited plans, and lessening (if not quite eliminating) overages. That has kept those two companies steady, but as T-Mobile CEO John Legere gleefully explained in his company's Q4 earnings release, the Un-carrier is catching up. ""The competition just doesn't get that customers want to come first,"" Legere said. ""That's three years in a row that we've added more than 8 million customers and taken all of the postpaid phone growth in the industry."" That sounds like bragging, and it certainly is, but Legere speaks the truth. His company has been gaining on AT&T and Verizon mostly by offering lower prices and more transparency. The numbers, however, would be a lot worse if more AT&T and Verizon customers were unhappy. The Brand Keys results, coupled with the churn-rate trends, show that they're content. Happy customers who think they're getting a better product, especially in a space where reliability matters such as wireless phones, mostly won't jump carriers just to save money. That doesn't mean AT&T and Verizon can rest on their laurels. T-Mobile and Sprint are cheaper, and Sprint specifically has dedicated a lot of advertising dollars to hammering home the idea that all wireless networks are pretty much equal. For many customers, that's more or less true (and one of the two leading industry studies ranks T-Mobile as tied for Verizon for the top network). Eventually, that could push loyal customers to make a change, but for now loyalty has helped protect AT&T and Verizon against two very aggressive competitors. ","

Ciena (NYSE:CIEN) may be a stock for growth-oriented investors to keep an eye on. The company makes optical networking equipment, along with software and services that help transmit vast amounts of voice, data, and video across networks. Ciena shares had run up from a low of $15.62 last summer to $26.17, but pulled back after the company's most recent earnings report on March 8. In that report (for the first fiscal quarter in 2017), revenues were up 8.4% year over year (but down sequentially) to $621 million, and earnings per share were $0.26, missing analysts' estimates by $0.03. Shares sold off initially, but two analysts -- Wells Fargo's Jess Lubert and Dougherty & Company's Catharine Trebnick -- immediately reiterated outperform ratings after the somewhat disappointing report. Moreover, management pointed the way toward continued growth across its portfolio. Let's dive in to some highlights. Image source: Ciena. Ciena prides itself on having invested early in an open platform with a diverse portfolio -- allowing its networking, data center, and web customers to pick from a variety of products, and add, alter, or drop network elements as necessary, and in a seamless fashion. In the company's 2016 annual report, CEO Gary Smith wrote: Five years ago, we introduced our OPn Architecture, a focused approach to next-generation networks through scalability, programmability and network level applications. Today, OPn has evolved and expanded into our governing philosophy and broader belief system, which is rooted in enabling choice in the market through openness. This bet appears to be paying off, as the company says it now has a leading position in many applications, such as data center interconnect, and multivendor network orchestration, which requires openness and flexibility. Basically, instead of locking its customers into a particular hardware regime, Ciena has invested in a diverse suite of technologies, and opened its technologies up to developers with its Emulation Cloud and DevOps Toolkit. The results seem to be excellent -- at least relative to the industry. Ciena cited recognition as an industry leader in several segments in its annual report. On the latest conference call, the company reiterated that it was growing faster than the market, and should continue to do so. The market, it forecast, is growing in the mid-single digits, so expect high-single-digit growth for Ciena. This appears to be true, especially when you compare Ciena's results to those of competitor Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN). Infinera had a terrible year, and its most recent quarter showed year-over-year growth of negative 30%, a stark contrast from Ciena's 8.4% gain. Ciena has been using its recent strength to take care of its balance sheet. The company reduced its convertible debt by $46 million in the quarter and its term loan by $93 million, though it still has a ways to go as it has $1.25 billion in debt and convertible notes. The company is not necessarily in any danger here -- cash and short-term and long-term investments topped $1 billion, so Ciena should have plenty of cash to pay off the $185 million that comes due in June 2017. Still, the company's ratio of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) to interest expense in 2016 was only roughly 3, so interest expense is taking up a good chunk of potential earnings. Telecom equipment is not the most stable business, so debt reduction could go a long way in de-risking the company. The company grew its Asia-Pacific revenues nearly 60% year over year in the most recent quarter, despite not being in China. Its main growth driver in the Asia-Pacific region is India. As Smith explained on the call, there is a very large build for 4G capability going on in India right now, and Ciena is reaping the gains of seeds it's been sowing in the region for years (transcript via Seeking Alpha): ... this is an investment that we've made dating back 12 years, both in terms of software development teams and market development teams there. It is our fastest-growing country, and we are basically with every single major carrier in India and we are very well positioned for it. So I think it's a multiyear opportunity; it's not just one quick buildout that's getting all the attention, it's across the very broad base of technologies for Ciena. And really it's a market that I think will be very, very high growth for us over multiple years. The Asia Pacific region accounted for about 14% of revenue in the most recent quarter. While Ciena has performed very well in a cyclical, competitive market, it is about to lose a key executive. Francois Locoh-Donou has been with Ciena for almost 20 years, and is currently the company's chief operating officer. However, this year he will take over the reins as CEO of F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV). Smith assured investors on the call that a succession plan was underway and the company has a very deep bench. Nevertheless, someone with the skills to be a CEO will surely be missed, so investors must watch how the company executes going forward. It appears as though Ciena is performing strongly in the market for optical networking gear. Nevertheless, it is losing its COO, and remains subject to the investment cycles of large telcos. AT&T and Verizon make up more than 27% of the company's revenue, so any further slowdown with those clients could be reason for caution. The company currently trades at 39 times earnings, though only 11 times forward estimates, so continued strong growth and increasing margins are built into the current price. Still, those who believe in a renewed cycle for optical networking spend may wish to give Ciena a look. ","

China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) is the biggest telecom company in the world and one of the three most valuable companies in Asia, but its stock is often overlooked by U.S. investors. The telco doesn't offer spectacular price growth, but it's a solid income play which rebounded from some steep market downturns since its IPO in late 1997. I personally own shares of China Mobile, and I think it's a great ""forever"" stock to own for ten simple reasons. Image source: Getty Images. Being the top telco in the world's most populated country naturally gives China Mobile the biggest customer base of any telecom company -- which includes 851 million wireless customers at the end of January, a 3% gain from 829 million customers a year earlier. Within that total, 552 million customers were on 4G networks -- a 65% jump from a year ago. That growth bodes well for China Mobile, since it generates much higher revenues per 4G customer than those on 2G and 3G networks. China Mobile launched a wireline broadband business at the beginning of 2016, and its subscriber base has grown 39% from 58 million last February to 81 million this January. That move might seem unusual, since U.S. telcos like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are eagerly divesting their slower-growth wireline businesses, but it's a smart way for China Mobile to reach more rural customers across the country. It also allows the company to expand its ecosystem and boost its revenue per customer with video, internet, and wireless bundles. China has an internet penetration rate of just 52%, according to Internet Live Stats. That's very low compared to an 89% penetration rate in the U.S. and 91% penetration rate in Japan. It also indicates that China Mobile has plenty of room to continue growing its wireless and wireline customer bases. In February, China Mobile, telecom equipment vendor ZTE, and mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) announced that they would start interoperability testing and outdoor trials for the new 5G specs developed by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) group. Those trials, which will run throughout 2017, will use China Mobile's guidelines, ZTE's base station solutions, and Qualcomm's prototype chips. China Mobile plans to start deployment testing in 2018 and start commercial operations in 2020 -- which should spark fresh revenue growth as 4G customers upgrade their plans. Image source: Getty Images. China Mobile is one of three state-backed telecom companies in China, the other two of which are China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU). The Chinese government occasionally rotates the management at these three companies to prevent one company from marginalizing the other two. That intervention prevents China Mobile from ever becoming a monopoly, but the government backing also gives it a wide safety net during market downturns. The tight relationship between the three telcos enables them to collaborate quickly. In late 2015, the three companies agreed to sell their towers to China Tower for cash and stock, then lease them back to reduce operating expenses. Analysts estimate that the move generated roughly 2.4 billion yuan ($350 million) in savings for China Mobile within the first year. China Mobile has a trailing yield of 3.2%, which admittedly doesn't look as impressive as AT&T and Verizon's 4.6% yields. Its semi-annual payments, which are declared every half year based on earnings growth, are also less frequent than AT&T and Verizon's quarterly payments. But despite those disadvantages, China Mobile has continuously paid dividends for 14 straight years, and its trailing yield has remained between 3% and 5% over the past five years -- which is much higher than the S&P 500's 2% yield. China Mobile's top line growth has slowed down since 2014, but that should just be a momentary lull before it adds more customers and generates more revenues per customer with 4G plans and wireline/wireless bundles. Source: YCharts. Analysts expect China Mobile's revenue to rise 2% this year and 4% next year. That growth rate might look weak, but it compares favorably to AT&T's estimates for 1% sales growth and Verizon's estimates for a 1% sales decline. Lastly, China Mobile trades at just 14 times earnings, which is higher than China Telecom's P/E of 12 but lower than China Unicom's P/E of 51 and the industry average of 18 for foreign telecom companies. That low valuation -- combined with its solid dividend, government backing, and growth opportunities across China -- make China Mobile one of the safest ways to invest in China's long-term growth. The stock may face near-term volatility due to alarmist talk about a trade war between the U.S. and China, but those challenges will likely fade over the next few years. ","

Defining the Internet of Things (IoT) can be simplified down to the connection of everyday things -- like homes, industrial equipment, watches, etc. -- to the internet, for the purpose of collecting data, tracking usage, and automating systems. While it encompasses many technological devices, it's important to remember that the Internet of Things spans across all major sectors. The amount of connected IoT objects will reach 50 billion by 2020 and will be worth $7.1 trillion by that same year. Now that you know a little more about what the IoT is, let's take a look at how companies are using the IoT right now, and a few IoT examples you might not know about. Image source: Getty Images. If you've ever seen an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch or an internet-connected Fitbit fitness tracker, then you're familiar with the Internet of Things. These devices fall into the broader wearable technology market and they're what many people think of when they think of the IoT. Or perhaps you've heard of a Nest programmable thermostat. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns Nest, which makes internet-connected thermostats that you can control via a smartphone or tablet, and learns your heating and cooling preferences the more you use it. Both Alphabet and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also pushing the Internet of Things into homes with their smart home hubs, like Google Home and the Amazon Echo. Both devices use virtual assistants to answer questions, order things online, or connect to door locks, lights, and home security systems. Connected homes are a major part of the consumer side of the IoT, and will bring in $14 billion in revenue this year in the U.S. Smartwatches, internet-connected fitness trackers, and smart home connections are just a few examples of how companies are investing in the IoT. While there are lots of companies betting on the Internet of Things, here's a quick list of some of the biggest players. While much of the IoT may seem like it's focused on consumer devices, most of the growth with come from the enterprise market. Research from BI Intelligence shows that enterprise devices will account for 40% of all 23.3 billion IoT devices by 2019. Agricultural-equipment maker Deere & Company uses internet-connected field equipment, along with sensors, analytics software, and cloud services to track the efficiency of seed planting. This type of agricultural technology is transforming how food is grown and how farmers manage their fields and equipment. Many other non-tech companies are also jumping into the IoT as well. General Electric, the 125-year-old conglomerate, has developed its own analytics software for industrial equipment. GE uses its software to help its customers manage their equipment more efficiently and anticipate when it needs to be fixed. Scottish and Southern Energy uses GE's Reliability Management software to track its equipment and maintain uptime, which saves the company an estimated $3.6 million dollars every year. In order for more devices, equipment, and services to be added to the IoT, new and more sophisticated wireless networks are being developed. Verizon is at the forefront of this change and said last year that its upcoming 5G network will help address the IoT's network needs. Verizon will roll out pilot tests of its 5G network in 11 cities across the U.S. in the first half of this year. While there's often a lot of hype around new technologies, it's clear that companies are already taking the IoT seriously and finding ways to use connected devices and software to offer better products and services. And if this year is any indicator, it appears that now is one of the best times for investors to consider getting on board with this technological shift. ","

Sean Williams,03232017,Fool,03162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks are often the foundation on which the greatest investing and retirement portfolios are built. And there's a good reason for that: They present myriad advantages over companies that don't share a percentage of their profits with shareholders. To begin with, dividend stocks are often a beacon of profitability. Companies don't ordinarily share a percentage of their earnings with investors on a recurring basis if they don't believe those profits are sustainable. Thus, a dividend payment (and especially dividend growth over time) serves as something of fishing hook to lure in income-seeking investors. Image source: Getty Images. Second, dividend stocks can help hedge against the inevitable downward movements in the stock market. The broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) has had 35 corrections totaling at least 10% since 1950, when rounded to the nearest whole number. While dividend income is unlikely to completely eliminate the often short-term pain of a stock market correction, it certainly helps to alleviate some of the sting. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, dividend stocks allow shareholders to grow their wealth through a process known as compounding. Instead of simply pocketing a dividend payout, shareholders have the opportunity of repurchasing more shares of common stock through a dividend reinvestment plan, more commonly referred to as a DRIP. DRIPs usually have no commission attached, sometimes allow for fractional share purchases, and increase your stake of ownership such that you receive a bigger payout and thus more shares of stock, in a repeating pattern. It's a trick that some of the smartest money managers use for their clients to generate wealth. Generally speaking, income investors want to buy into companies with the highest yields possible. But dividend stocks also hold an ironic and somewhat dark truth: The higher the yield, the greater the risk for disappointment. Dividend yields are ultimately just a function of a company's share price. Dividend yields don't tell us a whole lot about the quality of the dividend (i.e., if it's sustainable) or the earnings power behind the dividend. If a company has a failing or struggling business model and its share price falls considerably, it could artificially inflate the dividend yield and make it appear far more tempting than it should be. In simpler terms, the higher the yield, the more likely you could be falling into a high-yield dividend trap. Are you chasing a high-yield dividend trap? Image source: Getty Images. Admittedly, not all high-yield dividend stocks are necessarily bad news. The corporate structure of real estate investment trusts (REITs) ensures that they pay out at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of a dividend in order to qualify for preferential tax treatment. This means REITs, limited partnerships, and other specialized tax structures can offer substantially higher-than-average dividend yields (the average yield of the S&P 500 is around 2%) and have them be remarkably sustainable. However, the data is pretty clear that high-yield dividend stocks are nowhere near as sure a thing as you'd be led to believe. According to data released last summer by Mellon Capital, the realized dividend yield of high-yield S&P 500 dividend stocks between 1996 and 2015 was often much lower than investors expected. According to Mellon Capital and FactSet Research Systems' data, S&P 500 stocks with an average yield of greater than 16% had a realized dividend yield of just over 3% when all was said and done. In other words, these payouts weren't very sustainable, and in many cases they were cut considerably. In fact, S&P 500 companies with a projected yield of 3% to 4% had realized yields that topped those with forecast yields of 16%-plus. Overall, the gap between realized dividend yields and forecast yields widened with every 1% step up in yields beginning at the 4% to 5% category. In short, if it seems too good to be true when it comes to a dividend yield, it very well might be. Image source: Getty Images. For instance, telecom company Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) is sporting a 17% dividend yield within the S&P 500. If this were somehow sustainable, investors would be able to double their money on dividend income alone in less than five years. However, this ridiculously high yield masks the underlying problems Frontier is contending with. Frontier has on a few occasions acquired wireline assets from Verizon over the past decade. Though these tend to be higher-margin assets, they also represent a decaying technology given the proliferation of wireless connectivity. As such, Frontier has been facing a quarterly exodus of customers for years. Between its high debt levels and recently disappointing earnings results, it's looking like only a matter of time before Frontier cuts its dividend. And to make matters worse, its share price is down 55% over the last 12 months, meaning its 17% yield isn't doing much to stem the share-price losses tied to the underlying issues in the company. Your best bet when looking for dividend income is to find a stable company that appears to be valued at a discount. High-yield dividend stocks can be a plus for your income portfolio, but only after they've passed a pretty rigorous sniff test that you conduct! ","

                                   Cable or Cox Communications. Most tech experts suggest opting for a separate modem and router over a combo unit. The reason: You can get more out of your router — features, settings and power — if it’s a stand-alone unit. Buying your modem and router will save you money in the long run, but there are a few scenarios in which renting makes sense. You have roommates. Splitting the cost of a modem and router is easy. Figuring out how to divvy up the device should one or more roommates move out — not so much. Unless you can settle on a system that works for everyone, renting and splitting the bill will likely save headaches down the road. Your employer foots the bill. Some lucky folks don’t pay for their internet service. Instead, their company pays the monthly bill. They may not pay for equipment, though. If that’s you, don’t dig into your wallet for a new modem. You’re moving soon. If your living situation is temporary, renting might make the most sense. Especially if you don’t know where you’ll land next and what your internet options will be when you get there. That said, if you know those things, you might be able to buy equipment that will work when you settle into more permanent digs. If you’re particularly tech averse, you may also be inclined to rent, since your internet provider may offer free troubleshooting and repair services only on modems leased or purchased through it. Just keep in mind that most modems and routers are easy to set up and require little to no fiddling once they’re up and running. Routers are universal and can be used with any internet service provider. Modems are a slightly different story. First, you need to make sure the modem’s compatible with your internet provider. Most carriers have a list of approved modems on their website and many major providers allow the same devices. So you can often keep your modem if you switch providers, as long as it’s the same type of internet service (cable, DSL or fiber). Some providers, like Verizon Fios, don’t let customers use their own equipment. But Fios customers can opt to buy their modem directly from Verizon,

                                   an option that will save you roughly $90 over two years compared with renting. The next step: Make sure the modem has staying power. This rule applies even if you’re buying it directly from your provider. Internet speeds are only getting faster and older modems — those with DOCSIS 2.0 technology — top out at 38 Mbps download speeds. If you’re paying for internet speeds of 30 Mbps or higher, or think you might in the future, spring for a model with DOCSIS 3.0 technology. These support speeds up to 150 Mbps, which is plenty fast for even the most connected families. Once you’ve settled on a compatible modem, consider buying a used or refurbished model. You’ll save even more money and lose little to nothing in terms of performance. Just make sure you’re clear on the return policy should you have any issues. Buying a modem and router will increase your upfront costs, but lower your monthly internet bill. Most tech experts suggest buying separate devices, but a combo unit will get the job done if you’re trying to keep things simple. Either way, you’ll save money in the long run. And that’s always a smart decision. More from NerdWallet: Kelsey Sheehy is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website. Email: ksheehy@nerdwallet.com. Twitter: @KelseyLSheehy.

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to sign a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules as a bigger fight looms over rules governing the openness of the internet, the White House said on Wednesday. Republicans in Congress on Tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The fight over privacy sets the stage for an even larger battle later this year over Republican plans to overturn the net neutrality provisions adopted by the administration of former President Barack Obama in 2015. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he did not know when Trump would sign the bill. The privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. Under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. The reversal is a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Republican commissioners have said the rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet the vote was “Terrible for American ppl, great for big biz.” Republicans next plan to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, in December said he believes that net neutrality’s days are numbered. The rules bar internet providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content and prohibit giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane” on the web’s information superhighway, to certain internet services. Critics say the rules opened the door to potential government rate regulation, tighter oversight and would provide fewer incentives to invest billions in broadband infrastructure. Pai told Reuters in February be backs “a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that” but has steadfastly declined to disclose his plans. Trump has not talked as president about net neutrality but in 2014 tweeted he opposed net neutrality. ","

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"The vote was along party lines, with 50 Republicans approving the measure and 48 Democrats rejecting it. The two remaining Republicans in the Senate were absent and did not cast a vote. According to the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. The bill next goes to the U.S. House of Representatives, but it was not clear when they would take up the measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was overturning a regulation that “makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment.” But Democratic Senator Ed Markey said, “Republicans have just made it easier for American’s sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared, and sold to the highest bidder without their permission.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules. In a joint statement, Democratic members of the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission said the Senate vote “creates a massive gap in consumer protection law as broadband and cable companies now have no discernible privacy requirements.” The Internet and Television Association, a trade group, in a statement praised the vote as a “critical step towards re-establishing a balanced framework that is grounded in the long-standing and successful FTC privacy framework that applies equally to all parties operating online.” Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for advocacy group Consumers Union, said the vote “is a huge step in the wrong direction, and it completely ignores the needs and concerns of consumers.” ","

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"Google has come under intense scrutiny for ads appearing alongside videos on YouTube carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. The company vowed an overhaul of its practices and said on Wednesday it has started an extensive review of its advertising policies. Shares of Google parent Alphabet ended down 1.2 percent, or $10.15 per share, at $839.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. Control over online ad placement has become a hot-button issue for advertisers, with social networks and news aggregators coming under fire during and after the U.S. presidential election for spreading fake news reports. Advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. J&J said on Thursday it wanted to ensure that its product advertising did not appear on channels that promote ""offensive content."" (bit.ly/2nqZNJD) JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and the biggest issuer of general purpose credit cards, suspended all of its ads from YouTube on Thursday, according to spokeswoman Trish Wexler. The bank spends about $3 billion on marketing each year. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was $5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. While major brands suspending advertising on YouTube is a public relations pain for Google, the suspensions do not affect Google’s biggest ad product, search. According to eMarketer, Google’s 2017 global ad revenue is projected to be $73.75 billion, grabbing 62 percent of the $99.62-billion search market. Search accounts for 83 percent of Google’s overall ad revenue. The financial hit is also less certain because digital platforms tend to collect the bulk of their revenue from small-to-medium sized companies who cannot afford to buy on TV. “Digital dependence on the long-tail of advertising clients means that while major advertisers like P&G or agencies like Havas can publicly protest, they do not have the same impact on a Google or a Facebook as they have on a CBS or NBC,” analysts at MoffettNathanson wrote on Thursday. “In other words, if a major brand marketer or agency moves money to TV and out of digital, the TV industry will see the benefit whereas the digital industry might not truly feel it.” ","

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The London attack which left four people dead was a “wake up call” for technology firms to get their house in order over extremist material being circulated on the internet, the acting head of London’s police force said on Wednesday. The comments from Craig Mackey, acting Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, come after calls from politicians for tech firms, mainly based in the United States, to cooperate more with the authorities. “I think these sorts of incidents and the others we’ve seen in Europe are probably a bit of a wake-up call for the industry in terms of trying to understand what it means to put your own house in order,” Mackey told the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee. “If you are going to have ethical statement and talk about operating in an ethical way, it actually has to mean something. That is the sort of thing that obviously politicians and others will push now.” The British government and a series of well-known British brands such as Marks and Spencer Group Plc had already  suspended digital advertising with Alphabet Inc’s before the attack because ads were appearing alongside videos on its YouTube platform with homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. They have since been joined by U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc. The action has prompted Google to apologize and review its advertising practices. London police already have a specialist unit which aims to remove extremist material but Mackey said “the internet was never designed to be policed as such”. British officials have also demanded tech firms do more to allow police access to smartphone communications after reports that Khalid Masood had used encrypted messaging via WhatsApp before he drove a rented car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a police officer by parliament. “We work hard with the industry to highlight the challenges of these very secure applications,” Mackey said. “It’s a challenge when you are dealing with companies that are global by their very nature because they don’t always operate under the same legal framework as us.” Regarding the police’s ongoing inquiry into last week’s attack, Mackey said detectives still believed Masood had acted alone. So far 12 people have been arrested, with two still in police custody. Mackey also said there had been a “slight uplift” in hate crimes directed at Muslims but not on the scale seen after previous similar incidents. ","

,03302017,Reuters,03232017,"(Reuters) - The vote by the U.S. Congress to repeal rules that limit how internet service providers can use customer data has generated renewed interest in an old internet technology: virtual private networks, or VPNs. VPNs cloak a customer’s web-surfing history by making an encrypted connection to a private server, which then searches the Web on the customer’s behalf without revealing the destination addresses. VPNs are often used to connect to a secure business network, or in countries such as China and Turkey to bypass government restrictions on Web surfing. Privacy-conscious techies are now talking of using VPNs as a matter of course to guard against broadband providers collecting data about which internet sites and services they are using. “Time to start using a VPN at home,” Vijaya Gadde‏, general counsel of Twitter Inc, said in a tweet on Tuesday that was retweeted by Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. Gadde was not immediately available for comment. Twitter said she was commenting in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the company. The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives voted 215-205 on Tuesday to repeal rules adopted last year by the Federal Communications Commission under then-President Barack Obama to require broadband providers to obtain consumer consent before using their data for advertising or marketing. The U.S. Senate, also controlled by Republicans, voted 50-48 last week to reverse the rules. The White House said President Donald Trump supported the repeal measure. Supporters of the repeal said the FCC unfairly required internet service providers like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. Critics said the repeal would weaken consumers’ privacy protections. Protected data includes a customer’s web-browsing history, which in turn can be used to discover other types of information, including health and financial data. Some smaller broadband providers are now seizing on privacy as a competitive advantage. Sonic, a California-based broadband provider, offers a free VPN service to its customers so they can connect to its network when they are not home. That ensures that when Sonic users log on to wi-fi at a coffee shop or hotel, for example, their data is not collected by that establishment’s broadband provider. “We see VPN as being important for our customers when they’re not on our network. They can take it with them on the road,” CEO Dane Jasper said. In many areas of the country, there is no option to choose an independent broadband provider and consumers will have to pay for a VPN service to shield their browsing habits. Private Internet Access, a VPN provider, took a visible stand against the repeal measure when it bought a full-page ad in the New York Times on Sunday. But the company, which boasts about a million subscribers, potentially stands to benefit from the legislation, acknowledged marketing director Caleb Chen. VPNs have drawbacks. They funnel all user traffic through one point, so they are an attractive target for hackers and spies. The biggest obstacle to their routine use as a privacy safeguard is that they can be too much of a hassle to set up for many customers. They also cost money. “The further along toward being a computer scientist you have to be to use a VPN, the smaller a portion of the population we’re talking about that can use it,” said Ernesto Falcon, a legislative counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which opposed the bill.

It is a measure of financial leverage. Companies finance their operations with equity or debt, so a higher equity multiplier indicates that a larger portion of asset financing is attributed to debt. The equity multiplier is therefore a variation of the debt ratio, in which the definition of debt financing includes all liabilities. Calculation of the equity multiplier is relatively simple and straightforward. Consider the balance sheet of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as of the end of fiscal year 2017. The company's total assets were $375 billion, and the book value of shareholder equity was $134 billion. The company's equity multiplier was therefore 2.8x, which can be compared with its equity multiplier for the year 2016, which was 2.34x. We can compare equity multipliers between two companies. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) operates with a very different business model that includes more financial leverage. The company's total assets were $257 billion as of end of fiscal year 2017, with $43 billion of shareholder equity. The equity multiplier was 6x, based on these values.  Verizon's much lower proportionate shareholder equity value indicates that the business relies more heavily on financing from debt and other interest-bearing liabilities. The company's telecommunications business model is more reminiscent of utilities firms, which have stable, predictable cash flows and typically carry high debt levels. On the other hand, Apple is more susceptible to changing economic conditions or evolving industry standards than utilities or large traditional telecommunications firms. As a result, Apple has less financial leverage. Differences in business models mean that higher financial leverage does not necessarily indicate superior financial health. The equity multiplier is also an important factor in DuPont factor analysis, which is a method of financial assessment devised by the DuPont Corp. for the purpose of internal review. The DuPont model breaks return on equity (ROE) into its constituent pieces, which are popular financial ratios and metrics. Net profit margin, asset turnover and the equity multiplier are combined to calculate ROE, which allows analysts to consider the relative of each impact separately. If ROE changes over time or diverges from normal levels for the peer group, DuPont analysis indicates how much of this is attributable to financial leverage. If the equity multiplier fluctuates, it can significantly affect ROE. Higher financial leverage drives ROE upward, all other factors remaining equal. ",Equity Multiplier

Rob Cox,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Little is more satisfying than cracking open a vintage Sears, Roebuck & Co catalog and marveling at the breadth of its offerings, dated illustrations and all. The one for the spring and summer of 1971, for instance, runs to 1,071 pages and offers everything from Dacron polyester nurse uniforms to colonial birch-veneer bedroom sets. Sadly, this once-great American retailer of everything may not make it to its 130th birthday in one piece. The more enduring legacy of Sears, however, which published its first catalog back when Grover Cleveland was president, can be glimpsed deep within the nearly half-century-old edition. On page 432 is an application for a credit card. A few pages later there's the ""modernizing credit plan,"" allowing consumers in seven states to buy merchandise and defer payment. Sears Holding, the retailer, looks to be rapidly hurtling toward bankruptcy under the stewardship of hedge-fund boss Eddie Lampert. The financial-services businesses spawned by this empire – so robust a few decades ago that it built, in Chicago, the largest skyscraper in the free world – are alive and kicking. Therein lies a cautionary history lesson for Amazon.com, Alibaba and other internet conglomerates seeking international domination. The market capitalization of Sears has shrunk to around $1.25 billion, or a fraction of where it was a decade ago after Lampert merged it with rival Kmart to create what his investors hoped would form the foundation of the next Berkshire Hathaway. A recreation of Warren Buffett's model never happened. In fact, it's surprising that Sears shares have any value given the company's warning a week ago that it may not be able to continue as a ""going concern,"" auditor-speak for bankruptcy. Lampert dismantled much of what was left. He spun off a collection of real-estate assets, which trade as the $1.25 billion Seritage Growth Properties. He also stripped away the Lands' End apparel business, which Sears acquired for $1.9 billion in 2002 and now has a market value of $700 million. Sears set its Hometown and Outlet Stores unit free four years ago, too, and it's worth $97 million. It did the same for Orchard Supply Hardware, which Lowe's bought for $205 million in 2013. Sears Canada still sports an independent equity stub worth C$200 million. And earlier this year, Lampert offloaded the iconic Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker for $525 million upfront, some $250 million in a few years and royalties for the next 15 years. All told, that's more than $4 billion of value from the retail remnants. That sum excludes a significant portion of the Sears heritage, however. The company's attempts to offer credit to catalog shoppers led it to start the Discover Card in 1985. That business was bundled with Dean Witter Reynolds, the stock brokerage it acquired in 1981, and taken public in 1993. The combination later merged with Morgan Stanley, which spun off the credit-card arm a decade ago.

The U.S. wireless industry has undergone significant changes over the last few years. Pressure from smaller carriers T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) has forced incumbent telecom giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to make significant changes to their services. Most recently, both introduced unlimited data plans, forgoing the potential to capitalize on Americans' ever-growing demand for data. Both AT&T and Verizon are struggling to hold onto subscribers as the competition eats into service revenue and margins. They are also expanding into media: AT&T with the purchases of DirecTV and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), Verizon with smaller digital media acquisitions. Indeed, the two companies are very similar, but which is a better buy? Image source: Getty Images. A big reason for investing in AT&T or Verizon is their fat dividend. AT&T's and Verizon's dividend yields currently hover around 4.7%. That's well above the S&P 500's yield of around 2%. But investors shouldn't just look at yield. They should see whether the businesses can grow that dividend over time. Looking at both companies' balance sheets, we see AT&T is in a much better debt position than Verizon. AT&T's debt-to-equity ratio is 1:1 while Verizon's stands at 4.7. That said, AT&T could be on the hook for significantly more debt if its Time Warner acquisition goes through. Still, it won't push AT&T's ratio nearly as high as Verizon's. But if you look at their payout ratios (the percentage of earnings each company pays out as dividends), Verizon has a  slight advantage. At Verizon's current dividend rate, it's expected to pay out just 60% of 2017 earnings. AT&T, on the other hand, has a payout ratio of 67%. The ability of each company to grow its dividend will come down to whether it is able to grow cash flow and provide a strong return on invested capital. AT&T's strategy of making mega acquisitions to diversify away from its wireless business will negatively impact its return on invested capital. Verizon's acquisitions will also likely destroy shareholder value, but at least it's on a much smaller scale. Both companies might better serve shareholders by paying out a larger share of earnings as dividends, but pressure to keep growing the business is winning out. Verizon can comfortably service its debt with its cash flow, and its strategy lends itself to better dividend growth over the long run. Shares of Verizon and AT&T have headed in opposite directions over the past year. AT&T's share price is up about 6.5% over the trailing 12 months, while Verizon shares have fallen 8.3%. The result has been Verizon shares trading at a much more attractive valuation. Verizon's forward P/E ratio is just 12.8 compared to AT&T's 14.1 ratio. Even considering Verizon's debt situation, its EV/EBITDA ratio is comparable to AT&T's (7.5 vs 7.4). To be sure, investors expect much stronger earnings growth from AT&T over the long term. AT&T's acquisitions should help it grow earnings, but it's taking on more risk with the high prices it's paying. As such, Verizon's valuation makes it look more attractive for dividend investors. If you're looking at both AT&T and Verizon, you're probably more interested in a safe, growing dividend than earnings growth. While the two are interconnected, Verizon's advantages in its core wireless service (strong network and brand) ensure that it can grow steadily for years to come even if it faces near-term pressure. (The pressure from smaller carriers won't last forever as they eventually seek to generate cash flows on the level of their larger rivals.) That's why Verizon makes a better buy for most investors.

Billy Duberstein,03302017,Fool,03232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Earlier this month, shareholders of both CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) and Level 3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT) approved their merger by overwhelming majorities. Level 3 shareholders voted for the deal with an 81.2% majority (98.8% of the votes cast), while CenturyLink shareholders voted for the merger with 96.3% of the votes cast. As I had written previously, the merger should be beneficial, especially to shareholders of CenturyLink, as it will likely free up cash flow to maintain the company's high dividend. Now that the merger has cleared this first hurdle, what remains going forward, and what does this mean for shareholders? Image source: Getty Images. According to CenturyLink, the merger has already received approvals from many of the state agencies, including Ohio, Utah, Nevada, Georgia, West Virginia, Connecticut, Indiana, and Louisiana. Going forward, the companies still need regulatory approvals from the FCC, the Justice Department, and other agencies. The Justice Department will review the merger for antitrust issues, and will either approve the deal, approve it with conditions, or block the deal entirely. The FCC will then review the deal in a similar way, with more of a focus on competition and what it means for consumers of the combined companies' products and services. CenturyLink has stated that the combination will actually enable better competition and customer service. That's because, according to the companies, CenturyLink and Level 3's networks are mostly complementary, and Level 3 has many connections overseas. The companies say that this will enable better coordination in serving enterprise customers with offices and connections all over the world. Moreover, CenturyLink/Level 3 will still only be the second biggest enterprise network service provider, next to AT&T (NYSE:T). The companies believe they'll be able to compete better against AT&T and other big cable companies, thereby offering consumers better choices. These assertions, however, are being contested by smaller service provider companies and trade groups, such as INCOMPAS, which represents wireless carriers, as well as Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) and Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN). The latter two contend that Level 3 has been hiking prices for these smaller companies to connect to Level 3's long-haul backbone, and they fear that this will continue. Frontier and Windstream are both struggling mightily this year, so it is no surprise that they may wish to thwart the merger, which may marginalize them even further. For its part, INCOMPAS worries that the merger will reduce competition in the long-haul market, which CenturyLink and Level 3 both vehemently deny. Level 3 and CenturyLink point to AT&T (NYSE:T) Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR), and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) as big competitors, plus, according to an FCC filing, ""precedent firmly establishes that no provider has the ability to set prices above competitive levels."" While I am no expert, it does appear that the objections to the deal have not been insurmountable, and that a deal is still likely. However, the companies also must get approval from the Department of Defense and Homeland Security due to Level 3's international footprint in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Still, the market seems to be discounting a possibility that the deal will not go through. For instance, in the merger, Level 3 shareholders will receive $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink. Based on the closing prices as of Friday, March 16, CenturyLink traded at $23.65 per share, and Level 3 traded at $57.47 per share. Therefore, Level 3 shareholders would receive roughly $60.28 in value should the deal close, which is a difference of $2.81 from Level 3's current price. The companies expect the deal to close in Q3 of this year, so even adjusting for one CenturyLink dividend payment between now and then, the excess value is $2.27, or almost 4% above Level 3's price today. Of course, no one knows for sure if the deal will go through, or if the two companies will be able to integrate effectively and maintain their current price levels. That being said, those willing to play the merger arbitrage game may wish to take a look at Level 3. CenturyLink also sports a 9.2% yield and trades below book value, and I think the merger would be especially helpful to CenturyLink. Either way, the merger is an interesting play for investors in the telecom space today. ","

Brian Stoffel,03302017,Fool,03232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The past few days have been utterly painful for shareholders of Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). After analysts called the company's dividend into question, shares have fallen sharply -- and they have lost almost half of their value since just this January. Does such a move mean that the company -- and its headline-grabbing dividend yield of over 20% -- is a buy at today's prices? Would it be a better bet than putting your money behind a much safer telecom like AT&T (NYSE:T)? Image source: Getty Images The answers to these questions aren't 100% knowable. But we'll try to examine them by viewing the two companies through three different lenses. If I had one piece of advice for beginning investors, it would be this: Spend all your time studying sustainable competitive advantages -- otherwise known as ""moats."" While valuation, industry dynamics, and total addressable markets aren't unimportant, they pale in comparison with a company's moat. In the simplest sense, a moat is what separates a company from the competition. It is what keeps customers coming back year after year, and keeps the competition at arm's length for decades. Both AT&T and Frontier benefit from a huge moat, in that there are enormous barriers to entry in the telecom business. The upfront costs associated with setting up the infrastructure to deliver telephony and Internet are mind-boggling. But since both companies benefit from this moat, it isn't much of a differentiator. Instead, I look at the fact that AT&T is looking to diversify beyond simple telecom and become a content owner and distributor. It is doing that via its acquisitions of Time Warner and DirecTV. That, plus the fact that the company owns 32% of the wireless subscription market in the United States, is a powerful differentiator. Frontier, on the other hand, is a much smaller player that's going through growing pains while it attempts to integrate recent acquisitions it made from both AT&T and Verizon. There's no way it could focus right now on content ownership or delivery the way that AT&T is. The winner in this case is clear. Telecom investors love to see money coming back to them every quarter in the form of dividends. But it wouldn't be prudent for a company to spend all of its cash on payouts. That's because every company, at one point or another, will face uncertain economic times. Those that enter such times with lots of cash have options: buy back shares on the cheap, make strategic acquisitions, or -- most importantly -- outspend rivals to gain market share. Those that are debt-heavy are in the exact opposite boat, forced to narrow their focus just to make ends meet. Here's how AT&T and Frontier stack up in terms of financial fortitude, keeping in mind that AT&T is valued at over 100 times the size of Frontier. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow AT&T $7,500 million $114,000 million $13,000 million $17,800 million Frontier $322 million $17,600 million ($587 million) $265 million Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Because of the nature of the telecom industry, neither one of these companies sports a balance sheet worth bragging about. The real differentiator is usually free cash flow, but relative to their sizes, they both have similar cash flows. Instead, I look at Frontier's tenuous situation with its debt -- at 54 times its cash position, versus AT&T's ratio of just one-third that amount -- as the tiebreaker. As the recent worries over Frontier's debt have shown, this is something to worry about. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF P/S Dividend FCF Payout AT&T 15 14 1.56 4.7% 66% Frontier N/A 9 0.29 20% 266% Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, Nasdaq.com. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Given the massive drop in Frontier's stock lately, this is a lot closer than one might think. On a price-to-free cash flow basis, Frontier is 35% cheaper than AT&T. And even if Frontier has to cut its dividend by 50%, it will still be yielding more than AT&T. While AT&T's dividend is no doubt safer than Frontier's -- based on the payout ratio from free cash flow -- the risk/reward tips, ever so slightly, in Frontier's favor at this point. So there you have it: AT&T is the safer bet at today's prices. While Frontier is in the bargain basement at this point because of serious questions about its dividend, that alone isn't enough to make it a better buy. AT&T has a stronger moat around it, and a healthier balance sheet. Riskier investors may want to take a position in Frontier, but for the average American trying to build up his/her retirement portfolio, AT&T is the way to go. ","

Sean Williams,03302017,Fool,03232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. More often than not, dividend stocks are what form the foundation of the best retirement portfolios. It's not hard to understand why, either. Over the long run, dividend-paying stocks have run circles around non-dividend paying stocks in terms of overall return. The first reason investors often seek dividend stocks is that a regular stipend serves as a beacon of assumed profitability and sustainability. In other words, in a perfect world no company is going to continue to share a percentage of its profits with investors if it doesn't believe it'll remain healthfully profitable and continue to grow. Image source: Getty Images. Dividend stocks are also quite helpful in hedging against the inevitable downside in the stock market. Since 1950, according to data from Yardeni Research, there have been 35 stock market corrections in the S&P 500 of at least 10%, when rounded to the nearest whole number. While most dividend payments aren't going to completely cancel out this often short-term move lower in stock valuations, it does help ease investor worries in the short term. Finally, and arguably most importantly, dividend income can be reinvested back into more shares of stock via a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP. DRIPs are what top money managers use to generate significant wealth for their clients over the long run. However, dividends can also be deceptively dangerous if you aren't careful. If you don't take the time to understand the health of the business behind a dividend, or fully understand how a dividend is being funded, it could come back to haunt you. Here are two of what I'd consider to be the most dangerous types of dividend stocks. Arguably the most dangerous type of dividend stock is a high-yielding company (think 4%-plus yield) with a struggling business. Keep in mind that a dividend yield is nothing more than a company's annual payout as a function of its share price. If a company's share price has fallen 50% in a year, its dividend yield will have doubled. If you haven't taken the time to study how healthy the underlying business model is for a high-yield dividend stock, then you could be setting yourself up for trouble. Image source: Getty Images. For example, telecommunications service provider Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) currently has a dividend yield of 20% following the release of its less-then-stellar fourth-quarter results. Over the trailing 12-month period, Frontier's share price has fallen by 65%, which has more than doubled its dividend yield. If this yield were sustainable, investors could double their money in less than four years. However, if it looks too good to be true, it often is. Frontier is actually dealing with a number of issues that have no easy fix. The company believed that buying high-margin wireline assets from Verizon on a handful of occasions would allow it to generate significant cash flow. While that has partly been true, management apparently didn't do a great job of accounting for the rise of wireless mobile devices, which have made landlines somewhat obsolete. As a result, Frontier has been dealing with a steady loss of landline customers for years, which is eventually going to whittle away its cash flow and force what's likely to be another dividend cut. Broadband gains have also regularly disappointed Wall Street. The primary reason investors are buying Frontier's stock is its lucrative dividend, meaning more pain could be in store for shareholders if and when Frontier's payout is once again cut. It's no secret that a company paying a generous dividend will attract long-term income investors who's ownership tends to lessen volatility in a company's share price. However, when a company gets so desperate to reward shareholders that it issues debt in order to pay a dividend, there's reason to worry. Image source: Getty Images. Back in April 2014, Innoviva (NASDAQ:INVA), which was then known as Theravance and was planning to split into two separate companies, Innoviva and Theravance Biopharma, completed the private placement of $450 million in debt at a 9% rate. The reason for the offering from Innoviva was to ""support the initiation of a capital return strategy to the stockholders of Theravance, Inc. in conjunction with the previously announced spin-off of Theravance Biopharma."" In other words, the debt was to pay a $0.25-per-quarter dividend to shareholders. On paper, the company's decision to offer a dividend looked smart. Innoviva was the development partner that aided GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) in developing its cadre of next-generation long-lasting COPD and asthma medications, including Breo Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta. If these therapies achieved their blockbuster sales expectations, Innoviva should be rolling in the dough as a royalties company with little overhead expenses. Here was the problem: Breo, Anoro, and the remainder of GlaxoSmithKline's and Innoviva's COPD and asthma drugs struggled out of the gate. Many have since improved, but it's been a challenge to bring to physicians' and consumers' attention that a new long-lasting COPD and asthma treatment option exists. The result is that Innoviva had, until recently, been losing money -- so much so that the company suspended its $0.25-per-quarter dividend after just five quarters in 2015. Though the company is profitable now, it's left with $478.5 million in non-recourse notes as of Dec. 31, 2016. All in all, issuing debt to fund a short-lived dividend was a terrible idea in hindsight. Income stocks can be a real asset to your portfolio, but you'll need to do some digging to ensure that a company's payout is sustainable. ","

Last week, Google updated its ad policies and expanded safeguards for advertisers after some pulled advertising from YouTube because the video streaming site was displaying ads next to inappropriate content that espoused hate or even terrorism. Google said in a blog post that it has put in place more controls for advertisers, and it is also taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.

                                   . The Financial Times reported that advertisers are asking for discounts in pricing as a result. The bigger fear for investors is that an advertiser backlash could spread from YouTube to Google’s overall search business, or cast a pall over YouTube’s planned “skinny bundle” service. Since the story broke, Alphabet shares have fallen nearly 4%. Google’s efforts to handle the situation are getting mixed reviews from investors who see cause for concern. “Their public statements do not suggest to us that the company appreciates the degree to which advertisers are concerned and the continuing announcements of advertisers suspending their activity on Google properties reinforces our view,” Pivotal analyst Wieser wrote. Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Equities Research, predicted that Google will need to give out ad credits to lure back advertisers, which would also impact YouTube revenue. Don’t miss: This is what happens on the internet in just one minute The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the YouTube service was still rife with examples of ads running alongside offensive videos. Because the ads are automated, meaning they are placed using algorithms without human intervention, the advertisers also appear to need to be more involved in placing the ads themselves. Google said it is “changing the default settings for ads so that they show on content that meets a higher level of brand safety and exchanges potentially objectionable content.” Google has managed to handle such controversies in the past, and, alongside Facebook

Panic is unnecessary, but investors will want to carry this knowledge with them into the next few Alphabet earnings reports.

Frankly, I am shocked that Google is still having that problem. I remember when YouTube was launched 12 years ago, and the company had so many problems with copyright content being uploaded, and major media companies were coming down hard on Google after it subsequently bought YouTube. Within weeks Google had software that was able to root out all that copyrighted content. Here we are 12 years later and Google’s entire business model and cash flow rests on ads and ad networks, and this same issue apparently has not been solved. They are still having issues with ads being shown on places they shouldn’t be. Just last week, I trimmed my long-held Alphabet. Alphabet could catch a doghouse effect for a while. You know, the pendulum swings back and forth, and right now it’s looking like it could be swinging against Google.

But I continue to hold a core position, as I have since its IPO, because in the grand scheme of things, Google is very much about Android and the internet of things. Google browsers, self-driving cars, other ventures and search ads are all part of it too, of course. The biggest threat to Google isn’t Apple.

In coming years, we’ll all be talking to our smartphones and asking questions rather than typing in queries. Likewise, I expect Amazon to try another shot at the smartphone game, using an Android operating system, but Amazon will have built the smartphone from the ground up to be Alexa-centric. The Amazon world has become its own ecosystem from Alexa, to Amazon.com to the Amazon App. The consumer side of Amazon is stealing a playbook from the Apple ecosystem concept. The Amazon ecosystem is in the very early stages. The upshot is that I think you want to continue to own both Google and Amazon for the long term. But I think there’s more upside potential in Amazon. In fact, I think Amazon could be another dark horse that ends up being the first trillion-dollar company. (It’s now worth $403 billion.) I continue to hold both Amazon and Google in the Revolution Investing Model Portfolio and in my personal portfolio.

The move also sets up Vestberg, 51, as a potential successor to Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam, he said. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier said Vestberg will initially be based in Sweden but join the U.S.-based team later this spring. “What bringing someone in for the outside means is you need a new perspective,” Entner said. Verizon also said it is restructuring operations into three areas including Vestberg’s team. The media and telematics unit will focus on new businesses in digital media, including integrating its pending acquisition of Yahoo Inc YHOO.O. It will be led by Marni Walden as executive vice president for media and telematics. The customer and product operations team, led by John Stratton, will work on operating and growing Verizon’s established businesses, such as Verizon Wireless and Verizon Enterprise Solutions. Walden and Stratton are also both seen as potential successors to McAdam, according to industry analysts. Ericsson is working with Verizon on trials for a next-generation 5G network, and Vestberg and McAdam have known each other for years, industry watchers said. ","

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc said Friday they would not sell customers’ individual internet browsing information, days after the U.S. Congress approved legislation reversing Obama administration era internet privacy rules. The bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under former President Barack Obama requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. The easing of restrictions has sparked growing anger on social media sites. “We do not sell our broadband customers’ individual web browsing history. We did not do it before the FCC’s rules were adopted, and we have no plans to do so,” said Gerard Lewis, Comcast’s chief privacy officer. He added Comcast is revising its privacy policy to make more clear that “we do not sell our customers’ individual web browsing information to third parties.” Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so in the future, said spokesman Richard Young. Verizon privacy officer Karen Zacharia said in a blog post Friday the company has two programs that use customer browsing data. One allows marketers to access “de-identified information to determine which customers fit into groups that advertisers are trying to reach” while the other “provides aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses.” Republicans in Congress Tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the rules with no Democratic support and over the objections of privacy advocates. The vote was a win for internet providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast and Verizon. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules. The White House said Wednesday that President Donald Trump plans to sign the repeal of the rules, which had not taken effect. Under the rules, internet providers would have needed to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. Websites do not need the same affirmative consent. Some in Congress suggested providers would begin selling personal data to the highest bidder, while others vowed to raise money to buy browsing histories of Republicans. AT&T says in its privacy statement it “will not sell your personal information to anyone, for any purpose. Period.” In a blog post Friday, AT&T said it would not change those policies after Trump signs the repeal. Websites and internet service providers do use and sell aggregated customer data to advertisers. Republicans say the rules unfairly would give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet providers. Trade group USTelecom CEO Jonathan Spalter said in an op-ed Friday for website Axios that individual “browser history is already being aggregated and sold to advertising networks - by virtually every site you visit on the internet.” This week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans “believe that their private information should be just that.” ","

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules, the White House said, a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates. Republicans in Congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The signing, disclosed in White House statement late on Monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The bill repeals regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. The rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the repeal in a statement late on Monday for having “appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet.” Those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers.” Pai said the FCC would work with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees websites, to restore the “FTC’s authority to police internet service providers’ privacy practices.” Republican FCC commissioners have said the Obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. The action is the latest in a string of reversals of Obama administration rules. On Monday, the FCC reversed a requirement that Charter Communications Inc extend broadband service to 1 million homes that already have a high-speed provider. On Friday, Comcast, Verizon AT&T Inc said they would voluntarily not sell customers’ individual internet browsing information.

The details released on Thursday removed some uncertainty in the market on how Comcast would price and roll out its service, dubbed Xfinity Mobile. Comcast shares closed 2.1 percent higher at $38.13. Comcast is moving into wireless as cable companies seek to add more services to reduce customer churn, or attrition, as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Comcast’s service will launch on Verizon’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the two companies. It will allow customers to switch automatically to Comcast’s Wi-Fi hotspots from 4G LTE. Comcast will limit the service’s rollout to customers within its footprint, which includes major markets like Philadelphia and Chicago. It will initially be available only to subscribers with Xfinity broadband service. Comcast had roughly 25 million high-speed Internet customers in 2016, according to a filing. It did not state its investment in Xfinity Mobile or the expected return. Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said in a meeting with analysts on Thursday that the service would be cash flow positive over time. Analysts at JPMorgan wrote in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in a note earlier this week that Comcast’s agreement with Verizon was merely a way to enter the market. “Comcast will secure far better economics in wireless in time, either through a network sharing arrangement with or an acquisition of one or more carriers,” he said.

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is moving quickly to replace the Obama administration’s landmark net neutrality rules and wants internet service providers to voluntarily agree to maintain an open internet, three sources briefed on the meeting said Thursday. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, met on Tuesday with major telecommunications trade groups to discuss his preliminary plan to reverse the rules, the sources said. The FCC declined to comment but Pai previously said he is committed to ensuring an open internet but feels net neutrality was a mistake. The rules approved by the FCC under Democratic President Barack Obama in early 2015 prohibited broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane”, to certain internet services over others. As part of that change, the FCC reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. Pai wants to overturn that reclassification, but wants internet providers to voluntarily agree to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content, two officials said late Tuesday. The officials briefed on the meeting said Pai suggested companies commit in writing to open internet principles and including them in their terms of service, which would make them binding. It is unclear if regulators could legally compel internet providers to adopt open internet principles without existing net neutrality rules. As part of that move, the Federal Trade Commission would assume oversight of ensuring compliance. Three sources said Pai plans to unveil his proposal to overturn the rules as early as late April and it could face an initial vote in May or June. Internet providers like AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp have argued net neutrality rules would make it harder to manage internet traffic and investment in additional capacity less likely. Websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. AT&T and major trade groups sued the FCC in 2015 over the net neutrality rules. Democrats and privacy advocates say net neutrality is crucial to keeping the internet open. Pai in December predicted that net neutrality’s days were numbered. He told Reuters in February he believes “in a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that.” Pai and congressional Republicans have moved quickly to dismantle Obama-era telecommunications rules. Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates. Politico Pro reported some details of the meeting with trade groups on Thursday. ","

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"The U.S. insurer plans to roll out a product on Monday that offers coverage for expenses that arise from online bullying, extortion and other digital misdeeds. Called “Family CyberEdge,” it includes public relations and legal services, as well as at-home assessments of family electronic devices, executives said in an interview. Wealthy, high-profile individuals have increasingly become hacker targets, said Jerry Hourihan, president of AIG Private Client Group for the United States and Canada. Social media use and online financial information make them vulnerable. “They are more exposed than they ever have been,” Hourihan said in an interview. AIG’s product follows cyber offerings from rivals, along with services from credit-monitoring firms and companies like Reputation.com – a trend that is poised to accelerate as people share more information online, analysts said. Consumers now share loads of personal data on websites and apps and store photos and sensitive information in cloud platforms. “Whenever you see a lot of news about something that is a risk, you usually see insurance companies trying to jump on that,” said Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. AIG’s product came after customers asked for protection, Hourihan said. His unit caters to very wealthy individuals and typically insures assets like wine collections and fine art. Policies cost roughly 10 to 15 percent of a homeowner’s premium, Hourihan said. They also cover restoring data and monitoring cyber threats. Last year, a U.S.-based unit of German insurer Munich Re launched a personal cyber security policy that covers expenses like malware removal and online fraud reimbursement, according to its website. Premiums vary, but typically cost less than $100 for $25,000 to $50,000 worth of coverage. New York-based PURE Insurance launched its cyber security product in 2015. ","

The combination of Yahoo’s internet assets with AOL will be called Oath, a name that has already attracted plenty of ridicule across Silicon Valley and in the media with comparisons being made to the notoriously bad ""Tronc."" According to a tweet from AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong, Oath will oversee more than 20 brands and reach more than a billion consumers.

Joana Allamani,04062017,Investopedia,03302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On Tuesday, March 28 Congress voted to overturn privacy measures enacted in October under the Obama administration that would have prevented Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) from sharing their customers’ internet activity with third parties without their permission. The vote also blocks the FCC from making any such privacy protecting rules in the future. While ISPs are happy with this ruling, consumers are left worried. How can you protect your privacy with this new ruling? A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be a great way to maintain your privacy and stop your ISP from monitoring and collecting information on your web usage habits and search history. When you use a VPN, the data you send and receive over the internet is encrypted before it reaches your ISP, so they will only be able to see the amount of data sent and received, but not the content. You can choose one out of numerous VPN providers who may provide their services for free or usually a monthly price, or set up your own VPN and connect to that. However, beware of free VPN providers, says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, quoted in an article on VPNs in The Verge. If they do not charge anything, they could probably be logging your traffic and selling it to third parties. Do not sign up for a free VPN service without doing your research – at least check their privacy policy and terms of service. Hotspot Shield and CyberGhost VPN are examples of free providers that don’t log your usage and say that openly. With paid providers, Some VPN companies offer custom software, which creates that encryption that blocks the ISP from seeing the content of your web-browsing history. In addition to the providers who offer their own software, there are companies that use one pre-shared key for all of their customers. This could be risky, in that a person who controls a particular WiFi network could use that key to decrypt traffic used over the VPN, essentially nullifying the protection. Additionally, while you have several paid VPN service providers to choose from, it is important to consider the security of the VPN provider itself – transparency can be an issue among VPN companies and it is hard to determine which provider you can and cannot trust. After all, the VPN provider can see your traffic, and an untrustworthy one can sell your data to a third party just like your ISP can. Creating and setting up your own VPN server can be a safer option, where you might have to pay for the nominal cost of a server and then have total control over your traffic. Streisand and Algo are two systems that allow a user to set up their own VPN. You could even get a router with VPN capabilities; some higher end home routers come with built in VPN servers. Once you get those, you could simply use your web-browser to activate and then configure the server. Lastly, you can use your own computer to set up a VPN server. However, the particular computer you use needs to always be turned on. ","Stop Internet Companies Selling Your Data with a VPN (CMCSA,VZ) | Investopedia"
 ,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules, the White House said, a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates. Republicans in Congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The signing, disclosed in White House statement late on Monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for AT&T, Comcast and Verizon Communications. The bill repeals regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers' privacy than websites like Alphabet's Google or Facebook. The rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children's information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the repeal in a statement late on Monday for having ""appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet."" Those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers."" Pai said the FCC would work with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees websites, to restore the ""FTC's authority to police internet service providers' privacy practices."" Republican FCC commissioners have said the Obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. The action is the latest in a string of reversals of Obama administration rules. On Monday, the FCC reversed a requirement that Charter Communications Inc extend broadband service to 1 million homes that already have a high-speed provider. On Friday, Comcast, Verizon AT&T Inc said they would voluntarily not sell customers' individual internet browsing information.

Rob Cox,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Little is more satisfying than cracking open a vintage Sears, Roebuck & Co catalog and marveling at the breadth of its offerings, dated illustrations and all. The one for the spring and summer of 1971, for instance, runs to 1,071 pages and offers everything from Dacron polyester nurse uniforms to colonial birch-veneer bedroom sets. Sadly, this once-great American retailer of everything may not make it to its 130th birthday in one piece. The more enduring legacy of Sears, however, which published its first catalog back when Grover Cleveland was president, can be glimpsed deep within the nearly half-century-old edition. On page 432 is an application for a credit card. A few pages later there's the ""modernizing credit plan,"" allowing consumers in seven states to buy merchandise and defer payment. Sears Holding, the retailer, looks to be rapidly hurtling toward bankruptcy under the stewardship of hedge-fund boss Eddie Lampert. The financial-services businesses spawned by this empire – so robust a few decades ago that it built, in Chicago, the largest skyscraper in the free world – are alive and kicking. Therein lies a cautionary history lesson for Amazon.com, Alibaba and other internet conglomerates seeking international domination. The market capitalization of Sears has shrunk to around $1.25 billion, or a fraction of where it was a decade ago after Lampert merged it with rival Kmart to create what his investors hoped would form the foundation of the next Berkshire Hathaway. A recreation of Warren Buffett's model never happened. In fact, it's surprising that Sears shares have any value given the company's warning a week ago that it may not be able to continue as a ""going concern,"" auditor-speak for bankruptcy. Lampert dismantled much of what was left. He spun off a collection of real-estate assets, which trade as the $1.25 billion Seritage Growth Properties. He also stripped away the Lands' End apparel business, which Sears acquired for $1.9 billion in 2002 and now has a market value of $700 million. Sears set its Hometown and Outlet Stores unit free four years ago, too, and it's worth $97 million. It did the same for Orchard Supply Hardware, which Lowe's bought for $205 million in 2013. Sears Canada still sports an independent equity stub worth C$200 million. And earlier this year, Lampert offloaded the iconic Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker for $525 million upfront, some $250 million in a few years and royalties for the next 15 years. All told, that's more than $4 billion of value from the retail remnants. That sum excludes a significant portion of the Sears heritage, however. The company's attempts to offer credit to catalog shoppers led it to start the Discover Card in 1985. That business was bundled with Dean Witter Reynolds, the stock brokerage it acquired in 1981, and taken public in 1993. The combination later merged with Morgan Stanley, which spun off the credit-card arm a decade ago.

The U.S. wireless industry is fiercely competitive these days. The smaller carriers, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S), have been extremely aggressive in their efforts to grab share from an increasingly saturated market. T-Mobile has been very proactive with its pricing and promotions, while Sprint is content to undercut the competitor's pricing at every turn. As a result, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are both seeing pressure on their results. Most recently, we've seen the return of unlimited data plans, something Verizon insisted was unnecessary right up to the point when it finally unveiled its new offer. Meanwhile, Verizon continues to make sizable acquisitions and expenditures in digital media in an effort to diversify away from the wireless industry. Both factors should give Verizon investors something to worry about. Image source: Verizon. Verizon's new unlimited data plan should attract a fair number of customers while keeping many of Verizon's current subscribers from leaving. Verizon has lost postpaid phone subscribers in the first quarter of each of the last two years. That should change this year. The problem is, it won't generate as much revenue per subscriber. President of Operations John Stratton even said as much during an investors conference earlier this year. ""The first guys that you see come across are typically the ones who benefit greatest sort of on their bottom of the bill,"" he said. Verizon's new unlimited plan costs less than its previous highest-tier plan, so those subscribers will switch instantly, putting pressure on revenue per subscriber. Meanwhile, Verizon will see its costs per subscriber increase as it delivers more data to customers' smartphones. A big piece of Verizon's branding is its network reliability. It needs to continue investing in its network to maintain its leading position. On the positive side, Verizon has managed to maintain its unlimited plan pricing above its competitors. Verizon's unlimited plan costs at least as much as comparable plans on the market. Verizon's ability to maintain premium pricing is a good indicator that its brand is still strong. Faced with meager growth in the wireless industry, Verizon has made several large acquisitions to boost its presence in digital media. AT&T is also pursuing acquisitions, but on an even larger scale. AT&T spent $49 billion to acquire DirecTV, and it agreed to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) for $85 billion. Verizon's billions in acquisitions look like small potatoes by comparison. Still, both buying sprees could easily destroy shareholder value by leaving the companies in weakened financial states. If and when they need money to support their core wireless businesses, they'll likely have to tap the debt markets. Both companies already carry over $100 billion in debt, although that's supported by stellar cash flows. Verizon's decision to enter the digital media and advertising space is interesting. While the market for digital advertising is growing quickly (making it attractive), that market growth comes mainly from two companies. Verizon's ability to take share is suspect. While I believe Verizon could feel some pain in the short term as competitive pressures continue to weigh on its wireless business, I'm still bullish in the long run. At some point, T-Mobile and Sprint will feel pressure to produce meaningful cash flows, making their current pace of promotions and discounts unsustainable. Both companies have weak balance sheets being propped up by parent companies. At some point, something has to give at T-Mobile and Sprint. Perhaps an acquisition or merger takes the pressure off of subscriber growth. There have been several rumors circulating about a tie-up with a pay-TV provider, which would allow the new merged company to compete more effectively against the TV-wireless juggernaut of AT&T without resorting to undercutting pricing. Either way, Verizon's long-term position still looks good considering the strength of its wireless network and the size of its retail customer base. I'll be monitoring the situation with the smaller competitors closely, and I'm hoping management doesn't make any more big acquisitions, but unless things change considerably, I'm fine holding my shares. After all, the company is paying me a hefty 4.7% dividend to be patient. ","

Adam Levy,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. 2017 is turning out to be the year cable went to streaming. After AT&T (NYSE:T) launched DirecTV Now at the end of last year, both Hulu and YouTube have announced new linear TV streaming services, joining established services such as DISH Network's (NASDAQ:DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation Vue. Now, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is reportedly looking to enter the over-the-top market this summer with a nationwide television streaming service. The telecom company secured the streaming rights to networks as it renewed contracts for its existing FiOS TV service. Verizon's wireline video service growth slowed considerably last year. Will a new streaming service reinvigorate Verizon's television efforts? Image source: Getty Images. The major differences between linear TV streaming services comes down to content rights. AT&T said its biggest advantage with DirecTV Now is its scale as a pay-TV provider. After buying DirecTV, AT&T has over 25 million video subscribers. By comparison, Verizon has just 4.7 million FiOS TV subscribers. Verizon doesn't even have the scale of DISH Network, which counts 13.7 million subscribers. Scale is important because it gives the service provider leverage against the content providers. AT&T is probably paying less per subscriber for the streaming rights to ESPN than Verizon agreed to pay because it's sending 20 million more subscribers to ESPN than Verizon is. Sony was one of the first to launch an over-the-top linear TV service, and it started with absolutely no scale. Nonetheless, its service and pricing is competitive, but it's lost several notable content contracts during its two-year existence. Still, it's managed to attract 400,000 subscribers to PlayStation Vue. Whether Sony is making a profit on those subscribers is unclear, but it shows that getting the best content pricing isn't the only thing needed to take some market share. Verizon has a couple of main advantages over most of its competitors. The biggest advantage is the 114 million retail customer relationships it already has through its wireless business. Verizon can offer discounts for bundling its new streaming service with its wireless service. AT&T is using that strategy with DirecTV Now. It's offering $25 off DirecTV Now per month and free HBO for subscribers of its AT&T Plus plan. No other competitors can offer something similar. The second advantage Verizon has is its recent investments in digital advertising. Over the past few years, Verizon has made several large acquisitions of digital media and advertising companies. Lending that expertise to a streaming television service could help Verizon produce higher ad revenue than its competitors, allowing it to price its service competitively even if it has to pay more for content. All pay-TV providers receive a couple of minutes of ad space per hour for their own ads. Verizon could, however, win over some ad space from media companies if it can show superb results with its own inventory. That could produce additional revenue for Verizon, allowing it to produce higher margins or lower pricing to compete. Ultimately, Verizon is fairly well positioned to compete in an increasingly crowded market even though it doesn't have the scale of some of the current services. The revenue from the streaming service won't be huge compared with Verizon's wireless business, but bundling the offering could make Verizon's services stickier. ","
      
    Can Verizon Take On the Streaming Competition? -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Frontier (NASDAQ:FTR) has struggled mightily in its attempts to become a bigger player in the cable and internet space. But even as it has bled some of the subscribers it paid Verizon (NYSE:VZ) $10.54 billion for, it has had one major thing going for it -- its dividend. Now, as the company considers a reverse split to keep its stock above NASDAQ's $1 per share threshold, the value of that dividend, and whether it will continue to exist at all has become highly questionable. Frontier has already declared it will pay a dividend of $0.105 per common share in Q1 payable on March 31 to people who owned shares at the close of business on March 15. That's good short-term news for embattled investors, and in-line with what it has paid for the past two years, but the long-term prospects look bleak. Image source: YCharts. The company has seen its stock price steadily fall as it has struggled to hold onto the 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband customers, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) it purchased from Verizon. Frontier's losses in Q2, the first quarter after the deal closed, were expected, but the drop in Q3 was harder to explain. When the company lost another 144,000 residential subscribers and 14,000 more business customers in Q4, questions as to whether the company could turn things around became legitimate. As you can see on the chart above, the company's stock price has been falling fairly steadily all year. Frontier's failure to at least stabilize its subscriber loss in Q4, after suggesting it would happen during the Q2 and Q3 earnings calls, sent its stock price plummeting, something the company likely expected as it floated the idea of a reverse split in its Q4 earnings release: Frontier also announced that its Board of Directors has approved and will place before Frontier's stockholders at the May 2017 Annual Meeting a charter amendment for a reverse stock split of Frontier Communications common stock. The charter amendment will provide for a reverse stock split ratio between 1-for-10 and 1-for-25, with the Board designating the final ratio within 90 days after the charter amendment is approved by stockholders. It's easy to see why Frontier pays a dividend. The payments keep shareholders on board while the company tries to transform itself. The problem is that Frontier lost $80 million in Q4 and $373 million for the year, before paying the dividend. After the payments are factored in the full-year loss jumps to $587 million. Frontier has been losing video subscribers. Image source: Getty Images. The company, it's important to note, has not suggested it will eliminate its dividend. In fact, CEO Daniel McCarthy implied that Frontier planned to keep it during the Q4 earnings call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required), saying that the board had considered the issue two weeks before the call. ""They obviously look at the allocation of capital and resources for us,"" he said. ""They reviewed the complete plan that we presented on 2017, as well as the cash flows and all the initiatives that we're undertaking right now and they were comfortable declaring the dividend. So there has been no change in our policy on that perspective and they will just continue to evaluate that going forward."" The problem is that continuing to borrow money in order to fund a dividend has its obvious drawbacks. In the long-term it's not sustainable, but if the company eliminates the dividend after its reverse split, it runs the risk of seeing its newly propped-up stock sink further. That leaves it with three options: Frontier has said it plans to go forward as it has, but has left itself wiggle room to make a change. McCarthy's statement was qualified by the words ""right now"" and it's very likely that if results -- specifically subscriber counts -- do not turn around in Q1, then the dividend will be very much in jeopardy. Were that to happen, it would make an already struggling stock even less attractive, and perhaps force the company to consider a sale or pursue other strategic options. ","

Sean Williams,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. More often than not, dividend stocks are what form the foundation of the best retirement portfolios. It's not hard to understand why, either. Over the long run, dividend-paying stocks have run circles around non-dividend paying stocks in terms of overall return. The first reason investors often seek dividend stocks is that a regular stipend serves as a beacon of assumed profitability and sustainability. In other words, in a perfect world no company is going to continue to share a percentage of its profits with investors if it doesn't believe it'll remain healthfully profitable and continue to grow. Image source: Getty Images. Dividend stocks are also quite helpful in hedging against the inevitable downside in the stock market. Since 1950, according to data from Yardeni Research, there have been 35 stock market corrections in the S&P 500 of at least 10%, when rounded to the nearest whole number. While most dividend payments aren't going to completely cancel out this often short-term move lower in stock valuations, it does help ease investor worries in the short term. Finally, and arguably most importantly, dividend income can be reinvested back into more shares of stock via a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP. DRIPs are what top money managers use to generate significant wealth for their clients over the long run. However, dividends can also be deceptively dangerous if you aren't careful. If you don't take the time to understand the health of the business behind a dividend, or fully understand how a dividend is being funded, it could come back to haunt you. Here are two of what I'd consider to be the most dangerous types of dividend stocks. Arguably the most dangerous type of dividend stock is a high-yielding company (think 4%-plus yield) with a struggling business. Keep in mind that a dividend yield is nothing more than a company's annual payout as a function of its share price. If a company's share price has fallen 50% in a year, its dividend yield will have doubled. If you haven't taken the time to study how healthy the underlying business model is for a high-yield dividend stock, then you could be setting yourself up for trouble. Image source: Getty Images. For example, telecommunications service provider Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) currently has a dividend yield of 20% following the release of its less-then-stellar fourth-quarter results. Over the trailing 12-month period, Frontier's share price has fallen by 65%, which has more than doubled its dividend yield. If this yield were sustainable, investors could double their money in less than four years. However, if it looks too good to be true, it often is. Frontier is actually dealing with a number of issues that have no easy fix. The company believed that buying high-margin wireline assets from Verizon on a handful of occasions would allow it to generate significant cash flow. While that has partly been true, management apparently didn't do a great job of accounting for the rise of wireless mobile devices, which have made landlines somewhat obsolete. As a result, Frontier has been dealing with a steady loss of landline customers for years, which is eventually going to whittle away its cash flow and force what's likely to be another dividend cut. Broadband gains have also regularly disappointed Wall Street. The primary reason investors are buying Frontier's stock is its lucrative dividend, meaning more pain could be in store for shareholders if and when Frontier's payout is once again cut. It's no secret that a company paying a generous dividend will attract long-term income investors who's ownership tends to lessen volatility in a company's share price. However, when a company gets so desperate to reward shareholders that it issues debt in order to pay a dividend, there's reason to worry. Image source: Getty Images. Back in April 2014, Innoviva (NASDAQ:INVA), which was then known as Theravance and was planning to split into two separate companies, Innoviva and Theravance Biopharma, completed the private placement of $450 million in debt at a 9% rate. The reason for the offering from Innoviva was to ""support the initiation of a capital return strategy to the stockholders of Theravance, Inc. in conjunction with the previously announced spin-off of Theravance Biopharma."" In other words, the debt was to pay a $0.25-per-quarter dividend to shareholders. On paper, the company's decision to offer a dividend looked smart. Innoviva was the development partner that aided GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) in developing its cadre of next-generation long-lasting COPD and asthma medications, including Breo Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta. If these therapies achieved their blockbuster sales expectations, Innoviva should be rolling in the dough as a royalties company with little overhead expenses. Here was the problem: Breo, Anoro, and the remainder of GlaxoSmithKline's and Innoviva's COPD and asthma drugs struggled out of the gate. Many have since improved, but it's been a challenge to bring to physicians' and consumers' attention that a new long-lasting COPD and asthma treatment option exists. The result is that Innoviva had, until recently, been losing money -- so much so that the company suspended its $0.25-per-quarter dividend after just five quarters in 2015. Though the company is profitable now, it's left with $478.5 million in non-recourse notes as of Dec. 31, 2016. All in all, issuing debt to fund a short-lived dividend was a terrible idea in hindsight. Income stocks can be a real asset to your portfolio, but you'll need to do some digging to ensure that a company's payout is sustainable. ","
      
    The 2 Most Dangerous Types of Dividend Stocks  -- The Motley Fool

Danny Vena,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Longtime investors in streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) know that its relationship with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has been a rocky one. The two have sparred for years over a variety of issues including broadband access fees, corporate mergers, and net neutrality. In fact, many would argue that the phenomenon of cord-cutting -- customers ditching their cable subscriptions -- was the direct result of the flat-rate online video streaming service that Netflix pioneered in 2007. There has been a lot of animosity between the two over the years. In recent years, a number of secondary providers like Verizon Communications Inc. and Dish Network sought to capitalize on the trend of cord-cutters and cord-nevers -- those that never had cable or satellite -- by offering customers the option of a skinny bundle, a smaller subset of cable channels for a markedly lower price. This was an attempt to entice customers that were unwilling to pay for a full cable subscription. Netflix is winning the battle for the living room. Image source: Netflix. Several recent developments reveal that cord-cutting, skinny bundles, and the popularity of streaming services offered by Netflix and others may have finally worn down the cable colossus. Reuters is reporting that after testing the concept in several markets, Comcast will offer a slimmed-down bundle branded Xfinity Instant TV, which will provide major broadcast networks and sports channels like ESPN and Spanish language channels such as Telemundo and Univision for between $15 and $40 per month. The package will include a cloud-based DVR and be available across internet-connected devices. The report indicates that Comcast is planning to expand the service nationwide in its markets beginning in the third quarter of 2017. This is the latest in a series of events that illustrates a change of attitude by the cable behemoth. After waging a public relations battle in the media for much of 2014 over the issues of net neutrality and access fees, there has been a thawing of the chilly relations between Comcast and Netflix in recent months. In July of last year, Recode reported that Netflix would be available on the Comcast set-top box. When asked for a statement, the companies replied: Comcast and Netflix have reached an agreement to incorporate Netflix into X1, providing seamless access to the great content offered by both companies. We have much work to do before the service will be available to consumers later this year. We'll provide more details at that time. By November those plans had been realized and the companies revealed in a joint press release that Netflix would be integrated throughout Comcast's X1 platform, combining the on-demand libraries of both services in a single interface. Comcast no doubt saw that the writing was on the wall and moves such as this one could slow the migration from its services. Image source: Comcast. Comcast is pursuing other venues to bolster its position. Bloomberg is reporting that Comcast has received authorization to offer certain cable channels nationwide to customers outside its traditional markets as an online distributor. The company hasn't received permissions from every network and doesn't yet have plans to offer an online service nationwide, but if it were to offer such a service, it would compete directly with AT&T Inc.'s DIRECTV Now and Dish Networks' Sling TV. Comcast also announced late last month that Netflix would be available for free to its X1 customers from April 3-9, similar to promotions it offers for services like HBO and Starz. These recent developments are a sign of the times as these once-bitter rivals partner to offer services to customers. About 54% of U.S. households subscribe to Netflix, and Comcast has disclosed that more than 30% of its X1 customers are Netflix subscribers. With that many customers watching Netflix, Comcast may have decided, ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."" ","

As part of the new structure, the telecoms company is hiring former Ericsson Chief Executive Hans Vestberg as executive vice president for the network and technology team. He will initially be based in Sweden and report to Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam. Marni Walden is EVP for media and telematics and John Stratton will head up customer and product operations. The media and telematics business will house the assets of Yahoo, giving Verizon more than 1.3 billion digital media users, generating $7 billion of revenue. The structure ""will give us greater organizational agility to continue to lead the market with our wireless and fiber services, scale and expand our media and telematics businesses, and maintain the leadership in network reliability and new technology that is a Verizon trademark,"" said McAdam.

Claire Atkinson,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Apr 4, 2017 8:52 a.m. ET Verizon, which is in need of content, is a potential buyer, sources told the New York Post By James Dolan’s MSG Networks is sounding out suitors, several sources told The Post. The regional sports network, which has the TV rights for the Knicks, Rangers, Devils, Islanders and other sports teams, collects roughly $5 per subscriber per month — among the highest in the country, SNL Kagan said. ESPN, a national network, charges $7.86. The sales process is believed to be rather young and there is no guarantee a deal will be made. “Dolan’s gone to his friends” to gauge interest, a source said, referring in part to Guggenheim Partners Executive Chairman Alan Schwartz, who is on the board of Madison Square Garden, a company that shares ownership with MSGN

Its enterprise value is $3 billion, including a market cap of $1.7 billion and debt. Its shares have risen 7.2 percent since Feb. 17, to $22.95 at Monday’s close. If a sale happens, Dolan could use the proceeds to help fund a bid for The Garden — the family-controlled entity that owns the Manhattan arena, the Knicks and Rangers and other arenas and venues across the country , sources said. In October 2015, The Garden spun off its media assets. “I think the point of the spin-off was to sell the cable business a year or two later,” said one analyst who requested anonymity.

An MSGN sale will not be easy, several sources said, as RSNs are considered mature and perhaps even a melting ice cube as viewers opt for skinny bundles and cord-cutting.

Comcast, which owns a piece of Mets’ rights-owner SNY, another Big Apple RSN, is said to be looking to exit the sector — not grow it, according to the RSN expert. Last year, James Dolan, MSGN’s executive chairman, and his family received $2 billion from selling Cablevision and should have little trouble funding a bid for The Garden if they choose to make such a move, the analyst said. On a positive note, if the board of MSG, which some think is undervalued, were interested in a quick MSGN sale, it might agree to reasonable rights fee increases, the RSN expert said. MSG Networks and Verizon declined comment. This report originally appeared on NYPost.com ",James Dolan’s New York sports broadcaster MSG Networks is looking to sell - MarketWatch

                                   iPhone and, potentially, halt the Apple stock rally. In this column, I’ll focus on the latter theme. Let’s start with an Apple chart and then explore fundamental, quantitative, sentiment and ownership factors. Apple chart Please click here for the annotated Apple chart. Note the following from the chart. • The chart shows that the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is in overbought territory. A number over 70 is considered overbought. • Even though RSI is overbought, it is still below the peak reached last time. In the present context, it means Apple’s upward momentum can continue. • Apple’s stock has jumped over 50% from the last major low. Historically, it is common for stocks to rise more than 50%, take out “stops” of short sellers, hit targets of long investors, turn non-believers into believers and make a further move to about 60% from the last major low. As of this writing, Apple’s stock is almost at that 60% point. • After about a 60% move, there is usually a retracement. • Apple’s stock has rallied 24% in the first quarter of 2017. • The chart shows that Apple is approaching 138.2% Fibonacci extension from the last retracement. Strong stocks often pull back from this Fibonacci extension. • Those who are uninitiated might call Fibonacci voodoo. Before doing so, note from the chart that the last retracement in Apple’s stock stopped at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and then bounced over 50%. As a note of caution, there is an epidemic of investors being taught to use technical analysis in a manner that worked in years past but doesn’t any longer. It is important to use technical analysis correctly.

                                   and hold a Galaxy S8 in your hand. Use it with one hand and note the ease of use. Check out the huge, gorgeous display. Samsung has accomplished this remarkable feat by ditching the conventional aspect ratio of 16:9 and replacing with an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. That makes the phone narrow and easy to hold. The phone also has extremely narrow bezels. The screen is gorgeous because it has OLED (organic light-emitting diodes) and also Quad HD (four times the definition of standard high-definition), which means a resolution of 2,960 X 1,440. Impact on iPhone Based on past data, there will be limited switchovers from the Apple iPhone to the Galaxy S8 in the U.S., but it will be more pronounced in India and China. However, this will not change the earnings numbers for Apple in a meaningful way. Quantitative factors Quantitatively, Apple’s stock is now significantly more expensive than its own past valuations, but is still less expensive than many other consumer stocks. Sentiment Sentiment is most useful as a contrary indicator; please see Mark Hulbert’s articles on MarketWatch. An extreme positive sentiment is actually a negative for a stock. According to our proprietary indicators, sentiment on Apple shares is very positive but not extreme at this time. Over-owned Pre-split, when Apple’s stock topped $700, which turned out to be the exact top, I published a “sell” signal on Apple on MarketWatch. The stock fell over $300 within hours. You can see the signal in the “smart money” selling Apple. The signal was given based on Apple stock being over owned at that time. When a stock is over-owned, there are not many buyers left to propel it further. As of this writing, Apple shares are approaching over-owned levels, but it’s not there yet. iPhone 8 Apple’s stock will be supported by rumors of the iPhone 8. What to do now The sum total of the foregoing is that the Samsung Galaxy S8 is likely to dent the momentum in Apple’s stock rally but won’t hurt it badly. The most important question for investors is: “What does one do with Apple’s stock?” Please note from the chart that our target for Apple is still much higher, and we are still holding a partial position bought at $18.71. The stock is now trading over $140. Our call is to continue to hold Apple stock if it has not become a significant overweight in your portfolio. If it has, trim it a little. For those not in Apple stock and are sophisticated enough to look for high risk-adjusted returns, the prudent course of action is to wait for a pullback into the buy zone that we provide, even at the cost of missing further gains.

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"The deal shows how wireless carriers may be increasingly willing to pay lofty prices for assets they view as critical to 5G, which is expected to boast higher speeds and more capacity. The network is widely considered to be a multibillion dollar opportunity, and wireless carriers do not have many acquisition targets that would give them the type of spectrum they need in preparation for the roll out. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of 28 GHz and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum used in mobile communications. The No.2 U.S. wireless carrier said it would offer $95.63 per share, a premium of 162.1 percent over Straight Path’s close on Friday. Straight Path’s shares rose to $91.32 in afternoon trade, while AT&T’s shares were marginally lower. Earlier this year, AT&T said it was acquiring privately held FiberTower and its millimeter wave spectrum rights. It expects that deal to close by next January. In February, Verizon Communications, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, said it had closed on its acquisition of XO Communications’ fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion, giving it access to millimeter wave spectrum. Between FiberTower and Straight Path, AT&T should have a similar amount of spectrum as Verizon if not more, said Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche, in a note on Monday. Dish as well as Ligado Networks, the wireless satellite venture awaiting approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow it to use its spectrum for 5G purposes, are considered potential acquisition targets by industry analysts. Ligado is working with financial advisers to explore strategic alternatives, sources told Reuters in March. Straight Path had said in January it was hiring investment bank Evercore Partners to help explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of assets. The company had also agreed in January to pay the FCC $15 million to settle a federal probe of claims that it had submitted false data to renew airwave licenses. The tax-free deal, valued at $1.6 billion in total, includes liabilities and amounts to be remitted to the FCC, according to the January settlement terms. It is expected to close within a year, pending FCC review. The deal with AT&T is supported by Straight Path’s majority shareholder, Howard Jonas, who has entered into a voting agreement with the carrier in support of the transaction. Evercore advised Straight Path on the deal and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP provided legal counsel, while AT&T was advised by Moelis & Co and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP. ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"Unlimited data, talk and text will be available by mid-year for $65 per line for up to five lines, or $45 per line for customers with Comcast’s top X1 packages, which bundle TV, internet and phone services, the company said. The details released on Thursday removed some uncertainty in the market on how Comcast would price and roll out its service, dubbed Xfinity Mobile. Comcast shares closed 2.1 percent higher at $38.13. Comcast is moving into wireless as cable companies seek to add more services to reduce customer churn, or attrition, as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Comcast’s service will launch on Verizon’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the two companies. It will allow customers to switch automatically to Comcast’s Wi-Fi hotspots from 4G LTE. Comcast will limit the service’s rollout to customers within its footprint, which includes major markets like Philadelphia and Chicago. It will initially be available only to subscribers with Xfinity broadband service. Comcast had roughly 25 million high-speed Internet customers in 2016, according to a filing. It did not state its investment in Xfinity Mobile or the expected return. Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said in a meeting with analysts on Thursday that the service would be cash flow positive over time. Analysts at JPMorgan wrote in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in a note earlier this week that Comcast’s agreement with Verizon was merely a way to enter the market. “Comcast will secure far better economics in wireless in time, either through a network sharing arrangement with or an acquisition of one or more carriers,” he said.

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"The FCC said 175 broadcast stations were selling airwaves to 50 wireless and other telecommunications companies. Companies plan to use the spectrum to build new networks or improve existing coverage. The spectrum auction’s end is widely expected to kick off a wave of deal-making in the telecom industry. Until now, companies participating in the auction have been restrained by a quiet period, but that will end after April 27, when down payments are due from auction winners. “What is most interesting to us was (Verizon) was nowhere to be found,” Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a research note, adding that “we continue to believe Verizon’s interests lay in the higher band spectrum assets.” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email that there were three surprises in the results: “Comcast bought less than expected, Dish Network bought more, and Verizon bought nothing at all.” Dish shares fell 2.5 percent to close at $62.38. Comcast, Verizon and AT&T were down less than 1 percent at market close while T-Mobile rose marginally. Moffett said Dish’s spectrum spending underscored “the growing importance of the company’s valuation as it relates to their spectrum holdings.” Comcast sold spectrum from three of its NBCUniversal owned stations in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago for $481.6 million. The FCC also announced new channel assignments for 957 non-winning stations that must change channels to clear the new wireless airwaves for use. Of the $19.8 billion bid, more than $7 billion will go to reduce the U.S. deficit and $10.05 billion to broadcasters relinquishing spectrum. Up to $1.75 billion will go to  broadcasters that incur costs in changing channels. Sellers had initially sought $86.4 billion for 126 megahertz. Many analysts had expected broadcasters to earn more and sell more spectrum. ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Advocates of landmark net neutrality rules on Friday blasted Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai’s plans to roll back the Obama era legal framework. Reuters and other outlets reported late Thursday that Pai told major telecommunications trade groups of his plans Tuesday to replace 2015 net neutrality rules with voluntary agreements to adopt open internet principles. The 2015 rules prevented broadband providers from giving or selling speedy or so-called fastlane access to some internet services over others. Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, opposes the rules approved by the FCC which gave the agency strong legal control over broadband providers, treating them much like utilities. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said if the reports are accurate “we are gearing up for a battle that could eviscerate the widely supported open Internet protections.” The rules “were built on a record of more than four million comments, and demonstrated that a free and open internet is at the very heart of our American democracy,” she added. Chris Lewis, vice president at Public Knowledge said Pai could “give dominant cable and telecommunications companies what their DC lobbyists have dreamed of for years: voluntary net neutrality ‘rules’ where consumer protection is no more than ‘trust your cable or internet provider.’” The FCC declined to comment. Pai wants to introduce new regulations under which internet providers like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc would voluntarily agree in their terms of service to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content. The move would allow the Federal Trade Commission to enforce compliance with the new rules. Internet providers do not oppose net neutrality principles, but opposed the decision to reclassify internet service under a law that subjects them to potential utility style regulation. Pai is expected to unveil his proposal as early as April 27, with an initial vote planned for either May or June, sources told Reuters. The proposal would be open for public comment before the FCC could finalize it. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents major internet companies like Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, Netflix Inc and Microsoft Crop, and strongly supports net neutrality, will meet with Pai on Tuesday, a person briefed on the matter said. The group declined to comment. ","

 ,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"AT&T said on Monday it would buy Straight Path Communications, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, for $1.25 billion in an all-stock deal as it aims to accumulate the airwaves it needs for a next generation network. The deal shows how wireless carriers may be increasingly willing to pay lofty prices for assets that they view as critical to 5G, which is expected to boast higher speeds and more capacity. The network is widely considered to be a multibillion-dollar opportunity, and wireless carriers do not have many options in terms of acquisition targets that would give them the right type of spectrum for a next generation network. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of 28 GHz and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum used in mobile communications. The No.2 U.S. wireless carrier said it would offer $95.63 per share, a premium of 162.1 percent to Straight Path's close on Friday. Straight Path's shares leaped 150 percent to near $91 a share in afternoon trade, while AT&T's shares were marginally lower. Millimeter wave spectrum is expected to play a large role in 5G. Earlier this year, AT&T said it was acquiring privately held FiberTower and its millimeter wave spectrum rights. In February, competitor Verizon Communications, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, said it had closed on its acquisition of XO Communications' fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion, giving it access to millimeter wave spectrum. Between FiberTower and Straight Path, AT&T should have a similar amount of spectrum as Verizon if not more, said Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche, in a note on Monday. Other companies in the industry rose after the news as investors are expecting a wave of mergers and acquisitions in telecom this year. Sprint earlier rose 1.5 percent to $8.49, while Dish Network rose 2.3 percent to $64.01. Straight Path had said in January it was hiring investment bank Evercore Partners to help explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of assets. The company had also agreed in January to pay the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) $15 million to settle a federal probe of claims that Straight Path had submitted false data to renew airwave licenses. The tax-free deal, valued at $1.6 billion in total, includes liabilities and amounts to be remitted to the FCC, according to the January settlement terms. The deal with AT&T is supported by Straight Path's majority shareholder, Howard Jonas, who has entered into a voting agreement with the carrier in support of the transaction. Evercore advised Straight Path on the deal and Weil, Gotshal & Manges provided legal counsel, while AT&T was advised by Moelis & Co. and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton.

Adam Levy,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) wireless phone service plans have been in the works for a long time, but it finally revealed some details last week. Comcast's Xfinity Mobile service will be available to Comcast's cable and internet customers later this year. The service relies on an MVNO agreement with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), made as part of a wireless spectrum sale completed in 2011. So, Xfinity Mobile customers will be using the same wireless network as Verizon customers. The new wireless service will give Comcast the opportunity to offer the quadruple-play bundle: internet, cable, home phone, and wireless. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon are the only competitors to offer similar bundles. The more services customers take in a bundle, the less likely they are to cancel any of them. Comcast's pricing is designed to primarily benefit its core cable business by improving subscriber retention through bundling. At the same time, that strategy has the potential to steal away non-bundled AT&T and Verizon wireless customers. Image source: Comcast. The most glaring limitation of Xfinity Mobile is its limited market base of Comcast's existing customers. As Comcast's cable footprint is limited to certain markets, it doesn't represent a major threat to the nationwide wireless carriers right out of the gate. Additionally, its best pricing is reserved for its best X1 customers, which management says comprises just 25% of its customer base. All other customers have to pay more. Here's how Comcast's unlimited data plan pricing stacks up with AT&T and Verizon's. Xfinity Mobile(Best X1) Xfinity Mobile(other customers) Verizon AT&T Unlimited Plus 1 Line $45 $65 $80 $90 2 Lines $90 $130 $140 $145 3 Lines $135 $195 $160 $165 4 Lines $180 $260 $180 $185 5 Lines $225 $325 $200 $205 Data sources: Comcast, Verizon, AT&T. As you can see, Comcast's pricing is competitive, but it doesn't provide much value for larger family plans unless you bundle it with Comcast's preferred X1 packages. As such, Xfinity Mobile will likely appeal to Comcast's most valuable customers. On the flip side, it won't appeal to Verizon or AT&T's most valuable customers -- large family plan subscribers. Xfinity Mobile, at least in this first iteration, is about helping Comcast hold onto its video and internet subscribers. Since AT&T acquired DirecTV, it's now able to offer television, phone, and wireless service nationwide. The carrier offers a $25 discount on its Unlimited Plus plan for DirecTV and DirecTV Now subscribers. Comcast customers that subscribe to AT&T for wireless service are especially susceptible to that kind of promotion. Xfinity Mobile provides an opportunity for Comcast to get customers to switch from AT&T's wireless service to Comcast and stick with their current cable TV plan. It's now at least a two-way street. That's notable for AT&T investors as the telephone company has struggled to add video subscribers. Last quarter, DirecTV Now accounted for over 100% of its net additions; satellite and U-Verse combined for a net loss of 25,000 subscribers. Stealing video customers away from Comcast through bundling was one way to offset subscriber losses. Comcast also offers a pay-by-the-gigabyte option for subscribers. Customers can pay $12 per GB, and they only have to pay for the data they use. Considering most people use less than 5 GB of data per month, and Comcast has 16 million WiFi hotspots to offload additional data, many customers could save money by going a la carte with their data. What's more, Comcast allows customers to switch to the unlimited plan mid-month, so it's effectively capping the per-gigabyte plan at $65 per month (for about 5.5 GB of data or more). The catch is, the offer is still limited to Comcast's customers and not available nationwide. Comcast does own the rights to stream some cable networks nationwide, and it could launch a streaming TV competitor, so it's not out of the question that Xfinity Mobile could eventually become a nationwide product. If it did, it would become a much bigger threat to traditional wireless carriers. Even so, the a-la-carte pricing appeals to lower value customers at AT&T and Verizon. While it may cut into subscriber numbers, it won't affect their bottom lines nearly as much as would stealing away large families on unlimited data plans (a segment where both AT&T and Verizon are able to match or undercut Comcast's pricing). Xfinity Mobile isn't a big threat to Verizon or AT&T, but it could somewhat slow gross additions for both companies' wireless services as well as AT&T's television services. Another competitive force in the wireless market isn't great news for the telecom giants, but it's nothing to be too concerned about, either. ","
      
    Is Comcast's New Wireless Service a Threat to AT&T and Verizon? -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. After much speculation, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has entered the wireless space with a new service that takes advantage of its Wi-Fi network, while piggybacking on Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) network when needed. Called Xfinity Mobile, the service will only be offered, at least at first, in markets the company already serves with cable and internet. Comcast is not looking to directly take on the national carriers, including Verizon, AT&T (NYSE:T), Sprint (NYSE:S), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Instead, it's hoping to tighten its hold on its customer base by offering them one more product to bundle with cable and internet service. That's a strategy AT&T and Verizon have used as well, while Sprint and T-Mobile have stuck with being lower-priced wireless-only players. ""Our goal is to improve loyalty and drive customer growth,"" Comcast Mobile President Greg Butz told CNET, also noting that being in the wireless game could change the company's less-than-stellar reputation. ""We see this as a halo to let customers think about cable differently."" Comcast promised, in the service's launch press release, to provide consumers with a ""better wireless experience, for less money."" Those are bold claims for a company that scored below industry averages as a pay television and internet service provider (ISP) in the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) report (registration required). To be fair, Comcast did improve its ACSI ratings in 2016, climbing by 15% in pay TV while showing a 5% jump as an ISP. It's fair to say that Comcast is now just one of the most-hated companies in America, which is better than being alone with that designation. Its ACSI ratings of 62 (pay TV), 59 (internet), and 64 (land-line phone) place it well behind T-Mobile's 74, AT&T's 71, Verizon's 71, and Sprint's 70 in the wireless category. Comcast customers will also need to buy a phone. Image source: Getty Images. Comcast's goal is to make it more attractive for consumers to get all of its services by offering the best deals for customers who bundle more products. In the case of Xfinity Mobile, the cheapest priced unlimited deal is reserved for customers who subscribe to its ""best X1 packages,"" according to a press release. Comcast is selling its new wireless service at two different unlimited price points, and on a per gigabyte basis. It is also offering a very limited amount of free service. The first two offers sound nice, but 100 MB of data is an effectively useless deal, unless you are the type of person who only uses your phone for talking and texting or you want a phone just for emergencies. It's a proposition that may not work for many customers, but could have appeal to the older cable audience. The $12 per GB deal is similarly limited, though it might be a good offer for customers who use their phone mostly for calls The unlimited deals, however, beat Verizon's and AT&T's prices at least for the first two lines, and the single $45 line for top-tier existing X1 customers is the lowest unlimited price offered by any major carrier. Sprint currently has the lowest price for unlimited talk, text, and data service among the four major carriers, albeit through a limited-time offer for new customers. The No. 4 carrier charges $50 a month for one line, $80 for the second, $100 for the third, and $120 if you need four lines. T-Mobile comes in second at $70 for the first line, $100 for two, $140 for three, and $160 for four, but the Un-carrier does not charge any additional taxes or fees to its customers, while all the other carriers do. AT&T and Verizon would both be more expensive than the $65 per line, per month Comcast plan for the first two lines, but a better deal if you need at least three. In the $45 Xfinity Mobile category, Comcast offers better pricing for three lines at $135 a month than T-Mobile ($140), Verizon ($160), and AT&T ($165). Once you get to four lines with the Xfinity $45 deal, the Comcast product is cheaper than AT&T, tied with Verizon, and as noted above, pricier than T-Mobile and Sprint. Image source: Sprint. Comcast's pricing is set up to do exactly what the company said it wants to do. It's designed to make consumers consider upgrading their internet package in order to receive the best pricing if they also want wireless. In addition, the pricing should be attractive to existing customers already on the higher X1 tiers, tying them even closer to the brand, making it harder for them to leave. It's hard to see this offer tempting too many people away from Sprint or T-Mobile, but some of Comcast's best customers might find the savings worth it if they have AT&T or Verizon. Consumers are likely to be skeptical of Xfinity Mobile, which the the company said will be available ""soon,"" especially given Comcast's history of advertising one price, then pushing the actual cost higher with fees. This new service looks like a good deal for some Comcast subscribers, but even they should wait until the company actually takes signups to see what the potential hidden costs may be. ","

Dan Caplinger,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend investors gravitate to high-yielding stocks like Altria Group (NYSE:MO) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), which have demonstrated a history of being generous with shareholders. Yet the two companies face much different conditions in their respective industries, and both have to deal with challenges that could have an adverse impact on their growth in the future despite having plenty of opportunities as well. For those who want to decide whether Altria or Verizon is the smarter pick right now, comparing the two stocks on a number of metrics can shed some light and help you make a better choice. Of these two stocks, only Altria has managed to give shareholders solid returns recently. The tobacco giant has produced gains of 17% over the past year. By contrast, Verizon has seen its stock fall since April 2016, and even on a total return basis, the telecom company has lost 2%. Image source: Verizon. A look at the valuations of the two stocks creates some confusion if you don't look beyond headline numbers. On a trailing basis, Altria looks like the cheaper stock, trading at less than 10 times earnings over the past 12 months. By contrast, Verizon trades at a higher trailing multiple of 15. Yet the backward-looking figures for Altria include a big one-time gain related to the sale of its interest in SABMiller. On a forward-looking basis, the two stocks switch positions, and Altria looks more expensive, with a forward multiple of more than 20. Verizon weighs in at just 12 times forward earnings, giving it the nod in terms of sustainable valuation. With respect to dividends, Verizon has a key advantage. The stock currently yields 4.75%, which dramatically outpaces the 3.4% yield Altria has right now. In terms of sustainability, both Altria and Verizon have similar profiles. Verizon has historically had lower payout ratios than Altria, but the telecom giant has seen that number trend higher as it goes through its business cycle. Again, Altria's payout ratio is artificially low based on extraordinary items in its earnings, but on a forward basis, both appear to weigh in around 70% to 80%. Altria has been more generous than Verizon in providing dividend growth. For instance, Altria's most recent boost to its payout was 8%, and its annual increases go back nearly half a century when you adjust for spinoffs. By contrast, Verizon's latest increase amounted to just 2%, and that's more in line with what the telecom company has traditionally done for shareholders. On the dividend front, Verizon and Altria both have pros and cons about which investors can reasonably disagree. As companies with long histories, Altria and Verizon have had plenty of growth opportunities, but they also face the challenges of being industry leaders. For Verizon, immense competition among wireless carriers has forced the company to offer large incentives in order to keep existing subscribers and attract new ones. The payoff has been less than stellar, with the company reporting nearly two-thirds fewer new phone subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2016 than it did in the previous year's fourth quarter. Operating margin figures have plunged because of the incentives, putting pressure on Verizon's bottom line. Verizon is hopeful that those trends will reverse as replacement cycles occur, but strategic moves from wireless rivals could throw a wrench into those expectations going forward. Altria, meanwhile, continues to balance falling cigarette volume against price increases to keep revenue and profit moving higher. In February, the company said it expects earnings growth for 2017 to come in between 7.5% and 9.5%, which is in line with Altria's historical target. However, new challenges are on the horizon, including a newly imposed $2 per pack increase in the cigarette tax in California, which is a key market for Altria and its tobacco industry peers. Moreover, the looming merger of rival Reynolds American with international industry player British American Tobacco could result in new competitive pressures for Altria. On the opportunity side, efforts to promote reduced-risk products have picked up substantially, and some believe the market for cigarette alternatives like heated-tobacco products could eventually become larger than Altria's core cigarette business. Those promises are likely a long way off, but efforts to move forward are putting Altria in position to reap rewards as the industry evolves. The greater growth prospects for Altria right now justify a somewhat higher valuation, but many investors will prefer Verizon's higher dividend yield and exposure to the cutting-edge wireless network industry. Neither stock is a slam-dunk winner right now, with both having pluses and minuses that could sway investors in different directions. ","

Andrew Tonner,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Telecom companies enjoy a well-earned reputation as some of the best dividend-paying stocks on the market. Unfortunately, the concentrated nature of the U.S. wireless market means there are only a handful of viable stateside options in the industry. Telecom investors looking for something slightly more exotic than blue-chip stocks like AT&T and Verizon Communications can look to international telecommunications stocks as a way to expand the number of potential opportunities while remaining exposed to the industry at large. Using this as a jumping-off point, let's review why names like Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF) are two of the best international telecom stocks for income investors today. The British telecom giant swung to a significant loss on paper in 2016, which caused Vodafone stock to underperform its benchmark, the Nasdaq Composite, by 40% over the past 12 months. However, much of the below-the-line carnage resulted from Vodafone's using deferred tax assets to turn 1.3 billion Great British Pounds (GBP) of operating profits into a net loss of GPB 3.8 billion (a $4.7 billion loss at today's current exchange rate). Companies can do this for any number of reasons, but the most common reason to intentionally swing to a net loss is to reduce income tax expenses in the near term. This is, of course, a one-time event for the company, and Vodafone is generally a profitable company. As such, investors should look at Vodafone as the international telecom equivalent of AT&T or Verizon Communications. The company generates roughly two-thirds of its revenues from Europe -- mostly Germany, the U.K., Italy, and Spain -- and the remainder of its sales come from emerging markets, notably India. Its European operations tend to be mature, slow-growing spaces. However, India represents an interesting opportunity for Vodafone and its investors. The company continues to aggressively move deeper into the rapidly expanding Indian telecom market, most recently via a deal to merge its Indian telecom subsidiary with Indian telecom operator Idea. The combined entity will create a mobile operator that will hold the first or second largest market share in 21 of India's 22 coverage regions. As a fairly mature company, Vodafone is so large today that significant revenue growth seems unlikely. However, as an established incumbent with a 5.9% dividend yield, Vodafone presents an intriguing opportunity for international telecom investors. Image source: Getty Images. Though SoftBank pays a dividend -- yielding a paltry 0.6% -- the Japanese telecom giant's continued revenue growth story plays a far more prominent role in its investing thesis than its cash distributions. Led by founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, the company has entered and exited a diverse number of industries over the years. Today, SoftBank generates the bulk of its revenues from providing telecommunications services in Japan and in the U.S., where it owns an 83% stake in Sprint. SoftBank also owns a 36% share of Yahoo! Japan -- though it controls 43% of its voting rights -- and mobile phone distributor Brightstar. The company has also demonstrated a flair for increasing its value via acquisitions and direct investments. It parlayed a $20 million investment in a then-unknow e-commerce start-up called Alibaba into a 30.25% stake in the Chinese tech heavyweight worth roughly $82 billion at its current stock price. Last year, Softbank paid $32 billion to acquire ARM Holdings, whose power-efficient semiconductor design is the standard for mobile devices worldwide. The company is also in the midst of raising a $100 billion technology investment fund. With so many different growth drivers, it should come as no surprise that SoftBank's future seems bright indeed. Sell-side analysts estimate the company's profits will increase by 67% in the current year and grow at an average annual clip of 16% over the long term. SoftBank has also generally increased its dividend, although it hasn't done so each year since it initiated dividend payments in 2012. Income investors will want to keep an eye on the company's debt burden. Though the intensive fixed-asset nature of the telecom business usually involves a lot of debt, Softbank currently sports a debt-to-equity ratio of 490%. Taken in its totality, though, SoftBank certainly deserves the attention from income investors eyeing the international telecom market because of its mix of long-term revenue growth and increasing dividends.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The stock market has had a solid 12 months, with major indexes up 15% since last April. Yet many individual stocks have enjoyed rallies of many multiples of that figure. Head-turning gains suggest dramatic improvements in the underlying business that might pave the way for continued market-beating returns for investors. Alternatively, quick, sharp spikes could set the stage for a painful decline. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at the prospects for three stocks: Sprint (NYSE:S), TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE), and SodaStream (NASDAQ:SODA), which have risen at least 150% each in the past year. TrueCar has come a long way since CEO Chip Perry took over the top spot in late 2015. Back then, executives described their latest quarter as ""a difficult one"" that ""marked the close of a challenging year."" The online automotive retailing platform had just posted a net loss of $65 million, compared to $48 million in the prior year thanks to underwhelming sales and monetization metrics. Image source: Getty Images. Its 2016 fiscal year was far stronger. Net loss shrank to $42 million as its dealer count surged and revenue growth sped back up to a double-digit pace. Lifted by this happy reversal, the stock has jumped 170% in the last year. Perry and his executive team admit that the business isn't out of the woods yet. ""We are nowhere close to declaring victory,"" he told investors in February, ""but we exited 2017 with significant velocity."" The key to the stock's future gains will be whether the company continues to march toward profitability even as sales growth stays strong. Investors will be watching for more improvements in the dealer network in 2017 as revenue rises to over $315 million from $277 million last year. Sprint shares are on fire following impressive operating results. The cellular giant recently logged its best quarterly customer additions figure in four years as it snatched market share from rivals Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). Both peers stepped up their promotions last quarter, which led to an uptick in Sprint's cancellation rate, yet the company still managed to bring in 405,000 new postpaid customers. Yet Sprint is far from profitable, having lost $923 million over the past nine months. That brutal result is entirely thanks to the company's $31 billion debt burden, though. Interest expenses amounted to $1.8 billion in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, which was enough to wipe out the $1.3 billion of operating income it managed. S Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts. For the stock to keep climbing, investors will want to see Sprint's operating cash expanding at a fast-enough pace to reduce its burdensome debt load over the coming years. After two years of brutal sales declines, at-home beverage machine maker SodaStream is back to posting solid growth. Machine sales jumped 37% last quarter thanks to a healthy mix of improved volume and higher average prices. Carbon dioxide canister sales, which is a proxy for the number of active customers, rose 10% to cross 7 million. Image source: Getty Images. Those numbers all suggest SodaStream has achieved its pivot away from a soda focus toward a sparkling water branding. The key challenge ahead is to build on that success to increase its household penetration even as traditional soda companies all fight over the fast-growing sparkling water segment. Unlike Sprint, SodaStream's business isn't groaning under the weight of hefty debt payments. And in contrast to TrueCar, this business is already profitable, having recently posted an almost quadrupling of annual net income to over $44 million. Those impressive metrics, plus the potential for increasing profitability from high-margin, recurring carbon dioxide sales, tell me that SodaStream has the best chance out of this group to produce additional market-thumping stock gains in the years ahead.

Danny Vena,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Longtime investors in streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) know that its relationship with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has been a rocky one. The two have sparred for years over a variety of issues including broadband access fees, corporate mergers, and net neutrality. In fact, many would argue that the phenomenon of cord-cutting -- customers ditching their cable subscriptions -- was the direct result of the flat-rate online video streaming service that Netflix pioneered in 2007. There has been a lot of animosity between the two over the years. In recent years, a number of secondary providers like Verizon Communications Inc. and Dish Network sought to capitalize on the trend of cord-cutters and cord-nevers -- those that never had cable or satellite -- by offering customers the option of a skinny bundle, a smaller subset of cable channels for a markedly lower price. This was an attempt to entice customers that were unwilling to pay for a full cable subscription. Netflix is winning the battle for the living room. Image source: Netflix. Several recent developments reveal that cord-cutting, skinny bundles, and the popularity of streaming services offered by Netflix and others may have finally worn down the cable colossus. Reuters is reporting that after testing the concept in several markets, Comcast will offer a slimmed-down bundle branded Xfinity Instant TV, which will provide major broadcast networks and sports channels like ESPN and Spanish language channels such as Telemundo and Univision for between $15 and $40 per month. The package will include a cloud-based DVR and be available across internet-connected devices. The report indicates that Comcast is planning to expand the service nationwide in its markets beginning in the third quarter of 2017. This is the latest in a series of events that illustrates a change of attitude by the cable behemoth. After waging a public relations battle in the media for much of 2014 over the issues of net neutrality and access fees, there has been a thawing of the chilly relations between Comcast and Netflix in recent months. In July of last year, Recode reported that Netflix would be available on the Comcast set-top box. When asked for a statement, the companies replied: Comcast and Netflix have reached an agreement to incorporate Netflix into X1, providing seamless access to the great content offered by both companies. We have much work to do before the service will be available to consumers later this year. We'll provide more details at that time. By November those plans had been realized and the companies revealed in a joint press release that Netflix would be integrated throughout Comcast's X1 platform, combining the on-demand libraries of both services in a single interface. Comcast no doubt saw that the writing was on the wall and moves such as this one could slow the migration from its services. Image source: Comcast. Comcast is pursuing other venues to bolster its position. Bloomberg is reporting that Comcast has received authorization to offer certain cable channels nationwide to customers outside its traditional markets as an online distributor. The company hasn't received permissions from every network and doesn't yet have plans to offer an online service nationwide, but if it were to offer such a service, it would compete directly with AT&T Inc.'s DIRECTV Now and Dish Networks' Sling TV. Comcast also announced late last month that Netflix would be available for free to its X1 customers from April 3-9, similar to promotions it offers for services like HBO and Starz. These recent developments are a sign of the times as these once-bitter rivals partner to offer services to customers. About 54% of U.S. households subscribe to Netflix, and Comcast has disclosed that more than 30% of its X1 customers are Netflix subscribers. With that many customers watching Netflix, Comcast may have decided, ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."" ","
      
    Has the Netflix Effect Finally Worn Down Comcast? -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett's stock picking skills are legendary. Thanks to his once-in-a-generation abilities, shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK.B) have compounded at an average annual rate of 20% per year over the past half-century. It's a track record that may never be replicated. Even at 86 years old today, Buffett remains as active as ever, though he has since added two additional portfolio managers -- Todd Combs and Ted Weschler -- to help deploy Berkshire's billions in capital. After scanning Berkshire's latest 13-F filing, names including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) stand out as particularly interesting potential investments right now. Here's why shares of these two companies make for compelling Buffett stocks to buy in April. After first being purchased by one of his investing lieutenants in 2016, Buffett spearheaded Berkshire's recent doubling-down on Apple shares. In the past few months, the Oracle increased Berkshire's Apple investment to a stake worth nearly $20 billion. And although the move breaks with his long-standing aversion to technology companies, his purchase of the Mac maker is a classic Buffett investment in virtually every other sense. I've gone to great lengths to argue the bull thesis for Apple shares in several articles as of late, so I won't provide as exhaustive of an analysis here as I might otherwise -- the accompanying links should more than get you up to speed. That said, Apple enjoys several useful catalysts that suggest its shares will continue to rise in the coming months. Apple shares tend to handily outperform the broader market in the run up to major iPhone releases. With one-third of its estimated installed base using iPhones that are more than two years old, the stage again seems set for Apple to trigger a massive upgrade cycle with the release of its reportedly redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone this fall. Despite this likely return to growth, Apple remains far cheaper than the overall market. And its overflowing cash hoard gives Apple the ability to enhance its shareholder returns through any number of potential avenues. Image source: Getty Images. Berkshire began buying shares of Twenty-First Century Fox in the fourth quarter of 2014. Berkshire's initial purchase totaled 4.75 million shares, worth $181 million at the end of the period. Berkshire has since nearly doubled its ownership stake, reporting control of 8.9 million shares in its latest 13-F, a stake of about $285 million in dollar terms. The relatively small dollar values at work here, at lest for Berkshire, suggest that one of Buffett's two investing lieutenants initiated the position. Either way, the move reflects an increasing bullishness toward media assets from Berkshire, a perspective that's understandable judging by recent trends in the industry. Consolidation has been a especially potent trend, as content producers like Twenty-First Century Fox have become acquisition targets. To this end, AT&T's pending buyout of Time Warner shows why Twenty-First Century Fox could find itself an acquisition target at some point soon. Spurring this is the fact that media distribution channels are expected to shift as new wireless standards, such as 5G, allow for ultra-fast streaming over wireless networks directly to mobile devices. Doing so will likely require so-called ""wireless bundle"" providers like AT&T to negotiate for content deals with existing cable companies, like Comcast. As such, the safest way to ensure a company like AT&T can secure rights to critical channels is to also own broadcast content that other cable providers need for their own bundles. In light of that, names like Charter Communications -- also a Berkshire holding -- or Verizon Communications could look to purchase Twenty-First Century Fox to continue this trend. This highlights what makes Twenty-First Century Fox a suitable Buffett stock. The company's durable competitive advantage is its content assets and brands, which are difficult to replicate or challenge. Regardless of your politics, it's probably safe to say that it would be virtually impossible to challenge media assets like Fox News among its constituents. In this sense, Twenty-First Century Fox seems like a classic Buffet stock to invest in at a time when content assets are in high demand. ","

(YHOO) reports earnings on Tuesday evening, with analysts expecting 14-cents per share profit on $814-million in revenues. Dow component Verizon Communications, Inc. (VZ) recently amended the terms of its agreement to buy the company’s core Internet assets, reducing the acquisition price by $350-million due to increased liabilities arising from a series of high-profile data breaches. The transaction is expected to close in the next two to three months. YHOO stock has gained more than 20% so far in 2017, with market players taking advantage of the deal’s growing optimism. VZ has struggled over the same period, falling more than 9% even though the D.J. Industrial Average has risen more than 4%. Both companies could be exposed to broader market forces between now and the finalization date when what’s left of Yahoo abandons its once iconic brand name. YHOO Weekly Chart (2006–2017) The stock split four times into the 2000 all-time high at $125.03, posting on the second trading day of the new millennium, and sold off into single digits during the Dot.com bear market, A broad recovery peaked in the low-40s (blue line) in 2006, ahead of a second descent into single digits during the  2008 economic collapse. It completed a round trip back to 2006 resistance in 2014, ahead of a breakout that added just 10-points into the November 2014 high at $52.62. It got cut in half into the February 2016 low at $26.15, ahead of a multimonth bounce that just reached resistance at the .786 Fibonacci selloff retracement level. A reversal is likely at or around this price zone, with the decline targeting the 2006 high and unfilled January 2017 gap between $42.50 and $43.50. Further downside is unlikely, at least in the short-term, because sellers will be hesitant to press their bets ahead of the acquisition. Traders looking to play this week’s earnings report should watch a 2-month rising channel, with support at $46 and resistance at $48. A breach at either end is likely to trigger momentum signals, with a breakout reaching $50 while a breakdown drops toward the gap. It will take a solid buying thrust above the round number to clear Fibonacci resistance and set up a test at the 2014 high. VZ Weekly Chart (2006-2017) Verizon reports earnings on Thursday, April 20. The stock rallied strongly in the 1990s, posting an all-time high at $64.75 in September 1999, just three months ahead of its future paramour. It sold off into 2002, finding support in the mid-20s while the subsequent bounce lagged broadly positive action during the mid-decade bull market. That rally ended at the 50% bear market retracement in the low-40s in 2007. The subsequent downtrend found support at the 2002 low in October 2008, ahead of a triangular basing pattern that failed to produce significant upside until the second half of 2010 when the stock broke out and entered a strong uptrend. The advance continued into the 2013 high in the low-50s and gave way to an intermediate correction that ended in the upper-30s during the August 2015 mini flash crash. The stock returned to the 2014 high in the middle of 2016 and broke out, but aggressive sellers took control immediately, generating a failure swing that could signal a long-term double top. The contested level aligns perfectly with the .786 retracement of the 1999 into 2008 downtrend, adding weight to a technical argument that the stock has already posted the highest high for this bull market cycle. Yahoo and Verizon report earnings this week, with both companies now exposed to broad market forces after finalization of their troubled fiscal union.

Lauren Thomas,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Verizon Communications reported first-quarter earnings and sales on Thursday that missed analysts' expectations, sending shares lower. Here's what the company reported versus what the Street was expecting: The stock closed down more than 1 percent on Thursday. Total revenues for Verizon's wireless business were $20.9 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 5.1 percent from one year ago, which was largely due to decreased overage revenue, lower postpaid customers in the quarter and continued promotional activity, Verizon said. Verizon also reported a net decline of 307,000 retail postpaid connections, or those who are bound by contracts, including 289,000 phone losses. The telecom company said it added a net of 35,000 Fios internet connections, missing quarterly estimates, and it lost a net of 13,000 Fios video connections for the period. ""... we extended our wireless and fiber network capabilities, began offering an unlimited pricing option and expanded our opportunities in new markets,"" Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said in a statement, commenting on the latest quarter. ""We're executing on strategies to capture future growth ..."" Verizon said it completed its acquisition of XO Communications' fiber assets earlier this year, part of its plan to expand its cell network. On Thursday, the company predicted its full-year 2017 sales to be ""fairly consistent"" with those in 2016, with improvements being made in wireless service revenue and equipment revenue trends. Verizon's 2017 effective tax rate should fall within a range of 34 to 36 percent, the company said, which would exclude any impacts from the Trump administration's potential tax reform. The telecom giant's much-talked-about acquisition of Marissa Mayer's Yahoo is still pending, complicated by the two data breaches that Yahoo announced last year, which affected up to 1.5 billion users throughout 2013 and 2014. The companies initially agreed to a $4.8 billion deal, but in February, Verizon lowered the price to $4.48 billion, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier this week, amid heightened dealmaking activity in the telecom sector, Verizon CEO McAdam said he is open to discussing the possibility of merging his company with Disney, CNBC owner Comcast, or CBS, according to Bloomberg. Referring to Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts, McAdam told Bloomberg: ""If Brian came knocking on the door, I'd have a discussion with him about it."" ""... if there is the right opportunity out there to accelerate [Verizon's] strategy organically in a way that adds shareholder value, we're always looking at those opportunities,"" Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis explained McAdam's comments in a conference call Thursday. ""We are committed to remain the largest and most reliable 4G network ... As part of the densification, we are deepening our fiber assets as seen by the XO transaction"" and continuing to focus on ""organic"" growth, for now, Ellis added. The CFO said he's confident wireless subscriber growth will reach a positive trajectory later in the year and into 2018, so long as Verizon keeps prices at the ""right levels"" and works on stepping customers up.

Lauren Thomas,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Verizon Communications announced a deal Tuesday that will further its commitments to growing its wireless broadband network nationwide, as the landscape for telecom companies only becomes more competitive and crowded. The agreement calls for Corning, a New York-based manufacturer of materials primarily for industrial and scientific applications, to provide up to 12.4 million miles of optical fiber each year for Verizon to purchase starting in 2018 and lasting until 2020, with a minimum purchase commitment of $1.05 billion. ""This new architecture is designed to improve Verizon's 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G, and deliver high-speed broadband to homes and businesses of all sizes,"" Verizon said in a statement. Verizon launched One Fiber, what has been called a more ""nontraditional Fios build"" for the company, in Boston last year.

""Our plans [in Boston] identified a shortfall in fiber supply, and Verizon has been working with business teams to forecast demand and fill supply gaps with existing suppliers,"" Verizon Chief Supply Chain Officer Viju Menon said in a statement.

Adam Levy,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently announced the results of the first incentive spectrum auction. The auction reallocated radio airwaves previously controlled by broadcast television stations to telecom companies to support their wireless data networks. But one telecom company that won't be getting any of that spectrum is Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The company failed to place any winning bids in the auction. The FCC auction specifically reallocated the 600 MHz band of airwaves, which are well suited for covering large areas and penetrating buildings. While Verizon holds a good amount of spectrum in that band already, it's surprising the company wasn't more aggressive in the auction. That's particularly true in light of its recent decision to offer a new unlimited data plan to its sizable retail wireless customer base. Verizon may be more interested in trying its hand in the mergers and acquisition market, where it can use stock to help finance its purchases. It may face competition from AT&T (NYSE:T), which was also relatively inactive in the auction, spending less than $1 billion. Image source: Verizon Verizon has historically been very active in the FCC's spectrum auctions. In 2008, the carrier spent $9.4 billion for 700 MHz spectrum, which has very similar characteristics to the 600 MHz spectrum the FCC just sold. In 2015, Verizon spent another $10.3 billion on the FCC's AWS-3 mid-band spectrum (high 1000s MHz to low 2000s MHz) auction. Verizon has also bought spectrum on the private market. It bought a bunch of AWS licenses in 2011 for $3.6 billion from a group of cable television companies. That $3.6 billion is in addition to offering an option to activate an MVNO agreement at lower-than-usual rates. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) recently took advantage of that agreement with the launch of Xfinity Mobile. Verizon's decision to sit on the sidelines while smaller carriers snatched up the spectrum may be because the company doesn't think it needs any more low-band spectrum (sub-1000 MHz). The upcoming 5G network will run on high-band spectrum, which is capable of delivering very high data speeds, but over relatively short distances. Verizon is working to beat the competition to market with its 5G network. Verizon owns 46.2 MHz in the low-band spectrum range. That's still more than T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), which just bought 31 MHz in the 600 MHz band. T-Mobile's total will climb to 41.1 MHz after it closes its purchases. That includes some 700 MHz spectrum T-Mobile bought from Verizon in 2014. That deal was another indication that Verizon is set with its low-band spectrum holdings. But Verizon's customer base is around twice the size of T-Mobile's. AT&T, which has a similarly sized customer base, owns 70.5 MHz of low-band spectrum. With the launch of a new unlimited data plan, Verizon's network could suffer if it doesn't do something. In all likelihood, Verizon will be very active in merger and acquisition talks in the following weeks. It's already reportedly interested in outbidding AT&T for Straight Path Communications. AT&T agreed to pay $1.6 billion for the company, which holds high-band spectrum licenses useful for a 5G network. Rumors have circulated for a while that Verizon may be interested in buying Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) or otherwise gaining access to its growing trove of spectrum licenses. Dish was an active bidder in the recent auction, spending $6.2 billion. The satellite TV company owns a variety of spectrum licenses in the low-band and mid-band ranges. Dish may be interested in selling the spectrum licenses in exchange for cash and an MVNO agreement along the lines of the one Verizon offered Comcast and other cable companies in 2011. Verizon has a few options, but none of them will be particularly cheap. Investors should pay attention to what deals Verizon makes, and how it structures those deals to manage its debt and balance it with cash flows. ","

T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) aggressive pursuit of growth over the past few years has already been paying off, but Verizon Communications' (NYSE:VZ) earnings report this morning showing that it lost retail customers for the first time represents an important inflection point in the U.S. wireless industry. While T-Mobile has been poaching customers from all other carriers for years, the dominant domestic wireless carrier has held up relatively well despite intensifying competition -- until now. Big Red has relied on its brand strength and strong retention of valuable postpaid subscribers to defend itself, and has only made modest concessions in response to T-Mobile's various Un-carrier initiatives, which now number over a dozen different moves to upend the industry. Verizon's latest reactive effort was relaunching unlimited data plans in February, which were still priced at a premium relative to T-Mobile One. T-Mobile management on an earnings call. Image source: T-Mobile. For what it's worth, Verizon says that Verizon Unlimited helped mitigate some of the customer losses in the first quarter; it ended up losing 307,000 net postpaid customers, but would have lost 398,000 if it weren't for Verizon Unlimited. Never one to let up, T-Mobile poked fun at the date of Verizon's earnings release, insinuating that Verizon may have been celebrating the ""holiest of high days"" (bonus points for puppy memes). In an emailed statement to CNBC, Verizon responded: We like puppy memes too. But today, like every day, we're focused on improving America's most reliable network. We're also busy enhancing our network to handle 3D, virtual reality and holographic puppy memes. Verizon is still the market leader by far, but T-Mobile has been making incredible progress growing its customer base. Verizon closed out the first quarter with 113.9 million total retail connections. T-Mobile hasn't reported first-quarter results yet, but finished 2016 with 71.5 million total customers (including wholesale) after adding 6.6 million throughout the year. Verizon does not report wholesale connections, and for reporting purposes Verizon's ""retail"" connections are synonymous with T-Mobile's ""branded"" customers. For comparability purposes, if we stack up T-Mobile's branded net additions next to Verizon's retail net additions (excluding wholesale for both carriers), the aforementioned inflection point becomes clear: Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. The U.S. wireless market is quite mature at this point, and overall isn't really growing all that much any more in terms of connections and customers. As the market leader, it makes sense that Verizon has struggled to find growth, while T-Mobile has been growing by gaining share and stealing customers. There are still revenue growth opportunities as data consumption continues to rise, driven in large part by mobile video, and carriers attempt to monetize that increased usage. The tough part is that aggressive pricing is the key to T-Mobile's success (in addition to savvy marketing campaigns that appeal to younger demographics), which undermines efforts to increase average revenue per user (ARPU); T-Mobile's branded postpaid phone ARPU was effectively flat in the fourth quarter ($48.37). Verizon reports average revenue per account (ARPA), which includes all lines in an account, and as such isn't directly comparable with T-Mobile's ARPU metrics; Verizon ARPA was $136.98 last quarter (down 6%). Overall, the Un-carrier continues to crush it, while Big Red searches for growth elsewhere. ","
      
    Verizon Customer Losses Are an Inflection Point as T-Mobile Continues to Crush It -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) wireless phone service plans have been in the works for a long time, but it finally revealed some details last week. Comcast's Xfinity Mobile service will be available to Comcast's cable and internet customers later this year. The service relies on an MVNO agreement with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), made as part of a wireless spectrum sale completed in 2011. So, Xfinity Mobile customers will be using the same wireless network as Verizon customers. The new wireless service will give Comcast the opportunity to offer the quadruple-play bundle: internet, cable, home phone, and wireless. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon are the only competitors to offer similar bundles. The more services customers take in a bundle, the less likely they are to cancel any of them. Comcast's pricing is designed to primarily benefit its core cable business by improving subscriber retention through bundling. At the same time, that strategy has the potential to steal away non-bundled AT&T and Verizon wireless customers. Image source: Comcast. The most glaring limitation of Xfinity Mobile is its limited market base of Comcast's existing customers. As Comcast's cable footprint is limited to certain markets, it doesn't represent a major threat to the nationwide wireless carriers right out of the gate. Additionally, its best pricing is reserved for its best X1 customers, which management says comprises just 25% of its customer base. All other customers have to pay more. Here's how Comcast's unlimited data plan pricing stacks up with AT&T and Verizon's. Xfinity Mobile(Best X1) Xfinity Mobile(other customers) Verizon AT&T Unlimited Plus 1 Line $45 $65 $80 $90 2 Lines $90 $130 $140 $145 3 Lines $135 $195 $160 $165 4 Lines $180 $260 $180 $185 5 Lines $225 $325 $200 $205 Data sources: Comcast, Verizon, AT&T. As you can see, Comcast's pricing is competitive, but it doesn't provide much value for larger family plans unless you bundle it with Comcast's preferred X1 packages. As such, Xfinity Mobile will likely appeal to Comcast's most valuable customers. On the flip side, it won't appeal to Verizon or AT&T's most valuable customers -- large family plan subscribers. Xfinity Mobile, at least in this first iteration, is about helping Comcast hold onto its video and internet subscribers. Since AT&T acquired DirecTV, it's now able to offer television, phone, and wireless service nationwide. The carrier offers a $25 discount on its Unlimited Plus plan for DirecTV and DirecTV Now subscribers. Comcast customers that subscribe to AT&T for wireless service are especially susceptible to that kind of promotion. Xfinity Mobile provides an opportunity for Comcast to get customers to switch from AT&T's wireless service to Comcast and stick with their current cable TV plan. It's now at least a two-way street. That's notable for AT&T investors as the telephone company has struggled to add video subscribers. Last quarter, DirecTV Now accounted for over 100% of its net additions; satellite and U-Verse combined for a net loss of 25,000 subscribers. Stealing video customers away from Comcast through bundling was one way to offset subscriber losses. Comcast also offers a pay-by-the-gigabyte option for subscribers. Customers can pay $12 per GB, and they only have to pay for the data they use. Considering most people use less than 5 GB of data per month, and Comcast has 16 million WiFi hotspots to offload additional data, many customers could save money by going a la carte with their data. What's more, Comcast allows customers to switch to the unlimited plan mid-month, so it's effectively capping the per-gigabyte plan at $65 per month (for about 5.5 GB of data or more). The catch is, the offer is still limited to Comcast's customers and not available nationwide. Comcast does own the rights to stream some cable networks nationwide, and it could launch a streaming TV competitor, so it's not out of the question that Xfinity Mobile could eventually become a nationwide product. If it did, it would become a much bigger threat to traditional wireless carriers. Even so, the a-la-carte pricing appeals to lower value customers at AT&T and Verizon. While it may cut into subscriber numbers, it won't affect their bottom lines nearly as much as would stealing away large families on unlimited data plans (a segment where both AT&T and Verizon are able to match or undercut Comcast's pricing). Xfinity Mobile isn't a big threat to Verizon or AT&T, but it could somewhat slow gross additions for both companies' wireless services as well as AT&T's television services. Another competitive force in the wireless market isn't great news for the telecom giants, but it's nothing to be too concerned about, either. ","

Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP) investors were greeted last week by the news that AT&T (NYSE:T) planned to purchase the small company for a total transaction cost of $1.6 billion. Proceeds to Straight Path shareholders would be $1.25 billion, or $95.63 per share, payable in AT&T stock. That's over a 200% premium from the previous Friday's close, and a massive 1,500% increase since IDT spun off the company back in 2013. Straight Path's stock closed last Thursday at $91.70 and this was followed by an SEC filing by the company noting that it had received interest from another party that was considering topping AT&T's offer. Investors jumped in when the market reopened Monday and had pushed the stock up to $106 by 2:30 p.m. Rumor has it Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is the second bidder. STRP data by YCharts While the AT&T deal, and any one topping it, will be a boon for Straight Path owners, it also has relevancy for other investors betting on the future of wireless communications. The race to launch the next-generation 5G network is heating up and is worth consideration. Image source: AT&T. That will be accomplished by expanding the network's reach. Part of the conversation around 5G has been the use of small cells, referring to localized wireless access points. Historically, wireless connectivity has been achieved with large cell towers, but the next generation of connectivity could be brought down to the micro level, relying even on home-based routers to provide access for users. Thus, 5G could have seamless integration with Wi-Fi, expanding the reach of networks overall and providing ultra-high speeds and ultra-high reliability for the tidal wave of device connections that has been dubbed the Internet of Things. Those connections span everything from consumer electronics and vehicles to industrial and medical equipment. A wireless connectivity service that is able to accommodate all of those devices could be huge. With the IoT movement already underway, it has become a race to get that bigger and better network up and running. Straight Path owns bandwidth licenses and other intellectual property that will play a key role in the future 5G network, which is expected to begin initial rollout later this year. AT&T hopes its acquisition helps accelerate its development and expansion and supports other key purchases it has made as of late or is in the process of making.

The country's largest mobile providers will likely continue to battle it out for subscribers, but growth in adding subscription services has started to slow dramatically as of late.

It's beginning to look like the 5G network and the IoT will be the next catalysts for growth. The big purchases by AT&T and Verizon to speed up R&D are setting the stage for the next battle in the world of telecom. If the current trend continues, AT&T and Verizon will come to rely on big data services as their primary means of business in a few short years as a result of the move to 5G. The potential battle over Straight Path is the most recent, visible example of how the companies are trying to one-up each other. ","

Dividends aren't sexy but they are effective. While companies that offer regular payouts aren't likely to triple in value in any given year, dividends are the strong and steady force behind many retirement portfolios. Over time, such payments create dynamic wealth. Consider the two companies we are investigating today: telecom giant Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Over the last 25 years, their stocks have gone up 130% and 940%, respectively. But when we take dividends into account, this is what happens. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts. If I had my way, I'd jump into a time machine, grab my beginner investor self, and tell him, ""Brian, there's nothing more important to your success than picking companies with the strongest sustainable competitive advantages."" That's because these advantages, often referred to as ""moats,"" are what separate a companies from the rest of the field. They provide that special something that keeps customers coming back for more and the competition at bay for ages. Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson has three different divisions, each with its own moat. The consumer division, which accounts for 18% of sales, is buoyed by the strength of the company's brands like Band-Aid and Tylenol. The medical device division -- which comprises 35% of all sales -- benefits from large installed bases and moderately high switching costs for hospitals. And biggest of all, pharmaceuticals -- pulling in 47% of all sales -- is protected by patents. It's somewhat concerning that patents only last a specific amount of time, and yet they protect almost half of the company's revenue. At the same time, the reliability of the other two divisions allows Johnson & Johnson some leeway that other pharmaceutical companies don't have. Verizon is also making inroads into becoming a content company. The acquisitions of AOL and part of Yahoo! are evidence of this. If this seems like a lot of ink spilled over the moats for these two, that's because it is. It's impossible for me to solidly declare a winner here, as both are very strong. Investors love seeing cash returned to them. But it's important to keep cash sitting in the bank, too. That's because every company will deal with tough economic times. When those times hit, companies with cash have options: buy back shares on the cheap, acquire competitors, or outspend them in an attempt to gain market share. Those with a lot of debt are in the opposite boat, fragilized by their tenuous obligations. In the chart below, I've adjusted Verizon's free cash flow numbers to normalize them. They were artificially lower due to the fact that the company paid a large one-time tax bill for divesting some of its business, and it changed its business model to do far less subsidizing of phone plans. Remember that Johnson & Johnson is valued 70% higher than Verizon. Here's how the two stack up: Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $4 billion $105 billion $13.1 billion $13.8 billion Johnson & Johnson $42 billion $22 billion $16.5 billion $15.5 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Verizon 13 14 3.0 4.8% 67%* Johnson & Johnson 19 22 2.7 2.6% 55% Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. *FCF for Verizon is adjusted for the factors mentioned above. On the face of it, Johnson & Johnson appears to be the more expensive stock, trading at a significant premium on an earnings and free cash flow basis. But the company is growing faster than Verizon as well, and trades at a 10% discount to Verizon on the PEG ratio. In the end, the differentiator is the dividend. Verizon's payout is safe and much larger than Johnson & Johnson's. So there you have it: We have a draw. Both companies have solid moats, Johnson & Johnson has the stronger balance sheet, and Verizon is more attractively valued. If I were forced to choose, I would side with Johnson & Johnson, as I like the company's opportunities to grow in the future, while I think Verizon's foray into content is a bit riskier. Either way, both of these companies are solid dividend payers worthy of your careful consideration. ","

Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) has seen some hard times lately. The telecommunications equipment and services veteran fell short of Wall Street's earnings estimates in three of the past four quarterly reports, slashed dividend payments by 75% in January, and saw share prices fall 33% over the past 52 weeks. Does Ericsson have a path back to profitable growth, or are the dog days here to stay? Image source: Getty Images. The Swedish company is preparing to report first-quarter results next week. In the meantime, here's a quick look at Ericsson's results in fiscal year 2016: Metric FY 2016 FY 2015 Year-over-year Change Revenue $26.0 billion $29.3 billion (11%) Net income $0.22 billion $1.62 billion (86%) Earnings per share (diluted) $0.06 $0.49 (88%) Free cash flows $0.98 billion $1.61 billion (39%) Average SEK-to-USD exchange rate $1 = 8.56 SEK $1 = 8.43 SEK 1.5% Data source: LM Ericsson. 2016 was a tough year for the telecom equipment industry in general. The 4G installation cycle is winding down, and 5G replacements are not quite ready for action yet. Network operators are consolidating on a global level, leaving fewer clients for Ericsson and its rivals to pursue. Economic uncertainties weren't inspiring networks to lighten their capital expense wallets any faster than necessary. All of these issues weighed heavy on Ericsson's sales trends and gross profits last year. The company launched new product platforms while running a cost-reduction program last year. The cost controls are said to be running on track, including the elimination of 4,800 positions or 5% of Ericsson's total workforce. ERIC data by YCharts There are a few new wrinkles to consider in the Ericsson story: Moreover, it turns out that Vestberg might have more to offer Ericsson even after leaving the company. He now works for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), in a role giving him hands-on control over that network's fiber-optic networking strategy. Ericsson is known to be working with Verizon on infrastructure for the upcoming installation of 5G standards. If that weren't enough, Vestberg is said to have a long-running friendship with Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam, and is one of three high-level executives who might take over when McAdam retires. In other words, Ericsson has a pretty significant foot in the door toward winning contracts for Verizon's network upgrades. Wall Street analysts have started coming around to Ericsson's view, sparking several upgrades and rosy price targets in recent weeks. The company sports an attractive risk/reward balance at today's low share prices, especially if Ekholm can make some tough decisions and take the cost-cutting program to the next level. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch, and Ericsson has a lot of hard work to do before investors can cash in those promises. That being said, we're talking about a global leader in a cyclical but fundamentally strong industry, trading in a deep trough at the moment. I have to say that buying Ericsson today looks less like a risk and more of a value-bounce reward over the next couiple of years. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

If it wasn't for Sling TV, Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) would be bleeding subscribers. Instead, the streaming linear TV service has attracted over 1 million subscribers, helping Dish tread water with its overall subscriber numbers. At the end of 2016, Dish reported 13.67 million subscribers across its traditional satellite business and Sling TV. That's down 310,000 or so from two years ago, right before Dish launched Sling TV, but consider how much worse it would be without Sling TV. Dish Networks' management argues that it can charge so much less for Sling TV (plans start at just $20 per month) because its customer acquisition costs are so much less. There's no need to send a person over to the house to install the satellite dish, or set up in-home equipment, all of which Dish pays for upfront. Sling TV also doesn't offer loss-leading promotional short-term sign-up rates to acquire customers. But even when you factor in the savings, Sling TV customers generate about one-fourth the profit of traditional satellite customers over their lifetime. Image source: Sling TV. Annual subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber are down 25% over the last two years. In the fourth quarter, that number fell to about $536, down from about $853 in 2014. That's not entirely due to the influx of Sling TV subscribers, but multiple times throughout its annual report, management notes, ""As Sling branded pay-TV subscriber activations increase, it will have a positive impact on subscriber acquisition costs."" The trend in subscriber acquisition costs indicates that most of Dish's gross additions are Sling TV subscribers. The problem is, Sling may be cannibalizing Dish's satellite business -- i.e., customers Dish has already acquired. In that case, Dish isn't saving any money on customers switching to Sling. They're just replacing a higher revenue stream with a lower one. Analyst Craig Moffett says each time Dish replaces a satellite customer with a Sling customer, ""they forgo a future stream of contribution dollars equal to about $1,950 ... In the substitute OTT subscriber, they gain a future contribution stream worth about $325, and they incur upfront cost of about $55."" Those values are based on the average customer life for both satellite and Sling TV. Even if Dish isn't directly cannibalizing itself (with its satellite customers dropping the dish for Sling), the trend is for Sling TV subscribers replacing Dish. The effect is still the same. Several big competitors have entered or are planning to enter the streaming linear TV market. AT&T (NYSE:T) launched DirecTV Now late last year and has already attracted some 400,000 subscribers, according to one media executive. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is also interested in launching a nationwide streaming service this year. The big difference between Dish Network and AT&T and Verizon is that the latter two don't rely on video subscriptions for the bulk of their revenue. AT&T and Verizon's streaming services will support their core wireless service businesses through bundling options. There's no incentive to take other services from Dish Network with Sling TV, but AT&T incentivizes DirecTV Now Subscribers to buy into its highest-tier data plan -- Unlimited Plus. Investors can expect Verizon to do something similar. AT&T has a sizable traditional TV business with both U-Verse and DirecTV. The early adoption of AT&T's DirecTV Now doesn't seem to have had a major impact on its traditional TV subscribers; it lost 27,000 subs last quarter versus 26,000 a year ago. Time will tell if AT&T sees more cannibalization over time. Meanwhile, Verizon's video customer base is relatively small and geographically limited. A nationwide streaming service could help it cut into competitors' markets more than its own FiOS TV service. While the margins on these streaming linear TV packages are much smaller than traditional TV, the opportunity to bundle nationwide makes them much more valuable for AT&T and Verizon. For Dish, it leads to a deterioration of subscriber value over time, and the cost savings don't even come close to making up for it. ","

"Todd Campbell, Jason Hall, and Anders Bylund",04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Main Street investors probably aren't familiar with Orange SA (NYSE:ORAN), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and Vestas Wind Systems (NASDAQOTH:VWDRY), but our Motley Fool contributors think that's a good thing. Since these companies aren't making front-page news (yet), they could be bargains worth adding to your portfolio. Anders Bylund (Orange): France-based telecom giant Orange SA runs a multinational network of wired and wireless telecommunications services. The company serves 263 million subscribers across 29 countries, including high-growth developing markets such as Egypt and the Middle East. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. By comparison, American peer Verizon serves just 142 million subscribers altogether. AT&T gets closer with a grand total of 210 million connections, but the count drops to 176 million if you back out Ma Bell's DirecTV satellite TV customers. Either way, Orange stands head and shoulders above its American counterparts in terms of business scale and customer reach. But how often do you think about this global telecom giant? Popular financial sites show a mere trickle of news about Orange, often nothing more than the company's own press releases for monthlong periods. The same sites show a mere handful of Wall Street analysts covering the stock -- or none at all. American investors simply don't see this company and stock very often, even though it trades directly on the Big Board. For those willing to dive a bit deeper, Orange would be well worth a second look. Analyst-tracking services that include European analyst firms in their ratings polls show 23 buy ratings and seven holds these days, versus no sell recommendations. In our Motley Fool CAPS system, 709 investors like you and me have rated Orange, with 96% of them giving the stock a thumbs-up rating. Orange offers a generous dividend policy, ambitious international growth plans, and deep-discount valuation ratios. I can't say for sure that Wall Street is actively trying to hide Orange from American investors, but it's the closest thing to a secret weapon you'll find in my own real-world investment portfolio. Todd Campbell (Shopify): As Anders points out, stocks with headquarters outside the U.S. often fly under the radar, and that can present a great opportunity for investors savvy enough to find them. One company that I think more investors should be aware of is Shopify, a Canadian provider of software solutions to small and midsize retailers. It seamlessly services brick-and-mortar stores and online retailers with a suite of solutions that help them win customers, manage inventory, and process payments, and its sales growth is downright inspiring. The number of merchants relying on its system jumped to over 375,000 in the fourth quarter from 243,000 a year ago, and as a result, sales grew 86% year over year to $130 million in the quarter. What I really like about this company is that its platform is highly scalable, and its business model has the potential to be very shareholder-friendly. Merchants pay a monthly subscription fee that ranges from $29 to $299, and those subscriptions provide a nice, steady source of recurring revenue, but processing merchant orders could be the big gravy train. Thanks to more merchants using its solutions -- and a healthy economy --  the dollar value of orders it processes grew 94% year over year to $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, and $2.2 billion of that volume was processed on its Shopify Payments service, up 120% from Q4 2015. As merchandise volume on its platform expands, so too will revenue, and right now, there's no evidence of momentum slowing. In fact, management thinks it can deliver sales of at least $580 million this year, and if it can deliver, it will represent yet another big year of growth for the company. SHOP Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Admittedly, the big black mark on this stock is that the company is still losing money. However, online retail sales still make up only a small percentage of total retail volume, and rapid growth could get this company into the black as soon as next year. Jason Hall (Vestas Wind Systems): With a market capitalization of more than $17 billion, wind turbine manufacturer, installer, and servicer Vestas Wind Systems isn't small at all, and it's one of the biggest renewable-energy companies in the world. But there's a good chance a lot of people reading this either haven't heard of it or don't know very much about it at all. And it may not be fair to say that Wall Street wants to keep it a secret, since it's based in Sweden, but there aren't any major U.S.-based analysts providing coverage of the company, despite the fact that it does hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. sales every year. But investors would do well to pay close attention. In coming decades, a growing global middle class is going to require a lot more electricity generation, and renewables such as wind are expected to produce a large amount of new electricity. Vestas, already a global leader in the industry, is positioned to profit from this trend. Vestas is pretty cheap right now, too, trading at less than 17 times last year's earnings. That's significantly below the nearly 27 times earnings you'd pay for the S&P 500. If you're looking to buy an under-the-radar leader in a wonderful growth industry, Vestas is worth a close look.
