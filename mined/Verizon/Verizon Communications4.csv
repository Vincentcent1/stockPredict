,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"The news stoked speculation about the future of the T-Mobile-Sprint tie-up, and also about other potential merger partners for T-Mobile. Analysts have said that the telecoms and cable sectors are primed for a wave of deal activity, and executives have openly talked about potential mergers. If the talks with Charter and Comcast fail, Sprint’s negotiating position could weaken if it were to restart merger talks with T-Mobile, JPMorgan analysts said. T-Mobile’s shares fell 3.3 percent on Tuesday to $61.06, while Dish shares were up 0.3 percent at $64.02. Sprint shares were last up 2.7 percent at $8.22. Analysts have speculated that Dish, a satellite TV provider that has been buying up wireless spectrum, could be an attractive acquisition target for both Verizon and T-Mobile. Sprint’s talks to provide the backbone for a wireless network for Comcast and Charter serve as a “three-way hedge” for the companies, said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “From a game theory perspective, this is a fascinating move,” Moffett wrote in an email. The two cable companies are hedging for a possible tie-up between Sprint and T-Mobile that could reduce their negotiating leverage, and the wireless deal also allows Sprint to hedge against the risk that a merger with T-Mobile never happens, Moffett said. A wireless deal with Comcast and Charter would also give Sprint more bargaining leverage if it does secure a tie-up with T-Mobile, he added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the negotiations between the companies on Monday, said Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. A minority equity investment was being discussed but that may not be part of any deal, sources told Reuters. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources said. Comcast and Charter announced a wireless partnership in May in a bid to offset customer attrition as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Comcast also already has an MVNO agreement with Sprint that stems from the cable company’s 2008 investment in Clearwire Corp. A source familiar with the matter said Comcast would seek better terms for that agreement given the highly competitive nature of the wireless business and technological changes in the past nine years. MVNOs do not own networks, and instead rent capacity from established operators to sell on to their customers, usually at low prices due to their small overheads, with cheap distribution through the internet or convenience stores. The cable companies’ agreement with Verizon restricts them to offer wireless within their own service areas, while a deal with Sprint could allow them to offer the service nationally. Verizon shares were down 1.6 percent on Tuesday at $44.97. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"WILMINGTON, Del./BOSTON (Reuters) - Sprint Corp used confidential information from its alliance with RadioShack Corp to open competing mobile phone stores, dooming the comeback by the electronics retailer and destroying jobs, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by RadioShack creditors. RadioShack emerged from bankruptcy in 2015 with a deal to co-brand about 1,400 stores with Sprint, which was meant to help the telecoms provider better compete with larger rivals AT&T Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. However, by early 2017 RadioShack, owned by General Wireless, had returned to bankruptcy and is liquidating. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court by RadioShack’s official committee of unsecured creditors says that Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint breached its contract with RadioShack, and is seeking $500 million in damages. Sprint allegedly ignored its obligations to provide inventory and staff to RadioShack stores because of its own financial troubles. Sprint spokesman David Tovar said the company was disappointed by the creditors’ committee action and Sprint expected to defend the matter vigorously. The lawsuit alleges that in 2016, Sprint used confidential information obtained from RadioShack to open 200 competing stores near RadioShack’s best locations, sinking any comeback for the electronics chain. “Sprint’s action destroyed nearly 6,000 RadioShack jobs,” said the lawsuit. The allegations stand in sharp contrast to promises made less than seven months ago by the chief executive officer of SoftBank, Sprint’s Japanese parent company, that he would create U.S. jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump made jobs the centerpiece of his election campaign. SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son was among the first foreign business leaders to meet with then-President-elect Donald Trump at his New York headquarters and praised the Republican for a raft of planned deregulations. The CEO promised to invest $50 billion with the aim of hiring 50,000 people in the United States. Trump took credit for the commitment and reported in late December that Sprint had committed to bringing 5,000 jobs to the United States. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp is in talks with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp about a partnership to boost the two U.S. cable companies’ wireless offerings, according to sources familiar with the matter. Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other’s consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added. One of the sources said that a minority equity investment was being discussed but that it may not be part of any deal. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources added. Sprint, Comcast and Charter declined to comment. An agreement with the cable providers over its network does not mean Sprint may not also seek a merger agreement with T-Mobile, which is controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG, the sources said. Sprint sees the partnership as increasing competition in the market, which should help alleviate any antitrust concerns over a merger with T-Mobile, the source added. Investors have long expected a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless service providers, anticipating cost cuts and other synergies in the range of $6 billion to $10 billion. Three years ago, Sprint ended a previous round of talks to acquire T-Mobile amid opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump offered support for emerging technologies including unmanned aerial vehicles and next-generation wireless networks in a meeting on Thursday with the chiefs of AT&T Inc and General Electric Co and other business leaders. The White House brought together venture capitalists and executives from the telecommunications and drone, or unmanned aerial system, industries to discuss how the government can speed technologies to market. The meeting, which lasted more than three hours including breakout sessions, is part of Trump’s effort to tap industry experts on how to boost U.S. competitiveness in various fields and create jobs. On Monday, Trump met with the heads of 18 U.S. technology companies including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, seeking their help to make the government’s computing systems more efficient. He will meet with energy industry leaders next week. “We want them to create new companies and lots of jobs,” Trump told the executives on Thursday. “We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.” In attendance were chief executives of several drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc. Drone makers argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does not require automakers to win pre-approval of self-driving vehicle technologies. Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc also took part. Venture capital firms included Revolution LLC, headed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. Obama administration rules opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for deliveries beyond the view of an operator. Security issues would need to be addressed. The Federal Aviation Administration in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000. Last year, regulators cleared the way for next-generation 5G wireless networks, with expected speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020 but infrastructure hurdles remain. Wireless signals need to be much faster and more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or remote control of machinery. 5G networks could help to wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines.

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to American Tower Corporation's (AMT) offering of $750 million senior unsecured notes due 2027. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to repay existing debt, including debt under its 2013 and 2014 revolving credit facilities. Proceeds may also be used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2017, pro forma outstanding borrowings on AMT's RCFs totalled approximately $2.9 billion. The pro forma amount reflects the net repayment of approximately $95 million on is 2013 credit facility subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017. AMT currently has a Fitch Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong FCF and Margins: AMT's ratings are supported by the financial flexibility provided by its strong FCF and its high EBITDA margin, which has been consistently around 60% in recent years. The tower business model translates into strong, sustainable operating performance and FCF growth, aided by the company's significant scale and the favorable demand characteristics for wireless services (particularly data). Stable Growth Model: AMT is expected to continue to post strong FCF, generate mid- to high-single-digit organic growth and maintain relatively stable margins. Tower revenues are predictable, and growth is provided by contractual escalators embodied in long-term lease contracts and there are strong prospects for additional business. The tower industry is benefiting from wireless carriers continued investment in their fourth generation (4G) networks to meet rapidly growing demand for mobile broadband services. Stable Outlook: At March 31, 2017, net leverage was 5.0x, and Fitch expects AMT's net leverage to decline slightly to under 5.0x at the end of 2017. Leverage has gradually declined following AMT's acquisitions over the last couple of years, including the acquisition of the rights to towers and outright purchases of towers from Verizon Communications Inc. in 2015. Consolidation Risk Manageable: Fitch believes U.S. wireless consolidation, if it were to occur, would not have a material effect on AMT's operations. Revenue growth from continued lease activity and contractual escalators in the U.S market would more than offset the relatively modest losses occurring over time due to consolidation. International Exposure: Similar wireless service demand trends are occurring internationally, with wireless data services at an earlier stage of development than in the U.S. Excluding pass-through revenues, the company's international operations generated approximately 34% of total property revenues in the first quarter of 2017. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --In 2017, consolidated revenue grows to approximately $6.6 billion, based on expectations for property revenue to be near the mid-point of company guidance of $6.5 billion. In 2018 and thereafter, Fitch assumes revenue grows in the 4%-5% range due to contractual escalators and new-business growth. --EBITDA margins decline slightly in 2017 due to the lower margins associated with acquired properties but increase moderately thereafter as additional tenants are added to towers. --Capital spending of approximately $850 million in 2017. --Moderate stock repurchases as net leverage under 5x is reached, with further deleveraging arising from EBITDA growth (rather than debt repayment). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: At the current 'BBB' level, Fitch does not currently anticipate near-term developments that could lead to an upgrade of the rating. Negative: A negative rating action could occur if operating performance falls short of expectations of at least mid-single-digit organic growth combined with margin pressure, or if a significant transaction, or share repurchases, results in expectations for net leverage sustained above 5x for longer than an 18-24 month period. LIQUIDITY In Fitch's opinion, AMT has a strong liquidity position supported by its FCF, cash on hand and availability on its revolving credit facilities. Operationally, cash flow generation should remain strong. For 2016, FCF (cash provided by operating activities less capital spending and dividends) was approximately $1 billion. As of March 31, 2017, cash approximated $713 million and unused revolver capacity was approximately $1.77 billion. Of the cash balance, approximately $564 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. AMT has two revolving credit facilities: a $2 billion, multi-currency facility due in January 2022 (the 2014 RCF) and a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility due in June 2020 (the 2013 RCF). The principal financial covenants limited total debt/adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) to no more than 6.0x (up to 7.0x for specified time periods following a qualified acquisition). The covenants limit senior secured debt/adjusted EBITDA to 3.0x for the company and its subsidiaries. If debt ratings are below a specified level at the end of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense must be no less than 2.5x for as long as the ratings are below the specified level. There are no material maturities in 2017, and approximately $1.5 billion matures in 2018. Contact: Primary Analyst John C. Culver, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3216 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

(AABA) holds the balance of the remaining Yahoo assets, including 15.4% of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), following Verizon Communications Inc.'s (VZ) partial acquisition. The newly minted $52 billion market cap seems pricey, but no one really knows the value of this corporate hodgepodge or how it's going to grow in the coming years. Technically speaking, the stock is well positioned for gains through the rest of 2017 because the new entity has adopted Yahoo's long-term chart, yielding a timely breakout above the 2014 high at $52.62. While it's easy to second guess this glued-together reporting, consider that other big caps including United States Steel Corporation (X) and AT&T Inc. (T) have also sewn together bits and pieces of newly acquired operations or divestitures into multi-decade price charts. (See also: What Is Altaba Anyway?) AABA Long-Term Chart (1996 – 2017) The former company came public at $1.49 (after adjustment for five stock splits) in April 1996 and fell into a downtrend that found support near 65 cents. It then entered a powerful trend advance driven by the awakening of the net bubble, rising to an all-time high at $125.03 in March 2000. The subsequent downtrend relinquished the majority of the prior decade's dramatic gains, dropping the stock more than 97% to $4.01 at the end of 2002. The subsequent uptrend topped out at $43.66 in January 2006, highlighting severe technical damage because the rally failed to reach the .386 Fibonacci bear market retracement level. A pullback into 2008 accelerated during the economic collapse, dropping the stock back into the single digits for the second time in six years. It underperformed badly after hitting a bottom in November 2008, stuck in a narrow trading range bounded by resistance in the upper teens. The stock took off in the strongest buying impulse so far this decade in the second half of 2012, breaking out above the 2006 high in October 2014 before topping out in the low $50s a few weeks later. It then entered a steep correction that found support in the upper $20s in early 2016, ahead of an equally strong bounce that reached within a few points of the prior high in May 2017, just a few weeks before this month's post-acquisition breakout. (For more, see: Verizon Officially Now Owns Yahoo, Mayer Resigns.) AABA Short-Term Chart (2015 – 2017) The sell-off into 2016 unfolded through an Elliott five-wave decline, perfectly aligned with bearish action throughout the tech universe during that period. The stock tested the September 2015 low at $27.20 in February 2016, broke down and then rallied strongly, setting off a 2B buy signal that denotes the failure of bears to hold new resistance. Rumors about a company sale or divestiture generated speculative buying interest into September, when it disclosed high-profile hacking incidents that raised questions about the company's valuation. (For more, see: Yahoo Confirms Massive Data Breach.) On-balance volume (OBV) topped out in 2014 and entered a persistent distribution wave that ended four months before the price bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016. This bullish divergence contributed to steady buying interest that reached a new high ahead of the Verizon sale. The transaction triggered high-volume price bars and a sharp indicator downturn to a nine-month low, signaling aggressive profit taking as well as new purchases. The OBV downturn tells us that the stock needs to rebuild previously loyal sponsorship to continue the 16-month uptrend. However, the price remains in breakout mode, and it makes sense to ignore recent signals because they're unfolding right at the interface between the two corporate identities. In other words, this seemingly bearish activity could reflect the natural rotation from one set of shareholder hands to another. (See also: On-Balance Volume: The Way to Smart Money.) Altaba came to life after Yahoo sold key assets to Verizon, with the new entity using the parent's long-term chart. The split has triggered a major breakout undermined by a bearish volume signal, but we'll ignore that red flag for now, given broad tech strength and confusion about the new entity's legitimate supply and demand.

The company said Thursday a total of 64,514,767 shares of its stock were tendered at or below the final purchase price of $53.20 a share. Altaba said it accepted the purchase price and spent about $3.4 billion to buy back the shares. The $3.4 billion excludes fees and expenses related to the tender offer and represents around 6.7% of the shares outstanding as of June 20. (See also: Revised Deal: Verizon to Pay $350M Less for Yahoo.) In May, Yahoo announced the Dutch auction, saying then the price would not be less than $37 a share and that its directors and executive officers will not tender any shares in the buyback.

Recently, shares of Altaba were trading up 0.53%, or $0.28 to $55.34. The stock has been gaining all week as investors view it as a cheaper way to get a piece of Alibaba Group, the Chinese ecommerce giant. While the former Yahoo basically looks like a holding company for a stake in the Chinese retailer, Yahoo warned in a regulatory filing last year that Alibaba could get hit with a massive tax bill of as much as 36.5% if it tried to buy back the shares. Investors also get access to a stake in Yahoo Japan valued at $7.7 billion by owning shares of Altaba. The company also has $12 billion in cash and marketable debts, $130 million in minority investments including in Snap Inc. (SNAP) and a $740 million stake in Excalibur, which is a unit of the new company that holds patents of Yahoo that were not sold to Verizon. Leading the new company is Yahoo board member Thomas McInerney, formerly the chief financial officer for IAC/InterActiveCorp.

Telecom stocks are popular with income investors because they offer high yields and steady growth and their moats are tough for new competitors to cross. But with so many telco stocks on the market, it can be hard to identify the best plays. Let's take a closer look at three of my personal favorites -- AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and BCE (NYSE:BCE). AT&T pays a forward dividend yield of 5.2%, and it's hiked that dividend annually for over three decades. It spent 95% of its earnings and 70% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months -- so it can easily keep raising its dividend for the foreseeable future. Image source: Pixabay. AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. after Verizon, and it's the largest pay TV provider in the country, thanks to its purchase of DirecTV in 2015. If its proposed takeover of Time Warner clears regulatory hurdles, it will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world. AT&T is bundling these services together in lucrative packages to lock in customers. Its wireless customers, for example, can stream content from DirecTV and its ""sponsored data"" partners without the usage counting toward their data plans. It also recently bundled Time Warner's HBO channels with its unlimited wireless plans. Analysts expect AT&T's revenue to fall 2% this year and for its earnings to rise 2%. Those are lackluster growth figures, but the stock trades at just 19 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 22 for telecom companies. Verizon also pays a forward yield of 5.2%, and it's hiked that dividend for 10 straight years. It spent 76% of its earnings on those dividends over the past 12 months. However, Verizon's free cash flow also dipped into the red over the past year -- partly due to its buyout of Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless in 2014 and its subsequent purchases of AOL and Yahoo's internet business. Data source: YCharts. Verizon merged those two aging businesses into a new company called Oath, led by former AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Armstrong recently claimed that the new media platform would attract over 10 million creators for 2 billion customers and generate between $10 billion to $20 billion in annual revenues -- which would represent 12% of Verizon's 2016 revenue at the midpoint. Verizon plans to bundle all of these internet and media properties into its own wireless and wireline ecosystem. Like AT&T, it's using sponsored data to lock in customers with data-free streaming -- a strategy that both telcos hope will offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless customers. Analysts see Verizon's revenue and earnings both slipping 3% this year on the slowdown of its core wireless business and its increased investments in its ecosystem. However, both figures are expected to turn positive next year, and the stock remains cheaper than AT&T at 15 times earnings. BCE, formerly known as Bell Canada Enterprises, is the largest telecom company in Canada. It generates most of its revenue from internet, phone, and TV packages, but also generates additional revenue from investments in media outlets, real estate holdings, and professional sport teams. BCE pays a forward dividend yield of 4.8%, and it's hiked that dividend on an annualized basis for two straight years. It spent 83% of its earnings and 87% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months -- so its payout looks very sustainable. Unlike AT&T and Verizon, BCE is posting steady growth in wireless postpaid subscribers, which is only partly offset by its weaker prepaid growth. Its wireline business also continues growing, thanks to the strength of its internet and TV businesses. Analysts expect BCE's revenue to rise 4% this year, but its earnings are expected to slip 1% -- partly due to its recent takeover of Manitoba Telecom Services. But above all, BCE isn't copying AT&T's and Verizon's strategies of expanding their media ecosystems or divesting their wireline businesses. So if you're looking for a simpler telco with fewer moving parts, BCE -- which trades at a reasonable 18 times earnings -- might fit the bill. ","
      
    The 3 Best Dividend Stocks in Telecommunications -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Comparing American telecom players Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) to one another is like comparing the Major Leagues to Triple-A. They technically play the same sport, but they operate at entirely different scales. Thankfully, in the investing world, stocks of all shapes and sizes can make for potential buys; we're equal-opportunity investors here at the Fool. So keeping that in mind, let's look at CenturyLink and Verizon across three important categories to determine which company looks like the more appealing investment today. As a baseline, investors need to first understand the financial stability of any prospective investment before digging into its broader growth and valuation narratives. To guide this analysis, let's look at four metrics to get a sense of how Verizon and CenturyLink stack up in terms of liquidity and solvency. Company Cash & Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio CenturyLink $214 million $19.6 billion $4.2 billion 0.9 Verizon $4.3 billion $116.8 billion $16.9 billion 1.0 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The aforementioned difference in scale between the two comes into sharper contrast here. However, it should also jump out that, though they differ quite dramatically in absolute size, CenturyLink and Verizon share fairly similar capital structure and cash flow generation profiles. The two companies share virtually identical current ratios. Beyond that, CenturyLink carries just 1.1% of its total debt load in cash and investments, whereas Verizon holds 2.6% of its borrowings in liquid assets -- not much difference there. Alternatively, CenturyLink's 12-month cash flow from operations represents 21.4% of its total debt, whereas Verizon's cash flows only account for 10.1% of its $116.8 billion in debt. Granted, Verizon enjoys an investment-grade credit rating versus CenturyLink's non-investment-grade rating, so Verizon's cost of borrowing is likely lower. However, since the two share so much in common in terms of their financial footprint, it seems fairest to call this section a tie and move on. Image Source: Getty Images. Here's where the differences between the two start to really hit home. As the largest wireless provider in the U.S., Verizon's business model is largely predicated on providing wireless services to consumers and businesses -- $89 billion of its $125 billion in fiscal 2016 revenue came from wireless. Though the U.S. wireless market is no longer growing as fast as it once was, the space is generally stable. Alongside the other U.S. wireless monolith AT&T, Verizon's massive financial resources should allow it to effectively compete against continued competition from T-Mobile and Sprint. Moreover, the company is attempting to align itself with the broader trends in the wireless industry, most notably by buying its way into mobile advertising via its AOL and Yahoo acquisitions. For the record, I like AT&T's growth strategy more, but there's little reason to fret over Verizon's long-term place as a central player in this space. CenturyLink, on the other hand, finds itself in a slightly more precarious situation. In fact, $7.6 billion of the company's $17.4 billion in 2016 sales come from what CenturyLink calls its legacy services segment, which mostly consists of landline phone services for companies and consumers. As the company itself notes, this business is expected to remain in secular decline as the use of landline phones continues to dwindle. The remaining majority of CenturyLink's revenue comes from providing broadband and other data connectivity services to companies and individuals, which isn't necessarily a growth market either. The company hopes to shore up its competitive position via its pending merger with Level 3 Communications. The $34 billion deal should help expand CenturyLink's presence in the broadband service market and provide considerable cost savings. To be clear, this move is undoubtedly a smart one. However, it doesn't change the company's fundamental problem that it is largely tied to competitive markets that seem likely to decline over time. Looking to the final section of our analysis, let's start by reviewing three popular valuation metrics for Verizon and CenturyLink. Company P/E Forward P/E P/Cash Flow CenturyLink 15.6 12.2 12.3 Verizon 25.2 12.5 11.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar. Chart by author. Let's also tie in analysts' consensus growth estimates here to provide a bit more context about each company's valuation. Wall Street expects Verizon's sales to decline 2.7% this year and grow 0.5% next year. For CenturyLink, the analyst community sees its sales falling 5.4% this year and 1.8% next year. In this light, Verizon's higher current P/E starts to appear more favorable, and its forward multiples seem more enticing. Lastly, any discussion of these two telecom names would be remiss without looking at their dividends, one of the hallmarks of telecom investing. Verizon currently pays out a comparatively lower 4.9% dividend, and its dividend payout ratio stands at 76% of net income. CenturyLink pays out an 8.5% dividend with a 211% dividend yield, which seems rather aggressive. Ultimately, a safer dividend can be better than a higher yield. Verizon wins this final portion of our analysis. Apologies to the CenturyLink fans in the crowd, but Verizon is simply a higher quality business in terms of its current strategy, its size within the space, its growth outlook, and the sustainability of its dividend. To be sure, CenturyLink's Level 3 buyout should help the company improve the efficiency of its operations. However, in thinking about which company you see thriving over the long term, Verizon is the clear winner in this matchup of telecom industry powers. ","
      
    Better Buy: CenturyLink, Inc. vs. Verizon -- The Motley Fool

Anders Bylund,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There are some stocks you couldn't persuade me to buy if they were the last tickers on the market. They are headed toward extinction-level events and are hardly worth the electrons their digital stock certificates are printed on. For me, that list includes fading retailer Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ), near-forgotten smartphone veteran BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and regional telecom Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). Your list of blackball stocks may be different; read on to see why I'm staying away from these tickers. Image source: Getty Images. Frontier Communications has a habit of picking up the landline and FiOS operations that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) doesn't want to deal with anymore. Two large Verizon deals in 2010 and 2016 have more than quintupled Frontier's annual sales in seven years, yet they didn't help Frontier's earnings or free cash flows at all. Furthermore, the company's debt balances rose from $4.8 billion to $17.9 billion and annual interest expenses quadrupled to $1.5 billion. Lacking the large cash flows you'd expect from a mature telecom company, Frontier is cutting its dividend to help finance the debt-servicing costs. And management has not shown much concern for long-term shareholders, either -- the Verizon deals involved both new debt and a massive load of new Frontier shares going into the hands of Verizon's owners. Share prices have reacted as one might expect under this campaign of creative value destruction: FTR data by YCharts This is not a turnaround story just waiting to be told. It's a long, slow death march under the yoke of expensive and unprofitable wireline operations. I suppose the FiOS portion of Frontier's Verizon transactions could have worked out, since high-speed internet connections have worked wonders for other cable and telecom operators in recent years. But even there, Frontier is losing customers quarter by quarter and data service revenue keeps falling. I don't see a happy ending to Frontier's gloomy story. Not now, not in 10 years, not until the company completely shakes up its business model to come up with something that works. Failing that, this stock is going to zero in the long run. Once upon a time, BlackBerry was synonymous with ""smartphones."" High-quality physical keyboards made the company's devices a joy to use for secure text messaging and basic web browsing. Then Apple and the Android gang showed up with their sleek touchscreens and massive app stores. The smartphone game changed overnight, and BlackBerry never managed to find a foothold in the new market. This chart speaks volumes of BlackBerry's fading fortunes: BBRY data by YCharts BlackBerry CEO John Chen is turning the former smartphone giant into a very different business. The Canadian company is now all about secure messaging apps and data security tools. Best of luck, but BlackBerry burned a ton of credibility years ago. Any success the company finds at this point must be built from scratch, not resurrected from the glory days. This turnaround effort is a risky proposition, and it's easy enough to find better investments elsewhere. BlackBerry simply doesn't belong in my portfolio. Finally, I can't think of a single company more obviously headed to the scrap heap of history than Sears Holdings. The mall-based store chain started circling the drain long before Frontier or BlackBerry, and there's no going back: SHLD data by YCharts Kmart and Sears stores are closing their doors by the hundreds, the company is selling off real estate assets and household-name product brands to stay afloat, and billionaire CEO Eddie Lampert was forced to prop the balance sheet up with cash from his own pockets, since banks are no longer interested in doing business with Sears. I don't even have to aim my laser pointer at Sears to see it crumble. This company is falling apart on its own, and I don't want anything to do with it.

    3 Stocks I'd Hate to Buy -- The Motley Fool

Matthew Cochrane,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) is a company firing on all cylinders. In its 2017 first quarter results, all five of its business segments saw year-over-year revenue growth. Four of the five divisions-Display Technologies, Optical Communications, Specialty Materials, and Life Sciences-realized double-digit earnings increases over the previous year's results. Investors in the company have been rewarded for its performance as shares are up 47% over the past year. Yet, while the rally in Corning's shares has been fueled by a broad-based rise in the company's various business segments, it is the fast growth of two, in particular, that might have investors most excited. These divisions, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials, just scored major deals that highlight the opportunities of the industries they each compete in and the large macro trends that might drive further growth for years to come. GLW data by YCharts In the company's most recently reported quarter, its Optical Communications division saw sales of $818 million, a 34% year-over-year increase, and core earnings of $93 million, a whopping 258% year-over-year increase. This division supplies optical fiber to major telecom companies and internet service providers. With the need to upgrade their networks to meet the requirements of 5G soon, the demand for optical fiber isn't going away. Verizon agreed to purchase more than $1 billion of optical fiber from Corning over the next three years. Image source: Corning Incorporated. That's why it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Corning landed such a huge deal with Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) mere days before the company reported its first-quarter earnings. The deal committed Verizon to purchase more than $1 billion in ""optical solutions"" over the next three years which translates to about 20 million kilometers of optical fiber that Corning will supply Verizon annually for the duration of the contract. Corning's CEO Wendell Weeks said the company could sell even more fiber to companies if it had additional manufacturing capacity. As Weeks succinctly put it in the company's first quarter conference call, ""If we had more, we could sell more."" For this reason, Corning is investing in additional optical fiber capacity, which is factored into the company's four-year plan of capital expenditure spending of $6-7 billion. Because of the company's ability to expand its capacity for manufacturing optical fiber, Weeks said he expects the company to grow ""significantly faster than the optical markets we serve."" If all goes according to plan, Corning's shareholders should expect to see further success in this segment. During the conference call, Weeks sounded especially optimistic when he stated: Stepping back, all of our customers have the opportunity to benefit from our unique set of capabilities in Optical Communications. We are engaged in deep dialogue with major telecom players across the globe as they anticipate transformations in communications, education, healthcare, transportation, and ultimately, the way that we all live. Corning's Optical Communications market access platform, essential to realizing their vision, because of our ability to economically expand capacity and deliver innovative solutions. In early May, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook announced the inception of his company's one billion dollar Advanced Manufacturing Fund to spur innovation among American manufacturers. Just weeks later, Apple announced Corning would receive $200 million as the fund's first recipient. The money will go to Corning's Harrodsburg, KY facility where it manufactures Gorilla Glass. Corning scientists produce Gorilla Glass, the glass that is used for iPhones and iPads. Image source: Corning Incorporated. Gorilla Glass is Corning's proprietary state-of-the-art glass that covers most of the world's smartphones and tablets, including every iPhone and iPad ever made. In the first quarter, the business segment saw sales of $300 million and core earnings of $48 million, respective 32% and 50% year-over-year increases. Gorilla Glass 5, the latest and greatest iteration of the specialty glass, has seen a more rapid adoption than previous generations of Gorilla Glass which has translated into gains in price premiums and market share for Corning. With more and more major smartphone manufacturers using glass on the front and backs of their products, it's little surprise that Apple would take such an interest in the glass manufacturing process just before a major product release of its own. Neither optical fiber, which is the backbone of the world's connectivity, or Gorilla Glass, the medium we touch to connect to the rest of the world, are going away anytime soon. The recent deal with Verizon and investment by Apple highlight the many opportunities ahead for Corning in these two growth segments. ","

Leo Sun,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. IBM (NYSE:IBM) has disappointed plenty of investors, including Warren Buffett, with 20 straight quarters of annual revenue declines and a 20% haircut in its market value over the past five years. But as I discussed in previous articles, Big Blue's low valuation and high dividend should limit the stock's downside potential. IBM pays a forward yield of 3.9%, which is almost double the S&P 500's average yield of 2%. That dividend is supported by a low payout ratio of 46%, which gives it plenty of room to continue its 22 straight years of annual dividend hikes. Source: Getty. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, pays a slightly higher forward yield of 4%. That dividend is supported by a payout ratio of 71%, and Qualcomm has raised its dividend annually for 13 straight years. Source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm initially seems to have worse growth prospects than IBM, with analysts expecting its revenue and earnings to respectively fall 3% and 4% this year. Those declines are attributed to its loss of market share in mobile chipsets to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from bigger smartphone makers, and an OEM revolt against its high-margin wireless licensing fees. It's also dealing with a series of antitrust probes and lawsuits -- which claim that it leveraged its wireless patent portfolio to push competitors out of the market and secure exclusive deals. But looking ahead, Qualcomm is also expected to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors in the near future, which would diversify its business away from the troubled mobile market, grow its addressable markets by 40% by 2020, and make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world. The deal is also expected to be ""significantly accretive"" to its non-GAAP earnings once it closes. I believe that's a better turnaround strategy than waiting around for IBM's ""strategic imperatives"" growth to finally pay off. Investors who think Qualcomm looks too risky should consider buying telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T), which pays a forward yield of 5.1% and has hiked its dividend annually for over three decades -- making it a ""dividend aristocrat,"" a company that has hiked its payout for over 25 straight years. That dividend is supported by a payout ratio of 95%. AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. after Verizon, and it's also the biggest pay TV provider in the country, thanks to its acquisition of DirecTV in 2015. It will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world after its proposed acquisition of Time Warner clears regulatory hurdles. AT&T's flagship store in San Francisco. Source: AT&T. Analysts expect AT&T's revenue to fall 2% this year, and for its earnings to rise 2%. However, those estimates don't include the Time Warner deal, which could become accretive to AT&T's earnings and free cash flow within the first year, and generate $1 billion in annual run rate cost synergies within the first three years. In addition to offering higher yields and more exciting long-term growth prospects than IBM, Qualcomm and AT&T are also fundamentally cheap. Qualcomm trades at 19 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 25 for semiconductor companies. AT&T trades at 19 times earnings, versus the industry average of 22 for telecom companies. So before you buy IBM for its dividend, take a closer look at Qualcomm and AT&T to see if they better suit your income investing needs. I personally own both stocks as long-term income plays, and I'm not losing any sleep over either one. ","
      
    2 Stocks With Better Dividends than IBM -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. That's an old saying, but it's one that most people keep in mind when they evaluate the latest offer from a cable company, internet service provider (ISP), or a wireless carrier. Even a company like T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS), which built its rep on giving customers what they want, got greeted with skepticism earlier this year when it announced plans to drop all taxes and fees. In that case, the deal turned out to be exactly what was promised. That's not really true, however, when you look at Sprint's (NYSE:S) offer to cut your phone bill in half made to Verizon and AT&T customers. That promotion, while a good deal, only applied to the service portion of the bill, meaning people who accept the offer won't actually see their wireless bill cut in half. The same logic applies to many cable and ISP promotions where a short-term low price deal comes with a contract for future years that are more expensive. Pay television companies are notorious for offering prices that don't reflect the mandatory fees and surcharges customers have to pay. Because of that, news that Virgin Mobile (which is operated in the United States by Sprint) would be offering a year of unlimited talk, text, and data to customers who sign up by July 31 for $1 certainly caused consumers to raise an eyebrow. It seems like a phenomenal deal, but is it too good to be true? The Virgin Mobile deal requires buying an iPhone. Image source: Apple. The company is giving away a year of unlimited service (with high-speed data capped at 23GB a month) for $1, plus applicable taxes. That deal is not made up, it's not a bait-and-switch offer, but it's also not the whole story. To get a year of unlimited talk, text, and data for $1, the customer must purchase an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone and transfer his or her number to Virgin's Inner Circle plan, which costs $50 a month once the promotion ends. Virgin sells all currently offered iPhone models, including offering the entry-level iPhone SE for $279.99 for the 32GB version, which Apple sells for $399. The only thing approaching a catch here is one that's easy to avoid. To get the deal you need to buy an iPhone. If you buy one from Virgin, it will be locked, which locks you into its service after the promotion expires. To get around that, all you have to do is buy the phone directly from Apple. In that case, it will be unlocked, and you will be free to move to another provider at the end of the $1 promotion (or at any time, because Virgin does not lock people in with contracts). Aside from that, the only catch is that you have to pay taxes, which vary by market, but Virgin has not hidden that fact. This is actually a good deal that sets a new bar in the wireless industry. It's a bold move by Sprint, which is banking on the idea that after a year customers won't leave. That may not be true, but that's something shareholders, not consumers, should worry about.

    Top-Performing Tech Stocks of 2017 -- The Motley Fool

  "
Selena Maranjian,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Here's the bad news: The average monthly Social Security retirement benefit was recently $1,365 per month, or about $16,000 per year, with the maximum benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age recently at $2,687 per month -- or about $32,000 annually. Clearly, Social Security isn't going to give any of us a luxurious retirement. There's good news, though: There are many ways you can generate retirement income. It's smart to spend a little time figuring out how much money you'll need in retirement, and then planning how you can produce your needed cash flow. Here are a dozen strategies to consider. Image source: Getty Images. This one won't win a popularity contest, but it can be very effective. If you can work two or three more years than you originally planned to, your nest egg can grow while you put off starting to tap it. You might enjoy your employer-sponsored health insurance for a few more years, too, perhaps also while collecting a few more years' worth of matching funds in your 401(k). Here's what a difference this can make in your investing: Imagine that you sock away $10,000 per year for 20 years and it grows by an annual average of 8%, growing to about $494,000. If you can keep going for another three years, still averaging 8%, you'll end up with more than $657,000! That's more than $160,000 extra just for delaying retiring for a few years. Next, consider easing into full retirement instead of jumping in feet first. If you're willing and able to work a little in your first few years of retirement, you can generate some helpful income. Working just 12 hours per week at $10 per hour will generate about $500 per month. Better still, a part-time job can also give your days more structure and regular opportunities for socializing. Many retirees find themselves restless and a bit lonely in retirement, and a low-stress job on the side can be quite helpful. Here are some ideas of ways you might work in retirement: You could be a cashier at a local retailer or deliver newspapers. You might do some freelance writing or editing or graphic design work. You might tutor kids in subjects you know well, or perhaps give adults or kids music or language lessons. You might do some consulting -- perhaps even for your former employer. You could babysit, walk dogs, or take on some handy-person jobs. These days the Internet offers even more options. You might make jewelry, soaps, or sweaters, and sell them online. You might even just work part-time for your current employer. Image source: Getty Images. Think twice before entering retirement with a lot of credit card debt or other high-interest debt. When you're living on a reduced income, it will be extra hard to pay that off, and those payments can hurt your ability to make other necessary payments. It's a good idea to enter retirement mortgage-free, too, if you can, so that you don't have to make any mortgage payments and will only have to deal with insurance, taxes, and maintenance. This great retirement income strategy is only great at certain times -- when interest rates are meaningful. Right now if you park $100,000 in certificates of deposit paying 1.5% in interest, you'll collect $1,500 per year, hardly a helpful sum. Back in 1984, though, rates for five-year, one-year, and six-month CDs were in the double digits. If you could get 10% on a $100,000 investment, you'd enjoy $10,000 per year, equivalent to about $830 per month. Low interest rates not only deliver little income, but they also don't keep up with inflation. Bonds are another interest-paying option, but the safest ones (from the U.S. government) tend to pay modest interest rates, especially in low-interest-rate environments. Still, if you have a lot of money, you might make this strategy work by buying a variety of bonds that will mature at different times, generating income over many years. The more you contribute to tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, the more money you'll have in retirement. There are two main kinds of IRA -- the Roth IRA and the traditional IRA -- and for both in 2017, the contribution limit is $5,500 for most people and $6,500 for those 50 and older. (Limits are occasionally increased, to keep up with inflation.) That might not seem like a lot of money, but it's quite powerful if it can grow for many years. The following table shows how much money you can accumulate with annual $5,500 contributions at different average annual rates of growth: $5,500 Invested Annually For: Growing at 6% Growing at 8% Growing at 10% 15 years $135,699 $161,284 $199,224 20 years $214460 $271,826 $346,514 25 years $319,860 $434,249 $595,000 30 years $460,909 $672,902 $995,189 Data source: Calculations by author. A 401(k) has much more generous contribution limits -- for 2017 it's $18,000 for most people and $24,000 for those 50 or older. Give particular consideration to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s, which are increasingly available, as they let you withdraw money in retirement tax-free! While some annuities, such as variable annuities and indexed annuities, can be quite problematic, often charging steep fees and sporting restrictive terms, fixed annuities are well worth considering. They're much simpler instruments, and they can start paying you immediately or on a deferred basis. Following are examples of the kind of income that various people might be able to secure in the form of an immediate fixed annuity in the current economic environment. (You'll generally be offered higher payments in times of higher prevailing interest rates.) Person/People Cost Monthly Income Annual Income Equivalent 65-year-old man $100,000 $545 $6,540 70-year-old man $100,000 $623 $7,476 70-year-old woman $100,000 $586 $7,032 65-year-old couple $200,000 $937 $11,244 70-year-old couple $200,000 $1,029 $12,348 75-year-old couple $200,000 $1,178 $14,136 Data source: immediateannuities.com. Annuities can provide much peace of mind, removing stock market moves and the economy's current condition from your worries. A deferred annuity can also be smart, starting to pay you at a future point, such as when you turn a certain age. A 60-year-old man, for example, might spend $100,000 for an annuity that will start paying him $962 per month for the rest of his life beginning at age 70. That can remove any worries about running out of money late in life. You can generate income in retirement by selling off shares of stock from your stock portfolio over time -- but with dividend-paying stocks, you can collect income without having to sell any shares! A $300,000 portfolio, for example, that sports an overall average yield of 4% will generate about $12,000 per year -- a solid $1,000 per month. Dividend income isn't guaranteed, but if you spread your money across a bunch of healthy and growing companies, you'll probably receive regular -- and growing -- payments. Here are a few well-regarded stocks with significant dividend yields: Stock Recent Dividend Yield Ford Motor Company 5.4% Verizon Communications 5% Chevron 4.1% Pfizer 3.8% Cisco Systems 3.6% Data source: Yahoo! Financial. A dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) can be a fine option, too, offering instant diversification. The iShares Select Dividend ETF, for example, recently yielded about 3%. Preferred stock is another way to go. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF recently yielded 5.6%. Image source: Getty Images. Next, you might consider a reverse mortgage. It's essentially a loan secured by your home. A lender will provide (often tax-free) income during your retirement, and the loan doesn't have to be paid back until you no longer live in your home -- perhaps because you moved into a nursing home or died. It has some drawbacks, though, such as requiring your heirs to sell your home unless they can afford to pay off the loan, but if you're really pinched for funds and no one is counting on inheriting your home, it can be a solid solution. Another home-related retirement-income option is relocating. If you downsize and move to a smaller home -- or you move to a region with lower taxes or a lower cost of living -- you can end up spending less on taxes, insurance, home maintenance, utilities, landscaping, and so on. The median home value in California, for example, was recently about $386,000, but it was only $248,000 in Colorado and only $140,000 in South Carolina. Borrowing against your life insurance is another option. If you have a life insurance policy that no one is depending on -- such as if the children you meant to protect with it are now grown and independent -- you might consider borrowing against it. This can work if you've bought ""permanent"" insurance such as whole life or universal life, and not term life insurance, that generally only lasts as long as you're paying for it. You'll be reducing or wiping out the value of the policy with your withdrawal(s), but if no one really needs the ultimate payout, it can make sense. Plus, the income is typically tax-free. Image source: Getty Images. A little creative thinking can pay off well when it comes to retirement income, too. You may be able to come up with some ways to spend less and/or bring in more money. For example, you could spend less by quitting cable TV and just streaming your video entertainment -- that might save $50 you per month or $600 per year. If you're not using the gym much but are paying $40 monthly for it, that's another $500 or so in potential annual savings. Believe it or not, you might save hundreds of dollars just by spending an hour on the phone calling insurance companies to get the best current deal on your home insurance and car insurance. Eating out less and having friends over to play games or watch movies can save on dining and entertainment expenses. If you smoke, you can probably save thousands of dollars per year by quitting -- and you might lengthen your life, too! To bring more moola in, you might rent out a room now and then via Airbnb, or even take in a boarder for a year or two. If you're not already using cash-back or rewards credit cards, look into them. If you charge about $1,200 per month on credit cards and earn 2% back, on average, you're looking at close to $300 in cash back per year. Clear out your basement, attic, and/or garage by selling things online or via a yard sale and you might net hundreds of dollars. Or take an easier route and donate clothes and household items to charity, reaping tax deductions. You could make things to sell online, too, such as soaps, furniture, or jewelry. Reducing your household's automotive fleet by one vehicle can save a lot in insurance and upkeep, too. Finally, learn more about Social Security strategies. Just as there are many ways to boost your retirement income, there are a bunch of ways to boost your Social Security income, as well. You can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you can make some smart moves by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. If you and your spouse have very different earnings records, for example, you might start collecting the benefits of the spouse with the lower lifetime earnings record on time or early, while delaying starting to collect the benefits of the higher-earning spouse. That way, you both get to enjoy some income earlier, and when the higher earner hits 70, you can collect their extra-large checks. Also, should that higher-earning spouse die first, the spouse with the smaller earnings history can collect those bigger benefit checks. ","
      
    12 Ways You Can Get More Money in Retirement  -- The Motley Fool

Billy Duberstein,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","

24/7 Wall St.,06292017,MarketWatch,06222017,"Published: June 27, 2017 7:15 a.m. ET By Investors love dividends. Whether the market is up or down, many investors need those dividends to help pay income in retirement. Dividends also account for up to half of all shareholder returns through time. While high dividends are desirable for investors, savvy investors know that not all dividends are created equal. 24/7 Wall St. has conducted a review of the top dividends from America’s largest companies. Almost all the companies should be recognizable to most Americans. It turns out that there were 25 large companies paying a yield of 3.5% or more — and some much higher. The reason that the 3.5% dividend yield matters so much to equity investors is that this is 1% higher than the average yields of the S&amp;P and Dow. This was also more than 100 basis points higher than the average yield of the 10-year to 30-year Treasury. The volatile dividends for real estate investment trusts (REITs) were excluded, while the safer dividends from utilities and other sectors were included. Much of the retail segment’s high dividend yields may have a similar set of caveats, and they may feel driven by lower and lower share prices. As of the last week of June 2017, the average S&amp;P 500 Index yield was 2.37% and the average yield of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks was 2.43%. The huge difference between the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 is that all Dow stocks currently pay dividends — while there were close to 80 non–dividend payers in the S&amp;P 500, and the index includes the higher-yielding REITs. The yield of the 10-year Treasury note was last seen at just 2.13% and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was just 2.70%. The difference between the Treasury yields and equity yields is that the former are locked. Many of these major dividend paying companies should grow their revenue and earnings in the years ahead, and investors assume dividend and earnings growth in future years also will translate to higher share prices. 24/7 Wall St. used data from Thomson Reuters on financials and on target prices, and some extra color and commentary on what has driven these high yields also has been provided. The consensus analyst share price targets from Thomson Reuters have been used to show whether Wall Street thinks each company’s stock has room to appreciate or if they think there is already a fair value. Here are 25 great American companies paying dividends that 3.5% yield or greater. Macy's &gt; Yield: 6.78% &gt; Price: $22.46 &gt; Mean price target: $25.79 &gt; 52-week range: $21.51 to $45.41 &gt; Market cap: $6.8 billion Macy’s Inc. (NYSE: M) has the highest dividend yield of major retailers at this time. Its stock also has been brutalized by the growth of Amazon, and Macy’s has been unable to turn its own omni-channel up enough to offset in-store sale erosion. Its yield was already high a year ago, but the big dividend yield growth for new investors has been due to the pain of a falling stock price for existing shareholders. Macy’s is also pursuing more store closures to focus on the most profitable locations. At the start of 2017, Macy’s had almost 150,000 employees and operated about 830 stores under the Macys, Bloomingdales, Bloomingdales The Outlet, Macys Backstage and Bluemercury banners. Kohl's &gt; Yield: 5.94% &gt; Price: $37.38 &gt; Mean price target: $40.52 &gt; 52-week range: $35.16 to $59.67 &gt; Market cap: $6.4 billion Kohl’s Corp. (NYSE: KSS) has faced many of the same issues as Macy’s, including the rise of Amazon and e-commerce. As of January 28, 2017, Kohl’s operated 1,154 department stores, 12 FILA outlets and another three Off-Aisle clearance centers. Seagate Technology &gt; Yield: 5.91% &gt; Price: $42.39 &gt; Mean price target: $46.23 &gt; 52-week range: $20.77 to $50.96 &gt; Market cap: $12.6 billion Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ: STX) is best known for its storage devices, and it is currently one of the dividend kings of the technology sector. It operates globally and dominates in storage devices, with a focus on hard drives, solid state drives and portable drives. Ford &gt; Yield: 5.43% &gt; Price: $11.10 &gt; Mean price target: $12.80 &gt; 52-week range: $10.67 to $14.04 &gt; Market cap: $44.2 billion Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) has a better dividend than a stock performance of late. It has struggled to find direction in the post-Mulally years and is soon to have a new chief executive. At the same time, Ford has been experiencing a peak-auto trend in the United States as it seems hard to imagine the 2016 sales cycle being as robust in the year and years ahead. Staples &gt; Yield: 5.17% &gt; Price: $9.19 &gt; Mean price target: $9.80 &gt; 52-week range: $7.24 to $10.25 &gt; Market cap: $6.0 billion Staples Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLS) is the king of all independent retailers of office supplies. That being said, it is under a relatively new leadership now that its acquisition of rival Office Depot failed to get approved. Staples has been a rumored buyout candidate of its own, but it also faces the Amazon and small e-commerce impact that has been a challenge to much of the retail landscape. AT&amp;T &gt; Yield: 5.16% &gt; Price: $38.13 &gt; Mean price target: $39.68 &gt; 52-week range: $36.10 to $43.89 &gt; Market cap: $234.4 billion AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE: T) is still the king of major telecom dividends, but its lead over Verizon has come in. AT&amp;T has already diversified with its acquisition of DirecTV, and it is further trying to diversify with the pending acquisition of Time Warner to further spread into cable, telecom and content. AT&amp;T’s revenue was almost $164 billion in 2016. Verizon &gt; Yield: 5.09% &gt; Price: $45.81 &gt; Mean price target: $50.05 &gt; 52-week range: $44.46 to $56.95 &gt; Market cap: $186.9 billion Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) has the highest yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company has so far been less of an acquirer than rival AT&amp;T, but it has now acquired AOL and Yahoo and plans to grow its video and ad platforms. Its revenue was $126 billion in 2016. Occidental Petroleum &gt; Yield: 5.06% &gt; Price: $60.24 &gt; Mean price target: $71.44 &gt; 52-week range: $57.20 to $78.48 &gt; Market cap: $46.1 billion Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) is not the largest of the oil companies in raw market value, but it is the largest oil and gas dividend of the integrated players. Some of that dividend boost is because its shares are way down from the highs, and a weak oil market might be a continued risk to Occidental and all oil and gas players. Occidental’s 2016 revenue of $10 billion was almost half of the revenues just two years earlier. FirstEnergy &gt; Yield: 4.98% &gt; Price: $30.04 &gt; Mean price target: $33.53 &gt; 52-week range: $27.93 to $36.60 &gt; Market cap: $13.3 billion FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) is an electricity utility and generator via coal-fired, nuclear, hydroelectric, oil and natural gas, wind and solar power generating facilities. The company serves approximately 6 million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Target &gt; Yield: 4.89% &gt; Price: $51.45 &gt; Mean price target: $58.12 &gt; 52-week range: $48.56 to $79.33 &gt; Market cap: $28.4 billion Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) is in the middle of a tight retail market, wedged somewhere between the cross-hairs of Walmart and Amazon. The drop in Target’s shares has been far worse than rival Walmart, and that has helped to drive up the dividend. Despite having revenue of $69.5 billion in 2016, that is down from almost $74 billion the prior year. Southern Company &gt; Yield: 4.65% &gt; Price: $50.17 &gt; Mean price target: $51.16 &gt; 52-week range: $46.20 to $54.64 &gt; Market cap: $49.9 billion Southern Co. (NYSE: SO) is another electric utility and has power generation assets, sells wholesale electricity and distributes natural gas. Southern is based in Atlanta and claims roughly 9 million customers spread over electric and natural gas. Its 11 regulated utility markets are in Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and several more states. General Motors &gt; Yield: 4.44% &gt; Price: $34.29 &gt; Mean price target: $39.50 &gt; 52-week range: $27.34 to $38.55 &gt; Market cap: $51.8 billion General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) might be its own company again since its notorious bankruptcy and re-emergence as a public company. The stock also has been pretty much a nothing-burger since that IPO, and just like rival Ford, GM faces tough comparisons for a peak U.S. auto trend. Still, GM has been unwinding some money-losing and less profitable efforts in Europe. Entergy &gt; Yield: 4.41% &gt; Price: $79.60 &gt; Mean price target: $78.69 &gt; 52-week range: $66.71 to $82.09 &gt; Market cap: $14.3 billion Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) is an electric utility based in New Orleans. It serves portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans. It distributes natural gas and delivers electricity to 2.9 million utility customers. Overall Entergy is one of the big players among utilities in the deep south. Although it operates through several different subsidiaries, it has over 14,000 employees. The stock has made steady gains over the past few years, and it is actually closing in on an all-time high — with a dividend like this, that says something. Valero Energy &gt; Yield: 4.24% &gt; Price: $66.28 &gt; Mean price target: $73.89 &gt; 52-week range: $46.88 to $71.40 &gt; Market cap: $29.6 billion Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO) is a top petroleum refiner and ethanol producer in the country, and its stock can be volatile around the swings in oil pricing and also around how the refining sector’s margins grow and contract. Its revenue of more than $75 billion in 2016 is down handily from prior years, but much of that is price-driven by commodity prices rather than its raw profitability. Unlike traditional oil companies, refining companies do not thrive as well under high oil prices as the margins are tougher. As of December 31, 2016, the company owned 15 petroleum refineries with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.1 million barrels per day, and it owned and operated 11 ethanol plants with a combined capacity of approximately 1.4 billion gallons per year. Gap &gt; Yield: 4.19% &gt; Price: $22.27 &gt; Mean price target: $25.53 &gt; 52-week range: $19.33 to $30.74 &gt; Market cap: $8.8 billion Gap Inc. (GPS) has become a post-growth retailer after prior decades of expansion, and it is facing many of the same Amazon-related and e-commerce pressure of other retailers. The company has consolidated many stores under the namesake Gap brand, and it has Old Navy and Banana Republic brands. Gap also owns Athleta and Intermix. As of March 14, 2017, the company operated 3,200 company-operated stores and 450 franchise stores. Gap’s revenue of $15.5 billion in 2016 was the third straight year of decline and its pretax net income of $1.12 billion in 2016 was down from over $2 billion in 2014 and 2013. Williams Companies &gt; Yield: 4.17% &gt; Price: $28.81 &gt; Mean price target: $33.37 &gt; 52-week range: $19.60 to $32.69 &gt; Market cap: $23.8 billion Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE: WMB) is an energy infrastructure company that operates oil and gas pipelines. Its primary natural gas pipeline system extends from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the offshore Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the New York City metropolitan area. Other pipelines cover parts of the central and western states. The Tulsa-based company dates back to 1908. Chevron &gt; Yield: 4.11% &gt; Price: $104.42 &gt; Mean price target: $122.48 &gt; 52-week range: $97.53 to $119.00 &gt; Market cap: $197.8 billion Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) may not be the size in market cap of rival Exxon Mobil, but it outyields its larger rival. Chevron has seen its ups and downs with the price of oil, but it has pledged to not disrupt its dividend unless it simply faces no other serious alternatives. Revenues of $110 billion in 2016 were down from $200 billion just two years earlier. PPL &gt; Yield: 4.07% &gt; Price: $39.34 &gt; Mean price target: $38.96 &gt; 52-week range: $32.08 to $40.20 &gt; Market cap: $26.9 billion PPL Corp. (NYSE: PPL) is an electric utility based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and its three operating units are U.K. Regulated, Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated. The company dates back to 1920, and it claims to have more than 10 million utility customers in the United States and United Kingdom. Qualcomm &gt; Yield: 4.01% &gt; Price: $56.51 &gt; Mean price target: $61.55 &gt; 52-week range: $50.84 to $71.62 &gt; Market cap: $83.5 billion Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) has been the king of processors in the mobile phone and tablet arena. Its growth recently ran into some headwinds as customers such as Apple have chosen to in-house or go to cheaper rivals, and the company also has had royalty disputes. Now Qualcomm is hoping to bolster its growth and diversify its revenues away from just expensive microprocessors with the acquisition of a much more diversified NXP Semiconductors in a deal valued at close to $40 billion. Duke Energy &gt; Yield: 3.98% &gt; Price: $86.80 &gt; Mean price target: $84.75 &gt; 52-week range: $72.34 to $87.75 &gt; Market cap: $60.8 billion Duke Energy Corp. (NYSE: DUK) is easily one of the largest utility providers with a portfolio that covers the east coast through the Midwest. This company is more or less the gold standard when it comes to utility stocks, and many of the stocks within the industry take their bearings from it. Although utilities are known for trading on their dividends, Duke has made a noteworthy run so far this year. IBM &gt; Yield: 3.89% &gt; Price: $155.16 &gt; Mean price target: $165.07 &gt; 52-week range: $142.50 to $182.79 &gt; Market cap: $145.8 billion International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) has been a large buyback and dividend payer for years, but the company had to abandon part of its artificial earnings per share growth efforts. IBM has been growing in its emerging opportunities in cloud, Watson and other efforts, but its legacy IT-consulting operations have been bleeding off faster than IBM can grow its emerging tech businesses. The company still has around 380,000 employees. A slew of earnings disappointments has been a thorn in its side, and IBM may need new leadership quite soon if it cannot get that turnaround underway. Its revenue was almost $80 billion in 2016 and was down each year consecutively since at least 2012. Exxon Mobil &gt; Yield: 3.77% &gt; Price: $81.33 &gt; Mean price target: $87.13 &gt; 52-week range: $79.26 to $95.55 &gt; Market cap: $344.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) shares have suffered with the fate of oil prices, and its massive $31 billion acquisition of XTO Energy for natural gas was done at a time that the economics of today’s energy prices haven’t been so great. Exxon’s 2016 revenues of over $218 billion were down from $394 billion in 2014 and were half of the $451 billion in 2012. At least Exxon gets to claim that its former CEO became Secretary of State. Pfizer &gt; Yield: 3.75% &gt; Price: $34.07 &gt; Mean price target: $37.35 &gt; 52-week range: $29.83 to $37.93 &gt; Market cap: $203.3 billion Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) has struggled to find growth for years. Its drugs have faced the same patent cliff of much of Big Pharma rivals. Still, its dividend is deemed safe by investors, and 2016 revenues of $52.8 billion bumped up from the average of the prior three years. Cisco Systems &gt; Yield: 3.61% &gt; Price: $32.31 &gt; Mean price target: $35.43 &gt; 52-week range: $27.13 to $34.60 &gt; Market cap: $161.5 billion Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) has been one of the top technology companies in networking. It has made hundreds of small bolt-on acquisitions around future technology, and Cisco hopes that security integration can help bolster its sales ahead. Long-time CEO John Chambers has turned the helm over to Chuck Robbins, and Cisco has been in the midst of two large restructurings in the past five years in an effort to ""right-size"" its headcount and unit structure. Cisco’s revenue was $37 billion in 2016, and it has been stable but choppy over the past five years, but without any real growth. Cisco shares also remain well down from the tech bubble days back in 1999 to 2000. Exelon &gt; Yield: 3.59% &gt; Price: $37.34 &gt; Mean price target: $39.47 &gt; 52-week range: $29.82 to $37.70 &gt; Market cap: $34.6 billion Exelon Corp. (NYSE: EXC) is a Chicago-based utility targeting electric and natural gas customers. Its operations in electricity are in parts of Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland.

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"In support of the “Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality,” more than 80,000 websites - from big social media platforms like Facebook to streaming services like Netflix and matchmaking website OkCupid - are displaying banners, alerts, ads and short videos to urge the public to oppose the overturn of the landmark 2015 net neutrality rules. Net neutrality is a broad principle that prohibits broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others. The rule was implemented by the Obama administration in 2015. Changes to the rule are being proposed by the head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commision (FCC), Ajit Pai, appointed by President Donald Trump in January. Pai wants the commission to repeal the rules that reclassified internet service providers as if they were utilities, saying the open internet rules adopted under former President Barack Obama harm jobs and investment. The FCC voted 2-1 in May to advance a Republican plan to reverse the “net neutrality” order. During a speech in April, Pai asked: “Do we want the government to control the internet? Or do we want to embrace the light-touch approach” in place since 1996 until it was revised in 2015. At a Capitol Hill press conference, Democrats and internet companies vowed to fight the changes and suggested internet companies could slow internet speeds. Senator Edward Markey said the internet “is under attack.” “We will not let this takeover happen,” Markey said. “A free and open internet is our right and we will fight to defend it.” FCC spokesman Brian Hart declined to comment. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat on a commission with two current vacancies, said in a statement on Wednesday she supports “those who believe that a free and open internet is a foundational principle of our democracy.” The public will have until mid-August to send comments to the FCC before the final vote. More than 550,000 comments have been filed in the last day with the FCC and more than 6.3 million filed to date and thousands of people called Capitol Hill offices to express concerns. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on the social media platform, “Right now, the FCC has rules in place to make sure the internet continues to be an open platform for everyone. At Facebook, we strongly support those rules.” Twitter expressed support for the existing rules, encouraging users to protest while promoting the hashtag #NetNeutrality. “Net Neutrality is foundational to competitive, free enterprise, entrepreneurial market entry – and reaching global customers. You don’t have to be a big shot to compete. Anyone with a great idea, a unique perspective to share, and a compelling vision can get in the game,” Twitter said in a blog. Online forum Reddit displayed a pop-up message that slowly loads the text, “The internet’s less fun when your favorite sites load slowly, isn’t it?” A pop-up banner on The American Civil Liberties Union’s website read: “Trump’s FCC wants to kill net neutrality. This would let the cable and phone companies slow down any site they don’t like or that won’t pay extra.” ","

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp said on Friday that it was launching new leasing options aimed at price-sensitive customers who want to upgrade their phones more often, the carrier’s latest effort to lure subscribers in an oversaturated market for wireless service. The No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier will now allow customers to lease any phone and have the option to upgrade it after a year. Previously, the option was only available for Apple Inc iPhones and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s Galaxy devices. At 18 months, customers can either return their old phones and upgrade to new ones or purchase their devices. Those who want to buy their phones can pay the remaining amount in a lump sum or in six monthly increments. “We want to give full flexibility to our customers because you don’t want to get stuck with an old phone,” Robert Hackl, Sprint’s senior vice president of leasing, said in an interview. The changes come at a time when the U.S. wireless market is becoming increasingly competitive, and carriers are battling each other to lure customers through new deals. Verizon Communications Inc in February reintroduced unlimited data plans for the first time in more than five years. Earlier this year, Sprint began offering five lines of unlimited data for $90, cheaper than competitors’ plans. In June, it launched a promotion for free unlimited data, talk and text for a year for customers who bring their own devices. Sprint is the only carrier that leases devices to customers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “It’s about lowering the cost for the consumer,” he said. “What’s in it for the carrier is people with new devices are happier. They are getting access to the new capabilities of the network.” The company, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp , is believed to be exploring a tie-up with rival T-Mobile US Inc. Sprint has also entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp on a wireless deal that would allow the cable companies to use its network. “Considering that they’re more in an M&A mindset, they need a growing company,” Entner said, of Sprint executives. “Nothing draws more customers into the door than low prices.” ","

Apoyando al “Día de la Acción por el Internet para Salvar a la Neutralidad de la Red”, más de 80.000 páginas web - desde grandes plataformas de redes sociales como Facebook hasta servicios de streaming como Netflix y webs de citas como OkCupid - están desplegando pancartas, alertas, anuncios y clips de vídeo para alentar al público a que se oponga a la derogación de las emblemáticas leyes de 2015 por la neutralidad de la red. La neutralidad de la red es un principio que prohíbe que los proveedores de banda ancha otorguen o vendan acceso a Internet rápido, esencialmente lo que vendría a ser una “vía rápida”, a algunos servicios de internen y a otros no. La ley fue implementada en 2015 por la administración del anterior presidente, el demócrata Barack Obama. Cambios a esta legislación están siendo propuestos por el director de la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones de EEUU (FCC, por sus siglas en inglés), Ajit Pai, nombrado en enero por el actual presidente, el republicano Donald Trump. Pai quiere que la comisión revoque las leyes que reclasificaron a los proveedores de Internet como si fuesen servicios públicos, alegando que las leyes del Internet abierto adoptadas por Obama dañan el empleo y la inversión. La FCC votó 2 a 1 en mayo dar inicio a un plan republicano que derogase la orden de “neutralidad de la red”. Durante un discurso en abril, Pai preguntó: “¿Queremos que el gobierno controle el Internet?¿O queremos acoger la estrategia de tacto fino (en vigor desde 1996 hasta que fue revisada en 2015)?”. En una rueda de prensa en Capitol Hill, demócratas y empresas de Internet se comprometieron a luchar contra los cambios y sugirieron que las empresas de Internet podrían ralentizar la velocidad de red. El senador Edward Markey dijo que el Internet “está siendo atacado”. “No vamos a dejar que este asalto ocurra”, dijo Markey. “Un Internet libre y abierto es nuestro derecho y lucharemos por defenderlo”. Grandes proveedores de banda ancha, incluyendo a AT&T Inc y Verizon Communications Inc, reconocieron el apoyo del público por la neutralidad de la red. Enfatizaron que estaban a favor de un “Internet abierto” pero dejaron claro que estaban contra la orden de reclasificación de la neutralidad de la red de 2015 que dijeron que, según ellos, podía llevar a la regulación gubernamental de los precios. El portavoz de la FCC Brian Hart rechazó comentar la cuestión. La comisionada de la FCC, Mignon Clyburn, la única demócrata en una comisión que cuenta con dos plazas vacantes, dijo en un comunicado el miércoles que apoya “a aquellos que creen que un Internet libre y abierto es un principio fundacional de nuestra democracia”.

(DIS) to rest during the Allen & Co. annual media and technology conference being held this week in Sun Valley, Idaho. When asked if there was truth to the rumors, which resurfaced last week, he bluntly responded ""No,"" according to Variety. The executive, who has expressed interest in deal-making in the past, made the comment as he walked past a group of reporters at the confab. The annual event, which brings together some of the leading executives in entertainment and technology, has spawned many deals in the past. (See also: Three Reasons Why Verizon Won't Buy Disney) Previewing the conference, the New York Post last week reported McAdam could be gearing up for his next acquisition after completing its purchase of the core internet assets of Yahoo, and that he may set his sights on Disney. The paper cited a “well-placed banker” as saying Verizon can’t be counted out as a suitor for the Burbank, Calif.-based media giant. That report prompted Wall Street analysts to come out against a deal, arguing it would be too costly for Verizon and didn’t make a whole lot of sense. “[W]hen we saw this latest ‘news’ of Verizon looking to buy Disney, we laughed. Out loud. In fact, we’re still laughing. What would a wireless juggernaut want with a theme park, a YUGE consumer products line and the various movie studios,” wrote Wells Fargo media analyst Marci Ryvicker in a research report at the time. Acquiring Disney would take a lot more than the $4.5 billion Verizon spent for Yahoo assets given the entertainment company has a market value of $168 billion. Verizon would have to offer up a big premium to see a deal come to fruition with some estimates hitting $190 billion. Even if McAdam was looking to strike up some type of alliance with Disney, he would be hard pressed to do so, at least at the Allen & Co. confab. Chief Executive  Bob Iger isn’t attending this year’s event in Sun Valley.  (See also: Yahoo and AOL Will Form 'Oath') While the CEO was quick to dismiss a deal with Disney, that doesn’t mean the company isn’t looking for mergers and acquisitions after closing on its purchase of Yahoo’s core internet assets. Back in April, McAdam told Bloomberg the company is open to the possibility of merging with either Comcast (CMCSA), Disney, or CBS (CBS)  if it helps the mobile network carrier to get a better grip on the rapidly evolving telecom industry and beat its big spending rival AT&T (T).

He and his clients own shares of VZ.) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) may be weighing a purchase of Walt Disney Co. (DIS) to bolster its content ownership, several news stories recently speculated. But perhaps Verizon should consider looking in another direction and grab both CBS Corp. (CBS) and Viacom Inc. (VIAB) at a fraction of what Disney would cost, without taking on the theme parks and the troubles of ESPN. Disney has an enterprise value of about $180 billion, which means a deal to acquire Disney would likely cost $200 billion or more to get investors on board to approve a deal. CBS and Viacom together would have an enterprise value of nearly $60 billion, putting a purchase of both these companies at nearly one-third the price of Disney. (See also: Three Reasons Why Verizon Won't Buy Disney.) It was just last fall when talks were swirling about bringing Viacom and CBS back together, and now Verizon could be in a position to make that happen. There is something else Viacom and CBS have in common: National Amusements Inc., which owns nearly 80 percent of both Viacom and CBS. National Amusements Inc. is controlled by media mogul Sumner Redstone, which could make brokering such a deal easier – at least because of the limited number of interested parties. In December 2016, Sumner and his daughter, Shari Redstone, killed the possibility of a merger between CBS and Viacom. Verizon's stock has performed poorly in 2017, down almost 20 percent. Over the past three years, the stock is down nearly 12.5 percent. Earnings growth is expected to be anemic as well, putting further pressure on Verizon to make a move to keep pace with competitors AT&T Inc. (T) and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), which acquired Time Warner Inc. (TWX) and NBC Universal, respectively, to grab content. VZ data by YCharts Comcast, the cable and communications giant, is expected to grow its EPS by nearly 53 percent over the next three years, while analysts are looking for Verizon to grow its EPS by only 1 percent. VZ Annual EPS Estimates data by YCharts Meanwhile, CBS is expected to grow EPS by nearly 45 percent, and Viacom is expected to increase by almost 20 percent. VIAB Annual EPS Estimates data by YCharts Together, both CBS and Viacom could bring a combined $27 billion in projected revenue to Verizon, and perhaps spur some growth and provide synergies to Verizon. After all, a deal would bring Verizon Showtime, the movie studio Paramount Pictures, TV stations, a line-up of shows, CBS Sports and the NFL. The NFL on CBS would perhaps be tied into Verizon mobile's NFL offering. VIAB Annual Revenue Estimates data by YCharts According to Comcast's most recent 10-K filing, the NBC Universal segment grew revenue by 11 percent, to $31.6 billion, while the cable communications segment grew revenue by 6.6 percent, to $50 billion. Since March 2013, when Comcast completed its acquisition of NBC, shares have risen by nearly 93 percent. Verizon has taken on a considerable amount of debt in recent years, most notably in 2014, when it bought Vodafone's 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless for $130 billion. Verizon's current long-term debt stands at nearly $120 billion. Verizon needs a shot in the arm, and perhaps bringing CBS and Viacom together under the Verizon umbrella could be key to that.

Leo Sun,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) investors probably know that the telecom giant evolved from the AT&T's (NYSE:T) forced divestment of the Bell Operating Companies in the 1980s. Bell Atlantic, one of the seven ""Baby Bells"", merged with a few other Bells to become ""Verizon"" -- a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for ""truth"") and horizon -- in 2000. Verizon subsequently became the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. Over the past two years, it dramatically reduced its wireline presence, shuttered its public cloud business, and aggressively expanded into the online media space by gobbling up AOL and Yahoo's internet businesses. Source: Getty. Today, let's examine five lesser-known facts about Verizon which might change your overall perception of the evolving telecom company. Newer investors might think that Verizon always owned Verizon Wireless. However, that business was actually founded as a joint venture between Verizon and British telco Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) in 1999. In 2014, Verizon paid a whopping $130 billion to acquire Vodafone's 45% stake. However, that buyout increased Verizon's debt, reduced its free cash flow, and doubled its exposure to the saturated wireless market. Last quarter, Verizon posted its first-ever decline in wireless subscribers -- making the intelligence of that deal seem questionable. To offset that softness, Verizon is investing in the Internet of Things (IoT) market. Verizon's IoT business generated nearly $1 billion in revenue last year, a drop in the pond relative to its total revenue of $126 billion, but still an indication that it's reaching drones, connected cars, wearables, and other IoT gadgets. In the drone market, Verizon developed new long-range autonomous drone applications with Sierra Wireless and American Aerospace Technologies, a drone monitoring partnership with NASA, and launched its new ThingSpace IoT platform for connected devices. It also acquired Skyward, a drone management start-up, earlier this year. That start-up makes a suite of tools for tracking drones, handling pilot records, and organizing administrative paperwork. That's also why Verizon acquired Telogis -- a developer of cloud-based telematics, compliance, and navigation systems used by major automakers and telcos -- last year. That purchase helps Verizon connect to vehicle fleets and gather data from their routes. It also enhances its own Verizon Telematics business, which is used in over 40 countries. Verizon also previously launched Hum, a two-piece hardware system which connects any old car manufactured since 1996 to Verizon's network. Hum also adds diagnostics and telematics functions to the tethered mobile app, which essentially turns any car into a ""connected"" one. Those moves lay down the foundations for fully autonomous drones and cars to travel across Verizon's wireless networks in the near future -- which could cause widespread paradigm shifts across multiple industries. AT&T and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have repeatedly opposed ""One Touch Make Ready"" rules, which allow ISPs to attach their own wires on utility poles themselves without waiting for other providers to move their own. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, which is expanding its Fiber network nationwide, claims that AT&T and Comcast aren't violating the rules by refusing to move their wires to make room for Google Fiber's. Verizon also supports the enforcement of those rules, because it plans to roll out a lot of new fiber to support its wireless network in the near future. In a blog post and FCC filing, Verizon complains that it takes ""six months to a year"" and ""piles of paperwork"" to get a new attachment approved and placed on a pole. If the FCC sides with Verizon over AT&T and Comcast, Google Fiber might experience an unexpected growth spurt. In a previous article, I discussed how Starbucks' (NASDAQ: SBUX) liberal statements often antagonized conservative customers -- yet had no long-term impact on its revenue growth. On the other side of that coin is Verizon, with its staunchly conservative views often casting a shadow over its core businesses. Back in 2007, Verizon blocked text messages from a pro-choice group. In 2009, it sponsored a controversial climate change denier rally organized by a pro-coal group in West Virginia. Three years ago, it killed off its own fledgling tech news site, Sugarstring, reportedly because it published too many stories on net neutrality and surveillance -- both hot button topics for its parent company. Verizon's near-term future still relies heavily on the expansion of its wireless customer base and its ability to digest AOL and Yahoo's online business. However, the financial impact of the Vodafone deal can still be felt today, its expansion into new IoT markets can reduce its dependence on smartphones, and the enforcement of ""One Touch Make Ready"" rules could help it expand its wireless infrastructure to meet next-gen 5G needs.

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) just quietly increased the price of its One Plus plan by another $5 per month. T-Mobile first introduced One Plus, an add-on to its One unlimited data plan, after Verizon (NYSE:VZ) launched its unlimited plan, which includes HD video streaming and up to 10 GB of high-speed tethering. One Plus matches those capabilities and throws in unlimited in-flight Wi-Fi from Gogo. With the price increase, T-Mobile charges $80 per month for a single line -- the same as Verizon's unlimited plan. In fact, T-Mobile's pricing is a bit higher than Verizon's for family plans of three or more lines (even when you account for the inclusion of taxes and fees in T-Mobile's price). While the price increase isn't great for consumers, it's a sign that T-Mobile is starting take its foot off the pedal with its competitive pressure. Sprint (NYSE:S) has been most aggressive with its pricing, but it doesn't have the network quality to compete with T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T (NYSE:T) Image source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile has been the only major wireless carrier to be able to raise its average service revenue per subscriber in the last few years. Granted, it still sits below Verizon and AT&T, but it's also adding new subscribers, which supports strong revenue growth. T-Mobile has given itself several hurdles to climb over in order to increase its revenue per subscriber. First, it gave customers the option to lock in their pricing indefinitely as long as they stick to their current plan. That means T-Mobile has to convince subscribers to switch to its unlimited plan in order to increase revenue from existing customers. Second, it switched to only offering unlimited data plans. The One Plus plan is its only means of increasing the bill on those unlimited customers. T-Mobile's decision to increase the price on One Plus indicates it's confident the price increase won't negatively impact net additions too much. If it proves successful, it could lead to a price increase of its original unlimited plan, which would have a much bigger impact on ARPU. Investors should look for commentary on management's pricing decision during the company's upcoming earnings call. If T-Mobile begins to bump its pricing higher across the board, it's particularly good for both AT&T and Verizon investors, and should have a modestly positive impact on Sprint. For Sprint, its biggest competitive advantage is its pricing. Its service is priced well below the competitors, and T-Mobile increasing its prices just makes that advantage greater. That said, Sprint will only attract price-conscious consumers, so it may have difficulty increasing its prices in the future and keeping subscriber churn under control. Both AT&T and Verizon, meanwhile, have suffered significant declines in service revenue as a result of T-Mobile's aggressive promotions. Price increases may be a sign that it's ready to take its foot off the pedal and start focusing more on cash flow instead of customer acquisition. That means AT&T and Verizon may experience fewer switchers and customer retention expenses, and gain a bit more freedom to play around with pricing on their own. AT&T has been aggressive with its promotions, offering free HBO and a discount on its video services for subscribers to its $90-per-month Unlimited Plus plan. Verizon may offer similar incentives with the expected launch of a nationwide television streaming service later this year, but it might not have to if T-Mobile eases up on the pressure. As the carrier stealing customers away and providing innovative offers, any reduction in competitive pressure from T-Mobile should be welcome news for investors in the other three major wireless companies. The price increase for T-Mobile's One Plus plan may be just the start, and that's good for everyone. Well, everyone except for the consumers that missed out on saving $5 per month per line.

At the beginning of the year, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) said it planned to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores, expanding its retail footprint to catch up with its network expansion. After the first quarter, T-Mobile had to update its outlook to 1,500 T-Mobile stores. T-Mobile's VP of Sales Jon Freier tweeted this week the company has opened 1,000 stores already this year, surpassing its original goal. The footprint expansion represents a huge opportunity for T-Mobile. While the company has been able to continue stealing away customers from Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), expanding its footprint outside of major metro areas presents additional upside for the wireless carrier. Image source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile expects its new stores to cover 30 million to 40 million new people. What's more, the competition in the areas where T-Mobile is opening new stores is much less intense than the metro areas it currently operates, giving T-Mobile a good opportunity to take market share. T-Mobile already has strong brand recognition in these markets thanks to its national advertising campaigns, so it should be able to quickly capture market share. CFO Braxton Carter said a market share in the teens is achievable within a five-year time frame. That could mean an additional 5 million customers or so over the next five years just from the stores it's opening this year. That growth will be in addition to the customers T-Mobile is still bringing in from the two-thirds of the country it covered with its retail stores in 2016. That growth is still going strong, with T-Mobile adding 1.3 million customers in the first quarter between T-Mobile and MetroPCS. That's four straight years of adding over 1 million customers every quarter. Expanding its retail footprint also gives T-Mobile room to increase its pricing as it's now competing for a larger market. The company recently increased the price of its ONE Plus plan, putting it roughly in line with Verizon's unlimited plan. That could be just the start of price increases at T-Mobile as it starts to focus on cash flow. But T-Mobile just set a record low postpaid churn rate in its first quarter. Combined with the new greenfield markets its retail operations are expanding into, it can afford to see its net additions in existing markets wane a bit. Importantly, existing customers can keep their current pricing for as long as they keep their current plans. That should help keep churn rate low. So, not only do T-Mobile's new store openings support customer growth, they support average revenue per user growth for the carrier. With the broadest retail footprints in the country, AT&T and Verizon are going to be the biggest losers as T-Mobile enters new markets. Both companies have been bleeding subscribers to T-Mobile for years now. AT&T is relying on bundle economics to keep customers from leaving. It's offering all unlimited plan customers $25 off a DIRECTV package, and Unlimited Plus customers also get free HBO on any AT&T video service. Verizon is relying on the strength of its brand and its network, which still regularly ranks atop the four national carriers in independent studies. Verizon may also launch a nationwide video streaming service later this year that it could bundle. But consumers are cutting the cord more than ever, so it's not clear how much a bundle will help. That said, Verizon is better positioned than AT&T to hold onto its customers as T-Mobile enters new markets. Nonetheless, both companies must remain aggressive, as the competition in the industry remains fierce. ","

Retirees have a different set of financial priorities than their younger counterparts. Instead of seeking high-growth investments, these investors should focus on owning lower-risk stocks that also provide a steady stream of income. Which stocks do we think are a good choice for this age cohort? We asked that question to a team of Motley Fool investors, and they picked Ford (NYSE:F), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). Image source: Getty Images. John Rosevear (Ford): Everybody knows Ford, an iconic American brand that has undergone a renaissance over the last decade or so. But why is it a good stock for retirees now? Consider the following: To be clear, there are a couple of reasons why Ford's stock is cheap right now. First, Wall Street is concerned that the U.S. new-car market is slowing, which could squeeze Ford's profit margins for a time. Second, investors have had concerns about how well Ford is keeping up with rivals (notably General Motors) in terms of both future innovation and its products in the here and now. That's part of why Ford has a new CEO who has promised to aggressively address both. My sense is that Jim Hackett is the right leader to shift the Blue Oval back into high gear. If so, Ford's profits and stock price should both climb nicely. It may take a little while for that to happen, but Ford's fat dividend will help make it easy to stay patient. Travis Hoium (Verizon): Your golden years should be spent enjoying life, not worrying about the latest tech trends, or what part of the market is hot today. Steady companies with strong dividends are what I think investors in their golden years should value most. And Verizon is the perfect stock for those investors. Verizon is one of only four major U.S. cellular-network operators, and it's really only competing with AT&T for customers who demand a fast, reliable, and national network. That gives it pricing power and the cash flow needed to invest in next-generation networks, like the 5G networks that are rolling out today. You can see below the free cash the company was generating when it had a bigger 4G network than competitors, and now it's investing in 5G, which it hopes will lead to a competitive advantage in 2018 and beyond. VZ data by YCharts. Verizon's dividend today would be enough to make it a great investment, but I think the number of connected devices will only grow in the future. And having a leading 5G network will be a huge advantage for Verizon as that happens. This should be a company that pays a great dividend for many years to come, making it a great stock for your golden years. While investing in renewables should help shareholders feel good about this company's commitment to go green, these moves are paying off financially, too. Over the last decade, these investments have helped NextEra to grow its adjusted earnings per share more than 8.1% annually. In turn, the company has been able to raise its dividend each year by a similar rate. The markets have responded to these developments by taking shareholders on a highly profitable ride. SPY Total Return Price data by YCharts. Moving forward, NextEra believes that it will be able to continue growing its profits and dividend by 6% to 8% annually over the next few years through continued investment in new growth projects. When you combine that with the company's well-covered dividend yield of 2.8% -- NextEra's dividend payout ratio is only 44% of earnings -- NextEra stands a good shot at providing investors with high single-digit total returns. That makes this an ideal stock for income investors to put on their radars. ","
      
    3 Value Stocks for Your Golden Years -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Cord cutting started picking up steam in 2016 when 1.9 million pay-TV customers abandoned the service, according to an estimate from SNL Kagan. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The research group expects 10.8 million more customers to cut the cord over the next five years, with total subscribers falling to 82.3 million. That's bad news for pay-TV giants like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T). But it could be a major opportunity for virtual providers like DISH Network's (NASDAQ:DISH) Sling TV to take share of the pay-TV market. Kagan estimates virtual service subscribers will climb to 11 million by 2021. Image source: Getty Images. Even though some consumers ditch their traditional pay-TV plans, they still have a habit of sitting in front of the television. That leads them to spend more time watching over-the-top video services compared to cord-never households, according to data from Comscore. Virtual pay-TV providers often offer cord cutters a lower-priced option compared to traditional cable, which may attract some to simply switch service providers. Considering the switching costs for virtual providers is extremely low for customers (and often includes free trials), many cord-cutters may opt to sample various services to see if any fit their lifestyle at a price they can accept. There are currently just over 3 million virtual pay-TV subscribers in the U.S. Sling TV is the market leader with over 2 million subscribers. The number of virtual options continues to grow with Hulu and YouTube recently offering live TV services. AT&T launched DIRECTV Now last fall. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is expected to launch its own over-the-top service as well. The space is much more wide open for competitors compared to traditional television content delivery, which required significant upfront capital investments. As more and more companies enter the market, it could help accelerate the cord cutting trend at traditional providers. Some companies like DISH, AT&T, and Verizon will be cannibalizing their own services, although management likes to say it's expanding the addressable market. The problem cable stalwarts like Comcast now face is the potential erosion of their video subscriber base as more competition enters the market. Comcast currently benefits from offering a premium product compared to traditional and virtual distributors. Its X-1 platform for on-demand and streaming content has helped improve subscriber retention. Additionally, streaming services are much more prone to technical glitches and outages, making the viewing experience sub-par at times. But as more competitors enter the over-the-top market and technology improves, Comcast's advantages may disappear. If that's the case, it will see an uptick in subscribers abandoning its video service and find itself forced to do what AT&T and DISH Network did and launch its own OTT service. That could result in lower profit margins for its video business, as these services generally carry significantly lower service prices while programming expenses take up a larger share of revenue. While it beats the prospects of losing a customer entirely, Comcast will want to delay an over-the-top service as long as it can. There is a potential upside for traditional pay-TV providers, though. Many are tied to certain territories due to the limitations of the physical infrastructure required for distribution. Virtual providers can easily operate nationwide, opening up new markets to companies like Comcast and Verizon. (AT&T and DISH notably already have nationwide coverage through satellite.) Verizon's territory is relatively small compared to Comcast, so it makes sense that it's planning to launch in the near future while Comcast delays a virtual service outside of its territory. The next wave of cord cutting is just starting to build to a crest and the influx of virtual providers is helping it gather momentum. The good news is that many cord-cutters will be looking for a replacement instead of an alternative, which, as Kagan's estimates show, ought to result in most customers paying for TV one way or another.

The average dividend stock on the S&P 500 pays a little over 2%, which understandably doesn't get many income investors too excited. However, there are some stocks that pay much higher dividends that are safe and have lots of long-term growth potential. Here are three examples, all of which yield more than 5% as of this writing. Company Symbol Recent Share Price Dividend Yield Verizon VZ $44.66 5.2% Store Capital Corp. STOR $22.45 5.2% Senior Housing Properties Trust SNH $20.44 7.6% Data Source: TD Ameritrade and author's own calculations. Share prices and dividend yields as of 7/1/2017. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is an excellent choice for investors who need a steady, reliable income stream, and is actually the highest-yielding stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The 5.2% dividend yield paid by the telecom giant is backed by reliable cash flow generated by the company's subscribers. Image source: Getty Images. The company's size and financial flexibility should give it a durable competitive advantage in developing new technologies (such as its anticipated 5G network) and pursuing attractive value-adding acquisition opportunities that come up, which it has certainly shown its willingness to do in recent years. Verizon's dividend is not only generous, but it is also safe. The payout represents just 62% of 2017's expected earnings, so the company has plenty of cushion to absorb any earnings weakness, and also has plenty of cash to use for future dividend increases. Finally, with a P/E ratio of just 12 times 2017's expected earnings, Verizon looks like quite a bargain at the current share price. Net-lease REIT Store Capital (NYSE:STOR) recently announced that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, had acquired a 9.8% stake in the company. In a nutshell, ""net-lease"" real estate means that tenants sign leases that require them to pay property taxes, building insurance, and certain maintenance expenses. These leases typically have long initial terms and have annual rent increases, or escalators, built in. The benefits are a steady, predictable income stream, as well as minimal vacancy risk. In fact, 99.5% of Store Capital's properties are occupied as of the first quarter of 2017. Store Capital owns 1,750 properties, the majority of which are leased to retail businesses, with a particular emphasis on service-based businesses like movie theaters and restaurants. And the business has grown rapidly, at an average rate of 76 new properties per quarter. Thanks to the perceived weakness in the retail industry, which doesn't affect most of Store's tenants, the stock is down about 20% over the past year, even after the ""Buffett rally,"" which has created an interesting opportunity for long-term investors. Healthcare real estate could grow rapidly over the coming decades, especially senior-specific property types, as the Baby Boomer generation retires and the 65-and-older population in the U.S. roughly doubles by 2050, and older age groups are expected to grow even faster. Senior Housing Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SNH) could be a smart way to invest in this growth, and generate a fantastic income stream along the way. Image source: Senior Housing Properties Trust investor presentation. Despite the name, just over half of Senior Housing Properties Trust's portfolio of 434 properties is made up of senior housing, with medical offices making up most of the rest. The company's tenants derive 97% of their revenue from stable private-pay revenue sources, one of the highest ratios in the healthcare REIT industry. Many readers may think that Senior Housing Properties Trust's 7.6% dividend yield may sound too good to be true. However, it represents just 83% of the company's FFO, which isn't high for a REIT, so there is no reason to worry about the safety of the income stream. And as I recently wrote, the company represents a pretty compelling bargain at the current price. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Buy With Dividends Yielding More Than 5% -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. However, would an Amazon-Dish partnership really have any impact on an investment thesis for Amazon stock? After running through some of the benefits from a potential partnership I think Amazon investors should consider the potential Dish partnership an interesting proposition, but not something that should change their current Amazon investment strategy. Here's why: Image source: Pexels. Aside from the idea of launching a phone service for Prime members, most of the ideas above are simply improvements to what the company is already doing (or, in the case of drones, testing). So the primary benefit for Amazon creating a partnership with Dish would be to give it more control over current operations, and not necessarily to create new revenue streams. More control over existing services is great, but it's not exactly something that investors should get all that excited about. What's still unclear is how much this could cost Amazon. There was no estimate on how much Amazon might pony up for such a deal, but investors should keep in mind that building out wireless networks -- as Dish is doing -- is very expensive. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is expected to spend about $17 billion in capital expenditures this year, and AT&T's could hit $22 billion. Not all of that will come from building out their networks, but much of it will. Verizon CFO Matt Ellis said on the company's fourth-quarter 2016 earnings call that ""you should expect to see that CapEx will continue to be focused on the network side of the business as we go into 2017."" As such, if Amazon agrees to help spend capital to build out a network in partnership with Dish, it could end up being a costly venture. Rather than making any investment moves on this rumor, investors should just take note that Amazon is simply looking into how it can expand its services through wireless networks. Eventually, that could bring the company more control over its products and services, and perhaps give it an improved path to introduce new ones down the road -- but changing your investment strategy because of this rumor at this point would be pure speculation.

Recent controversies include the firing of CNN host Reza Aslan over an anti-Trump tweet, the firing of three reporters over a retracted story on Trump and Russia, and the network's decision to hunt down the maker of a GIF depicting Trump body-slamming CNN. Source: Getty Images. AT&T plans to buy Time Warner to expand its media ecosystem, which already includes U-verse, DirecTV, and ""sponsored data"" plans that provide AT&T customers with data-free streaming of its first-party and sponsored videos. If AT&T adds Time Warner's stable of media properties (HBO, CNN, Warner Bros.) to that mix, it could become a major threat to Netflix with its data-free bundles. Locking in customers offsets AT&T's sluggish growth in U.S. postpaid wireless customers, and diversifies its business with additional streams of revenue. It's similar to what Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is doing with its recent purchases of AOL and Yahoo's internet properties. But it's unclear how valuable the CNN brand is to AT&T's core strategy. On one hand, CNN's ratings rose significantly over the past few years under Zucker's watch. It just posted its most-watched second quarter in history with over a million daytime viewers in the 25-54 age group. Adding CNN to AT&T's sponsored or unlimited data plans could accelerate the network's digital transformation, while widening its moat against rivals like Verizon. CNN's mobile app. Source: Google Play. On the other hand, CNN still trails Fox News and Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) MSNBC in total viewership. It also doesn't complement Time Warner's other entertainment-oriented properties, which are easier to integrate and less controversial. Buying CNN might also raise regulatory issues, with the nation's biggest pay-TV provider controlling the third largest cable news network. But this could just all be sound and fury signifying nothing. AT&T hasn't officially said anything about firing Zucker or selling CNN, and the Time Warner merger will likely be approved. The Republican-controlled FCC allowed AT&T to skip a lengthy public-interest review, provided that it sells its FCC licenses, while Trump's appointed DOJ antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, previously stated that he doesn't believe that the megamerger represents ""a major antitrust problem."" CNN's ongoing battles with the Trump Administration and its supporters dominate the headlines, but they're distracting investors from the real issues. The inclusion or exclusion of CNN from the deal won't matter as much as retaining HBO or the other Warner Bros. media properties, so it will likely boil down to what regulators want. ","

Income investors like dividend stocks because they not only make regular payments to shareholders but also have growth potential for the long haul. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) has done a good job over time of identifying dividend stocks that pay above-average yields and also have room to move higher, and the exchange traded fund's long-term returns have been solid. So far in 2017, however, the Vanguard ETF has lagged behind the broader market, and some investors are nervous that the underperformance could be just the initial warning signs of an adverse trend to come for the ETF and for dividend-focused investments in general. VYM Total Return Price data by YCharts. Even though the overall market has gained ground this year, some sectors of the stock market haven't been as lucky, and those laggards show up clearly among Vanguard High Dividend Yield's top holdings. The energy sector has taken a hard hit in 2017, as oil prices have renewed their downward trend after recovering somewhat in 2016. Falling crude has put pressure on players from the largest integrated oil companies in the world to smaller exploration and production companies, and even Dow components ExxonMobil and Chevron saw declines of roughly 10% in the first half of the year because of those challenges. Industrial giant General Electric has posted similar declines so far in 2017, largely because of its ill-timed foray into the oil and gas sector a few years ago. The telecommunications sector has also performed poorly, falling prey to highly competitive conditions in the industry that have threatened even its most important companies. Verizon and AT&T have always been known for their attractive dividend yields, but the two wireless giants have had to fight against smaller carriers offering discounted prices for their services. So far, both companies haven't yet been able to convince customers completely that any superior quality is worth paying a premium subscription rate to get. With potentially costly upgrades to 5G networks looming, shareholders aren't certain whether profitability for the telecom giants will paint as attractive a picture as it has in the past. Finally, even in some strong sectors of the market, Vanguard High Dividend Yield has been saddled with underperformers. Technology stocks have advanced more sharply in 2017 than most other sectors, but major ETF holdings Intel and IBM have both lost ground this year. The two tech giants share the challenge of keeping up with the times, adapting their long and successful business models to address new competition while still innovating to attract high-end customers. Investors haven't been satisfied with their efforts to date, and each will have to work harder to sustain and build their businesses going forward. Image source: Getty Images. Boeing has also produced gains of more than 30% for the ETF. The commercial aerospace industry has remained strong for years, and airline consolidation has led many carriers to make new orders to update their aircraft fleets and maximize efficiency. Boeing also stands to gain from increased defense spending from the U.S. government, and greater military revenue could provide a new leg up on what has already been an impressive rally for the aerospace giant. Short-term performance in any investment can be volatile, and investors shouldn't worry about the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF's underperformance compared to the broader S&P 500 during the first half of 2017. Over time, ups and downs in the fund's returns tend to even out and provide solid long-term performance to shareholders who follow a disciplined income investing strategy. ","

Net neutrality, also called open internet, is the idea that everyone as a right to fair and unfettered online access. Under President Barack Obama, the Federal Communications Commission reclassified internet service providers with Title II of the Telecommunications Act, allowing them to regulate providers as common carriers, like telephone networks. Now, under a new administration and agency head, Ajit Pai, the FCC is planning to reverse Obama-era open internet policies. Read: FCC takes first step in rolling back net neutrality rules Also read: Here’s how other countries are addressing net neutrality The main fear among internet users is that devoid of net neutrality regulations internet service providers could throttle the speed at which users can access certain sites, creating “slow lanes.” Those opposed to net neutrality, however, argue that internet service providers were never meant to be regulated as common carriers and that it gives the government too much power in stifling what should be a free market.

AT&T said on Tuesday it would join the likes of Netflix and Amazon in support of the day of action, as Variety reports. But critics have denounced AT&T’s support as a publicity stunt. Comcast said on Wednesday that it too was in support of net neutrality. But the company doesn’t see the fight the same way as activists. It, and Verizon in its own statement, emphasized a desire to scrap what they see as 1930s-style utility regulation in favor of updated legislation. “We wanted to reinforce today — to the public, our customers, regulators and legislators — what we’ve been saying and doing for years. We support permanent, strong, legally enforceable net neutrality rules,” David Cohen, Comcast’s chief diversity officer in open internet, said. “For more than a decade this issue has been characterized primarily by slogans and rhetoric, and this has not led to protection of the open Internet on a permanent and predictable basis,” Verizon added in its response the day of action. “So we respectfully suggest that real action will involve people coming together to urge Congress to pass net neutrality legislation once and for all.” ","Netflix, Amazon, Twitter and others band together in protest of possible net neutrality rule reversal - MarketWatch"
,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc’s quarterly results topped analysts’ estimates as the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier on Wednesday reported record low customer attrition and said it was considering a quarterly dividend. T-Mobile has been gaining share from larger competitors AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc in a saturated U.S. wireless market through network improvements and lower prices. Shares rose 3 percent to $63.90 in after-hours trading. The company had said it was open to considering various strategic options and has acknowledged interest in talking with rival Sprint Corp about a merger. But such discussions appear to be on hold as Sprint explores other partnerships. Sources told Reuters in June that Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, had entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with cable companies Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp until the end of July. Sources also told Reuters that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp were exploring an investment of $10 billion to $20 billion in Sprint. “I would say we have the same but maybe more opportunities from an inorganic or an expansion standpoint than we had last quarter,” Chief Executive John Legere said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. In April, Legere said satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp had access to content and spectrum and noted Sprint had “an awful lot of scale.” Amazon.com Inc and internet companies should be considered because “they drive great value for shareholders,” he added. As for Sprint, “investors may begin to rethink whether they want a merger, or at least, whether they want one now,” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a note. Shares of T-Mobile and Sprint trade at similar multiples of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) despite T-Mobile’s stronger performance, he said. T-Mobile added 786,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the second quarter ended June 30, up from 646,000 in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected net additions of 607,000, according to research firm FactSet. Churn, or customer defections, was 1.1 percent, a record low. “We’re actually starting to have conversations about instituting a small quarterly dividend that we can grow in the future,” Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said on the call. Net income rose to $581 million, or 67 cents per share, from $225 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier.    Total revenue grew to $10.21 billion from $9.29 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $9.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ","

,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tech companies clashed with internet service providers on Monday over whether a landmark 2015 net neutrality order barring the blocking or slowing of web content should be scrapped by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The Internet Association said in its filing with the FCC that dismantling the rules “will create significant uncertainty in the market and upset the careful balance that has led to the current virtuous circle of innovation in the broadband ecosystem.” Comcast said the order “represented an unfortunate, unnecessary, and profoundly unwise wrong-turn for the broadband economy and consumers more broadly.” AT&T said the FCC in 2015 “grossly exaggerated the need for public-utility-style regulation while ignoring its costs.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined to weigh in on Monday, noting the FCC was an independent agency. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to withdraw the former Obama administration’s order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. Pai has asked that if in the event the FCC reverses that order, whether it has the authority or should keep any regulations limiting internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer  “fast lanes” to some websites, known as “paid prioritization.” Pai, who argues the Obama order was unnecessary and harms jobs and investment, has not committed to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” The Internet Association said there was “no reliable evidence” that investment by providers had fallen. Twelve state attorneys general including from Illinois and California urged the FCC not to overturn the Obama rules, saying that would “expose consumers to the risk that their internet access will be interfered with and disrupted.” More than 8.4 million public comments have been filed on the proposal. Pai will face questions on Wednesday on the issue at a U.S. Senate hearing. Providers say they strongly support open internet rules and will not block or throttle legal websites even without legal requirements. But some providers have said paid prioritization may make sense at times, citing self-driving cars and healthcare information. The Internet Association said it was “open to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories offered by the commission.” But it said Pai’s proposal “offers no clear alternatives.” ","

,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp said on Friday that it was launching new leasing options aimed at price-sensitive customers who want to upgrade their phones more often, the carrier’s latest effort to lure subscribers in an oversaturated market for wireless service. The No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier will now allow customers to lease any phone and have the option to upgrade it after a year. Previously, the option was only available for Apple Inc iPhones and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s Galaxy devices. At 18 months, customers can either return their old phones and upgrade to new ones or purchase their devices. Those who want to buy their phones can pay the remaining amount in a lump sum or in six monthly increments. “We want to give full flexibility to our customers because you don’t want to get stuck with an old phone,” Robert Hackl, Sprint’s senior vice president of leasing, said in an interview. The changes come at a time when the U.S. wireless market is becoming increasingly competitive, and carriers are battling each other to lure customers through new deals. Verizon Communications Inc in February reintroduced unlimited data plans for the first time in more than five years. Earlier this year, Sprint began offering five lines of unlimited data for $90, cheaper than competitors’ plans. In June, it launched a promotion for free unlimited data, talk and text for a year for customers who bring their own devices. Sprint is the only carrier that leases devices to customers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “It’s about lowering the cost for the consumer,” he said. “What’s in it for the carrier is people with new devices are happier. They are getting access to the new capabilities of the network.” The company, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp , is believed to be exploring a tie-up with rival T-Mobile US Inc. Sprint has also entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp on a wireless deal that would allow the cable companies to use its network. “Considering that they’re more in an M&A mindset, they need a growing company,” Entner said, of Sprint executives. “Nothing draws more customers into the door than low prices.” ","

,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo started as a pioneer and wound up a mere holding company. Uber Technologies could be embarking on the same path. In the heady days of 1999, Yahoo’s market value soared beyond $100 billion. Last month, the company offloaded the last vestiges of its online business to Verizon Communications for $4.5 billion. What’s left under the rebranded $56 billion Altaba is stakes acquired long ago in Jack Ma’s Chinese e-commerce goliath Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, along with about $11 billion of net cash. Meanwhile, legal and regulatory roadblocks keep piling up for Uber on top of a workplace-culture fiasco that has left the company, last valued at some $68 billion, without its co-founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, among other senior-level gaps. As it struggles to preserve its app-driven ride service and build fledgling logistics and autonomous-vehicle businesses, Uber has begun rounding up positions in some promising far-flung markets, too. It parlayed a cash-burning Chinese operation into a roughly 18 percent stake in rival Didi Chuxing last year. That stake alone is worth around $8 billion based on a recent $5.5 billion Didi fundraising that valued the whole company at $50 billion. Earlier this month, Uber did something similar in Russia, abandoning cutthroat competition with local rival Yandex in favor of 37 percent ownership in a new combined service, a stake initially valued at well over $1 billion. The two interests add up to approaching $10 billion. Meanwhile, Uber’s overall worth is declining. On the secondary market, it dipped to $50 billion in June, according to TechCrunch. It wouldn’t be surprising if it’s still falling following Kalanick’s ouster. A new fundraising in April for Lyft, Uber’s primary U.S. rival, pegged its value at $7.5 billion. Suppose Uber’s larger American business is worth twice that, and its China and Russia stakes soon appreciate by 50 percent. Ignoring Uber’s efforts in other countries, some of which eventually could become additional stakes, it would add up to a $30 billion company, with half the value already accounted for by minority interests. Extrapolate a few more years, and it’s not hard to see Uber becoming the next Altaba. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"NUEVA YORK/WASHINGTON - Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc, Alphabet Inc y decenas de grandes empresas de tecnología más protestaron online el miércoles contra los cambios a las leyes de neutralidad de la red de EEUU, que prohíben a los proveedores de banda ancha otorgar o vender acceso a algunos servicios de Internet y a otros no. Apoyando al “Día de la Acción por el Internet para Salvar a la Neutralidad de la Red”, más de 80.000 páginas web - desde grandes plataformas de redes sociales como Facebook hasta servicios de streaming como Netflix y webs de citas como OkCupid - están desplegando pancartas, alertas, anuncios y clips de vídeo para alentar al público a que se oponga a la derogación de las emblemáticas leyes de 2015 por la neutralidad de la red. La neutralidad de la red es un principio que prohíbe que los proveedores de banda ancha otorguen o vendan acceso a Internet rápido, esencialmente lo que vendría a ser una “vía rápida”, a algunos servicios de internen y a otros no. La ley fue implementada en 2015 por la administración del anterior presidente, el demócrata Barack Obama. Cambios a esta legislación están siendo propuestos por el director de la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones de EEUU (FCC, por sus siglas en inglés), Ajit Pai, nombrado en enero por el actual presidente, el republicano Donald Trump. Pai quiere que la comisión revoque las leyes que reclasificaron a los proveedores de Internet como si fuesen servicios públicos, alegando que las leyes del Internet abierto adoptadas por Obama dañan el empleo y la inversión. La FCC votó 2 a 1 en mayo dar inicio a un plan republicano que derogase la orden de “neutralidad de la red”. Durante un discurso en abril, Pai preguntó: “¿Queremos que el gobierno controle el Internet?¿O queremos acoger la estrategia de tacto fino (en vigor desde 1996 hasta que fue revisada en 2015)?”. En una rueda de prensa en Capitol Hill, demócratas y empresas de Internet se comprometieron a luchar contra los cambios y sugirieron que las empresas de Internet podrían ralentizar la velocidad de red. El senador Edward Markey dijo que el Internet “está siendo atacado”. “No vamos a dejar que este asalto ocurra”, dijo Markey. “Un Internet libre y abierto es nuestro derecho y lucharemos por defenderlo”. Grandes proveedores de banda ancha, incluyendo a AT&T Inc y Verizon Communications Inc, reconocieron el apoyo del público por la neutralidad de la red. Enfatizaron que estaban a favor de un “Internet abierto” pero dejaron claro que estaban contra la orden de reclasificación de la neutralidad de la red de 2015 que dijeron que, según ellos, podía llevar a la regulación gubernamental de los precios. El portavoz de la FCC Brian Hart rechazó comentar la cuestión. La comisionada de la FCC, Mignon Clyburn, la única demócrata en una comisión que cuenta con dos plazas vacantes, dijo en un comunicado el miércoles que apoya “a aquellos que creen que un Internet libre y abierto es un principio fundacional de nuestra democracia”. La ciudadanía tendrá hasta mediados de agosto para enviar comentarios a la FCC antes del voto final. ","

For example, the FANG stocks are often associated with the technology sector, but Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) reside in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), not in the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). Likewise, telecommunications is one of the 11 sectors found in the S&P 500, but telecom giants AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) reside in XLK. The construction of passively managed sector ETFs could change next year if index giants S&P Global and MSCI Inc. (MSCI) move forward with the creation of a proposed communication services sector. S&P and MSCI, the two largest providers of indexes for use by ETF sponsors, have jointly proposed communication services as a new GICS sector. The latest addition to the GICS lineup occurred last year when real estate was separated from financial services, marking the creation of the 11th S&P 500 sector. MSCI and S&P announced that move in 2014. (See also: GICS vs. ICB: Competing Systems for Classifying Stocks.) ""The proposed communication services sector could include companies in the aforementioned Telecom Sector including AT&T and Verizon,"" said CFRA Research Director of ETF and Mutual Fund Research Todd Rosenbluth in a note out Monday. Rosenbluth added that current members of XLY that could join the new communication services sector include well-known names such as Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), The Walt Disney Company (DIS) and Netflix. Likewise, XLK, the largest technology ETF, could see Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook, Inc. (FB) move to the communication services sector. Facebook and Alphabet combine for about 18% of XLK's weight. (See also: A Look at the Technology Sector SPDR ETF.) ""Based on CFRA's initial review of the proposed changes, we think AMZN could stay in the Consumer Discretionary sector along with Specialty Retail companies (17%) and Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure firms (14%),"" said the analyst. Amazon accounts for 15.5% of XLY's weight, more than double the weight assigned to Comcast, the ETF's second largest holding. While Amazon has long been assigned to the consumer discretionary sector, the company's dominant presence in the cloud computing space bolsters the argument that it could eventually be separated from its current sector designation in favor of technology or communication services. (See also: 5 ETFs With Amazon Exposure.) Last week, S&P and MSCI unveiled the consultation on the communication services sector, which would lead to the creation of a new industry group, two industries and a sub-industry, according to a statement from the index providers.

After dominating the U.S. wireless market for much of the last decade, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has fallen on hard times. Revenue and profits are down over the past year, and Verizon's stock has shed more than 20% of its value. VZ data by YCharts. Is Verizon's stock poised for a rebound? Or is this price decline a harbinger of more trouble ahead? The answers to these questions will likely depend on how well Verizon responds to the following challenges. In a largely saturated U.S. wireless market, the major carriers are locked in a battle for market share. Customers must be wrestled away from the competition to spur growth, and the ensuing struggle has ushered in a vicious price war. After initially resisting pressure from rival T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) to offer an unlimited plan, Verizon relented in the face of significant wireless customer losses. Verizon previously chose to compete on the strength of its network, which is widely considered best in class. But that advantage has lessened in recent years, as T-Mobile has steadily improved the quality of its wireless network. In fact, some studies now place T-Mobile's network on par with Verizon's. So Verizon was forced to join its rival in offering customers what they crave most: more data for less money. Unfortunately, while Verizon's new unlimited plan has helped to stem its customer losses, it's also dented its average revenue per user (ARPU) metrics. That's because many of Verizon's customers who switched to its unlimited plan were paying more for their previous data plans. In turn, this has pressured Verizon's revenue and profitability. Verizon expects ARPU trends to stabilize later this year, as new customers who come in on its new unlimited plan -- which is more expensive than some of the data plans it previously offered to new subscribers -- are expected to offset the decline from existing customers that lower their bills by switching to unlimited. This is an important trend that bears watching by investors, and one that will go a long way toward determining Verizon's future profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon may not be the first company that comes to mind when thinking about those most impacted by the rising number of cable cancellations, but with its FiOS business still accounting for about 10% of its total revenue, it's a serious threat nonetheless. Cord-cutting appears to be accelerating, as the plethora of online streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu is making it easier for more people to go without traditional cable TV. This trend is likely to only get worse for cable providers, as 10.8 million more customers are expected to cut the cord over the next five years -- up from 1.9 million in 2016 -- according to research group SNL Kagan. That's bad news for Verizon, whose FiOS TV segment has long been a source of growth. Recently, however, Verizon has begun to bleed customers -- including 13 million FiOS video subscribers in the first quarter -- as cord-cutting's impact has worsened. In response to these trends, Verizon sold off some of its FiOS assets in April of last year, sparking some analysts to wonder if it would be best served by exiting the pay TV business altogether. Yet for the time being at least, it appears that Verizon intends to keep its remaining FiOS assets. Verizon intends to counter cord-cutting by launching its own streaming service later this year. Of note, however, is that Verizon's previous attempts at online video have not gone well, and over-the-top video services typically carry lower profit margins than traditional cable. Worse still, Verizon's new streaming video offering is likely to at least partially cannibalize its existing FiOS TV business, although that's probably better than Verizon having its lunch eaten by its competitors. On a more positive note, Verizon's online video services would not be bound by the same regional constraints of its FiOS infrastructure, thereby allowing it to offer its streaming package on national basis. Yet there's likely to be fierce competition in this crowded arena, and rivals Sling TV and DirecTV Now already have a sizable head start. Still, having a competitive streaming service should only grow in importance as more and more consumers ditch their traditional pay TV packages in the years ahead. That makes Verizon's success in the streaming wars another area that investors should monitor closely. ","

T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported second-quarter results on July 19. The No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier delivered strong revenue and profit growth fueled by what are likely to be industry-leading customer gains. Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $10.213 billion $9.287 billion 10% Net income $581 million $225 million 158% Earnings per share $0.67 $0.25 168% Data source: T-Mobile Q2 2017 earnings release (opens PDF). T-Mobile added 1.3 million net new customers, bringing its total subscriber count to 69.6 million and extending its streak of adding more than 1 million customers to 17 consecutive quarters. T-Mobile added 817,000 total postpaid subscribers -- who pay monthly bills and are typically the most sought-after customers for wireless carriers -- during the second quarter, including 786,000 net postpaid phone customers. T-Mobile expects these figures to lead the industry for the sixth consecutive quarter -- a notable accomplishment considering that industry leader Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) finally succumbed to the pressure of customer losses and began offering unlimited data plans earlier this year. Yet while Verizon may have slowed its subscriber defections, it didn't stop them, and now it appears that it also didn't halt T-Mobile's market-share gains. T-Mobile CEO John Legere. Image Source: T-Mobile. CEO John Legere, who once again pulled no punches in his press-release statement, said that T-Mobile also gained the upper hand in network speeds after Verizon and fellow industry titan AT&T (NYSE:T) moved to match T-Mobile's unlimited data offerings. ""Our network just keeps getting better and faster while the Duopoly's networks seem to be choking after we forced them to go unlimited,"" Legere said. ""Make no mistake about it, the Un-carrier will not stop forcing change in this industry and our Q2 results are more proof that consumers are responding!"" To Legere's point, consumers do seem to be responding favorably to T-Mobile's offerings, as evidenced by both its industry-leading new-subscriber additions and its record low postpaid phone churn -- or customer defections -- which fell to 1.10%, down 17 basis points compared to the prior-year period. In all, T-Mobile's strong customer retention and subscriber growth fueled a 10% year-over-year increase in total revenue, to $10.2 billion. In turn, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and certain non-recurring items -- jumped 19%, to $3 billion. Adjusted net income surged 158%, to $581 million, or $0.67 per share. These results prompted T-Mobile to boost its full-year subscriber-growth forecast to a range of 3.0 million to 3.6 million branded postpaid net additions, up from previous estimates of 2.8 million to 3.5 million. The company also raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance to $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion from $10.4 billion to $10.8 billion. Peering out even further into the future, T-Mobile remains confident in its ability to grow its operating and free cash flow at annualized rates of 15% to 18% and 45% to 48%, respectively, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019. Legere also made some predictions during T-Mobile's earnings conference call: I predict that T-Mobile will be the only provider to grow total wireless revenues by double digits year-over-year. I predict that we'll be the only carrier to grow wireless service revenues at all year-over-year. And I predict that we will take all of the industry's postpaid phone growth again, at the same time achieving record profitability and strong free cash flow growth. While these are bold statements, T-Mobile has a history of delivering on Legere's promises. ","

On top of that, Frontier and Sprint operate in markets that require significant investments just to keep pace. That's a challenging position for two money-losing companies to be in, but both brands do have potential upside. It's reasonable to say that neither company represents a great buy. Both face an uphill battle against long odds, but there is a clear better buy between the companies. Image source: YCharts. Frontier wanted to be a bigger player and it spent $10.54 billion to do that buying Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). That move did make the company bigger and give it an economy of scale, but so far the purchase has been a disaster. The company paid dearly to acquire 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers from Verizon in April 2016. It has lost some of those subscribers in each quarter since the CTF deal closed. That's troubling news and while CEO Daniel McCarthy tells analysts and shareholders every quarter that it will change, the losses keep mounting. In Q4, when Frontier reported the loss of 144,000 more residential customers as well as 14,000 business customers, McCarthy blamed the drop on Frontier getting rid of former Verizon customers who had not paid their bills. ""This process is almost complete, and we expect to return to a normalized trend by the start of the second quarter,"" he said in the Q4 earnings release. ""I am pleased that underlying CTF customer trends improved in Q4 and continue to improve in Q1."" That did not happen. and the numbers actually got worse. In Q1, Frontier lost 155,000 residential customers and 18,000 business customers. In addition, Frontier just completed a 1-for-15 reverse split and it has cut its dividend. Those are not positive changes, but the CTF purchase did succeed in one key area -- it's helping the company spend less money. The cable, phone, and internet provider reached its ""target of $1.25 billion in total annualized synergies by end of Q1 2017, and remains on track to deliver an additional $350 million by end of Q2 2018,"" according to the Q1 earnings release. That buys the company time and makes it a more attractive acquisition. It's also plausible that Frontier has already hit bottom. The company's stock, as you can see above, has already absorbed the blows from continual subscriber drops, the reverse split, and the dividend cut. As you can see below, the market has been kinder to Sprint than it has Frontier. That's partly because the company has managed modest growth in postpaid subscribers for each of the past four quarters, but it's mostly because the company has become an attractive takeover target. Image source: YCharts. Sprint had been talking about reviving its once-planned merger with T-Mobile. That deal, which faces some major regulatory hurdles, has been put on hold while Sprint enters an exclusive negotiating period with Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). Those talks could result in a purchase, but that's not overly likely. Instead, the two cable giants are likely to invest in Sprint's network to beef it up to support their fledgling efforts to offer wireless service. Sprint has been very aggressive with its ads using former Verizon spokesperson Paul Marcarelli. Image source: Sprint. Sprint's biggest problem has been that T-Mobile had already staked out the territory as the alternative to wireless's biggest players. That made it hard for the number four carrier to add customers without resorting to major price cuts, which are risky in a market where consumers can leave after the promotional period ends. The likely support of Charter and Comcast could help stabilize Sprint. In addition, an investment from those companies will lessen its infrastructure expense while helping it grow subscriber counts. That makes Sprint the better buy even though its stock has moved very shakily upwards for the year. The wireless carrier simply has more options to turn around its business while Frontier faces a greater risk of going to zero. Multiple major players want at least a piece of Sprint. That should drive its price up were it to eventually sell and it gives the company leverage Frontier does not have. ","
      
    Better Buy: Frontier Communications Corporation vs. Sprint -- The Motley Fool

The stock market can seem to fall in and out of love with stocks at a moment's notice, creating great buying opportunities for investors. And sometimes it doesn't seem that valuations make any sense at all. Our Foolish investors have found three stocks they think the market is completely missing the boat on. Here's why they picked Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI), Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). Image source: Getty Images. Tim Green (Hanesbrands): With so many headlines dedicated to the largest companies, it can be easy to forget that there are thousands of U.S. stocks available. It's impossible to keep up with all of them, so it's not surprising that the market misses the boat on some solid investment opportunities. Hanesbrands, which owns well-known apparel brands including Hanes, Champion, Playtex, and Wonderbra, is one such company. Shares of Hanesbrands took a dive earlier this year when revenue and earnings came up short of expectations, but they've been slowly moving higher since. The stock is still well below its peak reached in 2015, but it could find its way back if the company can put together a string of positive earnings reports. HBI data by YCharts. Hanesbrands' core innerwear business is in a funk, with sales down 5.9% year over year during the first quarter. The activewear business performed better, with sales rising by 3.4%, and international sales surged 71% thanks to acquisitions. The ongoing shift of retail sales online presents a challenge for Hanesbrands, with the company blaming weak retail traffic for the innerwear decline. Analysts are expecting Hanesbrands' to grow revenue by 6.9% this year and produce adjusted EPS of $1.98. That puts the PE ratio at just about 11.5. While the upheaval in the retail industry creates some uncertainty, shares of Hanesbrands look like a good deal for investors willing to ride out the storm. Cory Renauer (Masimo Corporation): This hidden medical technology gem doesn't get nearly as much attention as it deserves. The stock has soared about 281% over the past three years, but it's still flying under Wall Street's radar. Just three analysts bothered tuning in for the company's latest quarterly earnings call. Wall Street may be missing the boat on the new leader of oxygen monitoring devices, but that doesn't mean it's too late for individual investors to climb aboard. In fact, I'd argue that Masimo's best days lay ahead. Although you've probably never heard of the company, you've almost certainly been attached to one of its oximetry devices (or at least one that contains noninvasive vital sign monitoring technology owned by Masimo). In the years ahead, it might be nearly impossible to find a hospital, long-term care center, or primary care provider that doesn't employ a Masimo product. After successfully protecting its intellectual property from infringement by the Dutch device giant Koninklijke Philips, the former rival is now a major partner. Philips makes IntelliVue monitors, which monitor a patient's breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. New versions of the ubiquitous monitors will also provide healthcare providers with constant measurements of important blood oxygen information that previously required an invasive blood draw. While Masimo will see a direct bump in sales from the monitors, the long-term effect of integrating this technology into the popular patient monitors could be huge. Philips represents more than half of the high-acuity monitoring market. Once healthcare providers around the globe become familiar with the benefits of constant oximetry monitoring, they're likely going to drive demand for Masimo's products through the roof. Travis Hoium (Verizon Communications): It may sound crazy that the market is missing the boat on a company worth $177 billion, but I think that's the case with Verizon. Since 2000, Verizon's stock is down 27% while revenue more than doubled and net income rose 58%. But where I think the market is missing the boat is the incredible potential of 5G technology, where Verizon will be a clear leader. The number of connected devices is already surging, and according to Gartner, connected things will increase 31% to 8.4 billion in 2017. Cisco's Visual Networking Index takes that a step further and predicts that 27.1 billion devices will be connected by 2021 and the average American will have 23 connected devices. 23! Right now, most of the increase in connected devices is coming in the home and from static devices like smart TVs or connected machines in a factory that don't require a cell network. But 5G speed of 10 gigabits per second (as much as 1,000 times faster than LTE) or more will absolutely change the game for connected devices. It will enable self-driving cars on a broad scale, a new level of virtual reality, and innovations that haven't even been thought of yet. With arguably the best network in the U.S., Verizon will be at the center of the 5G revolution. And that's an incredible growth opportunity for a stock trading at just 14.6 times trailing earnings with a 5.4% dividend yield. ","
      
    3 Stocks the Market Is Missing the Boat On -- The Motley Fool

Anders Bylund,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) fell 28% in 2016 and another 66% in the first half of 2017. The regional telecom's financial results have been a mixed bag lately, and Frontier recently slashed its dividend payments by 62%. Are shares a buy after these adjustments, or should investors still stay away from Frontier Communications stock? Let's start with a quick dividend analysis, because Frontier has been an income investor's best friend for many years. The stock's lowest yield in the last 10 years was a still-generous 4.9% in the spring of 2015, and Frontier's yields raced higher than 20% as share prices plunged in early 2017. That's where Frontier's management took action. Dividend Pay Date Payout Per Share (split-adjusted) Total Dividend Cost Cash Payout Ratio June 30, 2015 $1.575 $106 million 53% Sept. 30, 2015 $1.575 $189 million 83% Dec. 31, 2015 $1.575 $176 million 72% March 31, 2016 $1.575 $177 million 95% June 30, 2016 $1.575 $176 million 70% Sept. 30, 2016 $1.575 $178 million 106% Dec. 30, 2016 $1.575 $176 million 101% March 31, 2017 $1.575 $178 million 56% June 30, 2017 $0.60 $68 million (estimated) 28% (estimated) Data sources: Dividend.com and Frontier Communications. After holding steady at $1.575 per split-adjusted share for more than two years, Frontier's quarterly dividend was lowered to $0.60 per share in an announcement on May 2, 2017. At the same time, the company also approved a previously announced 15-for-1 reverse share split and reported disappointing first-quarter results. Share prices fell 22% over the next couple of days as investors digested the one-two punch of lower payouts and continued customer losses. Frontier CEO Dan McCarthy explained that the dividend needed to slow down in order to give Frontier more financial flexibility. ""As we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver on the full potential of our strong assets and generate additional cash flow, we will optimize our capital allocation to ensure we strike a balance between investing in the business, paying down debt and returning capital to shareholders,"" he said. So Frontier's dividend is down, and the company's cash flows have been earmarked for debt repayments rather than payout increases. Frontier's effective dividend yield remains generous due to sliding share prices, but you shouldn't expect any dividend payment boosts out of the company's management anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. McCarthy talks a good game, and promises to have his company back on solid financial ground soon enough. But Frontier often falls short of its own guidance targets and management needs to be held to its promises here. This is not made easier by the fact that Frontier is having trouble providing acceptable levels of service to its new customers in Florida, California, and Texas -- the three large markets the company acquired in a $10.5 billion deal with Verizon Communications in 2016. So I would take Dan McCarthy's rosy debt reduction talk with a grain of salt. That doesn't make dividend increases any more likely, either. In fact, it's probably a good idea to stay away from Frontier Communications stock altogether. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    Is Frontier Communications Stock a Buy? -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. At the beginning of the year, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) said it planned to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores, expanding its retail footprint to catch up with its network expansion. After the first quarter, T-Mobile had to update its outlook to 1,500 T-Mobile stores. T-Mobile's VP of Sales Jon Freier tweeted this week the company has opened 1,000 stores already this year, surpassing its original goal. The footprint expansion represents a huge opportunity for T-Mobile. While the company has been able to continue stealing away customers from Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), expanding its footprint outside of major metro areas presents additional upside for the wireless carrier. Image source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile expects its new stores to cover 30 million to 40 million new people. What's more, the competition in the areas where T-Mobile is opening new stores is much less intense than the metro areas it currently operates, giving T-Mobile a good opportunity to take market share. T-Mobile already has strong brand recognition in these markets thanks to its national advertising campaigns, so it should be able to quickly capture market share. CFO Braxton Carter said a market share in the teens is achievable within a five-year time frame. That could mean an additional 5 million customers or so over the next five years just from the stores it's opening this year. That growth will be in addition to the customers T-Mobile is still bringing in from the two-thirds of the country it covered with its retail stores in 2016. That growth is still going strong, with T-Mobile adding 1.3 million customers in the first quarter between T-Mobile and MetroPCS. That's four straight years of adding over 1 million customers every quarter. Expanding its retail footprint also gives T-Mobile room to increase its pricing as it's now competing for a larger market. The company recently increased the price of its ONE Plus plan, putting it roughly in line with Verizon's unlimited plan. That could be just the start of price increases at T-Mobile as it starts to focus on cash flow. But T-Mobile just set a record low postpaid churn rate in its first quarter. Combined with the new greenfield markets its retail operations are expanding into, it can afford to see its net additions in existing markets wane a bit. Importantly, existing customers can keep their current pricing for as long as they keep their current plans. That should help keep churn rate low. So, not only do T-Mobile's new store openings support customer growth, they support average revenue per user growth for the carrier. With the broadest retail footprints in the country, AT&T and Verizon are going to be the biggest losers as T-Mobile enters new markets. Both companies have been bleeding subscribers to T-Mobile for years now. AT&T is relying on bundle economics to keep customers from leaving. It's offering all unlimited plan customers $25 off a DIRECTV package, and Unlimited Plus customers also get free HBO on any AT&T video service. Verizon is relying on the strength of its brand and its network, which still regularly ranks atop the four national carriers in independent studies. Verizon may also launch a nationwide video streaming service later this year that it could bundle. But consumers are cutting the cord more than ever, so it's not clear how much a bundle will help. That said, Verizon is better positioned than AT&T to hold onto its customers as T-Mobile enters new markets. Nonetheless, both companies must remain aggressive, as the competition in the industry remains fierce. ","
      
    T-Mobile Is Opening Stores at a Breakneck Pace -- The Motley Fool

Brian Feroldi,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Interest rates have been hovering near historic lows for several years now. That's a big problem for retirees, many of whom depend on income from their investments to help finance their lifestyles, and who may prefer interest-paying assets like bonds due to their low risk. But poor returns from those ""safe"" assets have incentivized some income investors to put money in the highest-yielding stocks they can find in order to generate decent level of regular returns. This might sound like an attractive plan, but it can actually be a risky strategy. Too many stocks wind up with impressive-looking yields because their shares have been punished, often justifiably, by the market. The business itself may not be able to sustain such a payout much longer, and falling stocks may have further to fall. Image source: Getty Images. Recognizing all this, let's put the 10 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 to the test to figure out if any of them could be worth buying today. Company Ticker Dividend Yield Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) 16.3% CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) 9.4% Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) 7% Macy's (NYSE:M) 6.8% Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) 6.4% Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) 5.7% AT&T (NYSE:T) 5.4% Verizon Communication (NYSE:VZ) 5.3% L. Brands (NYSE:LB) 5.3% Ford (NYSE:F) 5.1% Data source: Finviz, as of July 17, 2017. This list excludes REITs. Smart income investors know that the first metric that they should look at when considering any high-yield dividend stock is its payout ratio. This figure is calculated by dividing the company's last 12 months of net income by its total dividend payout. The end result will tell investors what fraction of a company's profits are being used to cover the dividend. While this statistic is far from a perfect gauge -- one-time charges can sometimes heavily bias earnings downward -- it does provide investors with a quick way to measure a dividend's sustainability. Here's how these 10 companies stack up: Company Payout Ratio Frontier Communications NM CenturyLink 212% Mattel 190% Macy's 82% Seagate Technology 104% Kohl's 60% AT&T 95% Verizon Communications 77% L. Brands 63% Ford 64% Table source: Yahoo! Finance. NM = not meaningful; these companies reported losses over the past 12 months. A quick glance at the table above shows just how useful the payout ratio can be at helping you cull your list of potential investments. Frontier Communication hasn't even reported a profit over the last twelve months, which is why it doesn't have a payout ratio. After factoring in that it recently slashed its dividend by 62%, I'm content to eliminate the company from contention. Investors should be equally wary of investing in CenturyLink, Mattel, or Seagate Technology. All three of these companies are paying out more in dividends than they are earning in net income, which isn't a sustainable practice over the long term. That makes me believe they should also be excluded from further consideration. If a company's payout ratio looks sustainable, then I next like to get a sense of its growth potential. In my judgement, a dividend stock is only attractive if it can increase its payout over time. No company can do that long term without a growing profit stream. One quick way to gauge a company's growth potential is to look at both its historic rate of growth and its forecast growth rate over the next five years. While this method isn't foolproof, it does give us a sense of a where a company has been and where it could be going. Here's how our remaining six companies stack up in this area: Company Actual Earnings Growth Over Past 5 Years (Annualized) Estimated Earnings Growth Over Next 5 Years (Annualized) Macy's (5.1%) 18.6% Kohl's (4.1%) 5.3% AT&T 4.3% 7% Verizon Communications 12.4% 2.5% L. Brands Ford Data source: Yahoo! Finance. As you can see, big box retailers Macy's and Kohl's have seen their profits head in the wrong direction over the last five years. While there are a number of factors in play here -- declining mall traffic, discounting by competing bankrupt retailers, the rise of e-commerce -- the overall result has been shrinking net income. That's troubling, but it is interesting to see that Wall Street believes that both retailers will post healthy profit gains over the next five years -- Macy's in particular. That bullishness likely stems in part from the company's willingness to close underperforming stores and monetize its real estate assets. If that forecast growth rate can be believed, Macy's could certainly be worth considering. AT&T and Verizon Communications have both produced consistent growth over time, which makes sense given their dominance of the U.S. wireless industry. It is noteworthy that Verizon's profits have grown at a double-digit rate while Ma Bell's gains have been more muted. However, analysts expect that AT&T will be the faster grower from here, a view that likely stems from its recent purchase of DirecTV and its pending merger with Time Warner. If that merger gets the green light, then the company should have ample opportunity to grow revenue and cut costs, both of which could lead to an expanding bottom line. L. Brands, the retail company behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, has managed to keep its profits moving in the right direction in spite of facing the same issues that have plagued its big-box competition. Beyond its brand strength, one explanation for its success could be the company's big push into e-commerce. Last year, the company sold nearly $2 billion worth of products through its direct channels, representing about 16% of total sales. The company's growth plans call for a continued emphasis on online sales, and an intense push to grow its store count in China. If those moves pay off, then shareholders could certainly benefit. Meanwhile, analysts are predicting that Ford's profit trend will shift into reverse over the coming years. That view likely stems from worries that North American auto sales have peaked, plus concerns about it recent sudden change in leadership, and the long-term threats posed by electric and autonomous vehicles. New CEO Jim Hackett will have his work cut out for him in terms of changing Wall Street's outlook on Ford's. While these stocks are far from risk-free, and each has its own unique set of pluses and minuses, I must admit that Macy's and L. Brands are the two that interest me most from this list. Both companies can afford to make their dividend payments today, and could be in position to grow after the current wave of retail bankruptcies and store closures finally subsides. That's an intriguing combination that makes them worthy of further investigation. ","
      
    10 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks Today: To Buy or Not to Buy -- The Motley Fool

Motley Fool Staff,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man, Steve Broido, will hit you with a question from the other side of the glass. David Kretzmann, you're up first. What are you looking at? David Kretzmann: I'm looking at Camping World Holdings, ticker CWH. RV sales in the U.S. are actually hitting the highest levels they've ever been at in about 40 years. As more baby boomers are retiring and younger people are trying to travel more while they're still young and working, RV sales are continuing to increase each year here in the U.S. Camping World Holdings is essentially the largest national retailer of RVs. They have 130 stores in 36 states, and they also own the Good Sam Club, which you can think of as the RV industry's membership club, kind of the AAA for RVs, and they have 1.7 million members in the Good Sam Club, which provides some high-margin recurring revenue for the company and keeps that relationship with their customers over time. There's a lot of mom-and-pop operators in this space, so what Camping World can do is acquire those mom-and-pop brands, rebrand them, and build this national RV brand under Camping World. So a lot of things to like here. It's a small cap, but I'm keeping a close eye on it. Hill: Steve, question about Camping World Holdings? Steve Broido: I'm legitimately fascinated with RVs. I have looked at them online. It's an interesting, interesting, interesting place to look, by the way. Would you go with a fifth wheel or a motor home? What are you going with? Kretzmann: Man, I am not an expert there, Steve. It depends on your respective circumstances. Broido: I'm going fifth wheel. Kretzmann: Fifth wheel, that sounds good. Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at? Jason Moser: Yeah, looking at Wayfair earnings coming out on Aug. 8. Ticker is W. I've been covering this business since it IPOed in 2014. It continues to perform, and all of the metrics seem to be going in the right direction. They're growing sales; they're growing users; margins are actually pretty steady. The big metric there is the percentage of orders from repeat customers, and that continues to appreciate over time. So then it's going to be a question of whether they can pull back on that acquisition at some point and really unleash some profitability in the business. There was a report of Amazon jumping into this line of work a month or so ago. It doesn't seem like that may be the Wayfair killer others thought it might be. But very interested in their quarter here. Hill: Steve, question about Wayfair? Broido: Is there a membership model in place here? Maybe like Restoration Hardware has done, where you become a member and you get a discount? That kind of thing? Moser: There is not yet. I do believe they have something in the mix there to try to develop a little bit more loyalty. Hill: Matty Argersinger, what are you looking at? Matt Argersinger: One stock recently on my watch list is Live Nation Entertainment. The ticker is LYV. Yes, music streaming has been around for years. We talk about things like virtual reality. But in my mind, you just can't replace the experience of going to a live concert or sports event. Live Nation is the largest events, promotion ticketing company in the world. Last year, they promoted 26,300 events; 71 million fans came and attended. They also own Ticketmaster, by the way, which is the largest ticketing company in the world -- 480 million tickets last year. I just think there's a lot going for this company, and I like the idea of a live events business in this Amazon-disrupted world we're living in right now. Hill: Steve, question about Live Nation Entertainment? Broido: It's a question for Matt. What's the best concert you've ever attended? Argersinger: Oh my gosh. I'm going to go old school. I went to Bruce Springsteen about 15 years ago, right out of college. It was one of the best times I've ever had. Hill: What about you, Steve? Broido: I'm going with The Cure. I saw The Cure in 1989, Disintegration Tour, it was really solid. Hill: Three stocks. You got one you want to add to your watch list? Broido: I'm going camping, man. Kretzmann: All right! Broido: I'm buying an RV. Let's do it. Kretzmann: Sounds good, Steve. Hill: Kretzmann going to do the cooking for you on that trip? Broido: I hope so. Kretzmann: We'll go to Chipotle. ","

Jeff Bezos and company keep steamrolling ahead, and not just in the United States. The Fools talk international, the Echo Show, Target's (NYSE:TGT) upgraded guidance, and e-commerce more broadly. Plus, they discuss the direction of commercial real estate, and one company picking up a fair amount of the space that was left empty with so many retailers shrinking their brick-and-mortar footprints. A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: From big banks to big retail, in this case Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Target, Amazon Prime Day resulted in the biggest single day of sales ever for Amazon. This comes the same week that Target CEO Brian Cornell raised guidance for the retailer, citing higher traffic in their stores. Matty, let's start with Amazon. Forget Black Friday, forget Cyber Monday. It really does seem like Prime Day is the most important day for them. Matt Argersinger: Right. Based on the expected growth rate of 60%, Amazon probably pulled in almost a billion dollars. Not bad for a random Tuesday in July. No, this has become a big event. It started out a couple years ago as, ""It's the 20th anniversary of Amazon; let's have some special discounts for Prime members."" Hill: And by the way, it didn't go that well. Argersinger: No, not initially. I remember the site being down for several hours during that first time they did it. But it's now become this phenomenon. Of course, for Amazon, it really is about getting people to join Prime, experience what they can get on Prime. And for me, I'm really watching how people are interacting with Amazon Fresh and the household-staples part of the business. I think Amazon's goal is to get more and more people into that, realizing that's how they can steal a lot more market share from grocery stores, et cetera. David Kretzmann: Yeah, I remember in previous years, other retailers, I think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target included, tried to have their own competition against Prime Day on Prime Day to try to steal some of that share from Amazon, and that didn't really happen this year, but I'm just thinking back to the first quarter of this year, where Wal-Mart's online sales grew 69%, Target's online sales grew 22%, which pales in comparison to what Wal-Mart and Amazon are putting up. I would be curious to see what those online numbers look like for retailers like Wal-Mart and Target coming up. Hill: Again, you go back two years to when they first did this, as you said, Matty, the site was down, they got some criticism, and I think it was fair, in terms of a little bit of bait-and-switch going on, in terms of the products they were promoting that sold out very quickly, that sort of thing. But Jason, in just two years' time, as we should expect with Jeff Bezos and his team, they've really got it down pat now. You look at what they're promoting this time around; it's very much the Echo, and it really does telegraph where they see that device in people's homes and what it means for Amazon's business. Jason Moser: Yeah, and the pace they're rolling out in new apps and skills for the Echo, it's very impressive. I really feel like we're going to need to get an Echo show at our house just to test it out, for sheer selfless market research, Chris, I may have to buy one of those and come back and tell you how that thing works. Because I do like the Echo in our house. We have a Dot as well. It's neat to see its functionality. I think the Echo Show gives them an opportunity to incorporate a bit more e-commerce. I think that's maybe one of the holdups there in making purchases with the Echo -- you're not quite sure what exactly you're getting; you can't make that visual confirmation. But I also think with Prime Day, it's really important to note that this is beyond just our domestic economy. It's very easy for us to look at it from a U.S.-centric perspective. But really, this rolled out Prime Day to 13 countries this year. This is where I think the real opportunity for Amazon still exists. They're investing so much in those international operations, and they're delivering those operating losses today. But remember 10 years ago, that's what it looked like here. So it's not too big of a leap to think that in 10 years, they're going to have a very impressive global e-commerce infrastructure and operation going that could reward shareholders for many years to come. Argersinger: You could see, as big as Prime Day was, maybe a billion in sales for Amazon, it pales in comparison to Singles Day in China, which is an Alibaba phenomenon on Nov. 11 every year, where they did $18 billion in sales. And I'm just wondering if Jeff Bezos was thinking to himself, ""Prime Day, eventually I think could be this worldwide thing where we pull in tens of billions of dollars in sales, and this is just the start of it."" Moser: It's a nice lever to pull! Hill: In some ways, probably not as surprising that they had this big of a day when you think about what Target did, just in terms of retail, David. Target's news this week, the guidance raise, the subsequent pop in Target's stock, it was almost like a sigh of relief on Wall Street, because for all of Amazon's success, Target is still a big player in this space, as is Wal-Mart, as is Costco. So you look at Costco's recent June sales, Target raising their guidance -- Amazon has a bright future, but these bricks and mortar power players are doing pretty well. Kretzmann: I think Wal-Mart especially, they've made numerous acquisitions, including Jet.com and Bonobos, another fashion online retailer that they bought within the last couple months. As I mentioned, their online sales in the latest quarter were up almost 70%, which is phenomenal. And they have almost the same amount of items on their platform online compared to Amazon, so they're making a lot of progress there. Target is more treading water, I think, even though their online sales were up 22% in the latest quarter. Compared to what Amazon in Wal-Mart are dealing with, Target is going to have to step up their game, and I think there's still a lot of questions there, even with their slightly raised guidance for this upcoming quarter. Argersinger: So Target is all excited about their restock program, which is, essentially, next-day delivery service that they're rolling out or testing in Minneapolis. Compare that to Prime, where you get same-day delivery in 5,000 cities around the world, and here's Target, ""We're testing next-day delivery in Minneapolis."" Kretzmann: Revolutionary! [laughs] Argersinger: ""We're excited about what this could do for our business."" You guys are 10 years behind by now. Hill: They get a lot of snow up there, though. You can't expect everything the same day. Argersinger: That's true. Hill: David, you and I were talking before we started taping today. One of the ripple effects -- and we don't really get into it all that much on this show -- you think about commercial real estate, when we look at the big retail trends, and a lot of well-known retailers closing stores and, in some cases, going out of business. In some cases, all of a sudden, that commercial real estate becomes really cheap. You mentioned something that really surprised me, which is that T-Mobile, of all companies, has opened a thousand locations so far in 2017. How have they done that? Kretzmann: Apparently they're finding someplace to put those stores. Maybe they're filling up the space that's opening up as all these other retailers and restaurants close up shop. They initially had guided to open a thousand new stores total in 2017. This is coming off a base of 2,000 stores at the end of last year. But they hit that mark earlier this week. By the middle of the year, essentially, they reached that mark, and now they're saying, ""We're going to open 1,500 total stores this year."" Their existing store base now covers about two-thirds of the U.S., and now this will really help boost their store coverage outside of the main metro areas in the country. This is a company that has, over the past four years, each quarter they've added at least one million new customers, stealing customers from Verizon and AT&T bit by bit. They also have a record low churn rate as of the latest quarter. So, a lot of things going well for T-Mobile. They're in full-on expansion mode. ","
      
    Prime Day Was Amazon's Best Day Ever, but Target and Wal-Mart Aren't Hurting -- The Motley Fool

Michael Brush,07202017,MarketWatch,07132017,"Published: July 20, 2017 4:54 p.m. ET Five areas of the global market will benefit from a weak greenback By Republicans tripped up the U.S. dollar this week by failing to make progress on replacing Obamacare. This hurt the greenback by casting doubts on other reforms promised by President Donald Trump — including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Big picture, the GOP’s Obamacare setback is really only part of the problem for the dollar. Even if politicians miraculously get their act together (don't hold your breath) the dollar is still in for trouble. In fact, it's been weak all year for reasons that have little to do with Washington, D.C. — and those issues aren't going away soon. Indeed these challenges could bring a surprise breakdown in the dollar later this year, forcing investors to make some painful portfolio adjustments, says Jim Paulsen chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. Below, I offer a five-step plan on how to position your own portfolio now, to profit from the moves others will have to make later as dollar weakens further. But first, here are the three main reasons this unexpected dollar weakness will play out. 1: A global recovery is bidding up the value of other currencies For most of the recovery since 2009, U.S. growth has outpaced foreign growth. That made the dollar more attractive. People had to buy it to get access to more favorable U.S. growth. Nowadays, though, about two thirds of foreign economies are growing faster than the U.S. Europe is a good example. ""The economy is growing well above its potential, and while full employment is still a ways off, it now seems very achievable,"" says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. Meanwhile, growth in China has stabilized, erasing fears about a potential meltdown there. And many emerging markets are back on track. All of this means investment dollars are flowing out of U.S. assets into foreign countries. This, of course, puts downward pressure on the dollar and drives up foreign currencies. The trend is likely to persist. Leading economic indicators suggest foreign economies will continue to do well relative to the U.S. 2: Foreign bonds are becoming more attractive For much of the recovery, U.S. government bond yields were more attractive than foreign bond yields. But now, as foreign economies strengthen, that's changing. ""For the first time in more than five years, foreign bond yields are finally becoming more competitive relative to U.S. yield offerings,"" Paulsen says. This, too, is channeling money out of the U.S. and into foreign countries, driving up their currencies relative to the dollar. 3: U.S. inflation will heat up Many pundits think the greenback will hang in there because the Fed is hiking interest rates. This will entice foreign investors to buy dollars to get access to those higher yields, according to this theory. But to really understand what is going on here and what it means for the dollar, you have to consider why the Fed is hiking rates. And that spells trouble for the dollar. The Fed is raising rates because it sees signs of higher inflation. It wants raise rates to fulfill one of its two mandates — controlling inflation. To anyone owning dollars, inflation is bad news. It means they'll have less purchasing power. So they naturally sell greenbacks. Indeed, history is replete with evidence that the dollar weakens when inflation rises. The best example: High inflation during the 1970s hammered the dollar. Don't make the mistake of being lulled by the June inflation slowdown. That was probably caused by one-off events. One was the sharp decline in cell-phone prices linked to the rising popularity of unlimited plans. Another was measurement problems related to changes in how doctors report their fees to government statisticians, Zandi says. ""The Fed continues to downplay the recent drop in core inflation,” agrees Barclays economist  Blerina Uruçi. Leuthold’s Paulsen thinks tight labor markets will soon push wage inflation above 3%, and this will boost consumer prices as people buy more stuff. ""We expect inflation anxieties to worsen in the second half of this year,"" he says. If inflation suppresses the dollar, as it normally does, matters will get worse. A weaker dollar bids up commodity prices. This leads to more inflation. And this erodes the dollar even more. Partly because of this feedback loop, a breakdown in the dollar could push wage and consumer price inflation to 3%-4%, says Paulsen, which would shock a lot of people. A key factor to watch: Any move in the dollar below its current trading range. Since early 2015, the U.S. Dollar Index

If it breaks out of that range to the downside, it will wake up a lot of investors to the potential for more dollar weakness. They'll scramble to adjust their portfolios. What to buy now: Here's what you can do now to benefit as investors make necessary changes to adapt to this new investing climate. Paulsen provided guidance on the themes below, and I've filled in suggestions on specific stocks and exchange traded funds. 1. Buy commodities: A weaker dollar pushes up commodity prices.

Nigam Arora,07202017,MarketWatch,07132017,"Published: July 14, 2017 2:56 p.m. ET Retail sales and inflation reveal a weakening economy and, possibly, corporate profits By Sophisticated investors closely follow economic data. But I’ve noticed that some lesser-experienced investors don’t do the same. They should. Because two important pieces of economic data were just released. Retail sales Please click here to see a chart of retail sales. Please note from the chart that as the stock market continues to go higher, retail sales are declining after a prolonged run. This is especially troubling because the economy is near full employment. Typically, as employment gets stronger, retail sales climb. Could this be an early warning signal? The American economy is 70% based on consumer spending. For this reason, retail sales are very important. Retail sales, excluding autos, came in at -0.2% vs. +0.2% consensus month-over-month. We exclude autos from our models because they’re volatile and create noise that clouds the analysis. To see how The Arora Report filters out the noise, please click here. Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora. Inflation data The core Consumer Price Index (CPI) came at 0.1% vs. 0.2% consensus. In our models, we do not use headline CPI and exclude food and energy because they, too, are volatile. Weak inflation sometimes takes pricing power away from companies. This often leads to less profitability. Prime examples here are AT&T

Bonds and gold roar, but the dollar weakens After dovish testimony by the Federal Reserve’s Janet Yellen, weak economic data released now makes it less likely that interest rates will rise soon. The Fed is likely to focus on unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Any currency that pays a lower interest rate gets weaker. The dollar fell on the news.

Sooner or later, the music stops and someone is left standing. • From the large number of emails I have received from investors and social media, the momo crowd is driven only by price. Often such investors do not even have a good grasp of what a company does, yet they buy large quantities based on price momentum. Investors who are not especially nimble may consider staying away from this approach.

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"There has been a flurry of dealmaking for fiber assets, as growing demand from U.S. businesses for data transmission has fueled a revival in fiber optic services and is pushing large telecommunication companies to bulk up in fiber. No deal between WideOpenWest and Verizon is certain and negotiations could still fall apart, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Another buyer could still emerge for the asset, the sources added. WideOpenWest, which has market capitalization of around $1.4 billion and went public in May, is working with a financial adviser to explore a sale of the unit, the people said. WideOpenWest did not respond to a request for comment. Verizon declined to comment. Since 2014, WideOpenWest has built about 1,200 miles of fiber in the Chicago market for a “leading wireless carrier,” according to a corporate filing. The sources identified this carrier as Verizon. Verizon uses WideOpenWest’s fiber system in Chicago for backhaul, which is the data transfer of mobile traffic over wired lines, according to the sources. While it is under a long-term contract with the wireless carrier, WideOpenWest had said it expected it would find more business customers to use the fiber. Verizon reported quarterly revenue that topped analyst expectations on Thursday, adding 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers.. ","

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported quarterly revenue that topped expectations on Thursday as the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier attracted more subscribers with its unlimited data plan. Shares jumped 3.6 percent to $46.01 in premarket trading. In the quarter, Verizon added 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers, compared to an increase of 615,000 in the year-earlier period. The additions were higher than the JPMorgan estimate of 115,000 and consensus expectations of 70,000, JPMorgan analysts said in a research note on Thursday. Verizon has been competing for customers with smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp in a saturated U.S. market for wireless service as most consumers already have cell phones. In February, Verizon reintroduced an unlimited data plan for the first time in more than five years. Since then, other carriers have launched aggressive promotions. Sprint said in June that it was offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year to consumers who bring their own devices in a promotion aimed at Verizon subscribers. The company added 358,000 phone-only subscribers, compared with 86,000 net additions a year ago. Verizon’s unlimited plan, priced at $80 a month for a single line, is more expensive than competing plans. Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said Thursday’s post-earnings conference call that “even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver.” Churn, or the rate of customer defections for subscribers paying a monthly bill, was flat at 0.94 percent from the year-earlier period, and lower than analysts’ estimates of 1.1 percent, according to JPMorgan. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, called the subscriber numbers “very strong,” but added that “we remain cautious on Verizon equity given what we regard as unsustainable margins and returns in a competitive market.” Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.36 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the second quarter, from $702 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 96 cents per share. Total operating revenue edged up to $30.55 billion from $30.53 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents on revenue of $29.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The latest quarter included a gain from the sale of data centers and lower expenses. Earnings in the year-earlier period were also hurt by a strike in the wireline business. ","

AT&T said it lost 89,000 U.S. phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the quarter, its most lucrative customers. Analysts had expected a far bigger loss of 256,000. The company’s better-than-expected subscriber metrics and margin performance alleviated some concerns that hang over the stock, Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski wrote in a note on Wednesday. “In Wireless, it now seems clear that we will see record low churn for the industry this quarter, with consumers likely waiting for the new iPhone before switching and upgrading,” wrote New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin on Wednesday. It bought Time Warner Inc TWX.N for $85.4 billion to bundle mobile service with entertainment. AT&T expects that deal to close by year-end. AT&T announced in April it was offering its unlimited wireless plan with its streaming service DirecTV Now for an additional $10 a month. Product bundles will help win new subscribers and keep existing ones, Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts. AT&T reported second-quarter earnings of 79 cents per share, excluding certain items, topping analysts’ average estimate of 73 cents per share.

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo started as a pioneer and wound up a mere holding company. Uber Technologies could be embarking on the same path. In the heady days of 1999, Yahoo’s market value soared beyond $100 billion. Last month, the company offloaded the last vestiges of its online business to Verizon Communications for $4.5 billion. What’s left under the rebranded $56 billion Altaba is stakes acquired long ago in Jack Ma’s Chinese e-commerce goliath Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, along with about $11 billion of net cash. Meanwhile, legal and regulatory roadblocks keep piling up for Uber on top of a workplace-culture fiasco that has left the company, last valued at some $68 billion, without its co-founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, among other senior-level gaps. As it struggles to preserve its app-driven ride service and build fledgling logistics and autonomous-vehicle businesses, Uber has begun rounding up positions in some promising far-flung markets, too. It parlayed a cash-burning Chinese operation into a roughly 18 percent stake in rival Didi Chuxing last year. That stake alone is worth around $8 billion based on a recent $5.5 billion Didi fundraising that valued the whole company at $50 billion. Earlier this month, Uber did something similar in Russia, abandoning cutthroat competition with local rival Yandex in favor of 37 percent ownership in a new combined service, a stake initially valued at well over $1 billion. The two interests add up to approaching $10 billion. Meanwhile, Uber’s overall worth is declining. On the secondary market, it dipped to $50 billion in June, according to TechCrunch. It wouldn’t be surprising if it’s still falling following Kalanick’s ouster. A new fundraising in April for Lyft, Uber’s primary U.S. rival, pegged its value at $7.5 billion. Suppose Uber’s larger American business is worth twice that, and its China and Russia stakes soon appreciate by 50 percent. Ignoring Uber’s efforts in other countries, some of which eventually could become additional stakes, it would add up to a $30 billion company, with half the value already accounted for by minority interests. Extrapolate a few more years, and it’s not hard to see Uber becoming the next Altaba. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"路透华盛顿7月27日 - 颇为关键的6月美国资本财出货连续第五个月上升，暗示企业资本支出帮助拉动了第二季度的经济成长。 周四公布的其它数据显示6月商品贸易逆差大幅缩窄，零售和趸售(批发)库存双双上升，也强化了上一季经济加速成长的迹象。 适逢美国政府即将于周五公布公布第二季度国内生产总值(GDP)初值，上述乐观报告促使经济学家将经济成长环比年率预估上调至最高3.5%。美国第一季经济成长环比年率为1.4%。 “经济仍然处在衰退结束后开始的长期扩张中。我们认为唯一的风险在于，从事艰苦工作、推动经济成长的劳动力不足，”纽约三菱东京日联银行首席金融经济学家鲁普基(Chris Rupkey)说。 商务部称，扣除飞机的非国防资本财订单上升0.2%，5月时上升0.4%。 核心资本财出货量用于计算政府的国内生产总值(GDP)指标中的设备支出。 不过核心资本财订单下滑0.1%，说明未来几个月设备支出可能温和。6月该数据录得12月以来首次下降，5月为上升0.7%，为1月以来最大增幅。 **商品贸易逆差缩窄** 设备支出的增加主要是由能源产业推动。油气探钻在油价崩跌后减少，但之后又大幅增加。 但随着探钻活动降温，动能正在放缓。能源业复苏抵消了汽车生产下滑带来的部分拖累，从而给制造业提供支撑。制造业占美国经济的12%左右。 周四公布的其他数据中，商务部表示，6月商品贸易逆差减少3.7%至639亿美元，因出口增加。上个月商品出口增加18亿美元至1,286亿美元。 商品进口减少7亿美元至1,924亿美元。此外，6月零售和趸售(批发)库存增加0.6%。商品贸易逆差缩窄及库存增加对GDP增长来说是助力。 然库存升高也可能在未来几季打压经济成长。 “库存对经济来说并非永远是好事。若库存的积累是预期着需求环境复苏，一般而言就是正面的。”富国证券资深分析师Tim Quinlan说。 “若那是因为需求枯竭，产品没有卖出去所导致，显然就不是令人满意的信号。” 周四由劳工部公布的另一份报告显示，7月22日止当周，美国一周初请失业金人数经季节调整后增加1万人，至24.4万；但裁员数仍低，与就业市场趋紧的趋势一致。 目前初请失业金人数已连续第125周低于30万关口，这是1970年以来最长的持续纪录，而当时就业市场规模较小。劳动力市场接近充分就业，失业率处于4.4%的低位。 每年大约这个时候，初请失业金人数的起伏较大，因为汽车业者组装厂会暂时关闭以更换机械设备。通用汽车等部分制造商还会延长夏季关厂时间，以处理因销售下降而出现的过剩库存。 美国耐久财订单图表：tmsnrt.rs/2o0iZOm 美国经济-请失业金人数互动图：tmsnrt.rs/2gbkbf2 美国初请失业金及非农就业岗位图表：tmsnrt.rs/2p7dFGi (完) ","

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,［ニューヨーク　２０日　ロイター　BREAKINGVIEWS］ - 米ネット検索大手だったヤフーは、先駆者として登場したが、最終的にはただの持ち株会社に落ち着いた。米配車サービス大手ウーバー・テクノロジーズ[UBER.UL]もその道をたどり始めたかにみえる。 一方のウーバーは、法律や規制面での障害が次々と現れ、さらには職場のセクハラ問題などの不祥事を受けて共同創業者であるトラビス・カラニック氏が最高経営責任者（ＣＥＯ）を辞任し、他の幹部ポストにも空きが出る状態になっている。同社の直近の評価額は６８０億ドルだった。 アプリを使った配車サービスを維持し、ロジスティックスや自動運転車など新分野のビジネスを築こうと苦心する一方で、ウーバーは、遠く離れた一部の有望市場での事業を整理している。 ウーバーは昨年、大きな赤字だった中国事業を現地の配車サービス最大手「滴滴出行」に譲渡し、合併後の新会社株式の約１８％を取得した。滴滴出行が最近、評価額を５００億ドルとして５５億ドルの資金調達を行ったことを踏まえれば、この株の持ち分だけで約８０億ドルの価値がある。 しかしその間、ウーバー全体の企業価値は減少している。ニュースサイトのテッククランチによると、流通市場では６月に時価総額が５００億ドルに下落した。カラニック氏の辞任を受けて、さらに下落していても不思議ではない。 ウーバーの米国最大の競合相手であるリフトが４月に行った資金調達では、リフトの評価額は７５億ドルだった。ウーバーの米国事業がその倍の規模で、中国とロシアで保有する株式の価値が間もなく５０％上昇すると仮定しよう。ウーバーが他の国で展開している事業は、いずれ他社株式に転換されるものもあるかもしれないが、ここでは無視する。そうすると、全てを足し合わせた評価額は３００億ドルとなる。その半分はすでに他社株式の持ち分だ。これを元に数年後を予想すれば、ウーバーが次のアルタバになることは、想像に難くない。 ＊筆者は「Reuters Breakingviews」のコラムニストです。本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。 ＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。 ,"

The super-thin device touts a shatterproof display, thinner battery and a 360 Camera Moto Mod, a two-sided, circular camera which juts out at the top of the phone like a small periscope. (See also: Is Motorola a Great Stock for Value Investors?) Motorola has debuted a similar type of design to the Z2 with the release of the Moto Z Force and Droid Turbo 2. Like other phones in the Moto Z line, the new Z2 model has a set of connectors on its back that allows the phone to connect to Motorola’s various Moto Mod modular accessories, including wireless chargers or game controllers. A new Moto Mod 360-degree camera will cost a whopping $300. While the phone is not officially water resistant, but Motorola says it will have a level of “water protection” that allows it to survive light rain. While last year’s Moto Z Force was available only on Verizon Communications Inc.’s (VZ) network, the new Z2 version will sell for all the major carriers in the U.S. beginning Aug. 10. Price will vary by carrier, at around $750. While the wider availability will help expand Motorola’s market reach, competition is still fierce as smart device makers including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Samsung Electronics and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) plan to release new products in the upcoming months. Last month, Motorola shares jumped on news of the anticipated product release and word that the company was on track to sell 3 million Moto Z devices within the line’s first year on the market. Trading up 0.2% on Wednesday afternoon at $91.57 per share, MSI reflects a 36.9% return over the most recent 12-month-period and a 10.5% gain year-to-date (YTD).

Liz Moyer,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"Comcast Corp. should buy Verizon Communications, a deal that could be worth $215 billion, an analyst from Citigroup said Wednesday. Though many view Verizon as a likely suitor for Dish Network, the analyst said Comcast could swoop in with a deal for the wireless carrier that would help it extend internet connectivity outside the home. The analyst estimates Comcast could pay a 20 percent premium to Verizon's share price, which was $43.98 at the close of trading Tuesday. Verizon's shares are down more than 17 percent this year, so much so that Comcast, the parent of NBCUniversal, is now bigger in terms of market value, Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a research note on Wednesday. Verizon's market value was $179 billion as of Tuesday's close, so a 20 percent premium would put a deal value at $215 billion. ""It's a call Comcast should make ... and Verizon should take,"" wrote Bazinet in the note. Verizon shares were up more than 1 percent in morning trading, while Comcast shares were flat. The research cites press reports that indicate Verizon could be open to a deal with Disney, CBS or Comcast. A spokesman from Comcast and a spokeswoman for Verizon both declined to comment. It is a time of rapid consolidation in the media and telecommunications industries. Companies that create content are looking for more efficient ways to distribute it at a time when many households are moving to streaming services from Netflix and Amazon.com. Comcast bought NBCUniversal in 2009 and attempted a deal with Time Warner Cable in 2014, but called it off the next year. Telecom giant AT&T and media giant Time Warner are waiting on regulatory approval for their $80 billion combination, which would marry video content with delivery on mobile devices. Bazinet said in his note that the regulatory climate may be more amenable under the current administration to big combinations. A Comcast-Verizon tie-up could boost revenue at the combined company, he said. He estimates Comcast would have to sell about 16 percent of its cable operations where it overlaps with Verizon's FiOS network.

Shares of  Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) popped on Thursday morning, trading 6.5% higher as of 11:15 a.m. EDT. The fuel for this fire came from Verizon's second-quarter earnings report, which it posted before the opening bell. Verizon's revenue held flat year over year at $35.6 billion, while adjusted earnings per share rose from $0.94 to $0.96. The bottom-line result landed right where with Wall Street had expected it to, but the sales result was a modestly positive surprise. More importantly, Verizon added 590,000 net new subscribers in the all-important postpaid smartphones category. Retail postpaid phone churn landed below 0.9% per month for the ninth consecutive quarter, setting an all-time low in the LTE era at 0.7%. Low churn equals loyal customers, so that's great news for Verizon and its investors. Image source: Getty Images. This rosy report put a decisive stop to Verizon's recent share price slide, but the stock is still trading roughly 12% lower year to date. Management gave credit for these solid results to the February launch of all-new unlimited wireless data plans. Looking ahead, Verizon simply reaffirmed its view that full-year results in 2017 should stay close to the figures posted in 2016 on both the top and bottom lines. All things considered, Big Red earned this reprieve from share price pressures and today's market reaction makes perfect sense. Recouping what it's lost will take a couple more of these positive reports. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has once again swept the twice-yearly RootMetrics Mobile Performance in the United States report on a national level. The company did tie with Sprint (NYSE:S) and AT&T (NYSE:T) in the ""text"" category, but the company lost ground at the metro level in the study that covers the first half of 2017. ""The bigger story exists at state and metro levels where AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile [(NASDAQ:TMUS)] make significant strides,"" according to an emailed statement from RootMetrics. ""Metro-level performance provides the strongest gauge of a network for consumers."" Since many people don't travel extensively, or travel within limited areas, or travel only a few times year, the most important thing is how their wireless network works wherever they spend the most time. Gains are being made by its rivals, but Verizon still has the top wireless network. Image source Getty Images. RootMetrics defines metro areas as not just city centers, but also residential suburbs, business districts, recreational areas, and the highways that connect them. It tests network performance in all those areas and while Verizon still won, it scored fewer first place wins than in the previous period while AT&T, and to a much-lesser extent, T-Mobile scored more. First-place awards are only part of the story as RootMetrics noted that ""AT&T and T-Mobile made big speed and reliability improvements in metro areas."" Even Sprint, which appears to be the least successful carrier in the current report, saw ""significantly boosted data speeds and reliability at the metro level,"" according to the independent research firm. To come up with its score, RootMetrics testers drove over ""275,000 miles while testing performance on highways and in big cities, small towns, and rural areas across the U.S."" In total the company collected approximately ""4.7 million test samples while driving and at more than 8,800 indoor locations."" It's worth noting that while Verizon has run television commercials based on RootMetrics' results, T-Mobile CEO John Legere considers them biased. He sent an email to the media in February 2016 about the research company turning off his company's Voice over LTE feature, ""that is on every single phone we sell. VoLTE handles roughly 50% of calls made on the T-Mobile network,"" he wrote. Legere also questioned exactly how independent the research firm is, asking ""Do we have to pay RootMetrics millions like the other carriers do to get them to stop deliberately turning off significant portions of our network and skewing results during their drive tests? Coincidence? Doubt it."" RootMetrics said in an email to The Motley Fool responding to Legere's complaint that anyone can purchase its highly detailed data, but that is not connected to its results. RootMetrics now tests VoLTE and has since the first half of 2016. Verizon can still accurately say it has the best network, but that claim no longer means as much as it once did. Wireless network reliability overall has improved and that has given the public more viable choices. For many people, AT&T, T-Mobile, and even Sprint offer a good, or at least good enough, experience. Verizon is the leader with AT&T the clear No. 2, but for a lot of people, T-Mobile and Sprint have improved to the point where they are reasonable options, especially since they are the cheapest of the four major carriers.

    Verizon Has the Best Wireless Network, but That's Not the Whole Story -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,07272017,Fool,07202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The second quarter was Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) first full quarter following the release of its unlimited plan. Prior to offering unlimited data, Verizon was bleeding subscribers to T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and other competing wireless carriers. And while it might still be bleeding subscribers, the unlimited plan is certainly helping stem the losses. But a recent survey from Cowen and Company, found Verizon is the largest donor of subscribers to other carriers. Cowen determined Verizon's late entry to unlimited plans cost it a lot of subscribers. But one number from T-Mobile's earnings report indicates Verizon is starting to turn things around. Image source: Verizon T-Mobile reports its porting ratios with the other major carriers just about every quarter. The porting ratio is a good indicator of how many customers switch from one carrier to T-Mobile. A number over one indicates T-Mobile is winning more customers than its losing from that carrier. T-Mobile has reported porting ratios above 1 with every major wireless competitor for three years straight. But last quarter, T-Mobile's porting ratio with Verizon fell to 1.2. That's the lowest level it's seen in years. Even when Verizon was incentivizing subscribers to port their number, it didn't see a porting ratio so low with T-Mobile. Here's how it compares to AT&T (NYSE:T) and Sprint (NYSE:S) as well as prior periods. Q2 2017 Q1 2017 Q2 2016 Verizon 1.2 1.7 1.4 AT&T 1.6 2.3 1.6 Sprint 1.3 1.6 1.2 Data source: T-Mobile quarterly earnings calls As you can see, all three carriers made improvements against T-Mobile compared to the first quarter, but compared to the same period a year ago, Verizon was the only carrier that saw improved results. That's despite Sprint's efforts to attract subscribers with free service for a year and AT&T's unlimited bundles including discounts for its TV services and HBO. It's important to note that T-Mobile is just one of Verizon's big competitors. To wit, the trend in porting ratios is only an indicator of improving results at Verizon versus all of its competitors. But considering T-Mobile is the only carrier exhibiting significant postpaid subscriber growth, it's a pretty good indicator. Things are looking better for Verizon. Cowen and Company's survey shows a long-term view of the past. Verizon has donated more customers to other carriers over the last two years. That said, Verizon has more retail customers to donate than any other carrier, so it would only make sense that it loses the most customers. Additionally, Cowen's report doesn't look at trend lines. It's important to remember to invest based on expectations for the future, not what's happened in the past. Comments from T-Mobile's management indicate Verizon is doing a better job of holding onto its subscribers than it has in the past. There are a couple of factors that show up in the cost of Verizon's new unlimited plan. While it's helped the company retain subscribers, its average revenue per user is declining. That's because the first customers to switch to unlimited are those that can save money since they're regularly hit with overage charges from using tons of data. That said, Verizon expects the downward trend in ARPU to subside in the second half of the year, as more customers move up the chain to the unlimited plan and opt to spend more. The second area where Verizon is experiencing costs is in its network. T-Mobile just released data from Ookla showing Verizon's network speeds have declined significantly since it started offering its unlimited data plan. Its peak network speeds fell below AT&T's. While T-Mobile only reported peak speeds, and may not give the full picture of network coverage and average speed, the report is nonetheless a bad indicator for Verizon. Verizon's branding is all about the quality of its network. If its unlimited data plan cuts into the quality of its network to a noticeable degree, it may not be able continue retaining subscribers at its current rate. That said, Verizon has a lot of cash and more coming in every quarter to invest in its network. ","
      
    T-Mobile's Earnings Report Had Some Good News For Verizon Investors -- The Motley Fool

Joe Tenebruso,07272017,Fool,07202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In one corner stands Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), heavyweight champ of the U.S. wireless industry with 114 million subscribers. In the other is AT&T (NYSE:T), the No. 2 ranked competitor and current challenger for Verizon's title belt. Together, these telecom giants control about two-thirds of the U.S. wireless market. They both generate robust profits and pay bountiful dividends of more than 5%. But in the battle for investors' dollars, which of these wireless titans will emerge victorious and be named the better buy today? Read on to find out. We pit AT&T against Verizon in this better buy battle. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to telecoms, competitive advantage is often determined by the strength of a company's wireless network. And while evidence suggests that the difference in network quality among the major U.S. wireless carriers is shrinking, Verizon still holds an edge over AT&T in this regard. AT&T, however, isn't just standing still. The company is competing not only on the performance of its wireless network, but also on the total value it can provide to consumers. Thanks to its $49 billion acquisition of DIRECTV in 2015, AT&T can offer its customers a bundled package of services including wireless, home phone, internet, and pay TV. In this way, AT&T is hoping that its customers see this bundle as an even greater value than the sum of its parts. And based on some customer loyalty surveys, it appears to be working. Still, Verizon's reputation for superior network quality is a valuable competitive advantage, and it gives it a slight edge over AT&T in terms of economic moat. Round 1 winner: Verizon Investors typically look to the telecom sector for two things above else: capital preservation and income generation. As such, a telecom's financial fortitude is of the upmost importance. Let's take a look at how Verizon and AT&T stack up in this regard. Metric Verizon AT&T Revenue $123.6 billion $162.6 billion EBITDA $39.7 billion $49.6 billion Net income $12.3 billion $12.6 million Free cash flow ($0.4 billion) $16.9 billion Cash $4.3 billion $14.9 billion Debt $116.5 billion $133.2 billion Data source: Morningstar. Round 2 winner: AT&T No better buy discussion should take place without a look at valuation. Let's check out some key value metrics for Verizon and AT&T, including forward and trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Metric Verizon AT&T Trailing P/E ratio 14.71 17.74 Forward P/E ratio 11.58 12.29 PEG ratio 4.77 1.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Verizon seems like the better bargain until you look at the PEG -- or price-to-earnings-to-growth -- ratio, which in my opinion is the most important out of these three metrics. The sizable variance in Verizon's and AT&T's PEG ratios is due to the fact that analysts are expecting AT&T to grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 7% over the next five years, compared to only 2.5% for Verizon. With their forward P/E ratios being pretty close, this large difference in expected growth rates results in Verizon's PEG coming in at more than 2.5 times that of AT&T. Investors' returns from this point forward will be determined by these companies' future profits -- as opposed to their trailing earnings -- so AT&T's sharply lower PEG makes it the better bargain. Round 3 winner: AT&T AT&T, in a surprise upset, takes down Verizon in this heavyweight bout. Verizon's network quality lead isn't quite what it once was, and AT&T's superior cash flow generation and better valuation outmatch anything Verizon beings into the ring. For investors seeking a high-yield stock in the telecom sector, AT&T is the better buy. ","
      
    Better Buy: AT&T Inc. vs. Verizon -- The Motley Fool

Brutal doesn't begin to describe the past year for Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) shareholders. Nothing has gone right, and the market has noticed, giving Frontier one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market today. Things are so bad, in fact, that the stock has declined by an astounding 82.2% over the past year, against a 25.5% gain in the Nasdaq Composite over the same period. FTR data by YCharts So what caused this sell-off, and are further share-price declines in store? Let's examine each question. Over the past several years, Frontier has doubled down on legacy telecom services, hoping that economies of scale by way of consolidation could help buoy its performance, even as wireless standards continue to grow in popularity. In pursuit of its goal, Frontier closed a bet-the-farm acquisition of Verizon Communications' (NYSE:VZ) legacy product customers in California, Florida, and Texas. In exchange for $10.5 billion in cash paid to Verizon, Frontier received ""3.7 million voice connections, 2.2 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video connections,"" according to the merger's February 2015 press release. The company funded that deal through a mix of debt and equity financing, but the former is particularly important, considering Frontier's current predicament. Over the years, Frontier has engaged in a series of roll-up acquisitions that helped make it one of the largest U.S. providers of legacy telecom services. Along the way, Frontier also amassed over $17 billion in debt, which lead to its current state of crisis. The company's soaring debt load has also given rise to concerns that the company may not be able to meet its interest payments. The first major repayment date is still several years off, when Frontier will need to repay $2.4 billion in principal in 2020. However, the company generated only $2.0 billion in cash from operations over the past 12 months, and that doesn't include necessary expenditures such as maintaining its network. Worse yet, the discouraging customer attrition metrics imply that Frontier will be unable to grow its cash flows as consumers continue to move away from traditional phone services in favor of wireless. Image source: Getty Images. Companies facing looming debt repayments can typically refinance those debts, pushing out their due dates. However, Frontier may not be able to secure such financing if its business metrics don't improve, which is why the company recently enacted a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at bolstering its financial profile. As part of its Q1 earnings announcement, Frontier disclosed plans to reduce its dividend by just over 60%, from $0.105 per share to $0.04, effective immediately. Management said the plan should help Frontier save $300 million annually, and it believes it can increase those savings to a run rate of $400 million annually by the end of 2018. This move will allow the company to pay down debt, with the goal of lowering Frontier's leverage ratio from 4.39 to 4.0 by the end of 2019, and eventually reaching 3.5 by the end of 2021. Assuming the company can implement the program, it should go a long way toward helping Frontier reduce its debt burden, from one that could be disastrous to one that's big but maybe not fatal. However, customer retention will also play a significant role in determining whether Frontier survives this dark chapter in its history. Here, the jury is out. Frontier claims it has weathered the worst of its subscriber churn crisis, but the company's growth strategy is predicated on further building out its fiber broadband network at the same time national telecom powers such as Verizon and AT&T  hope to bring more of their services over cellular networks. Investors should, therefore, think long and hard before trying to buy into Frontier as a contrarian turnaround investment. ","

T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported second-quarter results on July 19. The No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier delivered strong revenue and profit growth fueled by what are likely to be industry-leading customer gains. Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $10.213 billion $9.287 billion 10% Net income $581 million $225 million 158% Earnings per share $0.67 $0.25 168% Data source: T-Mobile Q2 2017 earnings release (opens PDF). T-Mobile added 1.3 million net new customers, bringing its total subscriber count to 69.6 million and extending its streak of adding more than 1 million customers to 17 consecutive quarters. T-Mobile added 817,000 total postpaid subscribers -- who pay monthly bills and are typically the most sought-after customers for wireless carriers -- during the second quarter, including 786,000 net postpaid phone customers. T-Mobile expects these figures to lead the industry for the sixth consecutive quarter -- a notable accomplishment considering that industry leader Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) finally succumbed to the pressure of customer losses and began offering unlimited data plans earlier this year. Yet while Verizon may have slowed its subscriber defections, it didn't stop them, and now it appears that it also didn't halt T-Mobile's market-share gains. T-Mobile CEO John Legere. Image Source: T-Mobile. CEO John Legere, who once again pulled no punches in his press-release statement, said that T-Mobile also gained the upper hand in network speeds after Verizon and fellow industry titan AT&T (NYSE:T) moved to match T-Mobile's unlimited data offerings. ""Our network just keeps getting better and faster while the Duopoly's networks seem to be choking after we forced them to go unlimited,"" Legere said. ""Make no mistake about it, the Un-carrier will not stop forcing change in this industry and our Q2 results are more proof that consumers are responding!"" To Legere's point, consumers do seem to be responding favorably to T-Mobile's offerings, as evidenced by both its industry-leading new-subscriber additions and its record low postpaid phone churn -- or customer defections -- which fell to 1.10%, down 17 basis points compared to the prior-year period. In all, T-Mobile's strong customer retention and subscriber growth fueled a 10% year-over-year increase in total revenue, to $10.2 billion. In turn, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and certain non-recurring items -- jumped 19%, to $3 billion. Adjusted net income surged 158%, to $581 million, or $0.67 per share. These results prompted T-Mobile to boost its full-year subscriber-growth forecast to a range of 3.0 million to 3.6 million branded postpaid net additions, up from previous estimates of 2.8 million to 3.5 million. The company also raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance to $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion from $10.4 billion to $10.8 billion. Peering out even further into the future, T-Mobile remains confident in its ability to grow its operating and free cash flow at annualized rates of 15% to 18% and 45% to 48%, respectively, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019. Legere also made some predictions during T-Mobile's earnings conference call: I predict that T-Mobile will be the only provider to grow total wireless revenues by double digits year-over-year. I predict that we'll be the only carrier to grow wireless service revenues at all year-over-year. And I predict that we will take all of the industry's postpaid phone growth again, at the same time achieving record profitability and strong free cash flow growth. While these are bold statements, T-Mobile has a history of delivering on Legere's promises. ","
      
    T-Mobile US Earnings Surge on 1.3 Million Subscriber Additions -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,07272017,Fool,07202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) bet $10.54 billion that bigger would prove to be better and that proved to be a mistake. The company spent that money buying approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) from Verizon (NYSE:VZ). That deal was supposed to give the company the scale to lower its costs, while also making it more competitive with its much-larger rivals. ""This is a transformative acquisition for Frontier that delivers first-rate assets and important new opportunities given our dramatically expanded scale,"" said CEO Daniel J. McCarthy in April 2016 when the deal closed. ""It significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" That's true, but paying $10.54 billion for subscribers you slowly lose, does not count as a good deal. Frontier has achieved over $1.25 billion in annual cost savings with another $350 million to come, but it's still losing money and its subscriber counts have fallen in all four quarters since the deal closed. Frontier has been losing subscribers and there's no reason to believe that will change. Image source: Getty Images. In recent months Frontier has slashed its quarterly dividend from $0.105 to $0.04. It did that at roughly the same time it completed a 15-1 reverse stock split. That was a needed move to avoid being delisted, but those two moves together dramatically weakened any reason investors had to hold onto their shares. McCarthy and the Frontier board of directors made the move not only to avoid delisting, but also to preserve cash. ""As you have seen, we have reduced our quarterly dividend to $0.04 per share, which will make available approximately $300 million of additional cash annually, increasing to $400 million annually in the second half of 2018,"" the CEO said. ""We'll use this to reduce debt at a faster rate, and we are now targeting a leverage ratio of 3.5 times over the next few years."" Those moves are needed because the company followed up a $133 million loss in Q4 2016 by losing $129 million in Q1 2017. McCarthy has proven to be very good at manipulating money and pushing out loan obligations to buy runway, but that won't solve the company's biggest problem, subscriber loss. As noted above Frontier has lost subscribers in every quarter it has owned the former Verizon properties. McCarthy first blamed that on problems related to the transition, then cited a lack of marketing, before most-recently saying that people not paying their bills caused a one-time drop. Whatever the reason the company lost 144,000 residential customers and 14,000 business subscribers in Q4. It then followed that by dropping another 155,000 residential customers and 18,000 business subscribers in Q1. Those losses can't be explained by cord cutting since the company has not followed the broad industry trend in losing pay-TV subscribers, it has also been losing broadband users. While McCarthy has excuses for the subscriber drop, the reality is that Frontier has lost the one edge it used to have. As a secondary provider in all its markets competing with much bigger companies, Frontier could lure people to its service with lower prices. It still uses that tactic, but it's no longer the only game in town. There are a variety of skinny digital streaming pay-TV packages that are cheaper than Frontier and the company also has to deal with consumers willing to cut the cord in favor of non-live TV services like Hulu or Netflix. Those trends are only going to accelerate with even big cable being more willing to offer more a la carte options or lower-cost bundles. That makes it very unlikely the company will reverse its subscriber trends, which will cause its losses to grow, eventually putting it in a hole too deep to climb out of no matter how clever McCarthy manages resources.

    Here's Why the Worst Is Yet to Come for Frontier Communications Corporation -- The Motley Fool

  "
Anders Bylund,07272017,Fool,07202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) fell 28% in 2016 and another 66% in the first half of 2017. The regional telecom's financial results have been a mixed bag lately, and Frontier recently slashed its dividend payments by 62%. Are shares a buy after these adjustments, or should investors still stay away from Frontier Communications stock? Let's start with a quick dividend analysis, because Frontier has been an income investor's best friend for many years. The stock's lowest yield in the last 10 years was a still-generous 4.9% in the spring of 2015, and Frontier's yields raced higher than 20% as share prices plunged in early 2017. That's where Frontier's management took action. Dividend Pay Date Payout Per Share (split-adjusted) Total Dividend Cost Cash Payout Ratio June 30, 2015 $1.575 $106 million 53% Sept. 30, 2015 $1.575 $189 million 83% Dec. 31, 2015 $1.575 $176 million 72% March 31, 2016 $1.575 $177 million 95% June 30, 2016 $1.575 $176 million 70% Sept. 30, 2016 $1.575 $178 million 106% Dec. 30, 2016 $1.575 $176 million 101% March 31, 2017 $1.575 $178 million 56% June 30, 2017 $0.60 $68 million (estimated) 28% (estimated) Data sources: Dividend.com and Frontier Communications. After holding steady at $1.575 per split-adjusted share for more than two years, Frontier's quarterly dividend was lowered to $0.60 per share in an announcement on May 2, 2017. At the same time, the company also approved a previously announced 15-for-1 reverse share split and reported disappointing first-quarter results. Share prices fell 22% over the next couple of days as investors digested the one-two punch of lower payouts and continued customer losses. Frontier CEO Dan McCarthy explained that the dividend needed to slow down in order to give Frontier more financial flexibility. ""As we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver on the full potential of our strong assets and generate additional cash flow, we will optimize our capital allocation to ensure we strike a balance between investing in the business, paying down debt and returning capital to shareholders,"" he said. So Frontier's dividend is down, and the company's cash flows have been earmarked for debt repayments rather than payout increases. Frontier's effective dividend yield remains generous due to sliding share prices, but you shouldn't expect any dividend payment boosts out of the company's management anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. McCarthy talks a good game, and promises to have his company back on solid financial ground soon enough. But Frontier often falls short of its own guidance targets and management needs to be held to its promises here. This is not made easier by the fact that Frontier is having trouble providing acceptable levels of service to its new customers in Florida, California, and Texas -- the three large markets the company acquired in a $10.5 billion deal with Verizon Communications in 2016. So I would take Dan McCarthy's rosy debt reduction talk with a grain of salt. That doesn't make dividend increases any more likely, either. In fact, it's probably a good idea to stay away from Frontier Communications stock altogether. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    Is Frontier Communications Stock a Buy? -- The Motley Fool

With the market hitting the highs it has lately, any company that is selling for any kind of discount these days should probably be viewed with a certain bit of skepticism. After all, if there is so much confidence in the overall market, then something has to be deeply flawed with these companies. As is always the case with Wall Street, many of the things that dictate share price have to do with very short timelines that may not necessarily apply to an individual looking to buy and hold a stock for several years, especially when it comes to dividend stocks. Three stocks that look incredibly cheap today that may not necessarily merit such a deep discount are Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ:ARLP), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and 8point3 Energy Partners (NASDAQ:CAFD). Here's why these high-yield stocks may be worth a spot in your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. There's no denying that coal is on its way out as an economically viable energy source. According to Lazard's levelized cost of energy study, coal is now behind natural gas, solar, and wind on a cost-per-megawatt-hour basis -- and that doesn't include the impacts of subsidies or carbon taxes. Any company looking to invest in new power-producing facilities probably isn't going to look at coal as a viable option. Just look at the scheduled capacity additions in the U.S. for 2016-2020: Though net capacity additions will total 76 gigawatts, coal's net capacity will decline by 16 gigawatts, while other power sources offset these declines. This doesn't paint a pretty picture for any coal investments, but Alliance Resource Partners is probably the one exception. The company's mines in the Illinois Basin are the lowest cost-coal source out there when you consider all the factors, such as transportation. What this means is that Alliance's coal production has an opportunity to grow, while other mine regions, such as Appalachia and the Powder River Basin, suffer even larger declines. Also, when you consider that coal is still the largest source of electric power in the U.S., there is still some time left to make money in coal. And what better way to make money in this dying industry than with a company that has an 8.5% distribution yield and a balance sheet that won't blow up in a couple of years? Alliance's low-cost coal production, its low leverage, and a management team that isn't investing a lot in new mines is the strategy you want for an investment in coal today. Even with these desirable traits, Alliance's stock has an enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio of just 2.4. That's the kind of valuation you give to a company that is on the brink of collapse. Alliance probably won't be around forever, but its stock doesn't merit a valuation that low. If you want a stock that will throw off gobs of cash over the next several years, Alliance is the company for you. We've seen this before in the telecommunications business. Wireless providers start to reach network parity as a certain technology matures, and it sparks a bit of a price war as the non-price factors diminish. This is where we are at right now when it comes to Verizon Communications. Its competitors have had time to invest in 4G network infrastructure such that the difference between networks is much smaller than when 4G first came out. So to keep customers, wireless providers have turned to offering lower-cost contracts and bringing back unlimited data plans. As a result, competitors like T-Mobile are taking market share. Here's the thing, though: We're on the cusp of wireless providers' starting to roll out 5G networks. Verizon said that it plans to roll out 5G service in 11 markets by the middle of this year. That may be just a baby step, but the $3.1 billion for Straight Path back in May gives the company loads of across-the-country spectrum that covers the 40 largest markets. Now that Verizon has the technology and the spectrum, the next thing it will need in order to deploy 5G is loads of cash flow for investing. That is one place where Verizon excels. The company's subscriber base is the largest in the nation and should provide it with the most cash to throw at deploying 5G. If it can beat all its competitors to market with a 5G network, don't be surprised if all that pricing competition falls to the wayside. When you consider this dynamic, Verizon's stock looks awfully cheap. It currently carries a dividend yield of 5.3%, and its enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 6.8 times is more than reasonable. When 8point3 Energy Partners IPOed a couple years ago, it looked like a solar yield company that made much more sense than others in the market. Having two parent organizations -- solar panel manufacturers Sunpower and First Solar -- gave some reassurance that it wouldn't get projects rammed down its throat by a single parent org just looking to grow the payout at the expense of everything else. Recently, though, both Sunpower and First Solar have announced that they are looking to sell their stakes in 8point3. Both companies seem to think that there are enough buyers out there for projects that they don't need to be involved in the development phase anymore and can focus on the manufacturing end. That may sound like a death sentence for 8point3. If it doesn't have a parent organization, then how will it be able to buy development projects? If that is the concern on Wall Street (and it appears so, as shares have a price-to-tangible-book ratio of just 1.6 times and a dividend yield of 7.2%), then it seems a bit shortsighted. One thing to consider is that it still has right of first offer on 301 megawatts of power-generating assets held by the two parent companies. If 8point3 buys all of these facilities, that's a 31% increase to the portfolio today. Also, if both parent orgs decide to cut ties, then there is nothing stopping 8point3 from buying a stake in other solar power facilities as a third-party financier. I'll admit that 8point3's accounting looks fuzzy. A lot of cash comes from minority and unconsolidated interests in projects that don't show up in revenue or earnings. However, if the reason so many people are shying away from the stock is that Sunpower and First Solar want out, then this is a steal. ","

Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) core business is thriving, with strong engagement for the company's namesake social network and its Instagram subsidiary driving impressive top- and bottom-line growth. Here's a look at how the momentum from the company's social networks translated to earnings performance last quarter: Data source: Facebook. With Facebook having since passed 2 billion monthly active users and management indicating that ad placement on the social network is near a saturation point, growth could be more difficult to deliver going forward, but the company is hardly resting on its laurels. The leader in social networking is working on initiatives that have the potential to create huge benefits for its core products and open up new business avenues down the line. Image source: Facebook. From the invention of the television through the rise of the mobile phone, the screen has been at the center of the information age, but dramatic changes for display technology could be on the horizon. Virtual reality (VR) got its first big commercial push in 2016 and currently has niche appeal, but Facebook is betting on the technology's potential and angling to play a leading role in bringing it to the mainstream. The social media giant's virtual reality push is probably the company's most well-known innovation investment, with its $3 billion acquisition of VR company Oculus generating lots of press and evidencing a clear enthusiasm for display innovation. Facebook's Oculus Rift headset has gotten off to a somewhat disappointing start, with the device receiving a number of price cuts following weaker-than-expected sales and trailing HTC's competing Vive hardware, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reiterated a belief in VR as the next big computing platform and has his company working on a range of hardware and content initiatives that could lay foundations for the future of the tech. Facebook Spaces; Image source: Facebook. The company recently launched Facebook Spaces, a platform that allows users to create an avatar to hangout and share pictures and video in virtual chat rooms. It also recently partnered with Samsung for the release of the Facebook 360 app, bringing the social network's panoramic photo and video content to the Gear VR platform. In 2016, Facebook committed a $250 million investment in VR content, and Zuckerberg has indicated that his company plans to invest an additional $3 billion over the next decade to improve VR and drive adoption. The company also has plans to develop augmented reality (AR) offerings far beyond the filters currently available on Instagram, stating in its most recent earnings call that it plans to invest aggressively in content and infrastructure to build its position in AR. These technologies have the potential to change the way the world sees and interacts with information, and, if they take off, they'll open up innovations opportunities in industries ranging from retail to healthcare. Image source: Internet.org. Facebook is working to bring free (or at least low-cost) internet to the world, a move that will dramatically expand its addressable market -- and one that could threaten internet service providers (ISPs) and wireless carriers. The company recently launched Express Wi-Fi, a partnership project with a group of ISPs in Africa and Asia to expand the reach of connectivity, and it's got even more ambitious plans in the works. Here's a Zuckerberg quote from Facebook's most recent earnings call about the progress the company is making with its internet-beaming airplane project: On the connectivity side, in April we successfully simultaneously beamed 16 gigabits of data in each direction between a location on the ground and a Cessna aircraft circling more than 7 km away. Eventually, we're going to use this technology along with Aquila, our solar-powered plane we're building, to beam internet to parts of the world that currently don't have access. The company is also working on delivering internet by satellite. Of the roughly 7.5 billion people on Earth, roughly 3.7 billion are currently connected to the internet, so expanding the reach of network connectivity presents Facebook with huge growth opportunities. Building its position in the telecommunications field gives Facebook ways to sidestep data cap and throttling issues the company faces from international ISPs as well as domestic providers including Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast -- issues that could become more pronounced as the social network makes streaming video content a bigger part of its platform. For now, Facebook's efforts are concentrated on making the internet more globally accessible, but, in the long term, growing its provider capabilities could make it significantly less dependent on today's telecom leaders. Image source: Facebook. Facebook is also aiming to shakeup the network hardware space, and has been distributing designs for ""white box"" alternatives and partnering with manufactures to make them available for enterprise. These are made with non-proprietary parts and run on open-source software, and pose a significant threat to networking companies including Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper Networks because they offer levels of flexibility and customization beyond products from the current industry leaders. They also have the potential to dramatically reduce pricing power for routing, switching, and data center. Increases in video streaming and the use of VR and AR technologies will put added pressure on data centers and increase costs for businesses. Facebook has an interest in facilitating these technologies, and reducing the expenses associated with networking hardware has the potential to remove a central roadblock to their progression. Lowering the costs of network infrastructure is also likely to play a big role in bringing internet connectivity to areas that are currently without it, so it's a disruptive initiative that could have huge payoff and pave the way for the evolution of the social network.

    Beyond the Social Network: Facebook Wants to Disrupt These 3 Industries -- The Motley Fool

,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"After posting surprising losses among cellphone subscribers earlier this year, Verizon is back. The wireless carrier said Thursday that it has added 358,000 phone subscribers over the past several months, blowing analyst expectations out of the water and showing that its unlimited data plans are helping to keep customers loyal. The increase highlights a big turnaround from Verizon's last earnings report, which for the first time saw the company losing wireless customers faster than it could replace them. Those alarming results could have grown even worse without the release of Verizon's unlimited data plan, analysts said, which helped slow some of the losses. At the time, Verizon said it had lost nearly 400,000 phone subscribers early in the quarter, but it managed to pare those defections back to 289,000 with the introduction of unlimited data. [Why it took more than a week to resolve the Verizon data leak] Fast forward to today, and Verizon not only appears to have reversed the trend but is growing again. Much of that is attributable to record-low levels of customers leaving the network, said chief financial officer Matt Ellis. “That's certainly contributed to the net adds,” Ellis said on an investor call Thursday, “and showed that once we had a comparable offer out there … even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high quality network experience we deliver.” Verizon's strong report came a day after the market research firm RootMetrics called the company's network the best in the nation, saying that the popularity of unlimited data plans has not hurt network performance. Verizon had historically resisted unlimited data, arguing that customers did not need or want the option. But the company's tune changed as rivals such as T-Mobile began making strides with unlimited plans of their own. Thanks in part to unlimited data, customers across the wireless industry have remained remarkably loyal to their carriers — despite a promotional move by Sprint to offer a free year of service, Walt Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG, said in a research note Thursday.

                                   an expensive move that was shot down by Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam. While Verizon’s wireless business is seeing customers jump ship, wireless remains roughly 70% of the company’s revenue, according to Morningstar analyst Petra Vacval. Verizon is still very much reliant on wireless. “Trying to pivot a tanker doesn’t happen in a quarter,” Vacval said. “Yes you’ve seen the customer declines and the stock has been beaten up, but this is a huge company with really good margins, so it’s not like they need to do something tomorrow.” Verizon is set to report earnings for the second quarter before the market opens on Thursday. Here’s what investors can expect: Earnings: Verizon is expected to report earnings of 96 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. That would be a slight improvement compared with the 94 cents the company reported during the same quarter a year ago, and the 95 cents per share reported for the first quarter. Verizon has beaten or met FactSet consensus estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters. Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from sell-side and buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, executives, academics and others, also expects Verizon to post earnings of 96 cents per share. Revenue: Analysts polled by FactSet expect revenue for the quarter to hit $29.86 billion, down more than 2% compared with the year-earlier period and less than 1% from the first quarter. Verizon has missed FactSet consensus in six of the last 10 quarters. Estimize is expecting Verizon revenue to hit $29.89 billion. Share price: Analysts tracking the stock have an average 12-month target of $49.08, according to FactSet, which would represent about a 12% premium to current trading levels. Analysts also rate Verizon a hold, on average. Shares of Verizon are down nearly 18% in the year to date and more than 21% in the trailing 12-month period.

Austen Hufford,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 27, 2017 6:12 a.m. ET By Comcast Corp.'s entertainment unit surged in the second quarter, helped by the strong box-office performance of ""The Fate of the Furious,"" lifting profit and revenue even as cable video subscriber losses ticked up. At the NBCUniversal media division, revenue rose 17% to $8.33 billion. Revenue in the filmed entertainment division jumped 60%, thanks to the latest installment of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise. The cable networks and broadcast TV units grew revenue and earnings due to increases in subscription fees from pay TV providers, but both also saw a decline in ad sales because of ratings softness. Cable networks' ad revenues declined 0.9% to $906 million, while broadcast TV ad revenue declined 1.2% to $1.27 billion. In the cable business, the company lost 34,000 residential and business video customers, compared with a loss of 4,000 in the same quarter last year. Comcast has generally managed to withstand the turmoil in cable TV from cord-cutting better than some peers in pay television. In a tough environment, with consumers gravitating to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Sling TV, the company has added net video subscribers in five of the past seven quarters. The cord-cutting has taken a toll on TV ratings, however, for NBCUniversal's channels just like those of many other media companies. Comcast and industry analysts point to its investment in X1, a cloud-based, set-top box system, as a reason its video business has held up. The company said that 55% of its residential video customers now have X1, up from nearly 40% in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase. Comcast added 175,000 total internet customers in the second quarter, down from 220,000 in the year-earlier period. Total revenue per customer relationship, Comcast's unit revenue figure for its cable division, increased 2.2% to $151.19. Comcast lost 22,000 voice customers in the quarter, compared with an addition of 64,000 in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue for Comcast's cable division, which makes up 61% of revenue, rose 5.5% to $13.12 billion. Comcast recently launched a new wireless service, aimed at adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already. The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with Verizon Communications to offer its service. Comcast, along fellow cable provider Charter Communications Inc., has explored a deal with Sprint Corp. that could provide an alternative reseller arrangement, potentially with better terms, people familiar with the matter have said. Comcast has signaled that it views the wireless service as an add-on for its customers, aimed at increasing profits and reducing the percentage of customers leaving its service. In all, net income rose to $2.51 billion, or 52 cents a share, up from about $2.03 billion, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue grew 9.8% to $21.17 billion. Revenue and profit exceeded estimates from analysts, who were projecting earnings of 48 cents a share on $20.86 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Write to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com Comcast Corp.'s entertainment unit surged in the second quarter, helped by the strong box-office performance of ""The Fate of the Furious,"" lifting profit and revenue even as cable video subscriber losses ticked up. At the NBCUniversal media division, revenue rose 17% to $8.33 billion. Revenue in the filmed entertainment division jumped 60%, thanks to the latest installment of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise. The cable networks and broadcast TV units grew revenue and earnings due to increases in subscription fees from pay TV providers, but both also saw a decline in ad sales because of ratings softness. Cable networks' ad revenues declined 0.9% to $906 million, while broadcast TV ad revenue declined 1.2% to $1.27 billion. In the cable business, the company lost 34,000 residential and business video customers, compared with a loss of 4,000 in the same quarter last year. Comcast has generally managed to withstand the turmoil in cable TV from cord-cutting better than some peers in pay television. In a tough environment, with consumers gravitating to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Sling TV, the company has added net video subscribers in five of the past seven quarters. The cord-cutting has taken a toll on TV ratings, however, for NBCUniversal's channels just like those of many other media companies. Comcast and industry analysts point to its investment in X1, a cloud-based, set-top box system, as a reason its video business has held up. The company said that 55% of its residential video customers now have X1, up from nearly 40% in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase. Comcast added 175,000 total internet customers in the second quarter, down from 220,000 in the year-earlier period. Total revenue per customer relationship, Comcast's unit revenue figure for its cable division, increased 2.2% to $151.19. Comcast lost 22,000 voice customers in the quarter, compared with an addition of 64,000 in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue for Comcast's cable division, which makes up 61% of revenue, rose 5.5% to $13.12 billion. Comcast recently launched a new wireless service, aimed at adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already. The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with Verizon Communications to offer its service. Comcast, along fellow cable provider Charter Communications Inc., has explored a deal with Sprint Corp. that could provide an alternative reseller arrangement, potentially with better terms, people familiar with the matter have said.

Michael Brush,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 20, 2017 4:54 p.m. ET Five areas of the global market will benefit from a weak greenback By Republicans tripped up the U.S. dollar this week by failing to make progress on replacing Obamacare. This hurt the greenback by casting doubts on other reforms promised by President Donald Trump — including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Big picture, the GOP’s Obamacare setback is really only part of the problem for the dollar. Even if politicians miraculously get their act together (don't hold your breath) the dollar is still in for trouble. In fact, it's been weak all year for reasons that have little to do with Washington, D.C. — and those issues aren't going away soon. Indeed these challenges could bring a surprise breakdown in the dollar later this year, forcing investors to make some painful portfolio adjustments, says Jim Paulsen chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. Below, I offer a five-step plan on how to position your own portfolio now, to profit from the moves others will have to make later as dollar weakens further. But first, here are the three main reasons this unexpected dollar weakness will play out. 1: A global recovery is bidding up the value of other currencies For most of the recovery since 2009, U.S. growth has outpaced foreign growth. That made the dollar more attractive. People had to buy it to get access to more favorable U.S. growth. Nowadays, though, about two thirds of foreign economies are growing faster than the U.S. Europe is a good example. ""The economy is growing well above its potential, and while full employment is still a ways off, it now seems very achievable,"" says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. Meanwhile, growth in China has stabilized, erasing fears about a potential meltdown there. And many emerging markets are back on track. All of this means investment dollars are flowing out of U.S. assets into foreign countries. This, of course, puts downward pressure on the dollar and drives up foreign currencies. The trend is likely to persist. Leading economic indicators suggest foreign economies will continue to do well relative to the U.S. 2: Foreign bonds are becoming more attractive For much of the recovery, U.S. government bond yields were more attractive than foreign bond yields. But now, as foreign economies strengthen, that's changing. ""For the first time in more than five years, foreign bond yields are finally becoming more competitive relative to U.S. yield offerings,"" Paulsen says. This, too, is channeling money out of the U.S. and into foreign countries, driving up their currencies relative to the dollar. 3: U.S. inflation will heat up Many pundits think the greenback will hang in there because the Fed is hiking interest rates. This will entice foreign investors to buy dollars to get access to those higher yields, according to this theory. But to really understand what is going on here and what it means for the dollar, you have to consider why the Fed is hiking rates. And that spells trouble for the dollar. The Fed is raising rates because it sees signs of higher inflation. It wants raise rates to fulfill one of its two mandates — controlling inflation. To anyone owning dollars, inflation is bad news. It means they'll have less purchasing power. So they naturally sell greenbacks. Indeed, history is replete with evidence that the dollar weakens when inflation rises. The best example: High inflation during the 1970s hammered the dollar. Don't make the mistake of being lulled by the June inflation slowdown. That was probably caused by one-off events. One was the sharp decline in cell-phone prices linked to the rising popularity of unlimited plans. Another was measurement problems related to changes in how doctors report their fees to government statisticians, Zandi says. ""The Fed continues to downplay the recent drop in core inflation,” agrees Barclays economist  Blerina Uruçi. Leuthold’s Paulsen thinks tight labor markets will soon push wage inflation above 3%, and this will boost consumer prices as people buy more stuff. ""We expect inflation anxieties to worsen in the second half of this year,"" he says. If inflation suppresses the dollar, as it normally does, matters will get worse. A weaker dollar bids up commodity prices. This leads to more inflation. And this erodes the dollar even more. Partly because of this feedback loop, a breakdown in the dollar could push wage and consumer price inflation to 3%-4%, says Paulsen, which would shock a lot of people. A key factor to watch: Any move in the dollar below its current trading range. Since early 2015, the U.S. Dollar Index

If it breaks out of that range to the downside, it will wake up a lot of investors to the potential for more dollar weakness. They'll scramble to adjust their portfolios. What to buy now: Here's what you can do now to benefit as investors make necessary changes to adapt to this new investing climate. Paulsen provided guidance on the themes below, and I've filled in suggestions on specific stocks and exchange traded funds. 1. Buy commodities: A weaker dollar pushes up commodity prices. So buying them now makes sense.

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"There has been a flurry of dealmaking for fiber assets, as growing demand from U.S. businesses for data transmission has fueled a revival in fiber optic services and is pushing large telecommunication companies to bulk up in fiber. No deal between WideOpenWest and Verizon is certain and negotiations could still fall apart, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Another buyer could still emerge for the asset, the sources added. WideOpenWest, which has market capitalization of around $1.4 billion and went public in May, is working with a financial adviser to explore a sale of the unit, the people said. WideOpenWest did not respond to a request for comment. Verizon declined to comment. Since 2014, WideOpenWest has built about 1,200 miles of fiber in the Chicago market for a “leading wireless carrier,” according to a corporate filing. The sources identified this carrier as Verizon. Verizon uses WideOpenWest’s fiber system in Chicago for backhaul, which is the data transfer of mobile traffic over wired lines, according to the sources. While it is under a long-term contract with the wireless carrier, WideOpenWest had said it expected it would find more business customers to use the fiber. Verizon reported quarterly revenue that topped analyst expectations on Thursday, adding 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers.. ","

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported quarterly revenue that topped expectations on Thursday as the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier attracted more subscribers with its unlimited data plan. Shares jumped 3.6 percent to $46.01 in premarket trading. In the quarter, Verizon added 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers, compared to an increase of 615,000 in the year-earlier period. The additions were higher than the JPMorgan estimate of 115,000 and consensus expectations of 70,000, JPMorgan analysts said in a research note on Thursday. Verizon has been competing for customers with smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp in a saturated U.S. market for wireless service as most consumers already have cell phones. In February, Verizon reintroduced an unlimited data plan for the first time in more than five years. Since then, other carriers have launched aggressive promotions. Sprint said in June that it was offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year to consumers who bring their own devices in a promotion aimed at Verizon subscribers. The company added 358,000 phone-only subscribers, compared with 86,000 net additions a year ago. Verizon’s unlimited plan, priced at $80 a month for a single line, is more expensive than competing plans. Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said Thursday’s post-earnings conference call that “even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver.” Churn, or the rate of customer defections for subscribers paying a monthly bill, was flat at 0.94 percent from the year-earlier period, and lower than analysts’ estimates of 1.1 percent, according to JPMorgan. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, called the subscriber numbers “very strong,” but added that “we remain cautious on Verizon equity given what we regard as unsustainable margins and returns in a competitive market.” Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.36 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the second quarter, from $702 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 96 cents per share. Total operating revenue edged up to $30.55 billion from $30.53 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents on revenue of $29.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The latest quarter included a gain from the sale of data centers and lower expenses. Earnings in the year-earlier period were also hurt by a strike in the wireline business. ","

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Charter Communications Inc said on Sunday it was not interested in acquiring U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp, leaving the latter’s majority owner, SoftBank Group Corp, pondering how to orchestrate a merger. A merger of Charter and Sprint would create a telecommunications powerhouse, providing a one-stop shop for customers looking for internet and mobile phone services, and giving the combined company a stronger footing in creating the infrastructure required for so-called 5G wireless technology. SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is considering making an acquisition offer for Charter, which has a market capitalization of $101 billion and another $60 billion in debt, as early as this week, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday, in what would be by far the Japanese telecommunications conglomerate’s biggest ever deal. SoftBank remains interested in merging Sprint with T-Mobile US Inc, another U.S. wireless carrier controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG, with which Sprint held deal negotiations earlier this year, the source added. The source asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. SoftBank declined to comment. “We understand why a deal is attractive for SoftBank, but Charter has no interest in acquiring Sprint,” a Charter spokesman said in an emailed statement on Sunday. He declined to comment on whether Charter would entertain a bid from SoftBank and at what price. Sprint and T-Mobile could not be immediately reached for comment. SoftBank’s potential bid for Charter would follow the conclusion of two months of negotiations with Charter and larger cable peer Comcast Corp over Sprint potentially serving as their mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), allowing them to use its network to offer wireless services. “We have a very good MVNO relationship with Verizon Communications Inc and intend to launch wireless services to cable customers next year,” the Charter spokesman said. SoftBank’s interest in Charter also shows it is looking for alternatives to strengthen its negotiating hand in Sprint’s negotiations with T-Mobile, analysts said. “This could be a way to gain leverage in a T-Mobile deal,”  Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said of Son’s pursuit of Charter on Sunday. To be sure, a bid for Charter by SoftBank, which has a market capitalization of 9.9 trillion yen ($90.3 billion), would be a stretch for its finances, given that it would likely be without the deployment of the $100 billion technology-focused investment fund called Vision Fund it raised this year. Sprint’s market capitalization is just $32.8 billion, and it has a similar amount in debt. A bid for Charter that would give SoftBank majority control in a deal would require raising tens of billions of dollars in new debt and could push SoftBank to leverage some of its other assets, including its 29.5 percent stake in Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and its 43 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp. SoftBank shares were trading down 2.7 percent at 8,920 yen on Monday morning in Tokyo. Another hurdle for SoftBank would be the price expectations of Charter’s largest shareholder, John Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp. Charter’s proxy statement to its shareholders in March showed that CEO Tom Rutledge has compensation incentives to take Charter’s share price to more than $564. Charter shares ended trading on Friday at $370.26. What is more, were Charter to agree to a merger with Sprint, it would need the blessing of Comcast. Charter and Comcast announced an agreement in May that bars either company from entering into a material transaction in wireless for a year without the other’s consent. Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, also expressed interest in a takeover of Charter earlier this year, sources have said. Verizon, which has a healthier network than Sprint, has MVNO agreements in place with both Charter and Comcast, which are rolling out wireless plans for their customers using the Verizon partnership. Three years ago, SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T-Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators. That deal would have put SoftBank in control of the merged company, with Deutsche Telekom becoming a minority shareholder. T-Mobile was worth around $30 billion at the time, but its market value has since risen to more than $50 billion as it overtook Sprint as the No. 3 wireless carrier by subscribers. While Sprint’s customer base has also grown under CEO Marcelo Claure and financials have improved, the growth was primarily driven by heavy price discounts. Despite new investment, the company’s network is still viewed by many consumers as weaker than its rivals. Unless Sprint can clinch a merger with a peer, these investment requirements are set to become more pressing. Carriers will need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade to 5G networks that promise to be 10 times to 100 times faster than current speeds. ","

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) SINGAPORE, August 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Singapore Telecommunications Limited's (Singtel) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs), as well as its senior unsecured rating, at 'A+'. The agency has also affirmed at 'A' the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR and senior unsecured rating of Singtel's wholly owned subsidiary, Singtel Optus Pty Limited (Optus). The Outlook on the IDRs is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Low Rating Headroom: The Stable Outlook reflects our expectation that Singtel can maintain FFO adjusted net leverage below 2.0x - the level at which Fitch would consider negative rating action - for the financial year ending March 2019 (FY19) and FY20, particularly if the company uses the SGD2.3 billion proceeds from NetLink NBN Trust's IPO for its investment needs and debt reduction. Singtel faces significant capex needs and spectrum payments in the current fiscal year amid slowing growth in Singapore and Australia. Singtel will have limited headroom under its ratings, although the Netlink IPO proceeds provide some flexibility. Singtel has yet to confirm how it will use the Netlink IPO proceeds. We may consider negative rating action if the company choose to increase shareholder returns, rather than use the proceeds to reduce debt and fund critical investment needs, which will indicate a more aggressive policy for its capital structure. Slow Organic Growth: Singtel's FFO growth is likely to remain weak in view of the increasing competitive pressures and the continued EBITDA losses in its digital life (DL) business operations. Competition in Singapore and Australia will intensify with TPG Telecom's entry as the fourth mobile network operator in Singapore, although large investments undertaken in these markets and improvement in the financial performance of its DL businesses should support cash generation. Singtel's credit profile also benefits from its diversified cash flows, which include a steady stream of dividends from its associates. Including dividends from associates, the overseas operations of Singtel account for two-thirds of the group's adjusted operating EBITDA. Singtel has a substantial investment in its 36.5%-associate Bharti Airtel Limited (BBB-/Stable), but the Indian telco provides very little dividend contribution to Singtel due to its large capex requirements and the stiff competition it faces. High Capex, Spectrum Fees: Singtel continues to face heavy capex burden in the next two years to drive its mobile operations. It expects to spend SGD2.4 billion in cash capex and another SGD1.0 billion in spectrum payments in Singapore and Australia in FY18. Singtel will undertake network expansion in its regional 4G coverage in Australia and multi-year investments in new unified billing and customer care systems. Fitch forecasts the company's pre-dividend FCF margin to remain in the mid-teens over the medium term (FY17: 15%). M&A Risk, Financial Flexibility: Fitch believes Singtel will continue to undertake acquisitions, if suitable opportunities arise. However, we will treat any M&A as event risk, and will evaluate the impact of any acquisitions on Singtel's credit profile based on cost, incremental cash generation and funding mix. Singtel's other non-core assets including its minority stakes in Singapore Post and Southern Cross, could provide additional funding flexibility if these are monetised; however, we have not included these as sources of cash in our analysis of Singtel's credit profile. Notching for Parental Support: Singtel's 'A+' ratings factor in one notch of support above its standalone ratings to reflect Singapore's (AAA/Stable) majority state ownership (52% at end-March 2017) through Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (Temasek). Singtel is Temasek's largest investment, accounting for about 12% of total investment value of SGD275 billion at end-March 2017. Strong Regional Play: Singtel's standalone credit profile of 'A' reflects its diversified income stream through its solid market position in Singapore, number two market position in Australia through Optus, and leading market positions in Indonesia, India, the Philippines and Thailand through associates. Singtel expects major associates to contribute SGD1.4 billion in cash dividends in FY18, as the inclusion of dividends from Intouch Holdings Public Company offset the expected lower payout from Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited (AIS, BBB+/Stable). Singtel acquired a 21% stake in Intouch, the Thailand-based parent of AIS, in 2016. Strong Optus-Singtel Link: The strong linkage between Optus and Singtel leads to an equalisation of Optus's rating with Singtel's standalone credit profile of 'A'. Singtel owns 100% of Optus and maintains full control through the board. Fitch expects Optus's EBITDA and revenue to grow at only a low single-digit rate in FY18, given higher opex and intense competition. DERIVATION SUMMARY Singtel's 'A+' ratings include a one-notch uplift above its standalone ratings to reflect Singapore's majority state ownership, in line with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. Singtel is also Temasek's single largest investment. The uplift for state support is consistent with that of China Telecom Corporation Limited (CTCL; A+/Stable, standalone profile: A), which is majority owned by the state and is strategically important due to its nationwide fixed-line infrastructure. The uplift is, however, limited to one-notch, compared with Singapore Power Limited's (AA-/Stable) two-notch uplift, as Temasek owns 100% of the utility and has extended tangible support to it previously. On a standalone basis, Singtel's credit profile is well-positioned relative to Asian telecom peers, such as CTCL and KT Corporation (A-/Stable), in terms of its regional scale, cash flow diversification and mid-teens pre-dividend FCF margin. Singtel's FFO adjusted net leverage of around 2.0x is in line with that of CTCL but lower than the 3.0x-3.5x of Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable) and AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative). Meanwhile, Optus's rating is equalised with Singtel's standalone credit profile of 'A', given the strong linkage between the two entities. Optus's standalone credit profile is positioned in between that of KT Corporation and Telekom Malaysia Berhad (A-Stable; standalone profile: BBB+). KT is less leveraged at FFO adjusted net leverage of below 1.5x and its EBITDA is twice as large as Optus's, which offset its thinner EBITDA margins of 22%. Meanwhile, Telekom Malaysia operates at a similar net leverage of 2.3x-2.5x as Optus, and benefits from its market dominance and lower competitive pressures in the fixed-line market. Nevertheless, Optus has both strong mobile and fixed-line broadband offerings. No country-ceiling or operating environment aspects impact the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Group revenue growth of mid-single-digits in FY18 following the Turn acquisition in April 2017, then moderating to low-single-digit percentages over the medium term - Operating EBITDAR margin to remain stable at around 30% (FY17: 31%) in FY18-FY20, reflecting higher contributions from lower-margin group enterprise revenues and stiffer telecom competition in Singapore and Australia - DL's EBITDA losses to narrow to around SGD100 million in FY18 (FY17: SGD122 million), and the division to break even in EBITDA in FY21 - Stable dividends from associates of SGD1.5 billion-1.6 billion in FY18-FY20 - Annual cash capex of SGD3.4 billion in FY18 (FY17: SGD2.5 billion), including SGD1.0 billion spectrum fees. Cash capex to reduce to SGD2.1 billion-2.4 billion in FY19-FY20 - SGD2.3 billion proceeds from divestment of Singtel's stake in NetLink in FY18 - No major debt-funded M&A or asset sales - No significant increase in shareholder distribution with annual dividend payments of SGD2.8 billion-2.9 billion, translating to 73% payout ratio (FY17: 73%), which is in line with Singtel's stated policy of 60%-75% of underlying profit. RATING SENSITIVITIES Singtel Positive: There is limited upside potential for Singtel's rating in the short to medium term, although developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - FFO-adjusted net leverage falling below 1.0x (FY17: 2.2x), with positive post-dividend FCF on a sustained basis, provided the linkages with the state also remain unchanged. - Strengthening of linkages between Singtel and the state, which would arise from stronger tangible support to Singtel from Temasek Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Failure to reduce FFO-adjusted net leverage below 2.0x and/or raise FFO fixed-charge coverage above 7.0x (FY17: 7.6x) on a sustained basis, or if Singtel were to demonstrate a lack of commitment to improve its financial profile - as indicated by a more aggressive shareholder return policy - Weakening of ties between Temasek and Singtel Optus Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Upgrade of Singtel's standalone credit profile, provided that the linkages between Optus and Singtel remain intact - Emergence of significant legal linkages between the two entities (from debt guarantees from Singtel or cross-default provisions that link the two entities, for example) which may lead us to link Optus' rating to Singtel's IDR instead of Singtel's standalone profile. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Downgrade of Singtel's standalone ratings or a weakening of the linkages between Singtel and Optus. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Singtel has SGD3.1 billion of debt due in the next 12 months. However, its liquidity is adequate due to its strong access to capital markets and banks, which is underpinned by its regional market reach, robust financial position and as an entity linked to the Singapore state. In addition, the company had an unrestricted cash balance of SGD534 million at end-March 2017 and undrawn committed bank facilities to tap.

(AABA), the remnants of Yahoo after its sale of its core internet assets to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), is buying back as much as $5 billion in shares. (See more: What Is Altaba Anyway?) In an announcement, the company, which in essence is a holding company for large stakes in Chinese ecommerce​ giant Alibaba Group (BABA) and Yahoo Japan, said the board approved the share repurchase program as part of its efforts to return cash to its investors. In June, it disclosed it bought back around 64.5 million shares or about 6.7% of the outstanding shares. ""We have consistently stated that it is our intent to return substantially all of our cash to shareholders over time (of course retaining what we need to cover liabilities and operate the Fund)—and with this action, we state it again today, clearly,"" said Thomas J. McInerney, chief executive officer of Altaba in a prepared statement. Altaba said that when it purchases the shares will depend on the market conditions and supersedes the existing buyback programs authorized in March 2015 when it was  operating as Yahoo. Recently, shares of the company were trading 0.19% higher or $0.11 a share to $58.51. In late June, the stock reached a high of $60.22 shortly after it started trading under its new ticker. (See more: Altaba Stock Breaks Out After Verizon Sale.) Altaba’s shares have had bumpy ride as investors try to figure out what the new company is all about. One of the most attractive aspects of it is its 15% stake in Alibaba, which, according to media reports is valued at around $341 billion. While the former Yahoo basically looks like a holding company for a stake in the Chinese retailer, it warned in a regulatory filing last year that Alibaba could get hit with a massive tax bill of as much as 36.5% if it tried to buy back the shares. As a result, Altaba’s stock will likely rise as shares of Alibaba do, which is the case being made by JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth, who initiated coverage in late June with overweight rating and a $65 price target. According to a media report covering the action, Anmuth said that every 10% increase in Alibaba’s value means a 7% increase in Altaba’s net asset value. With a $65 price target, the analyst thinks shares can increase more than 10%. Altaba’s stake in Yahoo Japan is valued at $7.7 billion. The company also has $12 billion in cash and marketable debts, $130 million in minority investments including in Snap Inc. (SNAP) and a $740 million stake in Excalibur, which is a unit of the new company that holds patents of Yahoo that were not sold to Verizon.

Rani Molla,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"Unlimited data plans are slowing down mobile speeds for Verizon and AT&T customers, according to  data released today by mobile network measurement company OpenSignal. Verizon and AT&T reinstated their unlimited plans in February to compete with T-Mobile and Sprint, which have long offered unlimited data plans, and have since seen a deluge of demand. Greater data demand — either more data usage or more customers — means slower speeds. Think of it as increased traffic on a highway. Verizon and AT&T also have  nearly double the subscribers of T-Mobile and Sprint, so changes in their offerings hit their networks harder. More from Recode: 500 Startups surveys the early wreckage of a sexual harassment scandalFacebook says changes to how it hires are making the company more diverseFacebook's latest News Feed change could push more publishers to Instant Articles Carriers have long supported greater leeway to manage their networks as part of the U.S. government's fierce debate over net neutrality. T-Mobile's unlimited plan  often limits video streaming quality in a bid to ease the burden on its network; others like Verizon recently have tested similar tools to improve speeds. To staunch advocates of open internet rules, however, these techniques  violate the spirit of federal safeguards meant to ensure all web traffic is treated equally. Both Verizon and AT&T saw a notable decline in speeds after introducing unlimited plans. T-Mobile and Sprint have been able to gradually account for the increase in data demand, so their speeds weren't negatively affected this year — indeed, they both got faster since OpenSignal's February report. U.S. mobile speeds are generally  slower than other developed countries. Verizon and T-Mobile were basically tied for speeds at the beginning of this year. Now, T-Mobile has taken the lead with an average LTE download speed of 17.5 Mbps, compared with Verizon's 14.9 Mbps. Unsurprisingly, unlimited data plans are very popular, as consumers spend more time and complete more activities on their phones.  Ericsson expects typical North American smartphone users to blow through 25 GB of data a month in 2022, up from 5 GB in 2016, making unlimited data plans even more appealing. For this report, OpenSignal collected over five billion measurements from 172,919 U.S. smartphones during the month of June with its signal mapping app. ",Verizon and AT&T customers have slower speeds because unlimited data

Amazon wants to add tens of thousands of employees to its ranks while Google is donating millions of dollars to training. Touting such plans is partly a response to fears that tech will, like trade, be blamed for killing jobs as automation and artificial intelligence take hold. Trade became a surprise target during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, symbolizing globalization run amok for both political parties. Trump backed out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership shortly after taking office and has threatened to pull out of NAFTA.

Shares of  Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) popped on Thursday morning, trading 6.5% higher as of 11:15 a.m. EDT. The fuel for this fire came from Verizon's second-quarter earnings report, which it posted before the opening bell. Verizon's revenue held flat year over year at $35.6 billion, while adjusted earnings per share rose from $0.94 to $0.96. The bottom-line result landed right where with Wall Street had expected it to, but the sales result was a modestly positive surprise. More importantly, Verizon added 590,000 net new subscribers in the all-important postpaid smartphones category. Retail postpaid phone churn landed below 0.9% per month for the ninth consecutive quarter, setting an all-time low in the LTE era at 0.7%. Low churn equals loyal customers, so that's great news for Verizon and its investors. Image source: Getty Images. This rosy report put a decisive stop to Verizon's recent share price slide, but the stock is still trading roughly 12% lower year to date. Management gave credit for these solid results to the February launch of all-new unlimited wireless data plans. Looking ahead, Verizon simply reaffirmed its view that full-year results in 2017 should stay close to the figures posted in 2016 on both the top and bottom lines. All things considered, Big Red earned this reprieve from share price pressures and today's market reaction makes perfect sense.

Adam Levy,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) blew away expectations with its second-quarter earnings report. Not only did it post a big beat on the top line, but it also showed investors that its unlimited data plan is working to attract subscribers. Verizon added 358,000 postpaid phone subscribers last quarter, well above analysts' expectations. That picks up where Verizon left off in the first quarter. While the company lost 289,000 postpaid phone subscribers during the first three months of the year, management said it would have lost much more without introducing its unlimited plan in February. Now investors are asking whether the momentum is sustainable. Image source: Verizon. Verizon posted a record low churn level for its postpaid phone subscribers in the LTE era. Just 0.7% of phone subscribers left for a competitor last quarter. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) gave a good indication that Verizon would post a good churn number when it reported very low porting ratios with Verizon with its earnings report. Management says its ability to retain subscribers is directly a result of its unlimited data plan. At $80 per month for a single line (and discounts as you add more lines), Verizon's pricing is competitive, but still a slight premium to most of its competitors. The only provider with higher pricing is AT&T (NYSE:T), but its $90-per-month plan includes additional incentives like a $25 discount on TV service and free HBO. Verizon says its ability to retain customers shows people are willing to pay more for a comparable plan on a superior network. Indeed, Verizon's network and brand are two of its biggest competitive advantages. Those advantages shined through later in the quarter as competitors started offering significant switching incentives, including Sprint's (NYSE:S) offer of a free year of unlimited data service. But Verizon's performance in the back end of the quarter was consistent with the first part, according to management. Of course, retaining subscribers is only half the battle. In order to grow, Verizon had to attract new subscribers. Importantly, it didn't have to resort to expensive customer acquisition promotions like Sprint or AT&T. That's a strong indication that many subscribers were simply avoiding Verizon until it offered a simple unlimited plan like its competitors. It's another testament to the company's brand strength. Adding new subscribers to its unlimited plan is key for Verizon, which has seen its service revenue take a hit with the release of the new option. The early adopters of the plan were existing customers that realized they could save money by switching. Combined with other service revenue headwinds like the switch to equipment installment plans, Verizon's service revenue fell nearly 7% year over year. Adding new subscribers at the higher-than-average unlimited plan pricing should help start turning things around for Verizon. Indeed, management indicated its belief that service revenue has bottomed and will start to turn around in the second half of the year. Management expects the decline in service revenue to come in below 4% by the fourth quarter. As comparable quarters get easier, investors should see service revenue return to growth sometime next year, and operating margin should improve along with it. The wireless industry is extremely competitive, and Verizon has the most to lose. Verizon's ability to sustain the success it saw in the last two quarters is imperative. To that end, management is extremely optimistic. ""We absolutely think the trend on unlimited is sustainable,"" CFO Matt Ellis said on the second-quarter earnings call. ""Once we gave customers that clear and comparable offer, we see the value of our network and our offering compared to what else is in the marketplace."" There are a lot of things working in Verizon's favor for the near future. AT&T's focus is split in favor of its entertainment business, appealing to a shrinking crowd of pay-TV subscribers. Sprint is desperate for help, and looking for it wherever it can get it. T-Mobile is even showing signs of net addition slow downs, and it recently took steps to raise its prices, indicating a bigger focus on generating meaningful cash flow instead of stealing away customers. As long as Verizon focuses on keeping its industry-leading network at the top of the charts and maintaining the strength of its brand, it should be able to win back a lot of customers with its unlimited plan. Over time, that should translate into improved service revenue and higher operating margin as well. ","
      
    How Verizon Added 358,000 New Phone Subscribers Last Quarter -- The Motley Fool

Brian Stoffel,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. You could be forgiven for thinking this is an odd pairing. What's the point in comparing the stocks of a major communications company like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) with the world's leading provider of sugary, carbonated drinks -- in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)? The answer is simple: Given each one's size and stability, they are both popular picks for retirement portfolios. Indeed, each is currently offering dividend yields north of 3%, making them enticing picks in our current low-rate environment. Image source: Getty Images. But which is the better buy today? That's a very difficult question to answer, especially because they're in such different industries. That said, we're going to examine each through three different lenses, in an attempt to figure out which is the better deal. Here's how they stack up. For true long-term investors, there's nothing more important than a company's sustainable competitive advantage -- often referred to as a ""moat."" In Verizon and Coke, we have stalwarts with relatively wide moats, though both are currently shrinking. The problem, however, is that the powerhouse Coke brands have been receding for years. In fact, soda drinking in the United States peaked over a decade ago and recorded its 11th  straight year of declines in 2016. As America and the world become more health-conscious, they are turning away from traditional Coke products. Verizon, on the other hand, benefits from the size and quality of its network, as well as sky-high barriers to entry. According to Statista, the top four wireless providers control over 95% of the market in the United States, with Verizon coming in first with a 35% share. Verizon is also branching out of being ""just"" a communications company by acquiring content owners and providers, such as parts of Yahoo! and AOL. While the company has been pressured lately by no-contract plans from rivals, it still holds the top-dog status, and it's in an industry likely to stay relevant for the foreseeable future. As I mentioned at the outset, investors are primarily interested in dividends when they purchase shares of these two. So while it makes sense to want all of the cash coming in to go out in the form of dividends, there's something to say for keeping a nice pile of cash on hand. That's because every company, at one point or another, will face difficult economic times. Whether macro or company-specific in nature, those that enter these periods with cash will have options -- buy back shares on the cheap, acquire weaker competitors, or outspend rivals into oblivion -- and likely emerge stronger than before. Keeping in mind that Coke is valued at a 7% premium to Verizon by market cap, here's how the two stack up. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $5.4 billion $113 billion $12.3 billion ($0.126 billion) Coke $43 billion $32 billion $6.2 billion $6.8 billion Data sources: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. Here we have a pretty clear winner. Coke not only has a much more favorable cash position relative to its debt, but it also brought in tons of free cash flow over the past year, while Verizon was negative. To be fair, much of Verizon's debt is as a result of acquiring companies that add to its moat -- including the remaining stake it didn't hold in Verizon Wireless. And free cash flow was unusually low over the past year because of one-time charges. Still, it's the trade-off that management made: strengthen the moat while weakening financial fortitude, at least over the medium term. Finally, we have the murky science of valuation. While there's no single metric that can tell you if a stock is cheap or expensive, there are a number of data points we can consult. Here are five that I like to use. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Ratio Verizon 12 NM 4.8 5.2% 7,300% Coke 24 28 4.9 3.3% 89%* Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E calculated using non-GAAP earnings when possible. NM = not meaningful due to negative cash flow. * Coke's dividend payments were normalized to have been paid once per quarter in the past four quarters. Because of calendar irregularities, that is not how they appear on the company statements. Things get murky here. Because Verizon's free cash flow was negative, it makes price-to-free cash flow meaningless, suggesting that the stock is expensive. At the same time, on an earnings basis, it appears to be trading at a 50% discount to Coke. And when it comes to growth trends (the PEG ratio), both stocks look ridiculously expensive. To get a more clear-headed view, I went back and saw that Verizon has averaged $13.4 billion  in free cash flow over the past three fiscal years. Using that as a proxy is imprecise, but it gives us a P/FCF ratio of 13 and a payout ratio, based on the current dividend, of just 70%. Looked at in this light, I believe Verizon to be a cheaper stock for dividend investors. So there you have it: Coke has the benefit of a powerful brand and a loaded balance sheet. Verizon has chosen to take a little risk with debt, but given the telecom giant's moat and reliable cash flow streams from its subscribers, I believe Verizon to be the better bet at today's prices.

Sometimes, seemingly good ideas fail. That's what happened with Frontier Communications' (NASDAQ:FTR) decision to spend $10.54 billion buying Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) former wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). That move made sense when it happened. It was a bold attempt to lower costs per customer by allowing the company to spread expenses over more subscribers. Basically, the Verizon deal was Frontier's attempt to go from the minor leagues to the majors, and it turned out to be a mistake. In closing the CTF deal, Frontier took ownership of roughly 3.7 million voice connections, 2.2 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video connections in California, Florida, and Texas. That was supposed to give the company operating scale to lower expenses, and that part of the deal actually worked. CEO Daniel McCarthy, a man who can see the bright side in any piece of bad news, has been publicly optimistic since the CTF deal closed. During his company's Q1 earnings call, he explained just how much money the purchase has saved the company. ""We're pleased to have met our target of realizing $1.25 billion in annualized synergies,"" McCarthy said. The company expects to achieve another incremental $350 million in annual savings by midyear 2018. That's the good news, but it's essentially the only positive for the company. Frontier has gotten more efficient, but it's having a very hard time holding on to the subscribers it paid $10.54 billion for. Cord-cutting has changed the game for cable companies. Image source: Getty Images. In the four quarters since the CTF purchase closed, Frontier has lost subscribers. McCarthy has had seemingly valid excuses each time. At first he blamed the switch from Verizon; then he blamed a lack of marketing. For the past two quarters he has said the problem was customers who made the switch but never paid. The reality is that Frontier made the Verizon deal at a time when the market was changing. Cord cutting, or dropping cable for streaming services, has slowly sped up, giving consumers more options. That's very bad news for Frontier, which operated by entering markets with established cable companies and offering an alternative. The company used cheaper prices, at least during a promotional period, to lure people in. It was a market strategy that worked because people often disliked their cable provider. In the current market, however, Frontier is one option among many. It perhaps remains attractive for disgruntled customers of its bigger rivals who still want a traditional cable and broadband package, but it's not competitive in cases where people are looking to spend less by switching to streaming alternatives. Frontier has taken away much of the incentive shareholders had to own the stock. That included the recent double-whammy of a 1-for-15 reverse stock split and slashing its dividend from $0.105 to $0.04 per share, beginning with the recent June 30 payment. Those moves were needed to avoid being delisted and to be able to service its debt. Frontier lost $587 million in 2016, almost twice the $316 million it lost the previous year. As it continues to lose subscribers each quarter, there's little reason to think it can reverse those losses. Frontier and its shareholders made a bet that bigger would be better. A few years earlier, that would have proved to be true. In the current marketplace, however, being a bigger small player has not worked out. It's hard to see a path forward for Frontier that results in a return to profit. The best-case scenario is that a bigger player buys the company, but if that happened, it would be a fire sale. This is a money-losing company facing market conditions that make a turnaround unlikely. Frontier has very good management that will prolong its existence, but the end result remains inevitable.

When it cones to delivering a product people like, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) have done a surprisingly good job of keeping people happy, according to a new report from J.D. Power. Sprint (NYSE:S) doesn't score quite as well as its rivals, but all four companies run the risk of losing customers if those users actually need to interact with their carriers. That general customer content (albeit to a much-lower extent with Sprint) bodes well for the major wireless carriers. Poor customer service when something goes wrong could cause that satisfaction to disappear, J.D. Power found it its 2017 U.S. Wireless Customer Care Full-Service Performance Study -- Volume 2. ""A fast resolution to a problem -- whether companies try to solve it in-store, online, or through social media -- is the best way to both avoid customers' ire and curb their temptation of switching providers,"" wrote the consumer insights, advisory services, and data and analytics company. ""This means reducing wait times, training staff to be skilled and knowledgeable, and solving the problem on the first try are issues of paramount importance."" Data from the study noted that there is considerable room for improvement in customer-service related areas. Consumers were specifically upset about the level of effort it takes to get the help they needed. T-Mobile has worked to improve its network. Image source: T-Mobile. Verizon, which recently scored a win on the twice-annual RootMetrics Mobile Performance in the United States report, also took first place here, scoring a 797 out of 900. AT&T came in second with a 796, with T-Mobile just behind at 795. Sprint brought up the rear, scoring a 723. The top three carriers all rated five ""Power Circles,"" which marks them as ""among the best,"" while Sprint scored two, ranking it with ""the rest."" J.D. Power surveyed 9,994 customers who contacted their carrier's customer-care department within the past three months to compile the two studies. In both cases, the research was done from January through June 2017. When things go well, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile enjoy a positive relationship with their customers. People who ""strongly agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" that it takes a lot of effort to speak with a live representative saw satisfaction drop by 210 points compared with those who ""strongly disagree"" or ""somewhat disagree"" that it takes a lot of effort (642 vs. 852, respectively). In addition, how long customers spent on hold and whether their carrier solved their issue on the first try greatly affected satisfaction. ""The first-contact resolution rate is 85% among those who strongly or somewhat disagreed that it required a lot of effort to resolve their most recent issue, compared with only 31% among those who strongly or somewhat agreed,"" according to J.D. Power. The studies also found that while only 5% of customers used social media to resolve issues, those who do have higher satisfaction levels (841 versus 792). In general, people would prefer to solve their issues over the phone. More than half (56%) of those surveyed said that resolving a problem online requires a lot of effort, similar to the 54% who feel that about in-store help. Only 49% of respondents felt that way about trying to solve their problems over the phone. ""Nobody wants to spend a lot of time trying to deal with an issue they shouldn't have had in the first place,"" said J.D. Power's Peter Cunningham. ""Customers believe carriers have a ways to go when it comes to reducing the amount of effort involved in problem resolution. But if carriers focus on it, they will likely see churn decrease and profits increase."" The top three carriers clearly have a good enough product that many customers never encounter a problem. The breaking point for the industry comes when something goes wrong. That leads to possible frustration in getting a quick resolution and the possibility that the consumer will switch carriers. ""With wireless providers getting so competitive about pricing, coupled with the migration from the two-year contract, there are too many options for customers to stay in bad wireless relationships,"" Cunningham said. Basically, the best way for any carrier -- but most specifically Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile -- to hold on to customers is for them to improve customer service. That seems like a relatively easy fix, though it's one on which the industry has perhaps neglected to spend money in favor of other areas, including improving their networks. ","

Yahoo!'s core business is all the applications and websites that made it one of the most well-known early pioneers of the internet. That all became part of Verizon along with most of its 8,600 employees on June 13 for the princely sum of $4.48 billion in cash. That money is being paid to Altaba. In addition to getting Yahoo!'s core business, Verizon also received the Yahoo! brand name. If you owned Yahoo! stock, you will notice a change in your brokerage statement. The shares are now called Altaba and the ticker symbol is AABA. This has all been happening behind the scenes; there is nothing individual shareholders need to do. Altaba is primarily comprised of the non-core foreign assets that were formerly part of Yahoo!, an IP patent portfolio that is called Excalibur, and the cash it received for selling YAHOO!'s core business to Verizon plus cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities it already had on its books. It also has some debt on its books in the form of convertible notes. Image source: Getty images. Altaba was created to maximize shareholder profits and efficiently return cash to shareholders. To do so, the company will try to figure out a tax-efficient strategy to sell its assets and return its cash to stockholders. This is easier said than done due to complex federal and state tax regulations that would take as much as 36.5% of its profits from the sale of foreign assets if they were sold and the cash repatriated back to the United States. Altaba owns shares of two foreign businesses. It owns approximately 36% of Yahoo Japan and approximately 15% of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). This table shows the number of shares that Altaba owns and the value of those holdings. Data source: Altaba. The company has a cost basis, or what it paid for both investments, of $5.9 billion. This is a great demonstration of how much money can be made when shares are held long term, as profits on the holdings are over $54 billion. These two holdings comprise the bulk of the value of Altaba. Altaba has stated it had a tax liability of almost $15 billion in its latest proxy statement based on the closing prices for the two stocks as of the end of 2016. Today, that number is even higher based on share prices gains. Altaba also owns minority interests in a variety of other companies, including Hortonworks  and SNAP. These minority stock holdings are relatively small -- about $130 million in value -- in comparison to its holdings in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, which combined are worth more than $60 billion. The patent portfolio, Excalibur, is listed on Alibaba's books as being worth $740 million. All the company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are worth approximately $12 billion. Add up all of Altaba's holdings, and the company is worth roughly $85 per share on a pre-tax basis. The shares trade for over a 30% discount to the pre-tax price, as the market needs to price in the tax burden facing the business. But, investors are hoping management can figure out how to minimize taxes, which would give shares a lift. As share prices change daily, the company has created an almost real-time display of its pre-tax share price and its actual share price that is available at its website. For now, investors will continue to hope that management can find the most tax-efficient method to get cash out of the company and into shareholders' pockets. ","
      
    Understanding Altaba: Why Its Holdings Are Discounted by 30% -- The Motley Fool

Anders Bylund,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When Yahoo! sold its operating business to Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) for $4.48 billion, that was not the end of Yahoo as a publicly traded investment. What remains of the former Yahoo! company is now known as Altaba (NASDAQ:AABA), and operates as a closed-end management investment company with large holdings in a few handpicked companies. The company boasts a $56 billion market cap, dwarfing the Verizon deal's financial impact. Altaba just shared its first financial update since the Verizon transaction, and also re-upped its share buyback program with a fresh $5 billion commitment. I'm here to give you a quick update on Altaba's affairs. Let's start with an overview of Altaba's three largest holdings. That would be Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Yahoo! Japan, and Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Investment Holding Fair Value as of June 16, 2017 Fair Value as of Dec. 31, 2016 Change Alibaba $51.8 billion $33.7 billion 54% Yahoo! Japan $8.7 billion $7.7 billion 13% Snap $78 million N/A N/A Data source: Altaba. The company then known as Yahoo! also held cash equivalents and marketable debt papers valued at $7.2 billion at the end of 2017. The debt securities alone are now valued at $12.7 billion. The Excalibur operation, which contains a basket of technology patents not related to the core Yahoo! operation and not therefore passed on to Verizon, is now worth an estimated $665 million. All told, investments in businesses affiliated with the old Yahoo! business now add up to $60.6 billion while unaffiliated investments in bank bonds, government debt, and other unrelated affairs work out to a fair value of $12.9 billion. Image source: Alibaba. Altaba's investments were largely set up in the Yahoo! days, often long before the target companies joined the public market. The Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan positions remain unaltered, down to the last share. The fair value changes come from Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba racking up big gains on their own, plus a smattering of currency exchange effects. Between Altaba's two financial reporting dates, the U.S. dollar strengthened by roughly 5% against the Japanese yen and by 2% versus the Chinese renminbi. Meanwhile, both Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan delivered strong share price gains. Alibaba's American depositary shares gained 52% over this period, while the Japanese internet services operation posted a 16% gain. Do keep in mind that these gains already include the currency-based effects. These are still impressive gains. In particular, Alibaba held a successful investor day in June, outlining a bright future of world-class e-commerce operations and a serious commitment to growth outside the Chinese market. This is not a bad time to be a proxy for owning Alibaba, a title Altaba can claim since 70% of its total holdings are directly invested in that stock. In other news, Altaba announced that it had repurchased roughly 6.7% of its own shares in a $3.4 billion tender offer in June and July. To replace that program, which was started under Yahoo! in 2015, the buyback policy was given a fresh $5 billion commitment. ""We have consistently stated that it is our intent to return substantially all of our cash to shareholders over time (of course, retaining what we need to cover liabilities and operate the Fund) -- and with this action, we state it again today, clearly,"" said Altaba CEO Tom McInerney in a prepared statement. The financial data presented earlier did not come from a regular quarterly earnings report, but was simply a first-day accounting of Altaba's assets and liabilities. Altaba has yet to determine when its fiscal year starts and ends, which makes it difficult to estimate when the first earnings report under the new name might turn up. It would make sense to align the fiscal year with this date of inception, meaning June 16, though quarters ending in the middle of a calendar month are pretty rare. So we'll see. At least we know what cards the company is holding now and where it intends to invest any incoming cash flows. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

Sean Williams,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks often form the foundation of every long-term investment and retirement portfolio, and it's not hard to understand why. To begin with, dividend stocks typically have business models that are time-tested. After all, why would a company be paying a recurring dividend if it didn't believe its business would remain profitable? Thus, seeking out dividend stocks often means looking for profitable, time-tested businesses that'll allow us to sleep better at night. Image source: Getty Images. Second, buying dividend stocks helps to hedge against the inevitable stock market corrections that pop up from time to time. Since 1950, according to Yardeni Research, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) has undergone 35 corrections totaling at least 10%, when rounded to the nearest whole number. That's about one correction of at least 10% every two years. While a dividend payment isn't going to counteract the entirety of a possible move lower in equities, your payout over time will act as a comforting hedge that can calm your nerves. Finally, dividend stocks allow investors the opportunity to set up a Drip, or a dividend reinvestment plan. The idea of a Drip is that instead of pocketing the income from your dividend, you're repurchasing more shares of stock with the payout, often on a commission-free basis. Doing so, in a recurring pattern, should yield higher payouts, more shares owned, and a quicker pace of wealth creation. Drips are a common way money managers provide healthy returns for their clients. There's so much more to dividends, however. Here are seven facts about dividends you probably didn't know. Image source: Getty Images. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has only been paying a dividend, following a roughly 17-year hiatus, for the past five years. However, since it began regularly paying a quarterly stipend in August 2012, it's grown into the kingpin of all dividend stocks. Sure, its current dividend yield is only 1.7%, but its quarterly payout has grown by approximately 67% in just five years. Its $0.63-per-share quarterly payout ($2.52 annual) works out to about $13.1 billion being returned to its shareholders via dividends each year. And given its low payout ratio (the percentage of earnings per share it's paying out as a dividend), Apple's dividend is likely to rise even more in the years to come. Do you feel like S&P 500 companies are putting more money into your pockets each quarter? You should. According to data from FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS), aggregate dividends paid on a trailing-12-month basis by S&P 500 companies have increased in each and every quarter, save for one, between the first quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2016. Not only did these payouts grow each quarter, but the aggregate annual payout to shareholders has virtually doubled to $431 billion in less than seven years' time. During this span, the number of S&P 500 companies paying a dividend also grew from around 365 to 419. Image source: Getty Images. Yet in spite of this increase in aggregate payout, the S&P 500 has lost a lot of its income punch over the years. After consistently staying above a 3% yield, or higher, through 1990, the S&P 500's current yield sits below 2%. Part of the blame can go to companies utilizing their cash for stock buybacks and merger and acquisition activity instead of dividends. However, the other component at work is the S&P 500's rapid increase in value. Since dividend yield is a function of price, the S&P 500's rapid ascent and recent all-time highs have worked to push its yield lower. Something tells me this is a trade-off that investors will gladly take. If you want the highest-yielding sector within the S&P 500, look no further than telecom, with companies like AT&T and Verizon leading the way. Telecom companies and content providers do deal with relatively high up-front infrastructure costs, but are mostly protected by high barriers to entry and somewhat minimal competition. The result is telecom companies having exceptional margin power and the ability to lock consumers in with contracts. This is why their dividend yields are so high and why the aggregate sector yield through the third quarter of 2016 was 4.5%, more than double the S&P 500, according to FactSet. On the other hand, consumer discretionary stocks offer the worst yields at 1.4% on aggregate basis as of the third quarter of 2016. Discretionary companies rely on a strong economy to drive dividend growth, but a mixture of weak GDP growth and inflation data, coupled with tepid consumer spending, has kept this from happening in recent years. Image source: Getty Images. Among the veritable sea of dividend-paying companies lies a small clique of elite payers known as Dividend Aristocrats. A Dividend Aristocrat is a publicly traded company that's increased its payout for a minimum of 25 straight years. Just a couple dozen companies have done so, making it a pretty exclusive club. However, at the top of the list are six stocks that have raised their payouts for at least 60 straight years: You'll note that most of these companies supply a basic need, and thus inelastic, good or service, which is why their pricing power remains strong and why they've been able to thrive in both booming and recessionary economies. Apple may be the dividend kingpin in terms of aggregate annual payout, but no public company can rival York Water (NASDAQ:YORW), which has paid an uninterrupted dividend since 1816. This little-known water and sewer utility relies on the fact that water and sewer service are inelastic. If you live in a home, condo, or apartment, you need water and sewer service. Furthermore, York's business is regulated, which means it's not exposed to wholesale pricing fluctuations. The result is a company with exceptionally predictable growth and cash flow and thus a healthy dividend. Image source: Getty Images. Last, but not least, according to data from FactSet, the number of successful activist campaigns within the S&P 500 that were aiming for an increase in shareholders returns via stock buybacks and dividends hit a 10-year low in 2016 (at least through third-quarter 2016). Just 10 of the nearly 40 activist campaigns were successful, which compares to nearly 40 successful campaigns in just over 70 attempts in 2015. It's unclear whether companies are getting better at thwarting the demands of activist investors, or if they're finding more effective uses of capital than shareholder returns at this point. As you can see, dividend stocks can tell a story. What tales might your portfolio have in store? ","

Ezequiel Minaya,08032017,MarketWatch,07272017,"Published: Aug 1, 2017 8:23 a.m. ET By Sprint Corp., which recently had its advances seeking a tie-up with cable giant Charter Communications Inc. rebuffed, posted a net profit for the first time in three years amid cost-cutting efforts. Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said Tuesday the profit was ""an important milestone"" that reflects progress in the company's journey to boost its revenue and customer growth and transform its cost structure. Shares in the company, which have risen 30% over the past 12 months, climbed 2.8% to $8.20 in premarket trading. The company said it had 88,000 postpaid phone additions during the quarter, the eighth consecutive period of expansion. However, the pace of growth has slowed from a year ago when the company reported 173,000 postpaid additions. Prepaid additions were 35,000, up from a loss of 306,000 a year ago, but fewer than the 291,000 registered in the March quarter. In all for the June quarter, Sprint posted a profit of $206 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of $302 million, or 8 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 4.5% to $8.16 billion. Meanwhile, total net operating expenses also dipped, falling 13.3% to $7 billion. Analysts had expected a loss of a penny a share on $8.11 billion in revenue. Sprint proposed a merger with Charter that would have created a massive new entity controlled by SoftBank Group Corp., Sprint's parent, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. On Sunday, Charter Communications Inc. said it wasn't interested. Sprint had launched exclusive talks with Charter and Comcast Corp. in late May about an array of deal possibilities including one that would allow Comcast and Charter to offer wireless service under their own brands using Sprint's network, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. Charter and Comcast, the two largest U.S. cable companies by subscribers, in May agreed to a partnership that barred either company from doing a wireless deal without the other's blessing or participation for a year. Charter would therefore need Comcast's approval for any merger with Sprint. The backdrop of all the discussions is the convergence of the cable and wireless industries as smartphones become increasingly important and consumers rely more equally on cable and wireless companies to surf the web and watch videos. Charter is planning to join in the increasingly competitive wireless phone industry. The company has a mobile virtual network operator pact, or reseller agreement, with Verizon Communications Inc., and a spokesman told The Wall Street Journal that Charter intends to launch wireless services to customers next year.

Read: Apple’s earnings-driven gain puts the Dow on pace to top 22,000 Wall Street remains solidly higher for 2017, with major indexes having hit a series of records. However, the rally has left valuations stretched. “People are saying the move has been overdone, but they’ve been saying that for a while,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. “Valuations do look stretched relative to historical norms, but investors are looking a little farther out, and valuations don’t look that bad in that context.” “Overall, earnings have been coming in good this season, with stocks beating on revenue and profits,” Jacobsen said. “The fact that the market is still reacting to that in a positive way tells me that stocks aren’t in a bubble, that there’s fundamental support.” Read:  How each Dow stock contributed to the 22,000 milestone Apple has been one of the market’s biggest gainers thus far this year, up 36%.

The report is often watched for clues to the strength of official employment data, though the correlation between the ADP figures and government data is weak. Investors are in a holding pattern in advance of the Friday jobs report, said Bill Stone, global chief investment strategist at PNC Management Group. Apple is an outlier Wednesday as many investors were expecting the tech giant to have a tough quarter, Stone said. “Everybody’s waiting for Friday for more indication of what the Fed may do,” Stone said in an interview. Of particular interest will be average hourly wages, Stone said, because if they rise, it would be an indication that inflation may not be as soft as expected, and support the argument for more tightening from the central bank.

Apple’s U.S. market share is about 44%, thus the total smart mobile-phone market in the U.S. is $150 billion a year. Add spending on smartphone accessories (cases, cables, screen protectors, etc.) and we are probably looking at $200 billion total spending annually on smartphones and accessories.

                                   wireless-generated revenue in 2006 was $38 billion. Fast-forward 10 years and it is $89 billion — a $51 billion increase. Verizon’s market share is about 30%, making the total spending increase on wireless services alone close to $150 billion. Between smartphones and their services, $340 billion will not be spent on T-shirts and shoes. But we are not done. The combination of mid-single-digit health-care inflation and the proliferation of high-deductible plans has increased consumer direct health-care costs and further chipped away at discretionary dollars. Health-care spending in the U.S. is $3.3 trillion, and even a 3% rise in costs would be close to $100 billion. Then there are soft, hard-to-quantify factors. Millennials and millennial-want-to-be generations don’t really care about clothes as much as we may have 10 years ago. After all, high-tech billionaires wear hoodies and flip-flops to work. Lack of fashion sense did not hinder their success, so why should the rest of us care about the dress code? In the ‘90s casual Fridays were a big deal — yippee, we could wear jeans to work! Fast-forward 20 years, and every day is casual. Suits? They are worn to job interviews or to impress old-fashioned clients. Consumer habits have slowly changed, and we now put less value on clothes (and thus spend less money on them) and more value on having the latest iThing. All this brings us to a hard and sad reality: The U.S. is over-retailed. We simply have too many stores. Americans have four- or five times more square-footage per capita than other developed countries. This bloated square footage was created for a different consumer, the one who in in the ‘90s and ‘00s was borrowing money against her house and spending it at her local shopping mall. Today’s post-Great Recession consumer is deleveraging, paying off debt, spending money on new necessities such as mobile phones, and paying more for the old ones such as health care. Yes, Amazon and online sales do matter. Ten years ago just 2.5% of retail sales took place online, and today that number is 8.5% — about a $300 billion change. Some of these online sales were captured by brick-and-mortar online sales, some by e-commerce giants like Amazon, and some by brands selling directly to consumers. But as you can see, online sales are just one piece of a complex retail puzzle. All the aforementioned factors combined explain why, when gasoline prices declined by almost 50% (gifting consumers hundreds of dollars of discretionary spending per month), retailers’ profitability and consumer spending did not flinch — those savings were more than absorbed by other expenses. Understanding that online sales (meaning Amazon) are not the only culprit responsible for horrible retail numbers is crucial in the analysis of retail stocks. If you are only asking “Who can best  fight Amazon?” then you are only solving for one variable in a multivariable problem. These are the facts: consumer habits have changed; the U.S. is over-retailed; and consumer spending is being diverted to different parts of the economy. Value investors are naturally attracted to hated sectors. But we demand a much greater margin of safety from retail stocks, because estimating their future cash flows (and thus fair value) is becoming increasingly difficult. Warren Buffett has said that you want to own a business that can be run by an idiot, because one day it will be. A successful retail business in today’s world cannot be run by by an idiot. It requires Bezos-like qualities: being totally consumer-focused, taking risks, thinking long term. Vitaliy N.

At the NBCUniversal media division, revenue rose 17% to $8.33 billion. Revenue in the filmed entertainment division jumped 60%, thanks to the latest installment of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise. The cable networks and broadcast TV units grew revenue and earnings due to increases in subscription fees from pay TV providers, but both also saw a decline in ad sales because of ratings softness. Cable networks' ad revenues declined 0.9% to $906 million, while broadcast TV ad revenue declined 1.2% to $1.27 billion. In the cable business, the company lost 34,000 residential and business video customers, compared with a loss of 4,000 in the same quarter last year. Comcast has generally managed to withstand the turmoil in cable TV from cord-cutting better than some peers in pay television. In a tough environment, with consumers gravitating to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Sling TV, the company has added net video subscribers in five of the past seven quarters. The cord-cutting has taken a toll on TV ratings, however, for NBCUniversal's channels just like those of many other media companies. Comcast and industry analysts point to its investment in X1, a cloud-based, set-top box system, as a reason its video business has held up. The company said that 55% of its residential video customers now have X1, up from nearly 40% in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase. Comcast added 175,000 total internet customers in the second quarter, down from 220,000 in the year-earlier period. Total revenue per customer relationship, Comcast's unit revenue figure for its cable division, increased 2.2% to $151.19. Comcast lost 22,000 voice customers in the quarter, compared with an addition of 64,000 in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue for Comcast's cable division, which makes up 61% of revenue, rose 5.5% to $13.12 billion. Comcast recently launched a new wireless service, aimed at adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already. The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with Verizon Communications to offer its service. Comcast, along fellow cable provider Charter Communications Inc., has explored a deal with Sprint Corp. that could provide an alternative reseller arrangement, potentially with better terms, people familiar with the matter have said. Comcast has signaled that it views the wireless service as an add-on for its customers, aimed at increasing profits and reducing the percentage of customers leaving its service. In all, net income rose to $2.51 billion, or 52 cents a share, up from about $2.03 billion, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue grew 9.8% to $21.17 billion.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"SYDNEY, Aug 4 (IFR) - Verizon Communications (Baa1/BBB+/A–) has reopened Australia’s Kangaroo bond market for global corporate issuers with a stunning four-tranche print that can only encourage further issuance from offshore blue chips. The US telecom giant smashed expectations with a A$2.2 billion ($1.76 billion) four-tranche issue. It is the first Kangaroo bond from a corporate issuer this year and the second-biggest corporate bond in the Australian dollar market, just shy of Apple’s A$2.25 billion three-tranche Kangaroo debut in August 2015. Verizon priced well inside guidance levels and in line with its US dollar curve, said market sources. The A$500 million 5.5-year floating-rate note priced 122 basis points wide of three-month BBSW, 8bp below 130bp area guidance, while the A$550 million 3.5 percent fixed-rated February 2023s priced at asset swaps plus 122bp. The A$450 million 4.05 percent seven-year and A$700m 4.5 percent 10-year notes priced 157bp and 185b over asset swaps, versus respective guidance in the 160bp area and 190bp area. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan were joint lead managers for the trade. Verizon’s jumbo financing again highlights the pent-up demand for corporate credit in Australia’s bank-dominated local market. Local corporate bond sales have jumped to A$8 billion this year versus just A$1.6 billion in same period in 2016 and A$5.1 billion in the whole of last year. Apple revealed the Australian market’s potential as a global funding alternative in 2015 with its inaugural A$2.25 billion four-year and seven-year debut in August 2015 that smashed the previous A$500 million record for corporate Kangaroos. US chipmaker Intel followed with a A$800 million sale of four and seven-year Kangaroos in November 2015. In June 2016, Coca-Cola raised A$1 billion from a four and eight-year issuance, the same month Apple returned with a A$1.425 billion four-year, 7.6-year and 10-year offering. Three other corporate Kangaroos last year raised between A$175 million and A$350 million from single tranche trades. US companies have issued bonds overseas in recent years to avoid high US corporate tax rates levied on repatriated overseas profits. Companies have chosen to keep profits offshore, issuing bonds in foreign currencies and swapping proceeds back to US dollars to help pay dividends and finance stock buybacks. US motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, rated A3/A– (Moody’s/S&P), could follow Verizon having held investor meetings in Australia and Singapore in March for a possible Kangaroo debut. Verizon has had a busy week in the Asian capital markets. It also priced a $950 million 5.15 percent 33-year non-call five Formosa bond in the Taiwanese market. Citigroup and BNP Paribas Taipei were local underwriters while Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were structuring agents on the trade. Verizon is a huge bond issuer with over $116 billion-equivalent in bonds outstanding, the vast majority of which is in US dollars. This total includes $3 billion of 16-year notes sold on Tuesday as part of a liability management exercise to take out a number of high-coupon legacy bonds as well as other short-term debt.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"(Reuters) - CBS Corp said on Monday it signed a deal for its shows to feature on AT&T Inc’s DirecTV Now online streaming service. Under the agreement, DirecTV Now will stream CBS, CBS Sports, the CW channel and many of CBS’ local broadcast stations, according to the company. Customers will also have the option to buy a subscription to CBS’ premium Showtime network. AT&T will pay CBS for its content, helping the TV network shift its revenue stream away from advertising as more viewers watch their favorite shows online. Last year, CBS signed similar deals with Hulu and Alphabet Inc’s Google to be included in their streaming video services. Earlier this year, CBS announced a deal with Verizon Communications Inc  to distribute its content. The New York-based broadcaster, which owns the most widely viewed U.S. television network, said much of the programming of the channels under the deal would also be available on-demand. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. “For any bundle to be truly successful, CBS is must-have content,” said Ray Hopkins, head of CBS Corp’s TV networks distribution. ","

Amazon wants to add tens of thousands of employees to its ranks while Google is donating millions of dollars to training. Touting such plans is partly a response to fears that tech will, like trade, be blamed for killing jobs as automation and artificial intelligence take hold. Trade became a surprise target during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, symbolizing globalization run amok for both political parties. Trump backed out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership shortly after taking office and has threatened to pull out of NAFTA.

Sprint (NYSE:S) is desperately fighting to win new customers from Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The fourth-place carrier's most recent attempt to bring in new customers is to offer its unlimited data plan free for a year to customers switching from its competition. That promotion was supposed to end at the end of June, but it's been extended twice now. Even giving away phone service didn't attract enough subscribers to Sprint to offset losses in tablets and connected devices last quarter. Overall, the company lost 39,000 postpaid subscribers -- which are users who pay their bills monthly. Postpaid service revenue fell 6.5% year over year. Sprint's ads now feature ""Paul from Verizon."" Image source: Sprint Last quarter was the first full quarter for Verizon's unlimited data plan, and it paid off with much greater than expected postpaid subscriber additions. Verizon also posted record low postpaid phone churn rate of 0.7%. AT&T also had a solid quarter, posting its best-ever postpaid phone churn of 0.79%. However, it did still lose 89,000 postpaid phone subscribers. Still, that loss is a slowdown from previous periods when it was losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers every quarter. Some of AT&T's success in stemming its losses may be thanks to its decision to offer substantial savings on its TV services for unlimited data plan subscribers, including free HBO for its high-end Unlimited Plus service. T-Mobile, meanwhile, continues to eat up industry subscriber growth. The company added 786,000 postpaid phone subscribers. That number may be somewhat inflated, though, because of the way T-Mobile accounts for its new DIGITS virtual number service. Nonetheless, T-Mobile continues to take the lion's share of postpaid net adds in the industry with its aggressive pricing and promotions. Sprint's only competitive advantage against the competition is its pricing. It has a worse network, worse brand, and no bundling economics to play to its advantage. Offering free service for a year is basically an admission of its inability to compete on those levels. Verizon's results show that consumers are willing to pay up for a top-quality network, and the price is good enough. As a result, Sprint's efforts largely fell on deaf ears. During the company's earnings call, CEO Marcelo Claure said the company has already added 115,000 net new postpaid subscribers in July. (It's unclear if that numbers is phones or all postpaid subscribers.) He says the company is taking share from all of its competitors. More importantly, he doesn't expect AT&T and Verizon to get any more aggressive with their promotions. Meanwhile, Sprint itself has gotten more aggressive with its free service promotion. It's actively advertising the offer on social media to draw in more users and extending the expiration date. But the back end of the year is historically stronger for Sprint than the first half. Those results don't mean much without context. For example, last year, Sprint added 344,000 postpaid subscribers in its fiscal second quarter. Based on its results in July, it's on pace for exactly the same number of net adds this year. While it's a good sign Sprint's growth isn't slowing like it has in the previous four quarters, the period isn't over yet. What's more, if much of that growth is stemming from its free year of service promotion, it's hard to say how good that is for Sprint's long-term results. ","

Shares of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have rebounded since the company reported a solid second quarter in late July, with a strong showing in wireless due to the company's new unlimited plan. Also highlighted was the completion of the Yahoo! acquisition and its combination with AOL under the new Oath media business subsidiary. That business is generating $7 billion a year in revenue, and Verizon expects to reap $1 billion in operating expenses from Oath through 2020. While Verizon investors rightfully focus their attention each quarter on wireless results, the company is doing exciting work on less noticeable IoT and 5G network business development. Image source: Getty. Over the last couple of years, Verizon has made a number of Internet of Things (IoT) acquisitions -- smaller but important purchases that have mostly flown under the radar. You can read about those in more detail here. The company offers little in the way of specifics on the performance of its spending spree, other than it has an IoT division. However, the company said in its recent quarterly earnings report and on the quarterly conference call with analysts that organic IoT revenue, including telematics, grew about 20% year-over-year. The recently acquired telematics business – which is comprised of connected vehicle and fleet tracking and management services – brought in $220 million in the second quarter. No one really knows what the total market will eventually be for the IoT, but an estimate from Gartner says that the number of global connected devices will exceed 20 billion by the year 2020. That compares with an estimated 8.4 billion or so in operation this year. That's a big market, and someone will need to provide a network on which all of those devices communicate. This offers an important avenue of growth for Verizon, which saw revenue drop 2% in the quarter, excluding divestitures and acquisitions. It reported total consolidated operating revenue of $30.5 billion. The IoT business could eventually be a catalyst for big growth. Image source: Verizon. Closely linked to the IoT business is the development of 5G, a next-generation wireless network that will boast faster speeds and less latency than the current 4G LTE. More importantly, though, 5G will be able to power advanced connected machines like autonomous vehicles and devices used in offering remote healthcare. Verizon has been working to be the first to roll out the next-gen network, including outbidding AT&T (NYSE: T) for 5G technology and patent holding company Straight Path Communications for $3.1 billion. 2017 is a big year, as initial 5G testing in eight urban markets is underway. On the conference call, management was short on details here and said to wait for more information later this year when results from the testing is released. Testing involves an initial batch of customers that Verizon is using as guinea pigs to learn how to roll out 5G for general commercial use. With Verizon's current 4G-centric wireless business making up about three-fourths of revenue, it will continue to be the driving force behind business and share price performance. However, the current iteration of telecom technology is mostly played out as far as growth goes, leaving telecom businesses fighting over the existing client base in the U.S. While still small and in early development phase, Verizon's IoT and 5G units do little to impact quarterly results. However, as the world gets increasingly connected, these segments stand to grow and have the potential to pull Verizon out of its current fight for mobile phone subscribers. ","

When it cones to delivering a product people like, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) have done a surprisingly good job of keeping people happy, according to a new report from J.D. Power. Sprint (NYSE:S) doesn't score quite as well as its rivals, but all four companies run the risk of losing customers if those users actually need to interact with their carriers. That general customer content (albeit to a much-lower extent with Sprint) bodes well for the major wireless carriers. Poor customer service when something goes wrong could cause that satisfaction to disappear, J.D. Power found it its 2017 U.S. Wireless Customer Care Full-Service Performance Study -- Volume 2. ""A fast resolution to a problem -- whether companies try to solve it in-store, online, or through social media -- is the best way to both avoid customers' ire and curb their temptation of switching providers,"" wrote the consumer insights, advisory services, and data and analytics company. ""This means reducing wait times, training staff to be skilled and knowledgeable, and solving the problem on the first try are issues of paramount importance."" Data from the study noted that there is considerable room for improvement in customer-service related areas. Consumers were specifically upset about the level of effort it takes to get the help they needed. T-Mobile has worked to improve its network. Image source: T-Mobile. Verizon, which recently scored a win on the twice-annual RootMetrics Mobile Performance in the United States report, also took first place here, scoring a 797 out of 900. AT&T came in second with a 796, with T-Mobile just behind at 795. Sprint brought up the rear, scoring a 723. The top three carriers all rated five ""Power Circles,"" which marks them as ""among the best,"" while Sprint scored two, ranking it with ""the rest."" J.D. Power surveyed 9,994 customers who contacted their carrier's customer-care department within the past three months to compile the two studies. In both cases, the research was done from January through June 2017. When things go well, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile enjoy a positive relationship with their customers. People who ""strongly agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" that it takes a lot of effort to speak with a live representative saw satisfaction drop by 210 points compared with those who ""strongly disagree"" or ""somewhat disagree"" that it takes a lot of effort (642 vs. 852, respectively). In addition, how long customers spent on hold and whether their carrier solved their issue on the first try greatly affected satisfaction. ""The first-contact resolution rate is 85% among those who strongly or somewhat disagreed that it required a lot of effort to resolve their most recent issue, compared with only 31% among those who strongly or somewhat agreed,"" according to J.D. Power. The studies also found that while only 5% of customers used social media to resolve issues, those who do have higher satisfaction levels (841 versus 792). In general, people would prefer to solve their issues over the phone. More than half (56%) of those surveyed said that resolving a problem online requires a lot of effort, similar to the 54% who feel that about in-store help. Only 49% of respondents felt that way about trying to solve their problems over the phone. ""Nobody wants to spend a lot of time trying to deal with an issue they shouldn't have had in the first place,"" said J.D. Power's Peter Cunningham. ""Customers believe carriers have a ways to go when it comes to reducing the amount of effort involved in problem resolution. But if carriers focus on it, they will likely see churn decrease and profits increase."" The top three carriers clearly have a good enough product that many customers never encounter a problem. The breaking point for the industry comes when something goes wrong. That leads to possible frustration in getting a quick resolution and the possibility that the consumer will switch carriers. ""With wireless providers getting so competitive about pricing, coupled with the migration from the two-year contract, there are too many options for customers to stay in bad wireless relationships,"" Cunningham said. Basically, the best way for any carrier -- but most specifically Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile -- to hold on to customers is for them to improve customer service. That seems like a relatively easy fix, though it's one on which the industry has perhaps neglected to spend money in favor of other areas, including improving their networks. ","

T-Mobile is back with a plan for slightly older phone users. Over the last several years, T-Mobile has refashioned itself into the rebel ""un-carrier"" catering to a younger, hipper crowd. Now, it's going after their parents and grandparents. The nation's third-largest carrier on Monday introduced a new rate plan specifically marketed at consumers who are 55 and older. The plan, which includes unlimited data, calls and text messages, costs $50 a month for an individual line and $60 for a couple. Like other T-Mobile One plans, the rates include the taxes and fees. The normal price is $70 for a single line, and $120 for two lines (although there's currently a limited promotion that brings it down to $100). Customers will be able to sign up for the new plan starting Wednesday. The program, coined T-Mobile One Unlimited 55+, marks a departure from the usual wireless promotions that go after younger customers or families. It's another sign of the broader move by the carriers to offer more incentives to people to stick around or switch to their service. In this case, it's targeting a segment that hasn't gotten a lot of love. ""We're bringing the un-carrier revolution to people who are underserved and overpriced,"" Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Sherrard said in an interview Friday ahead of the news. Sherrard said the push to go beyond younger consumers in big markets comes from T-Mobile's expansion of its wireless network into areas outside of major cities. ""We've done phenomenally well with millennials and in urban centers,"" Sherrard said. ""Now we have an amazing opportunity to move beyond that."" He noted that the older age demographic represents the fastest-growing group of smartphone adopters and users. The new rate includes a discount for enrolling in its auto-pay function. Customers who don't want to sign up for auto-pay will shell out an $5 each month. The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.

While retailers in both the digital and physical world have seemingly become obsessed with reaching millennial shoppers, older generations still have a lot of purchasing power. In fact, Generation X, those born between 1965 and 1980, has the highest annual spending per American household, averaging $66,981, while millennials, defined for this info as those born 1981 through now, come in third at $47,114, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) blog. Baby boomers, people born between 1946 and 1964, have the second most at $59,646. With the youngest boomer now 53, most of that age group has crossed the 55+ mark, a group being targeted by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) in a new promotion. The wireless carrier has essentially created a senior discount for people 55 and older, a group it says it has a less than 10% share of currently. T-Mobile wants a bigger share of customers over 55. Image source: T-Mobile. The Un-carrier, as it calls itself, has offered the more than 93 million Americans that are 55 and over, two lines with unlimited data, calls, and text for $60 per month, including all taxes and fees. (It's $50 for the first line and $10 for the second. Only the first person needs to be 55 or older.) That's $40 cheaper than the $100 the company charges younger customers for the same plan. The offer starts Aug. 9 and it requires customers to use autopay to get the deal price. T-Mobile CEO John Legere touted the offer as a different way to market to baby boomers, and members of the silent generation (born 1929-1945). Getting the deal requires that new customers visit a T-Mobile store to actually show their ID. Existing customers in the impacted age group can switch pricing by calling the carrier or visiting a store. Legere is right when he notes that the deals being offered to seniors don't reflect how many of them use their phones. Yes, there's a much-older audience that wants very limited handsets with big buttons, but that's not what most Americans over age 55 want. According to T-Mobile: A senior discount has worked well in a number of industries. The wireless company is not requiring 55+ customers to do anything different to get the deal. This is not an early bird special or a movie deal for going to see a film when younger people are working or at school, it's the regular T-Mobile One Unlimited plan at a better price. Legere's company just surpassed Verizon (NYSE: VZ) for first place on one of the two major wireless studies. The results of that report suggest that T-Mobile can make inroads in a market dominated by Verizon and AT&T (NYSE: T). T-Mobile makes that very clear in its press release, saying that those two companies control nearly 81% of the postpaid wireless market of people 55 and older while T-Mobile only has 8%. ""When these generations were getting their first phones, AT&T and Verizon were the only real options -- and the Duopoly has been taking advantage of them ever since!"" said Legere. Basically T-Mobile feels it can now prove it has a good enough network to go after an audience that has been very conservative, opting for the traditional leaders. By offering aggressive pricing coupled with its new status as the top network (though a second major study disagrees), Legere believes that his company can take share from AT&T and Verizon. There's no reason to expect this deal won't work. ","

Yahoo!'s core business is all the applications and websites that made it one of the most well-known early pioneers of the internet. That all became part of Verizon along with most of its 8,600 employees on June 13 for the princely sum of $4.48 billion in cash. That money is being paid to Altaba. In addition to getting Yahoo!'s core business, Verizon also received the Yahoo! brand name. If you owned Yahoo! stock, you will notice a change in your brokerage statement. The shares are now called Altaba and the ticker symbol is AABA. This has all been happening behind the scenes; there is nothing individual shareholders need to do. Altaba is primarily comprised of the non-core foreign assets that were formerly part of Yahoo!, an IP patent portfolio that is called Excalibur, and the cash it received for selling YAHOO!'s core business to Verizon plus cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities it already had on its books. It also has some debt on its books in the form of convertible notes. Image source: Getty images. Altaba was created to maximize shareholder profits and efficiently return cash to shareholders. To do so, the company will try to figure out a tax-efficient strategy to sell its assets and return its cash to stockholders. This is easier said than done due to complex federal and state tax regulations that would take as much as 36.5% of its profits from the sale of foreign assets if they were sold and the cash repatriated back to the United States. Altaba owns shares of two foreign businesses. It owns approximately 36% of Yahoo Japan and approximately 15% of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). This table shows the number of shares that Altaba owns and the value of those holdings. Data source: Altaba. The company has a cost basis, or what it paid for both investments, of $5.9 billion. This is a great demonstration of how much money can be made when shares are held long term, as profits on the holdings are over $54 billion. These two holdings comprise the bulk of the value of Altaba. Altaba has stated it had a tax liability of almost $15 billion in its latest proxy statement based on the closing prices for the two stocks as of the end of 2016. Today, that number is even higher based on share prices gains. Altaba also owns minority interests in a variety of other companies, including Hortonworks  and SNAP. These minority stock holdings are relatively small -- about $130 million in value -- in comparison to its holdings in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, which combined are worth more than $60 billion. The patent portfolio, Excalibur, is listed on Alibaba's books as being worth $740 million. All the company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are worth approximately $12 billion. Add up all of Altaba's holdings, and the company is worth roughly $85 per share on a pre-tax basis. The shares trade for over a 30% discount to the pre-tax price, as the market needs to price in the tax burden facing the business. But, investors are hoping management can figure out how to minimize taxes, which would give shares a lift. As share prices change daily, the company has created an almost real-time display of its pre-tax share price and its actual share price that is available at its website. For now, investors will continue to hope that management can find the most tax-efficient method to get cash out of the company and into shareholders' pockets. ","

In the last few months, the stock of global satellite telecom company Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT) has been rallying strongly. However, while sales notched a 12% increase in the just-reported second quarter of the year, there was still a $12.5 million loss from operations. Speculation seems to be in the driver's seat here, and investors should be careful. GSAT data by YCharts In the second quarter of 2017, Globalstar revenue increased 12% to $28.1 million, compared to $25.1 million last year. That is good news for the company, as revenue has been steadily rising now since 2010, when it began updating its current satellite array. GSAT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The top line is improving, but it is profit margins that are the concerning part here. Globalstar still hasn't reached scale, as the company loses money on operations. In the second quarter, the loss was $12.5 million and $98.7 million on operations and on a net basis, respectively. Free cash flow, or cash left over after operations are paid for, has also remained negative for years. GSAT Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts To hit breakeven, the company still needs to generate significantly more revenue. While the company is making headway in that regard, last quarter's year-over-year increase still puts breakeven several years out assuming that number holds. However, the trend is positive, and that has led some to speculate that the satellite company could be a takeover target. Since I last wrote about Globalstar a few months ago, the stock has rallied as much as 30%. Little has changed, but investor interest has been driven by speculation that the company could be purchased for its telecom assets. Perhaps fueling the fire was Verizon's (NYSE: VZ) and AT&T's (NYSE: T) bidding war over Straightpath Communications (NYSEMKT: STRP) back in May. Globalstar was recently awarded approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use its satellites as a network extension for land-based wireless 4G LTE providers. The company is looking for a partner to help monetize that approval, but the fact that it was given the nod from the FCC has led some to think a Globalstar bidding war like the one for Straightpath could ensue. Image source: Globalstar. What many speculators may have missed, though, is that Globalstar already has a savior: Thermo Companies, whose CEO is Globalstar CEO James Monroe. Thermo owns over half of Globalstar shares and most of its debt, putting the small satellite provider squarely in its control. While that type of insider ownership could be a good thing, in this case it could create a conflict of interest that hurts other shareholders. Bleeding cash, Globalstar has been relying on the issuance of new shares to keep it afloat, and the primary buyer has been Thermo. That boosts Thermo's ownership, but dilutes the value of shares for everyone else. That also means that a possible sale of the company will be up to Thermo to decide on, not other investors, and it might not favor a buyout unless the offer is significantly higher than its average cost per share. What's best for the goose (shareholders) may not be best for the gander (Thermo). Globalstar has valuable assets in its global satellite telecom service, recently approved for ground LTE use in the U.S. and is currently seeking approval in other countries as well. Revenues are on the rise, although the new capabilities of its satellites for on-the-ground telecom in the U.S. have yet to be unlocked. However, even with revenues on the rise, the company is still a long way off from profitability and relies on its insiders to stay afloat. That situation dilutes ownership for everyone else and over time lowers the value of shares. At this point, any significant rise in the stock is likely to be rooted in speculation. Long-term investors should tread lightly. ","

Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) recently reported its second quarter earnings and even a cursory glance at the results show healthy growth in nearly every meaningful metric. The company's core sales increased to $2.6 billion, a 6% increase year over year, and its core EPS increased to $0.42, a 14% increase over 2016's second quarter. While the stock price immediately dipped after Corning reported earnings, long term, buy-and-hold investors know to focus on a business's underlying fundamentals, not short term price volatility. Besides, shares are still up more than 20% year-to-date. Like last quarter, Corning's two fastest growing divisions boosted the company's growth. Corning's Specialty Materials division, responsible for manufacturing Gorilla Glass, saw sales increase to $337 million, a 27% increase year-over-year. The company's Optical Communications division, which supplies optical fiber solutions to telecom carriers and internet service providers, saw core earnings rise 26% over last year's second quarter results. Data source: Corning Inc. Many quarterly highlights were discussed during the conference call, including the major deal it recently scored with Verizon and Apple's major investment in Corning's Gorilla Glass manufacturing capacity. What might excite investors most, though, is a completely new opportunity Corning is looking to exploit: glass pharmaceutical packaging. Granted, it doesn't sound sexy or exciting, but the market could be as big as $4 billion in annual sales and could lift Corning's companywide margins in the process. The new pharmaceutical packaging is being called Corning Valor Glass and, according to CEO Wendell Weeks, it ""dramatically reduces particle contamination, breaks, and cracks while significantly increasing throughput."" The delicate and precise nature of medicine requires strong quality control and recent problems in pharmaceutical packaging have led the FDA to issue warnings on ""lamella"" -- the tiny flakes of glass that can contaminate pharmaceutical products. Valor Glass is designed to eliminate these problems. Most encouraging for investors during the conference call was to hear Weeks tout two meaningful endorsements of the products from some of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest players. Merck and Co., Inc.'s CEO Ken Frazier said that his company ""plans to convert several injectable products to this exceptional new glass packaging solution pending appropriate regulatory approvals."" Pfizer Inc's CEO Ian Read went even further, calling his company's collaboration with Corning a ""game changer."" After quoting these two endorsements, Weeks concluded: Valor also provides a powerful example of what happens when our focused and cohesive portfolio meets a customer opportunity. We started out with major customers from our life science vessels platform. We reapplied our expertise in glass science, optical physics, vapor deposition, precision forming and extrusion to develop a breakthrough product that we believe has the potential to power Corning's growth for the next decade and beyond. Corning scientists have developed a new glass product for pharmaceutical packaging called ""Valor Glass"". Image source: Corning Inc. Corning's management said it plans to start with a relatively small investment of $500 million but that, over time, investments in Valor Glass could rise to as much as $4 billion depending on customer demand. Investments in the platform have already been calculated in management's guidance. The best news might be that Corning predicts ongoing annual sales for this platform will equal the platform's one-time start-up investment costs with profitability exceeding the company's average. As for when this product will be able to see the light of the market, a lot depends on the FDA, which can decide to accelerate Valor Glass's approval, allowing it to reach the market more rapidly than it otherwise would. For this reason, Corning believes it will be able to paint a better picture of the road map ahead once the product is officially submitted for approval. The positive side to the highly regulated FDA approval process is that it gives advance notice to Corning of market demand, significantly de-risking its initial investments into the space. As already noted, Corning's stock price declined by about 8% since reporting its second quarter earnings. Why? Probably because it gave conservative guidance for its Optical Communications division after admitting earnings for the division might be lumpy due to the inherent difficulty in planning for major infrastructure projects by large telecom and internet service provider companies. Yet, in the same release, Corning also announced plans to launch its new Valor Glass platform which could potentially boost company sales by 40% per year all by itself. As an investor, which one of these facts do you think is more material to Corning's long term success? Remember, the market rewards those with a long-term horizon who are savvy enough to exploit short term volatility. While there are never any guarantees, this certainly looks like such an opportunity.

It's akin to ""earnings"" for REITs. Revenue increased 11% on a normalized -- which excludes the revenue contribution from acquisitions -- and constant-currency basis. Equinix's revenue came in at about the midpoint of its guidance range of $976 million to $982 million, which didn't include revenue from acquisitions.

Here's what CEO Steve Smith had to say in the press release about the quarter: Q2 was another strong quarter for Equinix, surpassing the milestone of $1 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time in the company's history. A key highlight in the quarter was the completion of Verizon's Americas data center portfolio, strengthening our global market leadership and providing additional capability to meet customer demand. As the shift to digital impacts businesses across all segments, private, secure and distributed interconnection continues to grow as a core design principle of IT, resulting in key new customer wins, and healthy and growing market share for Equinix. Equinix provided third-quarter guidance and adjusted its full-year 2017 guidance to include the expected contributions from the Verizon data centers. For the third quarter, the company expects revenue in the range of $1,133 million to $1,141 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 7% and constant-currency growth of 3% over the year-ago quarter. Equinix does not issue quarterly AFFO guidance. Updated full-year guidance is as follows: Metric Updated 2017 Guidance Previous 2017 Guidance Projected Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $4,317 million to $4,327 million Greater than $3,976 million 20% (more than 11% on normalized and constant-currency basis) AFFO $1,382 million to $1,392 million Greater than $1,214 million 29% (13% on a normalized and constantcurrency basis) Data source: Equinix. AFFO outlook assumes $52 million of integration costs for acquisitions. ","

The cellular-enabled smartwatch would let consumers send messages, download apps and stream music without an iPhone nearby, Bloomberg reported. Apple Watch currently need to be tethered to an iPhone’s LTE network to connect to the Internet. People familiar with Apple’s plans told Bloomberg that the watch is meant to reduce its reliance on the iPhone. It is not clear if users will have to buy a separate cellular data plan for an LTE Apple Watch nor is it clear which carriers will support it. However, Bloomberg reported AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile plan to sell the new device. ",Apple will reportedly release  LTE Apple Watch

The bar was lowered after CEO Tim Cook in May conceded there’d been a “pause” in iPhone sales amid heavy promotion for a 10th-anniversary model scheduled for September. The earnings report overall was soothing enough to send shares to record highs this week, striking an intraday high of $159.75 the day after the earnings release and closing at an all-time best $157.14 that day. Analysts said guidance within the earnings release boosted market expectations that new iPhone hardware would emerge in September. That followed recent reports that a high-end iPhone rumored for release this year had hit production problems that would keep it from reaching prospective buyers before Apple’s fiscal year wraps at the end of September. AAPL closed Friday at $156.39.

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"The companies filed a 44-page brief with the court on Monday night in a high-profile dispute over whether police should have to get a warrant before obtaining data that could reveal a cellphone user’s whereabouts. “That users rely on technology companies to process their data for limited purposes does not mean that they expect their intimate data to be monitored by the government without a warrant,” the brief said. The justices agreed last June to hear an appeal by Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted in 2013 in a series of armed robberies of Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores in Ohio and Michigan. Federal prosecutors helped place him near several of the robberies using “cell site location information” obtained from his wireless carrier. Carpenter claims that without a warrant from a court, such data amounts to an unreasonable search and seizure under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment. But last year a federal appeals court upheld his convictions, finding that no warrant was required. Carpenter’s case will be argued before the court some time after its new term begins in October. The case comes amid growing scrutiny of the surveillance practices of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies and concern among lawmakers across the political spectrum about civil liberties and police evading warrant requirements. Nathan Freed Wessler, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing Carpenter, said the companies’ brief represented a “robust defense of their customers’ privacy rights in the digital age.” Verizon’s participation in the brief was important, he added, given that it receives, like other wireless carriers, thousands of requests for cellphone location records every year from law enforcement. The requests are routinely granted. The U.S. Department of Justice, which is defending current law enforcement procedures in the case, declined to comment on Tuesday. Civil liberties lawyers have said police need “probable cause,” and therefore a warrant, to avoid constitutionally unreasonable searches. In their brief, the companies said the Supreme Court should clarify that when it comes to digital data that can reveal personal information, people should not lose protections against government intrusion “simply by choosing to use those technologies.” ","

Among the stocks in a correction were e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Goldman Sachs, Exxon Mobil, Starbucks and Netflix. Below is a table highlighting the S&P 500 components that are in a correction.

Leading the charge higher in 2017 has been the tech sector, which is up more than 20 percent year to date. However, there are more signs of an internal breakdown. Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners, pointed out in a note Thursday that less than 60 percent of stocks in the Russell 3000 are trading above their 200-day moving average, a key long-term technical metric. ""The Russell 3k represents 98% of U.S. equities. Bulls don't want to see this hold under 60% for too long,"" Krinsky said.

Anders Bylund,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. You already know Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is a huge cash machine. The all-American telecommunications company generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow and $45 billion in EBITDA profits over the last four quarters, culled from a $123 billion revenue stream. But do you know exactly how all of these dollars are being herded into Verizon's coffers? Let's review. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon structures its financial results under two operating segments: As you might have guessed after seeing the lopsided subscriber balance between Verizon's two divisions, the wireless and wireline segments provide wildly different contributions to Big Red's financial results: Business Segment Q2 2017 Revenue Revenue Growth (YOY) Q2 2017 Operating Income Wireless $21.3 billion (1.9%) $7.4 billion Wireline $7.8 billion 1.2% $68 million Data source: Verizon SEC filings. YOY = year over year. Of course, this is just a snapshot of a large company constantly changing its business mix and future plans. In 2016, Verizon sold its wireline operations in Texas, California, and Florida to smaller telecom Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). The move reduced Verizon's Fios services and and landline phone footprint by roughly 25%. This was probably a wise move, judging by the way Fios subscribers have been slipping away under Frontier's management. Not even high-quality wireline services are an easy sell these days. On the wireless side, the rampant two-stage growth of ubiquitous cellphone adoption and then smartphones for everyone has essentially stopped. Verizon's retail subscriber count increased by 1.2% in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period. At the same time, average revenue per contract customer fell by 7%. Nothing comes easy these days for Verizon -- the wireless market is getting saturated and price-sensitive. So the company is branching out in new directions. Verizon has tried its hand at several media publishing operations in recent years, including the high-priced acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!. A streaming video service partnership with Redbox was killed in its infancy, but Big Red is planning another streaming video launch later this year. The wireless business should get a second wind as Verizon rolls out a next-generation 5G network over the next several years, paired with exploding demand for connections related to the Internet of Things. The Verizon we'll see in 10 years should look very different from the business under that name today. But now you know how Verizon is making money in 2017, at least.

    How Verizon Communications Inc. Makes Most of Its Money -- The Motley Fool

  "
Keith Speights,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ""A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money."" Whether or not the late U.S. senator from Illinois Everett Dirksen actually every said those exact words, the sentiment is undeniable. Billions of dollars certainly qualify as real money by anyone's definition. Many top companies give plenty of real money back to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Five of the biggest dividend payers are ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Each of these stocks pays out over $8 billion each year in the form of dividends. Are these smart dividend stocks for investors right now? Image source: Getty Images. The biggest oil company in the world is also one of the biggest dividend payers. In 2016, ExxonMobil returned nearly $12.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. So far this year, the company has paid out more than $6.4 billion in dividends. ExxonMobil's dividend yield currently stands at 3.84%. The company has increased its dividend for 34 consecutive years. Can that streak continue? Probably so. Granted, ExxonMobil has been spending more to cover its dividend than it's make on the bottom line lately. However, the big oil company's massive cash flow should allow it to keep those dividend checks flowing for a long time to come. Smaller players in the oil and gas industry could be shaken out if oil prices dropped too much, but ExxonMobil has weathered plenty of tough times in the past and is well positioned to do so in the future. Telecommunications giant AT&T paid out nearly $11.8 billion in dividends last year. The company returned a little over $6 billion in the first six months of 2017. A&T's shareholders currently enjoy a dividend yield of 5.1%. Like ExxonMobil, the company is a member of the elite group of stocks known as Dividend Aristocrats. To make this list, a record of 25 consecutive years of dividend increases is required. AT&T has hiked its dividend 32 years in a row. Although AT&T uses a higher portion of its earnings to fund the dividend program than is ideal, the company should be in good shape to keep its solid history of dividend increases going. AT&T's cash flow remains very strong. The company could also get a boost from its planned acquisition of Time Warner. Another large telecommunications company is also a great dividend stock. Verizon Communications returned $9.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2016. So far in 2017, the company has paid out $4.7 billion in dividends. Verizon's current dividend yield of 4.72% looks quite attractive. The company doesn't have as impressive a track record of dividend increases as AT&T, however. Still, Verizon has upped its dividend payout for each of the past 10 years. Its payout ratio is less than 60%, which indicates flexibility for continued dividend hikes in the future. The wireless industry is super competitive. However, Verizon has staying power. The company's good second-quarter performance shows that it can make the changes needed to survive and thrive. Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) paid $8.5 billion in dividends during 2016. In the first half of this year, the company paid $4.3 billion in dividends. GE's dividend currently yields 3.72%. Although the company claimed an impressive streak of dividend increases in the past few decades, GE cut its dividend in 2009. GE had a few years of dividend hikes after then, but held its dividend payout steady from 2015 to 2016. Incoming CEO John Flannery will no doubt have his hands full. GE's last quarter was a big disappointment. Still, though, dividend-seeking investors shouldn't have significant reasons to worry. GE's cash flow remains solid. The company should be able to keep the dividends coming at least at current levels. Johnson & Johnson returned more than $8.6 billion to shareholders as dividends last year. So far in 2017, the healthcare giant has paid out $4.4 billion in dividends. J&J's dividend yield stands at 2.52%. While that's the lowest of the five dividend stocks on our list, the company has by far the best track record of dividend hikes. J&J has increased its dividend for a remarkable 54 consecutive years. I expect that streak to continue for a long time to come. J&J's cash flow is exceptionally strong. The company also boasts one of the best pipelines in big pharma despite a recent setback with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommending against approval of experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug sirukumab.

    5 Dividend Stocks That Pay Out Over $8 Billion a Year -- The Motley Fool

 ,08172017,Fool,08102017,"RootMetrics has come out with yet another report. This time instead of pitting each of the four US carriers against each other, it puts all of the metro areas in the nation against each other. And the top five markets might be a bit surprising to some. The market with the best overall mobile network is Lansing, Michigan, who actually has the 117th largest population in the nation. Lansing had an overall score of 98.5. That was followed by Indianapolis who had a score of 98.3, Modesto, California with a score of 98.2, Chicago, Illinois and Port St. Lucie, Florida which were tied for fourth place with a 98 score. It's important to talk about how RootMetrics ranks these metro areas. RootMetrics went to the top 125 most populated metro markets over the course of the first 6 months of 2017. And it tested network reliability, network speed, data speed, calls and texts, which all made up the overall performance score. The scores are based on an average taken from its tests on all four major US carriers - AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. Each of these networks are weighted by the percentage of customers it has in that metro market. For instance, if New York City has more Verizon customers than Sprint does, then Verizon's score would factor more into the overall score for the city than Sprint, AT&T or T-Mobile's would. Throughout its testing, RootMetrics found that bigger doesn't necessarily mean a better network. Out of the top 5 largest markets, only one of them were in the five best markets for mobile networks, which was Chicago, and it was tied for fourth. The two largest cities, New York City and Los Angeles respectively, ranked 74th and 77th out of 125, respectively. Which is pretty low, actually. The good thing here is that all 125 metro areas did get a score above 90, which means these mobile networks are actually fairly decent. While they may not be perfect in each of the 125 metro markets, they do offer some pretty good service. You can check out the full list from RootMetrics latest report by following the link in the source section below, and you can see where your city landed on the list.

Daniel B. Kline,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big wireless, or more clearly biggest wireless, has a problem. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) used to market their more-expensive services on the fact that they offered better networks. That's no longer clearly the case. Of the two widely accepted industry studies on the subject, one from RootMetrics shows the gap narrowing between the four major carriers. The second study, from OpenSignal, puts T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) in the lead. In reality ""best network"" can mean different things to different people. It depends a lot on where you live, where you travel, and how you use your phone. The one truth, and it's something Sprint (NYSE:S) has been pushing in its ads, is that all networks are now pretty much the same. Sprint has been using Verizon's former pitchman Paul Marcarelli to tout that all networks are pretty much the same. Image source: Sprint. People will pay more for better service. History has shown that customers will actually pay more for even the perception of better service. AT&T and Verizon used to actually have superior networks to T-Mobile and Sprint, but now they mostly only have the perception of being better. That's an image that has been fading as both low-cost carriers have been heavily marketing the idea that network quality is no longer a differentiating factor. As this idea becomes more accepted, one of two things, or perhaps both, will happen to AT&T and Verizon. They will either lose customers, lower prices, or suffer some combination of the two. It's nearly impossible to believe that consumers will pay higher prices for roughly the same thing once they understand that's what they are doing. All prices are as of 8/14/17 and subject to change. As you can see in the chart above, Sprint has the best deal (though it's a promotion that could end) while Verizon charges the most. T-Mobile's prices are actually lower than they appear because the company includes taxes and fees in its base price. Verizon and AT&T were forced by T-Mobile and Sprint into offering unlimited data plans costing them billions in overage charges. That pressure is going to increase as T-Mobile continues building a reputation as having the best combination of network and price while Sprint uses extreme discounting to win customers. T-Mobile has 17 straight quarters where it has added more than 1 million customers. Sprint has turned a corner and reported positive income for the first time in three years in Q1 and it has the stock price upside that the company is very much available for sale or merger. That could mean a merger with T-Mobile, or another buyer, but either scenario likely means bad news for AT&T and Verizon. Sprint and T-Mobile have the most upside in the wireless industry because they have built their business on what matters to consumers now. AT&T and Verizon built theirs on a network quality advantage that has either eroded greatly or no longer exists. That's going to lead to more pain for both companies as they adjust to a changed market, and T-Mobile and Sprint should profit from that pain. ","

Anders Bylund,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT) recently reported second-quarter results: GAAP earnings sunk deep into the red due to the satellite communications specialist's skyrocketing share prices. Nice problem to have, right? Here's what you need to know about its latest business update. Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Growth Revenue $28.1 million $25.1 million 12% Operating Income (Loss) ($12.5 million) ($16.4 million) N/A Net Income (Loss) ($98.7 million) $14.1 million N/A Adjusted EBITDA $8.2 million $5.1 million 61% Data source: Globalstar. Globalstar's bottom-line income swung from a $14 million profit to a $99 million loss due to large fluctuations in the company's portfolio of derivatives. Its debt portfolio includes many contracts that have derivative features, tying the value of the debt to the company's stock price, among other metrics. Share prices have gained 73% year-to-date as of Aug. 14, and those rising share prices triggered higher debt valuations, so Globalstar recorded a $77 million non-cash expense to account for this balance sheet update. A year earlier, share prices had been falling, and management recorded a $40 million non-cash gain on the same line. You win some, you lose some. The company's sales rose in some product categories, but fell in others. The biggest gains came from Globalstar's Duplex line of low-speed satellite telephony services and its SPOT anti-theft location tracking tool. Sales of both services rose by double-digit percentages to deliver 85% of total service revenues. But Spot and Duplex will likely be largely forgotten in a year or two, after Globalstar rolls out a new technology platform. Image source: Getty Images. The company has been planning a terrestrial network for years now, repurposing its satellite-grade radio spectrum licenses to deliver services from ground-based cell towers and small cell stations. Globalstar isn't planning a brand new wireless network to compete with AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), but more of a partnership approach. On the Q2 earnings call,  CEO Jay Monroe said that he is busy talking to potential partners who are already part of the wireless industry, offering them a new way to boost network speeds with the help of his company's spectrum licenses. ""In order to take best advantage in unlocked considerable value we've built up in Globalstar, from our U.S. spectrum, our international spectrum and our satellite network, we are in partnership discussions with numerous companies,"" Monroe said. Specifically, Globalstar's licenses and technologies are great for small-cell installations that serve up high-speed connections in a tight footprint. All of the major telecoms already make use of small-cell hubs, managed by the same companies that operate cell towers across the nation. Globalstar also aims to tap into the coming 5G wireless technology platform, increasing the speed and reliability of its small-cell connections many times over. I wouldn't be surprised to see American telecoms signing up for lots these service-boosting tools. It's also possible that Globalstar could emerge as a buyout target if one of the majors decides it wants this asset all to itself. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has rallied from one-month lows, and returned to the range. Near-term support (2,463) is followed by a firmer floor matching the former breakout point (2,453). The S&P’s nearly immediate reversal higher is technically constructive. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has maintained near-term support. Specifically, the index has notched consecutive session lows just above the 21,840 floor, detailed last week. Conversely, near-term overhead closely matches the 22,000 mark, and a retest is underway. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq has rallied respectably from one-month lows. In the process, it’s reached familiar resistance — the 6,342-to-6,344 inflection point — an area also illustrated below. The Nasdaq closed Monday at 6,340, and the retest remains underway. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has knifed to the 6,342 resistance from one-month lows. To reiterate, Monday’s close registered just two points lower. Separately, the Nasdaq’s primary uptrend has apparently absorbed its latest whipsaw under the 50-day moving average, currently 6,273. The prevailing series of “higher highs” and “higher lows” signals an uptrend. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark’s backdrop remains the strongest. As illustrated, the August downturn has been underpinned by 21,840 support — illustrated on the hourly chart — an area closely matching the 20-day moving average. The 20-day moving average is a widely-tracked near-term trending indicator, and the Dow’s sustained summer posture higher signals a strong uptrend. Similarly, the S&P 500’s bull trend has absorbed the August downdraft. Tactically, an inflection point spans from 2,449 to 2,453, levels matching the 50-day moving average (in blue) and the June peak. To reiterate, the S&P’s nearly immediate reversal to the former range is technically constructive. Though the bigger-picture technicals remain bullish, the prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. On a headline basis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has staged a garden-variety pullback, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have thus far weathered more aggressive August downturns.

Last week’s close (136.47) registered fractionally higher, and the small-cap benchmark has extended its rally attempt this week. Tactically, resistance matches the breakdown point (138.85), detailed previously, and a retest is underway. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has bottomed slightly atop the 200-day moving average, and rallied from two-month lows. Consider that the 200-day moving average is in play partly as a product of the mid-cap benchmark’s prolonged eight-month range. The sideways price action moves the average price of the prior 200 days closer to the current price. Still, the 200-day is a widely-tracked primary trending indicator, and the quality of the prevailing rally attempt is worth tracking. An eventual violation would likely raise a technical caution flag.

                                    remains comparably stronger. Familiar levels stand out: The SPY has reversed firmly atop resistance, preserving a bullish intermediate-term technical bias. Collectively, technical divergences have surfaced this month. The prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. The small- and mid-cap benchmarks remain comparably softer, though each has maintained the 200-day moving average, rising from two-month lows. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ pullback has been garden-variety, while the Nasdaq Composite’s bull trend trend has likely absorbed a respectable August downdraft. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. The nearly immediate reversal atop the 2,450 area — closely matching the 50-day moving average and the June peak — places the index on firmer technical ground. This area remains an inflection point, though the S&P 500’s intermediate-term bias remains bullish pending a more technically damaging downturn.

To start, the shares have asserted a range-bound, or trendless, six-month backdrop. The flatlining major moving averages bisect the range, exemplifying the absence of trend. Still, the shares have challenged the range top, and the retest is worth tracking. Major resistance is frequently cleared on the third of fourth test. More broadly, the shares have cleared a one-year downtrend illustrated on the two-year chart. The trendline, circa 120, pivots to support, and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation. Additional resistance matches the six-month range top — the 123.10-to-123.30 area — and an eventual close higher would more firmly signal a trend shift. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar has asserted a strong summer downtrend, and remains tenuously positioned.

                                    has formed a massive double top, the “M” formation defined by the 2015 and 2017 peaks. The pattern is underpinned by major support matching the 2016 low of 23.96. The August low rests at 23.98, and punctuates a successful initial retest. Separately, consider that the 200-week moving average (24.23) roughly matches support. Friday marked the first weekly close lower since 2014, a precarious posture. The late-2014 rally atop the 200-week moving average preceded a massive technical breakout. More plainly, the sluggish August price action leaves the dollar vulnerable to a potential downdraft. Tactically, resistance broadly spans from about 24.55 to 24.70, an area matching the breakdown point and trendline resistance. An eventual close higher would place the brakes on dollar bearish momentum. Also see the July 25 review. Moving to U.S. sectors, the transports have survived a major technical test.

The group has established support matching the 200-day, reaching a nearly three-week high this week.

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Tuesday that it was introducing a cheaper unlimited mobile data plan with some limits as it tries to lure customers away from rival wireless carriers. The plan, to be introduced on Wednesday, is priced at $75 a month for a single line and will include DVD-quality video streaming on smartphones rather than high definition. It allows Verizon to slow down consumers’ data speeds in times of congestion and does not include calling and data in Mexico and Canada. It also has slower mobile hotspot speeds of 600 kilobits per second. “While entry-level pricing appears more competitive, the changes more likely reflect the impact current plans are having on Verizon’s network,” Mike McCormack, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note. “The move also follows a trend of differentiating unlimited plans to manage congestion and monetize the network.” Verizon has been competing for customers with smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp in a saturated U.S. market for wireless service as most consumers already have cell phones. Other carriers have been launching aggressive promotions in recent months. Sprint said in June it was offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year to consumers who bring their own devices in a promotion aimed at Verizon subscribers. Verizon’s new cheaper plan is aimed at casual smartphone users versus customers who want to stream a lot of video, a Verizon spokeswoman said. The company also is introducing a higher-end unlimited data plan for $85 a month for a single line that includes HD-quality streaming on phones and calling, texting and data in Mexico and Canada, and mobile hotspot with up to 15 gigabytes of LTE speeds. The options will replace Verizon’s previous unlimited data plan, launched in February for $80 a month for a single line. Verizon shares were down 4 cents to $48.10 in morning trading. ","

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said SCA Promotions Inc was entitled to half of its $11 million contract with Yahoo as a cancellation penalty. It rejected Yahoo’s claim that Dallas-based SCA improperly leaked the promotion to Buffett and Berkshire, while trying to line up insurance coverage for the grand prize. Berkshire is well-known for insuring against potentially costly events with long odds, such as picking a perfect “March Madness” bracket, as the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament is known. “Any information that SCA disclosed to Berkshire Hathaway was not confidential information,” Circuit Judge Edith Brown Clement wrote for a three-judge panel. Because SCA had kept Yahoo’s $1.1 million deposit, the appeals court on Monday awarded it another $4.4 million. The decision reversed a lower court ruling ordering SCA to return $550,000 of the deposit to Yahoo. “It has been a long battle over what we thought was a simple contractual provision,” Jon Patton, a lawyer for SCA, said in an interview. “We’re pleased the court of appeals got this right.” Charles Stewart, an Oath spokesman, said the unit does not discuss litigation. Berkshire and Quicken announced their “Billion Dollar Bracket Challenge” three weeks after Yahoo and SCA signed their contract, and Yahoo quickly agreed to co-sponsor it. No one won the top prize. Berkshire now sponsors a bracket contest for its roughly 368,000 employees. This year, a West Virginia factory worker won $100,000 for correctly choosing winners of the tournament’s first 29 games. The case is SCA Promotions Inc v Yahoo Inc, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-11254. ","

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"SEOUL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd set out to wipe the slate clean in New York on Wednesday with its new Galaxy Note 8 “phablet,” hoping features like dual rear cameras and its biggest-ever screen will extinguish memories of the device’s fire-prone predecessor. Priced at $930 to $960 from network carriers, including a dialing and data plan, the Note 8 kicks off a new era of premium-priced handsets, which analysts expect to be joined by $1,000-plus iPhones next month. The unveiling came five months after the release of the Galaxy S8 smartphone. Analysts said brisk sales of that device indicate recovery in Samsung’s standing after battery fires prompted the October withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 just two months into sales, which cost the company billions of dollars. The recall and related safety concerns briefly cost Samsung its number one spot in the global smartphone rankings, according to researcher Counterpoint. It has since regained ground, with Strategy Analytics putting its second-quarter market share at 22 percent, more than Apple and China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] combined. “Of course no one will forget what happened last year, but we also won’t forget the millions that stuck with us,” DJ Koh, the company’s mobile chief, said at the launch event. The Note 8 will be sold from Sept. 15, Samsung said, without elaborating on place or price. Verizon Communications, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, said it will begin taking pre-orders on Thursday for the phone at a price of $960. Rival T-Mobile will offer it for $930. “I hate to say it, but $1,000 is becoming the new mark” for premium devices, said Bob O’Donnell of Technalysis Research. Samsung’s Note models usually sport bigger screens than the S series and come with a removable stylus. The trademark curved screen of the latest incarnation measures 6.3 inches (16 cm)corner to corner, just 0.1 inch bigger than the S8+. All of Samsung’s Galaxy line phones now have edge-to-edge displays. Apple’s new premium phone is expected to feature a similar display, but its update to the iPhone 7 might not, which could be a disadvantage for Apple, O’Donnell said. “The bar gets raised in terms of what people view as standard, and if you’re not meeting the bar, it’s going to have an impact,” he said. The South Korean company has been a main driver of growth in handsets with 6 inch-plus screens, a category Strategy Analytics expects to grow 10 times faster than the overall market next year. Samsung has also installed dual rear cameras on a handset for the first time, which promises improved photographic control and picture quality. But Samsung made no mention of so-called augmented reality features, in which digital images float over real-life objects on screen. Apple in June made that technology a major focal point of its next operating system. Other features include security technology, such as facial recognition and fingerprint and iris scanning, and artificial intelligence in the form of Samsung’s Bixby voice-command assistant. Samsung also took a jab at Apple at the launch event, mentioning its new phone will have a standard headphone jack, unlike the iPhone 7 with a single jack, a feature that has been criticized by some users.

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, August 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BB-' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Windstream Services, LLC and its subsidiary Windstream Holdings of the Midwest, Inc. The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. Windstream had approximately $5.6 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30, 2017. The Negative Outlook reflects slower-than-anticipated revenue and EBITDA stabilization for Windstream versus previous expectations. Fitch had expected Windstream to return to revenue growth in 2019, excluding the EarthLink merger and Broadview acquisition (the transactions). While Fitch expects cost synergies from the transactions to drive EBITDA stabilization by the end of the forecast, we do not expect revenue to return to growth over the forecast horizon. The slower path to revenue growth is mainly attributable to headwinds in the legacy businesses, including those acquired from EarthLink and Broadview. Fitch has revised its negative rating sensitivity for adjusted leverage to 5.5x from 5.7x-5.8x to reflect the challenging competitive and business environment, which, in turn, has led to continued delays in the return to revenue and EBITDA stability. Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline to the mid-5x range by the end of 2018 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions and will remain relatively flat over the remainder of the forecast horizon. We believe the enhanced financial flexibility provided by the elimination of Windstream's dividend (net of cash used towards the $90 million share repurchase program) serves as an additional avenue for modest deleveraging. KEY RATING DRIVERS Near-Term Pressures The company has experienced some pressure in the wholesale and CLEC segments as a result of competition and declining legacy services. Excluding the transactions, Windstream experienced a decline of 3.4% in service revenue in 2016. Sequential revenues have been relatively stable in the ILEC consumer and small/medium business segment, and the enterprise segment. Including the transactions, Fitch's base case assumes organic revenues continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. Revenue Mix Changes Windstream derives approximately two-thirds of its revenue from enterprise services, consumer high-speed internet services and its carrier customers (core and wholesale), which all have growing or stable prospects in the long term. Certain legacy revenues remain pressured, but Windstream's revenues should stabilize gradually as legacy revenues dwindle in the mix. Leverage Metrics Fitch estimates total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will be 5.8x in 2017, including both transactions. Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline to the mid-5x range by the end of 2018 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions and will remain relatively flat over the remainder of the forecast horizon. The enhanced financial flexibility provided by the elimination of Windstream's dividend (net of cash used for share repurchases) serves as an additional avenue for modest deleveraging. In calculating total adjusted debt, Fitch applies an 8x multiple to the sum of the annual rental payment to Uniti Group Inc. plus other rental expenses. Cost Synergies Support EBITDA Stabilization Windstream anticipates realizing more than $180 million of annual run-rate synergies three years after the close of the EarthLink merger and Broadview Networks acquisition (the transactions): $155 million in operating cost savings and $25 million in capital spending savings. Windstream expects to realize $115 million in operating cost synergies after two years following the transactions, with roughly $40 million-$50 million to be realized by the end of year three. In its base case assumptions for Windstream, Fitch has assumed moderately lower cost savings in each of the three years following the transactions. Integration Key to Success Fitch believes there are potential execution risks to achieving the operating cost and capital expenditure synergies following the close of the transactions. Initial savings are expected to be realized from reduced selling, general and administrative savings as corporate overheads and other public company cost savings arise. Over time, the company is expected to realize the benefits of lower network access costs as on-network opportunities lower third-party network access costs. Finally, benefits are gradually expected to be realized by IT and billing system cost savings. DERIVATION SUMMARY Windstream mainly targets small and mid-sized business (SMB) customers, and competes in a highly fragmented space with smaller and larger peers. Cable operators are increasingly focused on medium-sized businesses and compete against Windstream in the SMB segment. Cable operators can also target other larger regional customers, including governments and universities. Larger wireline operators typically focus on enterprise customers, slightly reducing the level of competition in the SMB market for Windstream. Windstream has a weaker competitive position in the higher-margin enterprise market based on the scale and size of its operations. Larger companies, including AT&T Inc. ('A-'/RWN), Verizon Communications Inc. ('A-'/Stable), and CenturyLink, Inc. ('BB+'/RWN), have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Fitch notes that CenturyLink will become the second largest enterprise service provider after it acquires Level 3 Communications, Inc. (LVLT; 'BB'/Stable), which is expected to close at the end of 3Q17. In comparison to Windstream, AT&T and Verizon maintain lower financial leverage, generate higher EBITDA margins and FCF, and have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification. Fitch also believes Windstream will have a weaker FCF profile than CenturyLink following the LVLT acquisition, as CenturyLink's FCF will benefit from enhanced scale and LVLT's net operating loss carryforwards. Windstream has less exposure to the more pressured residential market compared to its rural local exchange carrier (RLEC) peer, Frontier Communications Corp. ('B+'/Stable). Within the residential market, RLECs face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators with facilities-based triple-play offerings, including Comcast Corp. ('A-'/Stable) and Charter Communications Inc. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, CCO Holdings, LLC, 'BB+'/Stable). Cheaper alternative offerings such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. RLECs have had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats. As of year-end 2016, roughly 60% of Windstream's footprint overlapped with a national cable operator. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Windstream: --Revenue and EBITDA include the EarthLink merger as of Feb. 27, 2017 and the acquisition of Broadview on July 28, 2017. --Revenues total $5.9 billion and $6 billion in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Fitch expects organic revenue to continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. --2017 EBITDA margins are in the range of 22% to 23%, including the annual rental payment as an operating expense. Fitch expects EBITDA margins to expand by roughly 100 bps in 2018 as Windstream cost synergies are realized. --Fitch assumes Windstream will benefit from synergies post-acquisition, and has moderately reduced the amount of operating cost synergies from the $155 million anticipated by Windstream over the next three years. --Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline from 5.8x at year-end 2017 to the mid-5x range by the end of 2018 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Stabilization of the Rating -The company sustains total adjusted debt/EBITDAR under 5.5x. Fitch has revised the negative adjusted leverage threshold to 5.5x from 5.7x-5.8x owing to the challenging competitive and business environment. -Revenues and EBITDA would need to stabilize on a sustained basis. -Fitch would also need to see progress by Windstream in executing the integration of its recent transactions prior to stabilizing the rating. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -A negative rating action could occur if total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is 5.5x or higher for a sustained period. -The company no longer makes progress toward revenue and EBITDA stability due to competitive and business conditions. LIQUIDITY The rating is supported by the liquidity provided by Windstream's $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). At June 30, 2017, approximately $475 million was available. Revolver availability was supplemented with $25 million in cash at the end of 2Q17. The $1.25 billion senior secured RCF is in place until April 2020. Principal financial covenants in Windstream's secured credit facilities require a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75x and a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5x. The dividend is limited to the sum of excess FCF and net cash equity issuance proceeds subject to pro forma leverage of 4.5x or less. Outside of annual term-loan amortization payments, Windstream does not have any material maturities until 2020. Maturities in 2020 total $1.5 billion, including $750 million outstanding on the revolver at June 30, 2017. Fitch believes that Windstream's announcement in August 2017 to eliminate its dividend provides enhanced financial flexibility. We estimate post-dividend FCF in 2017 will range from $0 to negative $50 million, including integration capex and $50 million of spending related to the completion of Project Excel. Fitch expects capital spending to return to normal levels in the 13%-15% range after 2017 and for the company to return to positive FCF in 2018, with FCF margins in the low single digits over the forecast. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Windstream Services, LLC --IDR at 'BB-'; --$1.25 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2020 at 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior secured term loans at 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BB-/RR4'. Windstream Holdings of the Midwest, Inc. --IDR at 'BB-'; --$100 million secured notes due 2028 at 'BB-/RR4'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable.

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere loves tweaking Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and does so frequently on social media. He has relentlessly used his popular Twitter account (4.46 million followers) to go after the rival carrier. His Twitter bio notes that he is focused on ""scaring our competitors!"" Legere recently has pushed the idea that Verizon's network has struggled under the weight of offering unlimited data. The outspoken, sometimes outrageous CEO has shared images of his own company's analysis of third-party speed test data showing Verizon offering slower download speeds than T-Mobile's. That data also shows Legere's company on a steady upward trend while key rivals Verizon and AT&T move in the opposite direction. Legere tweeted this on Aug. 22, when Verizon introduced new unlimited data plans: @Verizon just limited EVERYTHING about its “unlimited” plan…your network needs help! Just admit it already! pic.twitter.com/ccqPspHYMX  He also linked to a report on The Verge about Verizon's new tiered unlimited plans. There's some validity to Legere's claims since the new plans do throttle video to differing degrees depending upon which offer customers sign up for. It's hard to see that as anything other than an attempt to manage network traffic, which is not in itself a bad thing, but it does give at least a suggestion of validity to Legere's claims that ""Verizon's network is crumbling from offering unlimited."" T-Mobile's CEO likes to taunt his rivals on social media. Image source: T-Mobile. Verizon split its consumer unlimited plans into two tiers. The first, Go Unlimited, offers one line for $75, two for $130, three for $150, and four for $160. That plan lines up pretty well with T-Mobile, which offers one line for $70, two for $100, three for $140, and four for $160. In all cases T-Mobile is actually cheaper because its plans include taxes and fees. Verizon also offers the higher-end Beyond Unlimited. That service, which adds free calling, text, and data in Mexico and Canada as well as other perks, starts at $85 for one line, $160 for two, $180 for three, and $200 for four. All T-Mobile customers get free calling, text and high-speed data in Mexico, and Canada. The caveat with Verizon's new plans is that they throttle data when it comes to video, but at different levels. Go Unlimited ""offers DVD-quality video (SD on phones (480p) and HD on tablets (720p)), while video on Beyond Unlimited is HD for phones and tablets (720p for phones; 1080p for tablets),"" according to a Verizon press release. T-Mobile's regular unlimited plans also typically stream video at DVD-quality 480p rates. The carrier also offers its higher-end ""One Plus"" service with HD streaming video for an extra $10 a month per line. Only one of Verizon’s plans give you the option to scale up to 1080p (except on tablet), T-Mobile allows users to scale up to 1080p on all their plans on any device, (though regular T-Mobile ONE users need to purchase an HD pass in order to do so). T-Mobile's ONE Plus users have no cap on video streaming speeds (other than deprioritization after hitting the top 3% limit) while Verizon caps everyone at 10mbps. Both carriers offer 3G speeds for mobile hot spots on their cheaper plans. Verizon's higher-end offer includes 15GB of 4G LTE streaming while T-Mobile's includes 10GB. Competitive pressure that drives down prices benefits customers. Verizon has built its business on having the best wireless network and Legere has been pushing the idea that the added traffic from offering unlimited data has helped cause that to no longer be the case. There's statistical validity to the idea that Verizon's network has suffered as one of two widely accepted industry reports, OpenSignal's State of Mobile Networks Report, showed that T-Mobile now had the best network. The second study, from RootMetrics, however, still ranks Verizon on top, though it does show T-Mobile improving. T-Mobile has essentially gone after Verizon for offering the same unlimited plans it offers, albeit at slightly higher prices when you factor in taxes and fees. Legere sees the new pricing tiers as dual admissions of weakness. First, Verizon is trying to lessen traffic on its network by throttling video when it previously did not do that. Second, by lowering prices, the carrier has seemingly admitted that its network alone may not be enough to win over or keep customers. It's hard to see an upside to any of this for Verizon. The company is being forced to lower prices by a gleeful, upstart rival. The winners here are Legere, whose company has led the industry by adding more than 1  million new customers every quarter for four years, and consumers, who have seen prices fall with no end to that in sight.

Daniel B. Kline,08242017,Fool,08172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Frontier Communication (NASDAQ:FTR) finished another quarter where it saw its subscriber count fall. That has become normal operating procedure for the company since it spent $10.54 billion buying Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida. In Q2, Frontier saw its total customer base drop from 5.2 million the previous quarter to 5.08 million. Again, the company not only lost 70,000 pay-television customers, it also dropped 100,000 broadband subscribers. The broadband losses are particularly bad because most pay-TV providers have seen losses in video, but have added internet customers. Frontier has been steadily getting smaller, but CEO Dan McCarthy has become very good at seeing the positive. He was no different in his remarks in the Q2 earnings release (courtesy of S&P Global Market Intelligence). ""We were pleased with the progress we made during the second quarter as we executed well on a number of key initiatives stabilizing operations,"" he said. ""In particular, we improved churn in our California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) market, saw progress in our commercial business, and continued to reduce costs, which resulted in increased adjusted EBITDA margins."" That's certainly putting a bright spin on the results. MCarthy and Frontier CFO Perley McBride shared much more during the company's earnings call with analysts following the release of the Q2 numbers. Frontier has been losing video subscribers as well as broadband customers. Image source: Getty Images. ""We continue to make good progress at stabilizing our consumer business, highlighted by the churn improvements in CTF FiOS as well as stable ARPC,"" said McCarthy. He also noted that ""the impact from the account cleanup is now entirely behind the company, and we are focused on getting voluntary churn back to benchmark level."" In the past two quarters the CEO blamed some of his company's customer loss on former Verizon customers who had never paid being removed. In Q2, customer churn improved to 2.24% (1.95% for Frontier Legacy and 2.69% for CTF operations) compared to 2.37% in Q1 2017 (1.95% for Frontier Legacy and 3.01% for CTF operations). Combined Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC) came in at $80.38, slightly down from $80.62 in the previous quarter. One of the biggest pain points in getting cable is waiting for a technician to come hook up your service. Frontier has a plan to address that. ""We remain on track to roll out our consumer-friendly FiOS self-installation process in the second half of the year, which we expect will improve customer satisfaction by providing customers the ability to complete FiOS installation on their own schedule,"" said McCarthy. ""We expect this process to increase efficiency and improve internal resource utilization by reducing our reliance on contractors."" Since buying the CTF properties Frontier has been aggressively cutting costs. A major reason for the Verizon purchase was giving Frontier the scale to operate more efficiently, and McCarthy said that has been happening. ""The company is starting to benefit from our overall efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives,"" he said. ""Specifically, during the quarter, we reported lower content cost partially due to our increased scale, a trend which we expect to continue for the remainder of the year."" Frontier was also able to lower its maintenance costs. McCarthy attributed that to ""to leveraging third-party partnerships as well as efficiencies from moving to a centralized reporting structure."" In recent quarters Frontier has been doing everything it can to conserve cash. That included cutting its dividend to $0.04 per share from $0.105 per share, where it has been for over two years. During the Q2 call McBride explained another financial move made by the company. Frontier obtained a $1.5 billion senior secured term loan B facility maturing on June 15, 2024. In June of 2017, Frontier used cash proceeds from the term loan B, offering to retire $763 million of 8.875% Notes due 2020 and $527 million of 8.500% Notes also due 2020. Our near-term maturity profile is manageable with $583 million of bonds due in Q4 of 2018, $434 million due in 2019, less than $1 billion due in 2020, and we continue to have an undrawn $850 million revolver. That's a detailed way to say that Frontier continues to enjoy flexibility from its lenders. That's especially important as the company struggles to reverse, or at least stabilize, its subscriber losses. ","

 ,08242017,Fool,08172017,"RootMetrics has come out with yet another report. This time instead of pitting each of the four US carriers against each other, it puts all of the metro areas in the nation against each other. And the top five markets might be a bit surprising to some. The market with the best overall mobile network is Lansing, Michigan, who actually has the 117th largest population in the nation. Lansing had an overall score of 98.5. That was followed by Indianapolis who had a score of 98.3, Modesto, California with a score of 98.2, Chicago, Illinois and Port St. Lucie, Florida which were tied for fourth place with a 98 score. It's important to talk about how RootMetrics ranks these metro areas. RootMetrics went to the top 125 most populated metro markets over the course of the first 6 months of 2017. And it tested network reliability, network speed, data speed, calls and texts, which all made up the overall performance score. The scores are based on an average taken from its tests on all four major US carriers - AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. Each of these networks are weighted by the percentage of customers it has in that metro market. For instance, if New York City has more Verizon customers than Sprint does, then Verizon's score would factor more into the overall score for the city than Sprint, AT&T or T-Mobile's would. Throughout its testing, RootMetrics found that bigger doesn't necessarily mean a better network. Out of the top 5 largest markets, only one of them were in the five best markets for mobile networks, which was Chicago, and it was tied for fourth. The two largest cities, New York City and Los Angeles respectively, ranked 74th and 77th out of 125, respectively. Which is pretty low, actually. The good thing here is that all 125 metro areas did get a score above 90, which means these mobile networks are actually fairly decent. While they may not be perfect in each of the 125 metro markets, they do offer some pretty good service. You can check out the full list from RootMetrics latest report by following the link in the source section below, and you can see where your city landed on the list.

Daniel B. Kline,08242017,Fool,08172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big wireless, or more clearly biggest wireless, has a problem. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) used to market their more-expensive services on the fact that they offered better networks. That's no longer clearly the case. Of the two widely accepted industry studies on the subject, one from RootMetrics shows the gap narrowing between the four major carriers. The second study, from OpenSignal, puts T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) in the lead. In reality ""best network"" can mean different things to different people. It depends a lot on where you live, where you travel, and how you use your phone. The one truth, and it's something Sprint (NYSE:S) has been pushing in its ads, is that all networks are now pretty much the same. Sprint has been using Verizon's former pitchman Paul Marcarelli to tout that all networks are pretty much the same. Image source: Sprint. People will pay more for better service. History has shown that customers will actually pay more for even the perception of better service. AT&T and Verizon used to actually have superior networks to T-Mobile and Sprint, but now they mostly only have the perception of being better. That's an image that has been fading as both low-cost carriers have been heavily marketing the idea that network quality is no longer a differentiating factor. As this idea becomes more accepted, one of two things, or perhaps both, will happen to AT&T and Verizon. They will either lose customers, lower prices, or suffer some combination of the two. It's nearly impossible to believe that consumers will pay higher prices for roughly the same thing once they understand that's what they are doing. All prices are as of 8/14/17 and subject to change. As you can see in the chart above, Sprint has the best deal (though it's a promotion that could end) while Verizon charges the most. T-Mobile's prices are actually lower than they appear because the company includes taxes and fees in its base price. Verizon and AT&T were forced by T-Mobile and Sprint into offering unlimited data plans costing them billions in overage charges. That pressure is going to increase as T-Mobile continues building a reputation as having the best combination of network and price while Sprint uses extreme discounting to win customers. T-Mobile has 17 straight quarters where it has added more than 1 million customers. Sprint has turned a corner and reported positive income for the first time in three years in Q1 and it has the stock price upside that the company is very much available for sale or merger. That could mean a merger with T-Mobile, or another buyer, but either scenario likely means bad news for AT&T and Verizon. Sprint and T-Mobile have the most upside in the wireless industry because they have built their business on what matters to consumers now. AT&T and Verizon built theirs on a network quality advantage that has either eroded greatly or no longer exists. That's going to lead to more pain for both companies as they adjust to a changed market, and T-Mobile and Sprint should profit from that pain. ","

Eric Volkman,08242017,Fool,08172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Like most of the investing world, Warren Buffett thrives on dividends. The veteran financier and leading light of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) receives plenty of them; in the second quarter, for example, Berkshire was set to reap nearly $900 million in such payouts. Although Buffett prefers that the companies under Berkshire's wing reinvest their profits into growing their respective businesses rather than paying dividends, he is fond of getting such distributions from his stocks. The proof of this sentiment is in Berkshire's top two dividend yielders, both of which pay out handsomely. Here are a few words about this generous duo. Image source: Getty Images. Cellphone provider Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is no longer an important position for Berkshire Hathaway. Following a big sell-off earlier this year, Buffett's conglomerate held only 928 shares as of the end of June. That makes it Berkshire's lightest holding in terms of share count, by far (it holds over 59,000 shares of the next-lightest, UPS). Funnily enough, Verizon is the stock that yields the most (4.8%) in the company's immense portfolio. Although Berkshire won't benefit much from owning such a modest amount of its stock, the big telecom -- half of what is effectively a duopoly, along with AT&T, atop its industry -- certainly still has much potential. The company has invested heavily on content, buying AOL in 2015 and Yahoo! the following year to create the Oath media unit. This should make its offerings more attractive for subscribers, and its service ""stickier."" It also delivered an impressive second quarter, thanks in no small part to a new unlimited plan, which helped rope in thousands of new customers. Finally, it's working hard to develop its Internet of Things offerings, a potentially thick revenue stream. That potential should keep the market very interested in the stock and support its price. This will be aided enormously by the dividend, which should be at least sustainable given that the company's latest quarterly payout ratio was 60%. STORE Capital (NYSE:STOR) was plucked from relative obscurity to stock stardom after Berkshire revealed earlier this year that it bought nearly 10% of the company's shares. STORE Capital is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in retail properties. Although it's been an unheralded player in its segment (at least until Buffett got his hands on it), the company does its thing extremely well and knows how to make a buck. Total assets and revenue have risen lately at impressive rates. This, naturally, filters down into solid bottom-line performance. The company's funds from operations (the most accurate profitability metric for REITs) have also seen a nice climb, rising 30% on a year-over-year basis to more than $72 million in Q2. STORE Capital's store is very much open for business these days. The company's overall occupancy rate during said quarter was 99.5%, a huge proportion given the high number of properties (1,770) that it manages. On top of that, an aggressive acquisition policy has helped the REIT post those excellent gains, and the new assets coming into the portfolio should continue to aid growth. To maintain their status as REITs, companies like STORE Capital are required to distribute nearly all of their net profits in the form of dividends. Buffett and his fellow shareholders received $0.29 per share for the quarter, putting the company's yield at just over 4.6% on the most recent closing stock price. ","

"John Rosevear, Keith Noonan, and Steve Symington",08242017,Fool,08172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Still, there are some companies that seem like very good bets to be around for a while. A few are even good bets for growth over the next decade-plus. Here's why our Foolish investors think Corning (NYSE:GLW), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) are good choices for long-term-minded investors now. Steve Symington (Corning): Founded in 1851, Corning arguably knows better than any other company what it takes to survive and thrive in today's fast-changing world. And the glass technologist is not only investing heavily in both its core business and future growth opportunities, but also promises to reward investors with aggressive capital returns in the process. In late 2015 the company outlined a strategic capital-allocation framework with a goal of returning at least $12.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases by 2019. In addition, Corning promised to invest $10 billion in the business through research, development, and engineering. Corning is on track to meet both goals as of its most recent quarterly report, two weeks ago. Corning's optical-fiber technology has driven big growth for its Optical Communications segment. Image source: Corning, Inc. What's more, Corning's strength stems from multiple market verticals. In recent years Corning has made most of its money from its core Display Technologies segment, which includes specialized glass substrates for liquid crystal displays on smartphones, computers, and TVs. But as telecommunications giants build out their next-generation fiber networks -- Verizon (NYSE:VZ), for example, committed to purchase at least $1.05 billion in optical fiber and associated products from Corning earlier this year -- Corning's thriving Optical Communications business finally exceeded Display Technologies in terms of revenue last quarter. Meanwhile, Corning is enjoying strong growth from its Specialty Materials business, thanks to adoption of its popular scratch- and shatter-resistant Gorilla Glass products in next-gen smartphones and tablets. To that end, Corning also sees future applications for various glass products aimed at revolutionizing the automotive industry -- that is, outside of its glass ceramic substrates and particulate filters already found in millions of vehicles' pollution-control systems. And the company recently unveiled a cutting-edge pharmaceutical-packaging solution, dubbed Corning Valor Glass, which was the product of close collaboration with Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). In short, we're talking about a growing, solidly profitable 166-year-old company whose reach extends deep into multiple promising industries. And I see no reason Corning won't still be innovating and generating shareholder value in 2030. Keith Noonan (Disney): The market hasn't responded favorably to Disney's most recent quarterly results and the accompanying announcement that it will be shifting content away from Netflix in order to start its own streaming service. In fact, the company saw its worst trading day in over a year -- with shares down roughly 5% since its Aug. 8 earnings report -- but investors shouldn't be deterred by recent stock turbulence. On the contrary, the sell-off presents a buying opportunity for what looks to be the best long-term stock in the media industry. While Disney's $1.8 billion investment to purchase the remaining stake in streaming company BAMTech and move away from an already successful relationship with Netflix create near-term uncertainty, the company believes that having its own over-the-top offering will ultimately be much more profitable. There are compelling reasons to think that will be the case. Disney now trades at roughly 17 times forward estimated earnings, and also has considerable appeal as a dividend growth stock. The recent sell-offs have pushed the stock's yield to 1.5%, the company has boosted its payout 108% over the last five years, and, with a payout ratio of just 26.5%, Disney has a lot flexibility to deliver payout growth going forward. Between its attractive valuation, income generation, and competitive advantages, Disney looks like a stock for the ultra-long term. John Rosevear (Amazon.com): It might have started out as a quirky online bookstore, but two decades later, Amazon.com has become the 800-pound gorilla of retail -- and it might just be getting started. Already, Amazon is a dominant player in a slew of retail categories: Clothing, tools, shoes, computers and consumer electronics, housewares, and a long list of others (including books). That list will only get longer over time. For instance, Amazon has recently made big moves into segments like auto parts, health and beauty, and even groceries, with its pending purchase of Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM). Amazon Vehicles is just an information center right now, but it's one piece of evidence suggesting that the online retail giant is pondering a move into auto sales. Image source: Amazon.com But CEO Jeff Bezos is far from satisfied. There are growing signs that Amazon is looking to break into one of the toughest retail spaces of all, auto sales. And today's Amazon stretches well beyond what we used to call ""e-commerce,"" with a hugely important web services division and big investments in artificial intelligence that will open many more doors for growth well into the future. Of course, there are caveats. Unlike its consumer goods, which are usually very competitively priced, Amazon's stock isn't cheap and it could take a hit if and when the market gets choppy. And Amazon's profits remain thin because of Bezos' relentless push to reinvest in future growth. Still, this is a company that is clearly built to last a long time -- and just as clearly, one that's set to grow like few others for many years to come. ","

Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) released impressive fiscal second-quarter 2018 results on Aug. 24 after the market closed, highlighting hundreds of new customers across various disparate industries. This also marks the 11th time in as many reports that the operational-intelligence platform specialist has beaten expectations. Let's have a closer look at what Splunk accomplished over the past few months. Image source: Splunk. Fiscal Q2 2018* Fiscal Q2 2017 Year-Over-Year Growth Revenue $280.0 million $212.8 million 31.6% GAAP net income (loss) ($83.5 million) ($86.6 million) N/A GAAP earnings (loss) per share ($0.60) ($0.65) N/A Data source: Splunk. *For the quarter ended July 31,2017. Splunk CEO Doug Merritt stated: I am pleased with the solid sales execution in Q2, particularly our results in EMEA [Europe, the Middle East, and Africa]. As I traveled across Europe, Asia, and North America over the last two months, I was excited to see businesses, governments and universities adopting Splunk across multiple departments and use cases. Customer success and product innovation are at the heart of what we do. For the fiscal third quarter of 2018, Splunk expects revenue to be between $307 million and $309 million -- above the $306.9 million investors were anticipating -- with adjusted operating margin of 8%. As a result, Splunk once again increased its full fiscal-year 2018 guidance to call for billings of $1.450 billion, up from $1.425 billion previously, and revenue of between $1.210 billion and $1.215 billion, up from $1.195 billion previously. Splunk also reiterated its expectation for full fiscal-year adjusted operating margin of roughly 8%. All things considered -- and though it shouldn't be terribly surprising, given Splunk's propensity for under-promising and over-delivering -- there was nothing not to like about this report from an investor's perspective. Customers from a wide variety of industries continue to adopt Splunk's solutions in droves. And the company is translating that adoption to stellar revenue growth as its GAAP losses continue to narrow. With shares of Splunk down around 9% over the past three months in spite of its quarterly beat and raise in May, it was hard to blame the market for bidding up the stock after hours following the earnings release.

More importantly, Verizon stock had been stuck in a rut thanks to negativity surrounding its wireless business. Most notably, Verizon’s first-quarter report in April showed the company lost wireless customers on a net basis for the first time ever. The July 27 report that lifted Verizon stock showed both prepaid and postpaid connections on the rise, with churn rates under control. The result has been a more than 10% run for Verizon shares in about two weeks. Wireless undoubtedly is the future of telecom. So the fact that Verizon could counter the negativity about its wireless operations really helps counter the bearish narrative that existed previously.

                                    hasn’t had much to write home about since 2015. For starters, the company’s once-impressive growth rate slowed considerably, while the much-hyped biotech sector started to look overvalued and fall out of favor as the market went “risk off.” Since then, a few biotech names have managed to get their mojo back, but Illumina has failed to re-attain its share-price highs of 2015. All that could change this year, as the company seems to be getting back into a groove after a rather volatile 2016. For starters, Illumina won back investors with one of the best January performances on Wall Street. That was in part because of strong fourth-quarter 2016 earnings and optimistic guidance. Coupled with a general hope of deregulation thanks to a GOP-controlled Congress, investors were pleased. In the absence of any news to spark another leg up, Illumina stock has crawled ahead with the market. But in early August when the company offered up a solid second-quarter report that included a nice earnings beat, robust revenue growth, and better-than-expected guidance, it was off to the races. Illumina stock popped by double digits in a single session and proved it still can deliver dynamic returns to biotech investors.

Negative news items included a lowered outlook in February, miserable earnings in March despite the warning, and a decision to stop discounting handbags that had many investors worried about irreparable harm to sales. But Kors has proved the naysayers wrong. For starters, its August earnings wowed investors as adjusted EPS blew away expectations. And while revenue declined, it was better than Wall Street expected. So were same-store sales, which dipped just 5.9% instead of a predicted 9.2% decline. That sparked a 20%-plus rally for the stock in short order. The icing on the cake for investors was the recently announced acquisition of luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo, hinting at a move to protect margins and spur future growth.

But since then, Ralph Lauren stock has mounted a minor comeback. As with Michael Kors, earnings had a big role in recent gains. Ralph Lauren erased last year’s quarterly loss in a big way, posting significant profits that trounced expectations. And while revenue declined again, it also beat forecasts. The groundwork for Ralph Lauren’s recovery had been coming for some time, as the company started to recover on hopes that newly named CEO Patrice Louvet will bring a fresh perspective based on his strong consumer products and brand experience at Procter & Gamble Co.

                                     stock saw decent momentum after Election Day thanks to a “Trump bump.” Talk of deregulation and greater defense spending naturally spurred this aerospace stock, as it did many of Boeing’s peers. Still, after health-care legislation died with a whimper, and now that budget talks look increasingly dicey, many investors have been wondering if Boeing is a safe bet. After all, this is a company that has seen declining profits and a stagnant top line for some time — and while it may have looked like a bargain in 2016, there were reasons to wonder if the run was over. Boeing put those concerns to rest, however, with a raised outlook and impressive earnings beat at the end of July. Since that report, Boeing stock has tacked on another 13%. A huge dividend increase earlier this year, to $1.42 per share quarterly from $1.09, is even more reason to stick with this stock. Yes, short-term drivers propelled the run at the end of 2016, but improving fundamentals and continued momentum suggest that Boeing shares are going to remain aloft.

                                    hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has maintained notable support, circa 2,416, a level matching the June FAANG-induced low. The question now is the rally attempt’s quality. Near-term resistance (2,437) is followed by firmer overhead matching the former breakout point, the June peak of 2,453. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has narrowly maintained its first notable support. The specific area matches its breakout point — Dow 21,682 — better illustrated on the daily chart. Conversely, the Dow’s near-term breakdown point (21,840) pivots to resistance, and the initial retest should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has reached one-month lows. Still, a retest of the 50-day moving average from underneath, currently 6,271, is underway early Tuesday. On further strength, major overhead matches the 6,344 area, also illustrated on the daily chart below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has stalled at the 6,342 breakdown point, and violated the 50-day moving average, currently 6,271. More broadly, the prevailing downturn originates from the late-July key reversal (the long red bar) and includes two directionally sharp August downdrafts. The intervening rally attempts have thus far been flat. Bearish intermediate-term price action. Tactically, a rally atop the 50-day would mark technical progress, while a close atop the 6,342 breakdown point would more firmly neutralize the August downturn. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains the strongest major benchmark. To reiterate, the index has narrowly maintained its breakout point — Dow 21,682 — an area closely followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 21,642. Viewed in isolation, the Dow’s August downturn has inflicted limited true technical damage. Meanwhile, the S&P 500’s jagged August downturn has inflicted damage. Namely, the S&P has violated its breakout point (2,453) a level closely matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,450. Conversely, significant support broadly spans from 2,405 to 2,416, levels matching the breakout point, and the June FAANG-induced low. This week’s low currently rests at 2,417. Broadly speaking, the August downturn remains uneven — the technical backdrop is not one-size-fits-all — though damage has been inflicted. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have tagged one-month lows, punctuating recent violations of the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials remain comparably resilient, maintaining the first well-defined support.

                                   has violated the 200-day moving average, currently 136.95. The downturn originates from a failed test of the breakdown point (138.85), nearly to the decimal. Bearish price action. Delving deeper, important support broadly spans from about 132.40 to 133.70. This area defines the range bottom, and matches the 2017 low. A violation opens the path to less-charted territory, and potentially material follow-through. Conversely, a nearly immediate rally atop the 200-day would place the brakes on bearish momentum. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has registered three straight closes under the 200-day moving average, currently 310.50. Here again, the downturn punctuates a failed test of the breakdown point. More broadly, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have concurrently registered three-month lows. (Separately, consider that the iShares Russell 2000 ETF was narrowly negative year-to-date at Monday’s close — by a two-cent margin. The MDY has registered about a 2.2% year-to-date gain.)

                                   remains comparably stronger than the small- and mid-caps. The 200-day moving average, currently 234.90, remains distant. Still, the SPY has violated two key inflection points: Moreover, the tandem August downturns — the violations of support — have been fueled by volume spikes, encompassing a lighter-volume rally attempt. Bearish near-term price action. A retest of the 50-day moving average from underneath is underway early Tuesday, and should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Collectively, the widely-tracked U.S. benchmarks continue to diverge. The prevailing technical backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. As it applies to the S&P 500, a near- to intermediate-term consolidation phase is underway. These respective trends are in flux. Recall that notable support spans from 2,405 to 2,416, levels matching the breakout point, and the June FAANG-induced low. See Friday’s review. The S&P has bottomed this week at 2,417 — matching support — and the question now is the rally attempt’s quality. When gauging the quality, notable S&P resistance spans from 2,450 to 2,453, levels matching the 50-day moving average, and the June peak. A retest from underneath is within view early Tuesday, and worth tracking. To reiterate, a nearly immediate reversal atop the 2,450 breakout point would place the S&P on firmer technical ground. Beyond technical levels, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop has softened, as detailed Friday, and the August rally attempts have thus far lacked quality. The S&P 500’s more important longer-term trend remains firmly bullish. See also: Bull trend intact, S&P 500 absorbs mid-August plunge.

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"(Reuters) - Fusion Telecommunications International Inc plans to buy the cloud and business services unit of Birch Communications in an all-stock deal that it said would broaden its customer base. Fusion shares rose 70 percent to $2.09 on Monday on news of the deal, which would form one of the largest North American cloud services providers, with more than 150,000 business customers, 30 data centers and 31,000 miles of fiber network. Fusion’s management will run the combined company. However, private equity firm Birch Equity Partners LLC, Birch’s majority owner, will get 75 percent of the new company, while Fusion shareholders will have only 25 percent. Together, the company expects annual revenue of $575 million. The deal is the latest example of consolidation in the business communications sector as smaller vendors like Fusion try to lure enterprise customers from larger companies such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc by offering integrated voice, data and cloud services. Last year CenturyLink Inc announced plans to buy Level 3 Communications Inc for $24 billion. The deal is still awaiting regulatory clearance. “We are picking up a much broader set of customers,” said Fusion Chief Executive Officer Matthew Rosen, who will become the combined company’s chairman. “We’ll be able to cross-sell and upsell everything from contact center software to storage, disaster recovery and other cloud solutions.” The deal does not include Birch’s less-profitable business of providing communications services to consumers. Birch Equity and other Birch shareholders will get about 73 million Fusion shares that the companies said would be worth $3.85 each, or about $281 million in total. That would be a premium of more than 200 percent to Fusion’s closing price on Friday. Fusion has agreed to assume Birch’s existing debt of about $458 million. It will refinance that along with its own debt of about $101 million. “We believe that given the cash flows, we are in a good position,” Rosen said. Birch, a private nationwide telecommunications company founded in Atlanta in 1996, had already been diversifying. It bought cloud provider CBeyond for $323 million in 2014 to expand its services to small- and medium-size businesses. Fusion, a smaller New York-based company with a market capitalization of $47.94 million on Monday, has done several smaller deals as well, such as the $28 million acquisition of business communications firm Apptix last year. Fusion’s financial adviser was FTI Consulting, while Birch’s was Moelis & Co. ","

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc said on Wednesday that it is expanding its 5G trials to include three new U.S. cities by the end of the year as part of its push to develop a next-generation network. The trials will test a faster broadband service where the last leg of the connection is delivered via a radio signal to a home or business using high-band wireless airwaves known as millimeter wave. Participants in the trials will be able to stream AT&T’s DirecTV Now service over a 5G connection as well as experience shorter lag times for uses such as video conferencing and virtual-reality gaming. The No. 2 wireless carrier, which is currently conducting similar trials in Austin, will extend them to Waco, Texas; Kalamazoo, Michigan; and South Bend, Indiana, the company said. In those markets, AT&T plans to have more trial participants, which could include small businesses, universities and churches, and larger coverage areas. The service, called fixed wireless, is expected to be the first application of 5G technologies and could eventually be a competitor to the high-speed Internet services offered by cable companies. It could also be less costly to the companies than deploying fiber to the home. The tests are intended to help AT&T determine whether millimeter wave spectrum can travel through foliage and buildings, as well as how weather affects the signal. The company expects deployment of the service as early as late 2018. It is working with Ericsson, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Nokia and Intel Corp on the trials. Rival wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc has said it is conducting pre-commercial trials for fixed wireless in 11 cities and that it expects a 2018 launch. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in an interview that fixed wireless service would likely serve niche markets where there is no existing infrastructure for broadband. “If there is physical infrastructure, the business case for fixed wireless becomes pretty challenging,” he said. “You’re more likely to get more reliable service over fiber.” Still, both AT&T and Verizon have been buying millimeter wave spectrum in preparation for fixed wireless and recently got into a bidding war over an asset. In May, Verizon snapped up wireless spectrum holder Straight Path Communications Inc in a $3.1 billion deal, roughly double AT&T’s initial offer. ","

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said Yahoo must face nationwide litigation brought on behalf of well over 1 billion users who said their personal information was compromised in three massive data breaches. Wednesday night’s decision from U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, was a setback for efforts by Verizon Communications Inc, which paid $4.76 billion for Yahoo’s Internet business in June, to limit potential liability. The breaches occurred between 2013 and 2016, but Yahoo was slow to disclose them, waiting more than three years to reveal the first. Revelations about the scope of the cyber attacks prompted Verizon to lower its purchase price for the company. In a 93-page decision, Koh rejected Yahoo’s contention that breach victims lacked standing to sue, and said they could pursue some breach of contract and unfair competition claims. “All plaintiffs have alleged a risk of future identity theft, in addition to loss of value of their personal identification information,” the judge wrote. Koh said some plaintiffs also alleged they had spent money to thwart future identity theft or that fraudsters had misused their data. Others, meanwhile, could have changed passwords or canceled their accounts to stem losses had Yahoo not delayed disclosing the breaches, the judge said. While many claims were dismissed, Koh said the plaintiffs could amend their complaint to address her concerns. “We believe it to be a significant victory for consumers, and will address the deficiencies the court pointed out,” John Yanchunis, a lawyer for the plaintiffs who chairs an executive committee overseeing the case, said in an interview. “It’s the biggest data breach in the history of the world.” Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni said the New York-based company declined to comment on pending litigation. Yahoo is now part of a Verizon unit called Oath. In court papers, Yahoo had argued that the breaches were “a triumph of criminal persistence” by a “veritable ‘who’s who’ of cybercriminals,” and that no security system is hack-proof. On March 15, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two officers of the Russian Federal Security Service and two hackers in connection with the second breach in late 2014. The August 2013 breach affected more than 1 billion accounts, while the 2014 breach affected more than 500 million. A third breach occurred in 2015 and 2016. The case is In re: Yahoo Inc Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-md-02752. ","

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House committee said on Wednesday it has canceled a planned hearing on Sept. 7 on the future of internet access rules after no companies publicly committed to appearing. Among those who had been invited in late July to share thoughts before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee were the chief executives of Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. The hearing had the potential to be one of the most high-profile appearances of major tech CEOs on Capitol Hill. Zach Hunter, a spokesman for the committee’s chairman, U.S. Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, said the hearing was postponed because of talks over the future rules. “As negotiations progress on a permanent solution for net neutrality that ensures a free and open internet, the committee will postpone the original hearing in order to allow talks between stakeholders to continue,” he said. Republican lawmakers had hoped to bring top executives from tech companies and internet providers to testify publicly in a bid to garner support for a deal to set permanent rules on the future of internet access after a more than decade-long fight. No company had publicly committed to testify and many firms were privately reluctant to testify. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission under President Donald Trump has been moving to scrap rules implemented under the Obama administration that regulated broadband internet like a utility. The rules bar providers from blocking or slowing websites, or allowing websites to pay for “fast lanes” over competitors. Internet providers and major tech companies have been sharply divided over the issue. Many providers want Congress to step in and write permanent rules, while internet firms say the regulations are critical to preserving the open internet. Major internet firms and service providers have been meeting with committee aides in recent weeks, but Democrats have not agreed to work toward a compromise bill, arguing the Obama rules should be left in place. Republicans on the House panel plan to consider a bill to reauthorize the FCC next month that could address internet access rules. Other corporate chiefs invited to testify included the heads of Comcast Corp Netflix Inc and Charter Communications Inc. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to withdraw the 2015 order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. The FCC is considering whether it has the authority to limit internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “paid prioritization,” and whether it should keep any protections in place. ","

Adam Levy,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. After blowing away expectations with its second-quarter earnings report, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) showed the strength of its brand and network are still well intact. Given the option between unlimited plans from all four major carriers, customers increasingly chose Verizon's network. It managed to add over 600,000 postpaid customers and over 350,000 phone customers, specifically. While not the most in the industry -- that title still belongs to T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) -- it's a big step up from last year and the previous quarter. And it points to both the success and the importance of Verizon's unlimited data plan, which it unveiled in February. But Verizon is taking steps to moderate the amount of data on its network. It's launching a new, less expensive plan ($75 per month for a single line) that throttles video quality down to 480p. Subscribers that want high-definition video can opt for a more expensive plan ($85 per month), but even then, they're limited to 720p on phones and 1080p on tablets. This is just another sign that Verizon is having trouble keeping up with the data demands of its customers. Image source: Verizon. Verizon's new throttled video plans are an attempt to manage the amount of data clogging its pipes. It's not a unique strategy. In fact, when T-Mobile introduced unlimited video streaming for all of its customers a couple years ago, it relied on throttled video quality to do it. The move actually ended up saving the company bandwidth. Verizon is likely hoping for similar results. Verizon's network speeds started suffering as soon as it started offering an unlimited data option, according to recent test results from Ookla. Verizon isn't alone. AT&T (NYSE:T) is also showing signs of a slowdown following the introduction of its unlimited plans. Verizon's network strength is integral to its success. It's part of the company's ad campaigns and its branding. While it's constantly working to improve LTE capacity and speed, its attention is now split between it and 5G. While Verizon is certainly looking to free up additional bandwidth on its network with the move to a tiered unlimited plan, it may also be an appropriate response to recent pricing moves from the competition. T-Mobile upped its One Plus plan by $5 to match Verizon's $80 per month price point. The new pricing puts a bit more distance between T-Mobile's and Verizon's, maintaining its pricing premium. Meanwhile, AT&T's top-tier plan starts at $90 per month, still $5 more than the new $85 per month Verizon plan. That plan, however, also includes free HBO and a $25 discount on any AT&T television bundle. AT&T is offering a lot more value; Verizon is offering its network, which is still No. 1 for now. Although Verizon is offering a pricier option, it's likely a lot of users will opt to switch to the less expensive unlimited plan. Current subscribers can opt to keep their current plan, but they'll still be subjected to the same throttling as the $85 per month plan. Only new subscribers who want high definition video will have to pay the higher price. As a result, Verizon could face continued pressure on its service revenue per user. Management said it expects the metric to start recovering in the second half of the year, but this move could put a damper on that recovery. Management expects service revenue to improve as more subscribers switch from data buckets to unlimited data. To be sure, the new lower-tier unlimited plan is still more expensive than most of Verizon's old data plans. But that trend could be offset by early unlimited adopters downgrading to save a bit more money while staying on Verizon's network. Service revenue will be something to keep an eye on through the second half of the year, and be on the lookout for semi-annual network quality reports from third parties to see if Verizon's network strength is holding up with the influx of unlimited data subscribers.

"Timothy Green, George Budwell, and Rich Smith",08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's important to stick with what you know when it comes to investing. U.S retirees buying only U.S. stocks makes sense with that in mind. However, a whole world of international stocks awaits investors willing to venture outside the United States. There are risks, of course, but there are also opportunities. We asked three of our Foolish investors to each put forth an international stock that would be well suited for a retiree's portfolio, safety being the watchword. Here's why retirees should consider Unilever (NYSE:UL), Public Joint-Stock Company Mobile TeleSystems (NYSE:MBT), and Sanofi (NYSE:SNY). Image source: Getty Images. Tim Green (Unilever): For retirees looking for a relatively safe international stock, Dutch-British consumer-products giant Unilever fits the bill. The company is massive, generating 52 billion euros of revenue last year, and it's wildly profitable, with operating margins consistently in the mid-teens. Unilever owns a massive number of brands, including Dove, Hellmann's, Lipton, Ben & Jerry's, and countless more. According to the company, 2.5 billion people use Unilever products on any given day. Unilever stock isn't particularly cheap, trading for around 25 times earnings, but paying up for a massive stable of popular and durable brands makes sense. Unilever pays a dividend, with the ADR currently yielding about 2.6%, providing a nice income for retiree shareholders. Currency effects can cause swings in the dividend, but on a constant-currency basis, Unilever's dividend has increased by 7.4% annually between 2010 and 2016. Unilever's global scale and vast collection of powerful brands give the company important competitive advantages. There's always the risk that some of its brands become stale and susceptible to upstart competitors. But given the breadth of Unilever's business, the company should be able to continue producing exceptional profits for the foreseeable future. Those dividend payments won't stop anytime soon. Rich Smith: (Public Joint-Stock Company Mobile TeleSystems): What should an investor look for in an international stock? At the risk of stating the obvious, I'd say an investor should look for something that he or she cannot find just as easily right here at home. Think about it. If I tell you that AT&T (NYSE:T) or Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are great stocks for retirees to own, you might respond, ""Sure! They both pay good, strong dividends of about 5%.They're not unreasonably expensive at about 12.6 times forward earnings. Those sound like fine stocks for a retiree to own."" Or you might say, ""No way! T-Mobile is eating their lunch. AT&T and Verizon are doomed!"" So what are your incentives for buying Mobile TeleSystems instead of a domestic telecom? Well, the dividend for one thing. Mobile TeleSystems pays its shareholders a 10% dividend, which is roughly twice the payout at AT&T or Verizon. Growth is another factor in its favor. Analysts expect Mobile TeleSystems to grow its earnings at nearly 10% annually over the next five years -- twice AT&T's expected 5% growth rate, and three times the 3% projected  growth rate at Verizon. Topping it all off, Mobile TeleSystems stock costs only 8.7 times forward earnings -- about 30% cheaper than either AT&T or Verizon. For a retiree looking to invest in international stocks, I think Mobile TeleSystems is a fine pick. George Budwell (Sanofi): Shares of the French biopharma giant Sanofi have been markedly outperforming most of their large-cap drug-manufacturing peers this year because of the unexpected strength of both Sanofi's vaccine portfolio and an emerging multiple sclerosis franchise. In fact, the drugmaker's shares are currently up close to a healthy 20% so far this year. A big reason investors have been piling in to this French drugmaker is that the company's newer, long-acting insulin product, Toujeo, has been helping to largely offset the expected decline in the sales of its former flagship diabetes medication, Lantus, that's now under pressure from generic competitors. Previously, industry insiders weren't entirely convinced Toujeo would be up to the task, but the drug's extremely rapid commercial uptake clearly suggests otherwise. Apart from Sanofi's proven ability to overcome major new competitive threats to key brands, the company also sports a top-notch dividend yield of 3.4% -- along with a fairly reasonable payout ratio of 79.2%. Many of Sanofi's dividend-paying peers, after all, offer substantially lower yields, but much higher payout ratios to boot. Most importantly, though, Sanofi has raised its payout for 23 consecutive years at this point, showing the company's deep commitment to doling out a top-notch dividend to its shareholders. Given Sanofi's strong product portfolio and upper-echelon dividend program, this top international biopharma stock appears to have all the ingredients necessary to be an attractive stock for retired investors on the hunt for relatively safe vehicles to grow their money.

"Travis Hoium, Tyler Crowe, and Brian Feroldi",08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Owning companies with durable businesses that pay high dividends can be a great way for investors to make money in the market long term. And sometimes there are great values among high-yield dividend stocks. We asked three of our investors for high-yield stocks they think are on sale, and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE:SKT), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) were at the top of the list. Image source: Getty Images. Travis Hoium (Verizon): The telecommunications industry may be entering a new phase of growth with 5G networks starting to roll out across the country. And Verizon is leading the charge into the next generation of networks that will enable self-driving vehicles, virtual or augmented reality, and other new technologies. That opportunity for growth is why I think a stock trading at 16 times trailing earnings with a 4.8% dividend yield is on sale for investors. When a stock reaches a high dividend yield or a relatively low P/E ratio, it usually means a business' future is getting dimmer for some reason. Maybe it has fewer growth opportunities ahead or could be disrupted by new technologies or business innovations. And with T-Mobile and Sprint aggressively pursuing customers, I think the market is seeing some weakness in Verizon, but the company's massive network and the next generation of connected devices will drive a new phase of growth. Short term, I think the market is making too much of competition from smaller rivals and overlooking the massive network advantage Verizon has over the competition. That will become extremely important as 5G rolls out and Verizon is in prime position to profit. For investors, the deal they're getting on the stock with a 4.8% dividend yield won't last long if 5G is as fast as expected. Brian Feroldi (Tanger Factory Outlet Centers): Given the recent turmoil in the retail industry, it is understandable why the market has soured on shares of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers right now. Down 32% since the start of the year, it is clear that Wall Street believes that this company is in trouble. However, I think that this real estate investment trust's business model will still be able to thrive in the changing retail environment. That mismatch is providing savvy investors with a great chance to get in. Tanger is a REIT that operates 44 outlet shopping centers in the U.S. The company pioneered the outlet center concept in an effort to connect price-sensitive consumers with brand-name manufacturers looking for a way to unload unwanted inventory. What kind of brand-name companies are we talking about? Currently, Tangers' top five tenants are Gap, Ascena Retail Group (Ann Taylor, Dress Barn), Nike, Philips Van Heusen, and Ralph Lauren. Importantly, the company has no exposure to department stores, which is good since that's the group that's really struggling to adapt to the e-commerce threat. By staying focused on credit-worthy tenants and avoiding department stores, Tanger has been able to keep its occupancy rates above 95% for 24 straight years. It has also produced 55 consecutive quarters of same-center net operating income growth. These numbers clearly show that the company's business model thrives in nearly all economic environments. Looking ahead, I'm confident that outlet stores will remain popular middle ground for bargain-hunting consumers and brand-name companies alike for years to come. With a dividend yield of 5.7% that should consume about 56% of forecasted AFFO for the year, Tanger looks like a high-yield stock that is worthy of your attention. Tyler Crowe (Enterprise Products Partners): I'll admit that a company's stock trading at an enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 14.4 doesn't exactly scream bargain stock. For natural gas pipeline company Enterprise Product Partners, though, that is looking like a great price for a stock that has a distribution yield of 6.7%. One of the reasons that Enterprise continuously trades at a premium valuation is that the company is an incredibly reliable business that has raised its payout to investors every quarter for 52 quarters in a row. The company's pipeline, storage, processing, and petrochemical manufacturing business is built to act like a toll road in that it charges a fee for its services, which insulates it from the ups and downs of commodity prices. According to the most recent investor presentation, more than 85% of its gross profits come from these fixed-fee contracts. Also, with a natural gas liquid logistics network that's connected to every ethylene manufacturing facility in the U.S., 90% of the oil refining capacity east of the Rockies, much of the petrochemical manufacturing facilities in the Gulf Coast, and several export terminals, Enterprise gives its customers an immense number of options to send products to the most profitable outlet at any given moment. EPD Dividend data by YCharts. On top of Enterprise's great business model, it has a top-notch management team that prudently invests in high-return projects that enhance that logistics network while maintaining a manageable balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. All of these elements are what have allowed management to keep raising its payout and why the market consistently assigns a premium valuation to its stock. At today's price, it's an incredibly attractive offer. ","

Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) released impressive fiscal second-quarter 2018 results on Aug. 24 after the market closed, highlighting hundreds of new customers across various disparate industries. This also marks the 11th time in as many reports that the operational-intelligence platform specialist has beaten expectations. Let's have a closer look at what Splunk accomplished over the past few months. Image source: Splunk. Fiscal Q2 2018* Fiscal Q2 2017 Year-Over-Year Growth Revenue $280.0 million $212.8 million 31.6% GAAP net income (loss) ($83.5 million) ($86.6 million) N/A GAAP earnings (loss) per share ($0.60) ($0.65) N/A Data source: Splunk. *For the quarter ended July 31,2017. Splunk CEO Doug Merritt stated: I am pleased with the solid sales execution in Q2, particularly our results in EMEA [Europe, the Middle East, and Africa]. As I traveled across Europe, Asia, and North America over the last two months, I was excited to see businesses, governments and universities adopting Splunk across multiple departments and use cases. Customer success and product innovation are at the heart of what we do. For the fiscal third quarter of 2018, Splunk expects revenue to be between $307 million and $309 million -- above the $306.9 million investors were anticipating -- with adjusted operating margin of 8%. As a result, Splunk once again increased its full fiscal-year 2018 guidance to call for billings of $1.450 billion, up from $1.425 billion previously, and revenue of between $1.210 billion and $1.215 billion, up from $1.195 billion previously. Splunk also reiterated its expectation for full fiscal-year adjusted operating margin of roughly 8%. All things considered -- and though it shouldn't be terribly surprising, given Splunk's propensity for under-promising and over-delivering -- there was nothing not to like about this report from an investor's perspective. Customers from a wide variety of industries continue to adopt Splunk's solutions in droves. And the company is translating that adoption to stellar revenue growth as its GAAP losses continue to narrow. With shares of Splunk down around 9% over the past three months in spite of its quarterly beat and raise in May, it was hard to blame the market for bidding up the stock after hours following the earnings release.

There's no shortage of promising pure-play Internet of Things (IoT) stocks -- some of which will live up to their potential, and others that are bound to leave shareholders high and dry. That's the nature of investing in companies with models that hinge on striking gold in the fast-developing IoT space, but there are still ways for the more risk-averse investor to profit from the potentially revolutionary tech trend. As Mark Twain once said, ""When everyone is looking for gold, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business."" With that in mind, companies that are on track to play key roles in facilitating the evolution of device connectivity, trade at low multiples, and have substantial returned income components looks to be smart ways to invest in IoT.

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate led by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has a stock portfolio that contains nearly four dozen stock positions worth a total of $161.8 billion as of this writing. However, there is tremendous variation in the size of Berkshire's stock positions. For example, Berkshire's $44,748 worth of Verizon stock would be a large investment for most people, but it represents just 0.00003% of Berkshire's portfolio and is therefore not a very significant ""Buffett stock."" With that in mind, there are 22 billion-dollar common stock positions in Berkshire's portfolio. In order from largest to smallest, here's a list of the billion-dollar ""Buffett stocks"" -- and how you can use this data. Company Shares Berkshire Owns Recent Stock Price Value of Berkshire's Stake Kraft Heinz 325,634,818 $84.83 $27.62 billion Wells Fargo 467,987,270 $52.17 $24.41 billion Apple 130,191,960 $159.81 $20.81 billion Coca-Cola 400,000,000 $45.62 $18.24 billion American Express 151,610,700 $85.12 $12.91 billion International Business Machines 54,084,673 $134.15 $7.60 billion Phillips 66 80,689,892 $82.31 $6.64 billion U.S. Bancorp 85,063,167 $51.75 $4.40 billion Charter Communications 9,443,491 $397.47 $3.75 billion Moody's 24,669,778 $131.88 $3.25 billion Bank of New York Mellon 50,229,588 $52.68 $2.67 billion Southwest Airlines 47,659,456 $53.99 $2.57 billion Delta Air Lines 53,110,395 $47.80 $2.54 billion Goldman Sachs 10,959,519 $223.00 $2.44 billion DaVita 38,565,570 $56.70 $2.19 billion American Airlines 47,000,000 $45.78 $2.15 billion General Motors 60,000,000 $35.12 $2.11 billion Liberty SiriusXM 45,951,345 $43.50 $2.00 billion United Continental Holdings 28,211,563 $64.94 $1.83 billion Verisign 12,952,745 $99.73 $1.29 billion Visa 10,562,460 $103.27 $1.09 billion USG Corporation 39,002,016 $26.57 $1.04 billion Data source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC filings. Positions as of 6/30/2017, while prices and values are current as of 8/22/2017. One of the main things to notice from this data is just how top-heavy the portfolio is. While Berkshire's portfolio consists of 46 stocks, including the 22 billion-dollar positions in the chart, more than 56% of the entire portfolio's value is concentrated in just four stocks -- Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo, Apple, and Coca-Cola. Image source: The Motley Fool. Also notice that while there are 22 stocks in the chart, there are a couple of groups of similarly focused companies. Berkshire's airline stocks are perhaps the most obvious example from the chart. By themselves, none of Berkshire's airline investments are large, relative to some of the portfolio's largest holdings. However, notice that Berkshire has similarly sized investments in the four largest U.S. airlines -- American, Delta, United Continental, and Southwest -- worth more than $9 billion combined. Financials are another group well represented on the list. In addition to top Berkshire holdings Wells Fargo and American Express, you'll find three more banks and a major credit card processor among Berkshire's billion-dollar stocks. In all, banks and credit card processors make up just under $50 billion of Berkshire's stock portfolio. No discussion of Berkshire's billion-dollar stock positions would be complete without mentioning Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Thanks to a savvy financial crisis-era investment, Berkshire received warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank at a deeply discounted price. To make a long story short, Bank of America recently increased its quarterly dividend to a point where Buffett said he intended to exercise the warrants. However, Bank of America's capital plan was approved just days before the end of the second quarter, so the position has not been officially reported in Berkshire's SEC filings yet. Including Bank of America, Berkshire has 23 billion-dollar stock investments. And since 700 million shares of Bank of America are worth about $16.7 billion as of this writing, that means Berkshire's financial-sector stocks are worth nearly $67 billion altogether. In other words, it's fair to say that Berkshire's stock portfolio is highly dependent on the performance of the banking industry. I don't suggest buying or selling any stock simply because a billionaire has done the same -- even if that billionaire is named Warren Buffett. The more important lessons to learn are why Buffett likes each of these stocks and whether they fit your particular risk tolerance and investing goals. The bottom line is that while knowing what Warren Buffett owns can be a good starting point, it's still important to do your own research before buying any of the stocks on this list. ","
