The sale represents Verizon’s efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. Verizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. Reuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. The company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. For Equinix, the world’s biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. “We’ve been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,” Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts. The acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix’s total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. Citi and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. Shares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two of Asia’s biggest technology companies said they were looking to expand investment in the United States, as President-elect Donald Trump pushes to bring manufacturing and jobs back home. Son said on Tuesday, after meeting Trump, his investment would create 50,000 new jobs, a move the U.S. President-elect claimed was a direct result of his election win. The lack of details on the investment timetable also prompted doubts on whether the promise of money and jobs will be met, as Sprint is slashing staff numbers to cut more than $2 billion in costs this fiscal year. Trump’s moves since the election to engage with individual companies, while turning his back on broader, years-in-the-works trade deals, show that he is leaning on the deal-making skills he honed in the boardroom. Trump campaigned against the over-regulation of business and is expected to be more open to mergers than President Barack Obama. The $50 billion investment, announced jointly by Trump and Son in the lobby of the Trump Tower in Manhattan, would come from the $100 billion tech investment fund the head of SoftBank is setting up with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa from SoftBank of Japan, and he’s just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs,” Trump said. “He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!” Trump later Tweeted. Son, who wore a red tie and red sweater under his suit jacket, told reporters his company, a $68 billion telecommunications and tech investment behemoth, would create the jobs by investing in startup companies. He also said he expected a lot of “deregulation” under a Trump administration. Trump and Son did not give a timeline for the investment. Trump’s four-year term will begin after his Jan. 20 inauguration. The page also showed an additional $7 billion investment and creation of a further 50,000 jobs. (cnb.cx/2he38VQ) “While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials,” the Foxconn statement said. Son and Foxconn founder Terry Gou are considered close and have several business ventures together, including launching humanoid Pepper - which is manufactured by Foxconn - into several markets, and investing jointly in India. Foxconn has manufacturing facilities in the U.S. states of Virginia and Indiana, according to its website (here). Its 2015 annual report also listed logistics services in California and Texas. In October, prior to the election, SoftBank said Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) would be the lead partner in the $100 billion tech fund and could invest up to $45 billion over the next five years. SoftBank expects to put in at least $25 billion. Shares in SoftBank jumped 6.2 percent on Wednesday in Tokyo to their highest since August last year. “Now the market sees SoftBank as a Trump-related stock and that’s because it reacted favorably to their meeting,” said Fumio Matsumoto, a fund manager at Dalton Capital in Japan. Shares of Sprint briefly reached their highest level in 2-1/2 years, soon after Son’s comments. They closed up 1.5 percent, while shares of T-Mobile US rose 1.8 percent. It was not immediately clear how much of SoftBank’s investment had been disclosed before. SoftBank said on Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. election, it planned to make future large-scale investments via the $100 billion fund, rather than on its own, to avoid growing already-bloated debt. Whether or not Trump’s election led to SoftBank’s planned investment, the billionaire’s victory has been a boon to stock investors. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at another record level on Tuesday, its 11th new high since the Nov. 8 vote. Should the SoftBank fund grow as large as $100 billion, it would be one of the world’s largest private equity investors and a potential kingpin in the technology sector. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Back in 2011, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) seemed like a fading player in the wireless subscription business. The duopoly of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) owned 65% of the market, while T-Mobile came in a distant fourth place, with just 11% of the market. Times, however, have changed. Revitalized by CEO John Legere's ""Uncarrier"" plan that has expanded to include a wide number of initiatives, the company has grown to capture almost 17% of the market. While Verizon remains the top dog, with 35% of wireless subscriptions nationwide, such a drastic improvement leads to a simple question: Is T-Mobile's stock a better buy at today's prices? There's no definitive way to answer that, but there are three different lenses through which we can answer the question. Cash in the bank is awfully boring. But it's incredibly important. That's because every business -- at some point in time -- will run into rough patches. Whether they be company-specific or macro in nature, those with lots of cash on hand will be rewarded with optionality. Those with lots of debt, on the other hand, won't be so lucky. They will have to narrow their focus to just making ends meet to stay out of bankruptcy. The telecom industry requires heavy debt levels to maintain the enormous infrastructure required to meet our data demands, but we can still investigate where breathing room may exist. Here's how Verizon and T-Mobile stack up in terms of financial fortitude. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $7.6 billion $103 billion $14 billion $11.5 billion T-Mobile $6.2 billion $21.8 billion $1.4 billion $1.5 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes long and short-term investments. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. It's important to point out that Verizon is valued at roughly four-and-a-half times the size of T-Mobile. Given that, I can't help but give the nod here to T-Mobile. In terms of a cash-to-debt position, T-Mobile clearly has the upper hand -- with a somewhat comparable level of cash but only one-fifth the debt level. Of course, much of the debt that Verizon has is because the company bought out the stake that Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD) had in Verizon Wireless -- a critically important piece of Verizon's overall empire. But we'll get to the benefits that this bestows on shareholders in the next section. Often referred to as a ""moat"" in investing circles, a company's sustainable competitive advantages are perhaps the most important metric for any investor to consider. Evaluating a moat is part art, part science. In essence, the moat is the special sauce that makes a company what it is -- and differentiates it from all of the other players in the industry. Both T-Mobile and Verizon are beneficiaries of high barriers to entrance. In short, we don't see a lot of start-ups popping up to vie for your mobile subscription dollars. That's because it's prohibitively expensive to build out data networks. Verizon's moat is provided by the company's top spot within the industry. With 35% of all wireless subscriptions, and a fairly low churn rate, the company is able to rake in tons of free cash flow every month. It has also expanded beyond wireless service to become an Internet provider (FiOS), and it owns AOL's properties -- and will soon own Yahoo!'s operating business. It's yet to be seen exactly how these acquisitions will play out. T-Mobile, on the other hand, has the advantage of being a first-mover in the no-contract plans among the country's biggest players. Legere, in effect, is doubling down on convenience and customer service, saying, ""We're so much better than the others, we'll give our customers the choice to leave, and they still won't."" Of course, Legere has come up with other ways to keep customers around -- equipment installment plans or promotions tied to monthly bill credits -- but the bottom line is that the strategy has served as an important differentiator. The strategy has paid off thus far, but it's worth stating that Verizon and AT&T have already started offering much the same deal, and it may erode T-Mobile's advantage over time. In addition, we are already seeing Verizon move beyond simply being a wireless carrier and into a fully fledged media and content company -- via the aforementioned Yahoo and AOL tie-ups. That's something that T-Mobile simply can't compete with at this point -- from a cash, cash flow, or acquisition standpoint. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF P/S PEG Ratio Verizon 13 18 1.6 4.2 T-Mobile 35 29 1.3 0.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, Morningstar. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Normally, that would make me give the nod to T-Mobile. However, there's one extra variable to consider: the dividend. Verizon has a healthy and sustainable 4.5% yield, while T-Mobile has none to speak of. Given that, I'm siding with Verizon, here. So, there you have it. If I had to boil this down to one sentence, it would be this: T-Mobile has better growth prospects, but Verizon is the safer bet and offers a dividend. Truth be told, both are probably worthy of your consideration, but for those seeking income via dividends, Verizon is the obvious choice. ","

Image source: Getty Images. For those looking to pad their retirement accounts with solid dividend payers, the sight of Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) dividend seems too good to be true. A 4.5% yield from an industry leader trading for a 50% discount to the broader market? Yes, please! But as you'll see below, it's worth digging in to see if all that glitters really is gold before putting your hard-earned cash behind the company. For dividend investors, the most important thing to continually evaluate is a company's free cash flow (FCF) statement. This represents the amount of cash an organization can put in its pocket by running its business, minus any capital expenditures. At the end of the day, it is from FCF that healthy companies pay their dividends -- and as the FCF trends change, so too do a company's dividend policies. This is where I ran into something somewhat concerning. Over the past 12 months, Verizon has brought in $11.5 billion in FCF. There's nothing wrong with that. But in order to pay its dividend, the company used 80% of FCF. While that's technically sustainable, it raises two red flags: (1) If the company meets tough times, maintaining the dividend may be difficult, and (2) even if it doesn't encounter difficulties, Verizon may not be able to grow its dividend substantially moving forward. But by digging deeper, we can see this might be a bit more of an anomaly than a trend. In June of this year, Verizon ratified its collective bargaining agreement with employees. Because of that, Verizon ""recorded ... charges of approximately $3.6 billion."" That's a huge one-time charge, and it showed up in the company's bottom line and on the FCF statement. While it's definitely important to note such a big charge, it's also worth asking if this is something that long-term investors should really be worried about. To get a better idea of the trends at Verizon, I suggest investors back up and look at the company's history of FCF and dividend payments over the past decade. When we do that, here's what we see: Data source: SEC filings. Viewed through this lens, there are a couple of things that stand out. First, while the trend is certainly not linear, FCF has undoubtedly trended upwards over the past decade -- increasing an average of 12% per year. Second, the dividend is historically very safe, with 2005 being the only year where the payout ratio from FCF eclipsed even 65%. The bottom line: Verizon's dividend is pretty safe. Before giving my full-fledged support to Verizon, there are a few other caveats worth considering. First and foremost, while the company is the largest mobile provider in America, the telecom landscape is not what it used to be. Verizon, sensing that disruption and innovation are rampant in today's technological setting, has branched out into other lines of business. That's evident through the company's acquisition of AOL and the announced plan to buy Yahoo!'s core operating business. I wouldn't be surprised to see the company continue to trend toward other strategic initiatives. What investors need to watch is whether or not those moves materially affect Verizon's cash flow statement. If they do, then there may be cause for concern regarding the company's dividend. If not, however, I have no problem endorsing Verizon's fat 4.5% payout as a safe and sustainable one. ","

Image source: Netflix. Donald Trump's election has been kind to the stock market so far, with major indexes having reached record highs in the days following his victory. However, at least one popular stock pick could be jeopardized by the incoming administration. The president-elect named two advisors last week who are notable opponents of net neutrality, the concept that all data traffic should be treated equally by internet service providers. This is a particularly sensitive issue for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which takes up more web traffic than any other company but owns none of the pipes that bring it into homes. Netflix has repeatedly highlighted this issue in its earnings reports. In a recent one, the company said, ""We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at interconnection points."" Netflix had been mostly pleased with progress on the issue under the Obama administration, but Trump's selections, who come directly from the telecom industry, threaten to undo that. The two men, Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, have previously spoken against net neutrality standards, each having served as a lobbyist for the telecom industry -- Eisenach once called it a form of ""crony capitalism."" Though net neutrality is a global issue, the U.S remains by far Netflix's biggest market, accounting for more than half of its subscriber base. Obama's Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Tom Wheeler, has been seen as proactive against monopolistic abuses among cable companies and telecoms, creating net neutrality standards and breaking up the set-top box monopoly that has inflated prices for cable boxes. In February of 2015, the commission issued a set of rules to ""preserve the internet as a platform for innovation, free expression, and economic growth.  The Open Internet platform above all prohibits blocking access to websites, throttling traffic, or accepting payment to favor one content source over another. Telecoms like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have fought the regulations in the past, and an appeals court struck down portions of a former net neutrality bill in 2014. If Trump's FCC rolls back net neutrality, it could have a number of consequences for Netflix, other streamers like Hulu and Amazon Prime, and small, independent content providers that may be unable to afford higher fees that ISPs could charge for better service. The most likely outcome of the unraveling of net neutrality is that prices for consumers will go up as ISPs could charge extra fees to carry streams from bandwidth hogs like Netflix. Stricter data caps could also apply to mobile devices, making it harder to use such services away from home. The biggest threat to Netflix, however, could be cable providers giving so-called ""fast lane"" treatment to their own services, as Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could do for its Stream service. The end of net neutrality would also give additional leverage to a combined AT&T (NYSE:T)-Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), as AT&T could use its Pay TV services like DirecTV and U-Verse to give preferential treatment to HBO and the Turner cable networks owned by Time Warner. While rolling back net neutrality would be a challenge for content providers like Netflix, it would be a boon for cable and internet service providers, whose stocks have gained since the election. NFLX data by YCharts. The net neutrality development comes at a time when communities are already toying with the idea of a ""Netflix tax"" or a surcharge on streaming services that treats them like a utility. Between local taxes and the end of net neutrality, Netflix could soon become more expensive for the average American. Expect CEO Reed Hasting to address this issue in the next earnings report, if not sooner, as Netflix has long been one of the biggest proponents of net neutrality. ","

Image source: Getty. Buying telecom stocks probably seems like a fairly straightforward exercise. Due to the industry's relative stability, some investors regard telecommunications companies as similar to utilities, a sleepy and staid industry if ever there was one. In reality, though, investing in telecom stocks isn't nearly as clear-cut as it might seem. In this two-part article, we will examine a host of key business and financial metrics that investors need to consider before actually investing in any telecom stock. Image source: Author. If you read through any telecom company's annual report, you're guaranteed to come across the commonly used metric ""churn rate."" The term simply refers to the number of subscribers that leave their service over a given period of time, as a percentage of total subscribers. The number isn't unique to the telecom industry, though; churn rates are often measured in sectors that use subscription-based business models, like the cable-TV industry. The lower the churn rate, the better, since customer defections act as a headwind to revenue growth and profit margins. Telecom companies disclose their churn rates in their SEC filings. For example, AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Sprint (NYSE:S) have each maintained churn rates of between 1% and 2% over the past year. As the U.S. smartphone market matures, telecom companies are increasingly attempting to grow by courting one another's customers. This has led to a minor rise in churn rates in recent quarters, though they are unlikely to spike appreciably beyond their current range. Investors researching telecom stocks will certainly want to closely monitor this crucial metric. Perhaps the second most commonly discussed performance metric in the telecom industry is average revenue per user, or ARPU. Just as it sounds, this measures the typical revenue garnered from one customer. Telecom companies closely monitor this metric to help shape their near-term and long-term growth strategies. Growing ARPU can prove particularly lucrative for telecom companies, since applying new revenue-growth strategies to current users flows directly to the bottom lines. The general ARPU trend among U.S. telecom carriers has largely been downward over the past several years, the result of continued price competition among the four main industry leaders. Sprint and T-Mobile have aggressively slashed prices and added other incentives to court customers away from AT&T and Verizon. However, in response, AT&T and Verizon have both expanded the breadth of their product offerings -- AT&T bought DIRECTV, and Verizon acquired AOL and Yahoo! -- to further monetize their customer bases. Telecom companies also track subscriber metrics including Average Billings Per User, Average Revenue Per Account, and Average Billings Per Account, which generally attempt to provide the same kind of user-level insight into a company's revenue-generation capabilities. Either way, anyone considering investing in a telecom stock should review the company's ARPU and its general direction to gain a better sense of the business's overall health. As you can see, each of the four major U.S. telecom operations offers a reasonably strong network, with AT&T and Sprint suffering from relatively slower upload speeds. This picture changes from region to region, and from urban to rural environments. Furthermore, with each telecom already testing 5G -- the next evolution for wireless standards -- their differences in network quality are certain to change throughout the latter half of the decade. Telecom companies have historically been strong dividend stocks. As just one example, the sector's 4.2% average dividend yield is more than double the S&P 500's 2% payout. Though the sector overall has a high average yield, there are divergences between companies in the sector. Here's how the four largest telecom stocks vary by dividend policy: Company Name Dividend Yield No. Consecutive Annual Dividend Increases AT&T 5.3% 31 Verizon Communications 4.9% 9 Sprint N/A N/A T-Mobile US N/A N/A Data sources: Dividend.com and Google Finance. As you'll see in future sections, a telecom company's dividend policy often reflects its current financing circumstances. For example, Frontier Communications' 13.2% dividend yield reflects the heightened long-term risk that comes with its legacy landline strategy, which many investors expect to gradually erode in the coming years. On the other end of the spectrum, Sprint and T-Mobile intentionally avoid paying dividends in favor of investing all their excess cash into improving their wireless networks, in hopes of stealing subscribers from AT&T and Verizon. Taking the time to understand the reasons a telecom firm pursues its dividend policy can absolutely save you from a costly investment mistake. The telecom industry is notably capital-intensive. In order to provide a competitive network, telecommunications companies have to invest extensively in a wide range of fixed assets. As such, telecom operators often tap debt markets to fund a large part of their operations. The industry's subscription model -- in which cash flows tend to be fairly consistent -- also supports the use of leverage. As such, investors need to dig into a telecom company's balance sheet as part of their due diligence. A number of common balance-sheet ratios can prove extremely useful here. Investors can look at a company's debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio, net cash, and debt as a percentage of invested capital. Used together, these and other balance-sheet ratios can give you a view into a company's long-term financial viability. Think you're getting the hang of analyzing telecom stocks?

    A 10-Point Checklist for Investing in Telecom Stocks (Part 1) -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. In Part 1 of this article series on honing your abilities to analyze telecom stocks, we discussed the first five points investors need to understand as part of their research process. To recap, investors should understand important industry metrics such as churn and ARPU, examine the network quality of the company and its relevant competitors, research the dividend policy, and review its capital structure -- all before buying a telecom stock. Now let's consider five additional items for investors to consider. Image source: author. Spectrum rights are the lifeblood of modern mobile networks. Similar to how radio stations own the rights to broadcast over a certain frequency and geography, telecom companies own the rights to similar frequencies of radio waves that we simply refer to as spectrum. So it only makes sense that a telecom investor should have a basic understanding of a wireless provider's spectrum holdings. The good news is, that's fairly easy to do. Telecom operators provide information about their spectrum holdings and lease arrangements in their annual reports. If you're interested in a certain geographic area, the Federal Communications Commission maintains a website detailing which wireless companies own the rights to various spectrum frequencies. Telecom companies throw off gobs of cash, thanks to their relatively stable, subscription-based business models. As discussed in this article's companion piece, building and maintaining a competitive wireless network requires substantial capital expenditures, which can erode those free cash flows. The differences between providers on these matters can be eye-opening. For example, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) enjoy subscriber bases roughly twice the size of Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and the tremendous difference shines through in terms their cash flow generation. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash flow from operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital expenditures $19.2 billion $17.7 billion $7.0 billion $4.7 billion Free cash flow from operations $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending March 31, 2016. Though much has been made of T-Mobile's and Sprint's recent challenges to AT&T and Verizon, this chart reveals the extent of the financial differences among U.S. wireless providers. This sizable difference in cash flow generation gives AT&T and Verizon far more flexibility to invest in future growth drivers (see below). They can more easily spend more on marketing, promotional pricing, and other measures to fend off their resurgent competitors. In fact, I maintain that this chart provides one of most useful ways to frame the competitive landscape in the U.S. telecom market. Any investor looking at this market needs to examine the stock in question in a similar manner before buying. As many smartphone markets in developed countries mature, revenue growth strategies are evolving at most telecoms in ways investors need to understand. For example, T-Mobile and Sprint remain the underdogs in the U.S. wireless market. To try to close that cash flow generation gap, both parties remain focused on growing their 4G wireless subscribers through a mix of marketing and price competition; T-Mobile's ""Un-carrier"" campaign is perhaps the best example. Image source: T-Mobile. However, in terms of their free cash flow advantages, AT&T and Verizon have instead pursued M&A strategies that should allow them to grow ARPU, albeit in different ways. Verizon has made a bet on building out its mobile advertising business by spending roughly $9 billion to acquire content and ad-tech powers AOL and Yahoo! over the past two years. AT&T, on the other hand, is moving to fashion itself into a one-stop shop for mobile connectivity and video programming through its purchase of DIRECTV and its proposed Time Warner buyout. Since it takes money to make money, investors need to understand a company's upcoming investment plans before buying. As was the case with their spectrum holdings, wireless providers typically offer some information on their near-term investment plans in their SEC filings. For example, AT&T's annual report states, ""We expect our 2016 capital investment, which includes our capital expenditures plus vendor financing payments related to our Mexico network, for our existing businesses to be in the $22,000 range, and we expect our capital investment to be in the 15 percent range of service revenues or lower from 2016 through 2018."" Finding this information doesn't have to take a lot of time -- I found it from a quick search. As with all good investing, it's critical to understand the cast of characters at the helm of a company. In fact, finding companies run by strong managers is one of the bedrocks of the Fool's primer on how to buy stocks. Among U.S. wireless providers, this is a fairly easy process, as the four largest wireless providers in the country are run by a well-known set of executives: Randall Stephenson  at AT&T, Lowell McAdam at Verizon, John Legere at T-Mobile, and Marcelo Claure at Sprint. A quick search can reveal the background information for the executive team and board of directors of a company that interests you. Furthermore, companies are required to publish their executive compensation plans in their annual proxy filings, which you can find on the investor-relations page of a company's website. Successfully buying telecom stocks requires quite a bit of analysis and familiarity with industry-specific metrics. However, with a little practice, anyone can get the hang of it. Equally important, using this checklist can help reveal some important risk factors that might not leap out at first glance. Getting to that point might require some additional upfront effort on your part, but the rewards will be worth it. ","

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

Trump took credit for the investment, saying his November victory spurred SoftBank’s decision. Son told reporters he planned to “invest into the new startup companies in the United States.” It would be difficult to create 50,000 jobs entirely by investing in startups, which generally employ few workers. Sprint employs about 30,000 people and has cut jobs to combat losses. In an interview, Son said the money will be coming from a $100 billion investment fund that he began setting up earlier this year with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners.

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed. The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday. Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record. It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement. Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.” ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"The end of negotiations was not a complete surprise. Les Moonves, the longtime chief executive of CBS, said last week talks were still stuck in the early stages, more than two months after the Redstones asked the boards of both companies to explore a tie-up. The two sides never entered talks on pricing and were far apart on Viacom’s value, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Shares of Viacom were down 7.9 percent at $39.10 in afternoon trading. In afternoon trading, CBS shares were down 0.4 percent at $62.12. National Amusements, the privately held movie company through which Shari Redstone and her 93-year-old father control 80 percent of the voting shares of CBS and Viacom, said in a letter they stopped pushing for a deal on the expectation of a turnaround at Viacom under new leadership. Viacom named Bob Bakish, head of its international business, acting chief executive officer at the end of October, and made that position permanent on Monday afternoon as it announced the end of merger explorations. Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV, has been struggling to turn around declining ad revenue and ratings while CBS is home to top-rated shows such “The Big Bang Theory” and “Thursday Night Football.” Mario Gabelli, whose firm is the second-largest owner of voting shares of Viacom and CBS, said he was not disappointed with the failure of merger plans and that he still believes that ultimately the two might merge. “Viacom needs to be fixed,” he said. One sticking point in negotiations was that CBS’s Moonves wanted autonomy over the merged company. National Amusements was willing to compromise on this issue, but in the end decided to let Bakish retain control of Viacom, according to the sources, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Bakish already has started taking action after just a few weeks as acting CEO. Last month,  the company announced it was buying Argentine broadcaster Television Federal SA from telecom carrier Telefonica SA for $345 million. He is also looking to improve relations with affiliates and is working on a plan to turn around MTV, a top priority for him, he told Reuters in November. Last week, he replaced Viacom’s head of distribution, Denise Denson, a longtime executive who worked closely with former CEO Philippe Dauman. In September, National Amusements called on Viacom and CBS to consider recombining, 10 years after Viacom was spun off from CBS. Shari Redstone had been in favor of recombining the two under Moonves, sources have previously told Reuters. Industry speculation that the two might rejoin increased this year after the Redstones prevailed in a power struggle that resulted in Dauman’s departure. A Viacom spokesman confirmed it had received the letter from National Amusements, which was first reported by CNBC. A CBS spokesman declined to comment. National Amusement’s letter also said: “CBS continues to perform exceptionally well under Les Moonves.” Relations between Moonves and Shari Redstone continue to be good, the source said. This week, the two plan to go to Boston for the premiere of the film “Patriots Day,” produced by CBS Films. ","

The company stock was down 2.25% in pre-market trading. In a press release late Wednesday, Yahoo said it believes an “unauthorized third party” stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August of 2013. That’s in addition to the half a million customers whose data was hacked in another incident which Yahoo disclosed in September. The company believes the August 2013 hack is “likely distinct” from the other incident. In November, Yahoo disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that law enforcement provided it with data files that a hacker claimed was Yahoo user data. Upon analyzing it with the help of outside forensic experts, Yahoo has said it turned out to be the company’s data. (Read more: Yahoo Discloses New Potential Breach.) For Verizon the latest disclosure may be the nail in the coffin that ends its hope of acquiring Yahoo to add to its purchase of AOL, which it made last year. After all, this data breach is double the size of the other one which has delayed the closing of the deal. In a statement to the media, Verizon said, “As we've said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions."" Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead. Armstrong said Verizon and Yahoo will start planning what a combined company will look like. By the first quarter of 2017, Armstrong said there will be more clarity for the organization.  (Read more: AOL CEO Optimistic on Verizon-Yahoo Deal.)

Siegel is a longtime proponent of investing in equities, and recently was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying that “There’s no bubble today. There hasn’t been in years.” He also opined “the Trump rally has a way to run.” In a post-election interview, Siegel even raised the prospect of Dow 25,000 in a few years.

Many strategists, including those at Strategas, believe it's the one reason why this rally is showing no signs of slowing down into year end. Clifton has a great piece of advice for those waiting to sell in 2017: ""In 2003, when Congress cut the capital gains tax, the provision was made retroactive to the first committee hearing in March.

Equinix agreed to pay $3.6 billion in cash to acquire 24 data center sites and their operations. All told, the sites contain 29 buildings, located in 15 metropolitan areas. Most of these are in the U.S.; two are located in South America, specifically Bogota, Colombia, and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Equinix will also obtain 900 customers that currently use the facilities. Equinix expects the transaction to close by the middle of next year. Adding the Verizon assets to the REIT's current portfolio gives it 175 data centers in 43 localities, utilizing around 17 million gross square feet of space. Equinix believes the Verizon assets will be ""immediately accretive"" to its results. Specifically, the company estimates that it will add $450 million in revenue and $270 million in EBITDA in the 12 months after the deal closes. Verizon doesn't particularly want to be in the data center business, while Equinix is eager to expand. So this is an appropriate and opportunistic transaction for both parties. In its press release, the REIT quoted CEO Steve Smith as saying -- accurately, in my view -- that ""the new assets will bring hundreds of new customers to Platform Equinix while establishing a presence in new markets and expanding our footprint in existing key metros."" It's a good time to be in the data center business, as enterprises rely more and more on the services such facilities provide. Equinix has been doing well lately, with revenue and the bottom line in its most recently reported quarter both beating analyst estimates (although adjusted funds from operations -- the most important profitability metric for REITs -- slipped a little). With the Verizon buy, it's making hay while the sun shines, to quote a corny phrase, and investors should be pleased with the portfolio-expanding move. ","

Coverage map. Image source: Verizon Communications. There has been much hype this year about the next-generation 5G wireless network. However, investors looking to bet on the new network should forget about big wireless providers Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). For two main reasons, smaller, behind-the-scenes companies that are helping develop the new technology look like a more promising option. The country's two largest telecom businesses are working hard to bring the faster, more reliable network to market. Both have begun running technical trials and are planning real-world pilot programs beginning next year. A new wireless network will bring a flood of new sales of devices that are 5G-compatible. And a new round of fighting over wireless subscribers among the country's handful of carriers will no doubt ensue as well. But AT&T and Verizon aren't betting the farm on it, as made evident by each company's recent activity. For AT&T, it started with last year's DirecTV purchase, followed up by last month's proposed acquisition of Time Warner. Verizon has taken a slightly different path with its AOL and proposed Yahoo! acquisitions, as well as a slew of smaller tech and media company purchases. The goal in both instances are the same, though. The wireless carriers are transforming themselves into multimedia conglomerates rather than wireless network pure plays. A new 5G network will certainly play a part in both businesses, but it won't be leveraged in the same way as older networks were. Past wireless networks were all about increasing speed and reliability, and the next-gen network also won't disappoint. Initial testing is toting 5G as anywhere from 10 to 100 times faster than the current 4G network. But download speeds are only part of the discussion. The 5G network will move beyond the world of cellphones and will encompass the entire universe of technology, what has been dubbed the Internet of Things. The needs of the new network will include being able to support billions of connected devices, everything from wearable tech like smartwatches to autonomous cars to sensors on industrial equipment. Much more than just a newer and faster network for telecommunications, 5G is really a new medium of data transmission that paves the way for new technology that will shape our world in the decades ahead. With that in mind, let's take a look at two stocks that could be good ways to play the latest tech revolution. With 5G set to encompass much more than just your smartphone, the companies that are helping develop the network and devices that will use it are a more appealing investment than the telecoms. Here are two companies much smaller than Verizon and AT&T that are at the forefront of this research. Image source: InterDigital. InterDigital (NASDAQ:IDCC), which helped develop past wireless network technology, is also involved with engineering the latest 5G network. The company makes its money by developing solutions and earning patent fees and royalties for their use. Currently, InterDigital revenue comes from a combination of past technology royalties and new technology solutions income. It has been a good year as the top line has expanded with a large royalty sale of a past patent during the last quarter. In tandem with increasing sales has been an increasing bottom line as well, as the company has been looking for ways to keep costs down. IDCC Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Much work remains for the development of the 5G network platform, and InterDigital's engineers have been tasked with solving some critical issues. On the work docket is developing ways to address the need for reliability of ultra-sensitive data transmission for autonomous driving and remote healthcare, and the need for traffic prioritization for billions of interconnected machine communications. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a designer and maker of wireless-connectivity-enabling semiconductors. The company's technology has been powering smartphones for some time, but as a new wave of devices come to market requiring connectivity, Skyworks has been there to answer the call as well. The company saw top-line sales slow dramatically this year, taking a breather after revenue more than doubled in the last five years. Profits also initially slid, but ended up finishing the fiscal year on a high note and notched a 26% year-over-year increase on decreasing expenses. SWKS Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Global smartphone growth has slowed since 2015, but the Internet of Things movement is just getting under way. When 5G begins to roll out in the next few years, new chips enabling connection to it will need to be developed and sold. Skyworks is in a good position to benefit when that happens. ","

Four huge companies that control 70% of the digital communications sector have been using their market power to overcharge the typical household about $45 a month ($540 per year), according to a new report (link opens in PDF) from the non-profit Consumer Federation of America (CFA). AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) form what the researchers call a ""tight oligopoly on steroids."" These four companies, according to the report, have protected their control over prices by not competing head-to-head to ""a remarkable extent,"" leading to more than $60 billion in annual overcharges. This is good for the companies and their shareholders. By not competing in three consumer-facing businesses -- wireless, broadband internet access, and multichannel video programming service (cable) as well as the behind-the-scenes data services -- these companies have been able to consistently keep prices moving up (while costs have fallen). ""Stockholders love the astronomical rate of return, but consumers hate it,"" said Dr. Mark Cooper, CFA's director of research and the author of the report, in a press release, ""which is reflected in the very low ratings that these products get in consumer satisfaction surveys."" The federation released its report while testifying against the AT&T/Time Warner merger. Comcast is one of the companies on the hot seat in this report. Image source: The Motley Fool. AT&T, Comcast, Charter, and Verizon have generally avoided competing with each other, keeping largely to territorial boundaries dating back to before the Telecommunications Act of 1996 when they enjoyed actual monopolies. The report noted that AT&T and Verizon were slow to go into the video business (though both are in it now) while the major cable companies still have chosen to not offer wireless services to compete directly with telecommunications companies. ""Instead of competing vigorously on a head-to-head basis, they preferred to buy each other out,"" the federation wrote. ""This not only eliminated the most likely potential competitors, but it also gave them huge fortress regions. Lax antitrust and regulatory policy for the first 15 years of the implementation of the 1996 Act allowed this to come about."" In the press release, Cooper was quoted as saying: ""All of the negative aspects of the tight oligopoly on steroids come into play in the ATT-TWX mergers.  In many respects ATT is the dominant player in the tight oligopoly, with a strong position in wireless, business data services, and video distribution. Allowing it to acquire a major content producer would give it much stronger incentives and an enhanced ability to leverage its market power to harm consumers and competition."" Competition lowers prices. In much of the country, when it comes to cable and internet service, AT&T (which owns DirecTV as well as the U-verse video service), Charter, and Comcast do not face comparable direct competition. Consumers might be able to opt for DISH Network to meet their television needs, but they still, in much of the country, would need AT&T, Charter, Comcast, or Verizon for broadband service. All four of these companies to different extents have pricing power based on many Americans simply not having any other realistic choice. The CFA did note that T-Mobile's ""aggressive competition strategy is definitely putting downward pressure on prices and excess profits, saving consumers $5-$10 per month."" Despite that, it found that the a typical household, which has two cellphones, one landline, and a video-internet bundle, that uses AT&T or Verizon still pays an extra $10 per line. ""To estimate the total overcharges, we applied the $10 [monthly] overcharge figure only to the subscribers of the dominant carriers [AT&T and Verizon],"" the federation wrote, working that out to total annual overcharges of more than $40 billion. ""This equals to just over a quarter of the revenues of the firms with overcharges,"" the federation said. The study found similar results in broadband and video bundles. It used an overcharge number of $25 per household per month, despite writing that ""there are reasons to believe that this estimate is low."" Since between 70 million and 90 million homes have bundled broadband and cable, Cooper used 80 million as the base to estimate aggregate overcharges. ""The total would be $24 billion,"" the report says, again about a quarter of the revenue in these segments for the firms with overcharges. The federation wrote that competition could ultimately force prices lower, stating that all four of these companies would be thriving even without the overcharges. ""We find that the companies have been throwing off cash at the rate of $80 billion per year for mergers and acquisitions, increased liquid assets (retained earnings and stock repurchases), excess dividends and high prices paid for auctioned spectrum to keep spectrum out of the hands of potential competitors,"" the report says. ""Thus, excess returns to shareholders easily account for the excess profits and cost-reducing competitive effects would add to total consumer savings."" Whether that competition comes depends on a number of things. Disruptive technology could, for example, offer more people a broadband alternative that could hurt these companies' ability to keep consumers in cable/internet bundles. That is already happening in the wireless space, but Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter have been very successful when it comes to keeping competition from gaining a toehold. It could happen, but deals like AT&T buying Time Warner make it even less likely. ","

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

Image source: Getty Images. The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the growing network of connected sensors and devices, and the increasing connectivity is already having significant impacts at the consumer, enterprise, and public levels. Research firm Gartner expects the number of IoT devices to grow from 6.4 billion in 2016 to nearly 21 billion in 2020, and estimates that more than half of new business systems and processes will utilize the Internet of Things by the end of that period. Growth in device connectivity and machine-to-machine communication is creating an explosion of new data, and this information is being sorted and analyzed to produce insights that can improve efficiency and drive substantial economic value. Brian Feroldi (Verizon): There's no doubt that the Internet of Things trend offers tremendous growth opportunities for all kinds of tech companies. However, I personally do not think that buying an electronic hardware manufacturer is the right way to play the trend. The reason? Huge growth potential will attract a lot of competition. Over time, that competition will erode away profit margins, leaving investors with poor returns. For that reason, I think it is a far smarter idea to buy shares of a cellular network provider like Verizon Communications instead. After all, those billions of devices that are expected to come online will need access to a mobile network in order to work. That provides Verizon with a great new avenue for growth in the years ahead. You might not be aware of it, but Verizon is already benefiting from the IoT trend. Last quarter, Verizon's IoT revenue grew by 24% to $217 million, making it one of the company's fastest-growing divisions. Sure, that's still just a drop in the bucket when compared with the company's wireless and wireline revenue, but over time IoT revenue holds promise to grow like wildfire. That could help propel the company's long-term revenue and profit growth. Verizon certainly believes that the IoT represents a huge opportunity, which is why it is investing accordingly. Earlier this year, Verizon bought Telogis and Sensity Systems, both of which will add to the company's IoT product offering. Over time I think investors should expect even more bolt-on acquisitions to ensure that it maintains a strong foothold in this important and growing market. Throw in a dividend yield that tops 4.6% and I think Verizon is a great way for conservative investors to get their IoT exposure. Keith Noonan (Cisco): Overcoming security and standardization issues that arise from moving data between disparate devices and networks is one of the main obstacles to the evolution of connectivity, and no company is better suited to deal with it than Cisco. The company's Internet of Things and Applications Group vice president, Rowan Trollope, recently said that the company can deliver many of the connectivity and security needs brought on by IoT because ""it owns the network."" There's some simplification involved in that statement, but Cisco's leading position in networking means that the company is going to have a formative impact on the progression of IoT. The company is in the process of giving device makers tools and applications-programming interfaces to help with standardization and to cut down on security threats that could limit the progression of the tech. Cisco is taking these steps to get the big players on board with its network and certification process in order to facilitate its transition to a more subscription-based business model. This year, the company purchased Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion in order to bolster its service offerings and fast-track its position in IoT connectivity and analytics platforms. The big connectivity push also presents opportunities that could lift Cisco's hardware businesses. The networking giant has partnered with Ericsson, Intel, and Verizon for the development of a 5G mobile router, and could benefit from demand for routers and switches that are tailored for customers' IoT needs. Priced at just 12.5 times forward earnings estimates, with roughly $40 billion in cash and short-term investments on the books, and a 3.5% dividend yield, Cisco stock offers an inexpensive valuation, hefty returned income, and a forefront position in the Internet of Things.

Image source: Google. When Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unveiled its fancy new Pixel phone in October, which overall looks like a strong smartphone, there was one bizarre anachronism associated with the device: it was launching as a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exclusive. Well, at least in terms of distribution, as Big Red was the only U.S. carrier that would sell the Pixel at its retail store, even though technically the device is supported on all four major carriers. Android Police reported earlier this week that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is planning on rolling out Pixel displays at its retail locations. But here's the rub: The Un-carrier will only be displaying the Pixel, and won't be actively selling the device. What gives? T-Mobile sales reps will reportedly encourage interested customers to purchase the device directly from Google's online store. T-Mobile has been offering a Pixel promotion for a couple months, giving $325 to anyone that brings a Pixel to T-Mobile's network. The promotion value is spread out over two years via monthly bill credits, which is T-Mobile's way of making sure customers stick around. ""Verizon is spending millions to convince people that Google's Pixel is 'only on Verizon' and it is just not true,"" a T-Mobile spokesperson told FierceWireless. ""The Pixel works great on T-Mobile with unlimited high-speed data and a faster, more advanced LTE network. Buy one from Google or buy one from Verizon and bring it on over."" It goes without saying that this is an inconvenient solution for T-Mobile customers, who would much rather just buy the device directly from T-Mobile in a seamless transaction. Instead, customers have to buy the device from somewhere else, and then jump through all the hoops to get the promotion. T-Mobile is obviously interested in carrying the Pixel, but its hands are probably tied for the time being due to Verizon's exclusivity. Scoring an exclusive means exactly that. Verizon is the only carrier allowed to distribute Pixel for now, so the real question is how long the exclusivity window lasts. Once the exclusivity expires, I would imagine more carriers will look to sign on with Google to sell the Pixel at its retail stores, which is easily the most important distribution channel in the smartphone market -- as well as potentially the biggest limiting factor for Pixel. Considering the broader shift away from carrier exclusives, it's hard to imagine Verizon's exclusivity window lasting more than three to six months, which importantly should cover the busy holiday shopping season. T-Mobile's push to display the Pixel but not to officially sell the Pixel likely skirts the exclusivity, which Verizon probably doesn't take too kindly. In any event, there's a very good chance that the Pixel sees wider carrier availability once Verizon's exclusivity has ended, which will probably be in early to mid-2017. ","

Stu Woo,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 10, 2016 2:01 p.m. ET By LONDON -- Telecommunications giant Vodafone Group PLC has a mantra: Be No. 1. Or No. 2. U.K.-based Vodafone, the world's second-biggest mobile carrier by subscribers, is trying to keep that position by having the most -- or second-most -- customers in each of its 26 countries. ""It's not really about being the leader,"" Chief Executive Vittorio Colao told analysts last month. Vodafone believes the top two players in telecom markets -- and it doesn't matter if they are first or second -- are able to differentiate themselves through superior networks and services. By focusing investments in these two areas, the leading operators can justify higher prices. ""The gap versus No. 3s is not only stable, but even increasing,"" Mr. Colao said, adding ""it's about really creating a two-tier market."" Even after a $130 billion windfall from the 2014 sale of its Verizon Wireless stake, Vodafone has so far eschewed big, global expansion. Under Mr. Colao, a 55-year-old Italian reserve military officer who took over as CEO in 2008, the company left the consumer U.S. market and has plowed investment into Europe and the developing world instead. Vodafone's biggest competitors are typically formerly state-owned fixed-line giants still catching up in the mobile age. It earned GBP41 billion ($50 billion) in revenue for the last full fiscal year and ranks below only China Mobile Ltd. in terms of global subscribers. Over two years, Mr. Colao spent about $24 billion across his empire, which is concentrated in Europe, Africa and India, to expand high-speed mobile networks, the pillar of its marketing campaigns. Vodafone also spent about $20 billion in 2013 and 2014 to buy major cable operators in Germany and Spain, and it is expanding its wired cable and internet network so it can sell the telecom industry's Holy Grail: a ""quad-play"" package that offers mobile, landline telephone, cable and internet services on one bill. The results so far are mixed: Vodafone said last month that its plan was paying off in parts of Europe, but proving much more expensive than anticipated in India. Overall, Vodafone's organic revenue, which excludes foreign-exchange movement, grew 2.2% in the third quarter of 2016, outperforming the average 1.6% growth of major Europe-based telecom firms, according to Raymond James analyst Stephane Beyazian. Leading the way over the past six months was Germany, with 2.3% organic growth, and Italy, at 1.7%. But Vodafone's organic revenue declined 2.7% in its home market of the U.K. -- where it is the No. 3 mobile operator behind BT Group PLC, which operates the EE brand, and Telefónica SA's O2. Mr. Colao blames the shortfall partly on billing problems and customer-service complaints related to a new computer system. Even more costly has been defending its No. 2 status in India. New mobile carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., funded by India's richest man, has offered free service for at least a month to get new customers. Vodafone wrote down the value of its India business by EUR5 billion ($5.3 billion) earlier this month, citing the competition. ""It is very hard to compete with someone who gives stuff for free,"" Mr. Colao said. Vodafone was formed in Newbury, England, in 1984 and spun off from military and electronics conglomerate Racal Electronics Group in 1991. It was one of the world's first mobile-focused telecom companies, and obtained licenses in a hodgepodge of countries early in the cellphone era and via two big deals. It merged with AirTouch Communications, a San Francisco-based mobile carrier with world-wide holdings, in 1999. The next year, it acquired Mannesmann AG, a German telecommunications business with European operations. In 1999, Vodafone merged its U.S. mobile operations with those of Bell Atlantic Corp., with the latter renaming itself Verizon Communications Inc. They called their joint venture Verizon Wireless, with Verizon owning 55% and Vodafone the other 45%. Verizon Communications had long tried to buy out Vodafone's shares, but the two didn't reach an agreement until 2013. The sale closed in 2014. Vodafone gave back $84 billion from the sale to shareholders -- the largest single return in modern corporate history. A chunk of the remainder went to pay taxes and reduce debt. The rest of those funds helped bankroll Vodafone's two-year network-improvement program. The project, which mostly wrapped up this past spring, focused on expanding Vodafone's fourth-generation mobile network, or 4G, in Europe and both its fourth- and third-generation networks in emerging markets such as India. For years, Vodafone and John Malone's Liberty Global PLC have publicly flirted with the idea of a combination. The two companies expect to complete a merger of their operations in the Netherlands later this year, creating a 50-50 joint venture. Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference last month, Mr. Colao and Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said the Dutch tie-up wasn't necessarily indicative of future deals. But Mr. Colao kept the door open. ""We see the world the same way,"" Mr. Colao told investors, describing Mr. Fries. ""Is this the first trial of something bigger? Not necessarily....But of course it helps to know each other.""

                                    in jeopardy. To make security great again, we must augment the best preventive security with detection capabilities that can catch an attacker red-handed at an early stage, before damage can occur. This is a departure from the conventional “Cold War” security mindset that is concerned with keeping attackers out by building taller and thicker walls. It involves assuming that attackers will break into the network and become active — the most common breach scenario of 2016 — and shifting strategy, tools and staffing as a result. Today, the industry average time for finding an active attacker is about five months, reflecting the colossal failure of conventional security. The state of the union for federal security is that few if any non-defense agencies can find an active attacker on their network. Most cannot find a network intruder or a malicious insider, such as a rogue employee or contractor, working to steal or damage information or assets. Consider that the National Security Agency, the Office of Personnel Management and the FBI were breached along top security vendors and agencies. If government agencies with some of the top security talent were no match for cybercriminals, how can an enterprise stand up to the same threats? Since most organizations, public or private, lack the ability to find active network attackers, there is no telling if an intruder is lurking and what they have been able to accomplish. Only in the relatively straightforward “breaking and entering” cybercrimes of stolen personal information or financial details does it become clear at some point that a breach has transpired and damage has been done. With other forms of attack, you may never know. While defensive security is essential, it is no longer sufficient to protect networks. Security leaders in business and government need to admit to today’s reality and focus efforts on detecting active attackers. They need to shift from the traditional model of first encountering a threat and then developing a way to identify and block it. Instead, they need to find attackers by their operational activities that may blend in with normal network events. Such detection is difficult, but it can be done. It requires security based on behavioral profiling to find exceptional attack activities, rather than just trying to prevent the installation of malware. Preventive security is actually quite good and can deflect the vast majority of external threats. The trouble is that it can’t prevent every one. There are far too many ways for an attacker to get into a network, often just through compromising an employee’s or contractor’s computer or account through phishing or malicious software that loads on an unsuspecting user from a legitimate website. Now, in addition to a strong defense, companies need to expect that attackers will be able make their way on to the network. They need to spot them by their operational activities—the step-by-step processes that attackers must perform to gain control of valuable network assets. Instead of trying to find aspects of “known bad,” security professionals need a model of “known good” so that attacker activities can stand out from normal network events. That, for example, would understand that no one in the marketing department has ever used a tool like PowerShell, which is for network administrators, and to flag it as an anomaly when one does. One of the most important questions Donald Trump should be asking after he takes office in January is: “Do we have the ability to know if there is an active attacker on our networks?” That should be followed up with: “If so, how?” or “What is our level of confidence?” C-suite executives should be asking the same questions. What’s needed in both the public and private sectors is a new impetus for protecting vital assets and entrusted information based on admitting that an attacker will get in. Continuing with today’s approach will only yield more devastating loss and damage and becomes an illustration of insanity. Security must be modernized to meet the modern challenges and make it great again. Kasey Cross is director of product management at LightCyber, a leading provider of behavioral attack detection.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed. The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday. Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record. It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement. Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.” ","
                Yahoo under scrutiny after latest hack, Verizon seeks new deal terms | Reuters"
,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the summer of 2013, Yahoo Inc launched a project to better secure the passwords of its customers, abandoning the use of a discredited technology for encrypting data known as MD5. It was too late. In August of that year, hackers got hold of more than a billion Yahoo accounts, stealing the poorly encrypted passwords and other information in the biggest data breach on record. Yahoo only recently uncovered the hack and disclosed it last week. The timing of the attack might seem like bad luck, but the weakness of MD5 had been known by hackers and security experts for more than a decade. MD5 can be cracked more easily than other so-called “hashing” algorithms, which are mathematical functions that convert data into seemingly random character strings. In 2008, five years before Yahoo took action, Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute issued a public warning to security professionals through a U.S. government-funded vulnerability alert system: MD5 “should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.” Yahoo’s failure to move away from MD5 in a timely fashion was an example of problems in Yahoo’s security operations as it grappled with business challenges, according to five former employees and some outside security experts. Stronger hashing technology would have made it more difficult for the hackers to get into customer accounts after breaching Yahoo’s network, making the attack far less damaging, they said. “MD5 was considered dead long before 2013,” said David Kennedy, chief executive of cyber firm TrustedSec LLC. “Most companies were using more secure hashing algorithms by then.” He did not name specific firms. Yahoo, which has confirmed it was still using MD5 at the time of the attack, disputed the notion that the company had skimped on security. “Over the course of our more than 20-year history, Yahoo has focused on and invested in security programs and talent to protect our users,” Yahoo said in a statement to Reuters. “We have invested more than $250 million in security initiatives across the company since 2012.” The former Yahoo security staffers, however, told Reuters the security team was at times turned down when it requested new tools and features such as strengthened cryptography protections, on the grounds that the requests would cost too much money, were too complicated, or were simply too low a priority. Partly, that reflected the internet pioneer’s long-running financial struggles: Yahoo’s revenues and profits have fallen steadily since their 2008 peak while Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook Inc and others have come to dominate the consumer internet business. “When business is good, it’s easy to do things like security,” said Jeremiah Grossman, who worked on Yahoo’s security team from 1999 to 2001. “When business is bad, you expect to see security get cut.” To be sure, no system is completely hack-proof. Hackers have managed to break into passwords that were encrypted using more advanced technologies than MD5. Other Internet companies, such as LinkedIn and AOL, have also suffered security breaches, though none nearly as large as Yahoo’s. “This could happen to any large corporation,” said Tom Kellermann, a former World Bank security manager and security industry executive. Kellermann, now CEO of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures, said he was not surprised that it had taken Yahoo several years to identify the massive attacks. “Hackers often have a capacity to burrow deeper than we thought into a system and remain for years,” he said. Reuters could not determine how many companies besides Yahoo were using MD5 in 2013. Google, Facebook and Microsoft Corp did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to another former security veteran at Yahoo, even when the company was growing quickly, security sometimes took a back seat as the company focused on system performance to keep up with the growth. Then, when growth stalled, senior security staff left for other companies and the chances of getting approval for expensive upgrades dropped further, the person said. “Any changes to the user database took forever because they were understaffed, and it’s an ultra-critical system - everything depends on it,” said the former Yahoo employee. Yahoo declined to comment on details of its security practices, but said it routinely conducted drills to test and improve its cyber defenses and highlighted campaigns such as a “bug bounty” program in which it pays hackers to find security flaws and report them to the company. Last September, Yahoo disclosed a 2014 cyber attack that affected at least 500 million customer accounts, the biggest known data breach at the time. Following last week’s news of the even bigger 2013 breach, U.S. federal investigators and lawmakers said they are scrutinizing Yahoo’s security practices, and Verizon Communications Inc is seeking to renegotiate a July deal to buy Yahoo’s internet business for $4.8 billion. The former Yahoo employees said the company’s security problems began before the arrival of Chief Executive Marissa Mayer in 2012 and continued under her tenure. Yahoo had suffered attacks by Russian hackers for years, two of the former staffers said. In 2014, Yahoo hired a new security chief, Alex Stamos, and one of the security crews he led - known internally as ‘The Paranoids’ - thought they were making headway against the hackers, former employees said. In 2015, when the security crew discovered a hidden program attached to Yahoo’s email servers that was monitoring all incoming messages, their first thought was that the Russian hackers had come back. It turned out that the program had been installed by Yahoo’s email engineers to comply with a secret surveillance order requested by a U.S. intelligence agency, as Reuters previously reported. Stamos and some of his staff left Yahoo soon after that, creating further disruptions to security operations. This week, in addition to disclosing the 2013 hack, Yahoo said someone had accessed its proprietary computer code to learn how to forge “cookies,” which would allow hackers to access an account without passwords. Yahoo said it connected some cookie-forging activity to the same state-sponsored actor it believed was responsible for the 2014 data theft. “They burrowed in and got access to everything,” said Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security firm Trail of Bits. On Thursday, Germany’s cyber security authority criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt adequate encryption techniques and advised German consumers to switch to other email providers. Yahoo told Reuters it was committed to keeping users secure by staying ahead of new threats. “Today’s security landscape is complex and ever-evolving, but, at Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure.” ","

Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead. Armstrong said Verizon and Yahoo will start planning what a combined company will look like. By the first quarter of 2017, Armstrong said there will be more clarity for the organization.  (Read more: AOL CEO Optimistic on Verizon-Yahoo Deal.)

(CHTR) shares have been gaining in recent days, up more than 4.5% so far this week on continued speculation Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) could buy the cable operator. According to media reports, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam told Wall Street analysts at a meeting earlier this week that buying Charter would make “industrial sense.” McAdam didn’t say Verizon was readying a move or considering a deal, nor was Charter Communications expressing interest. The New York Post, citing sources that were present at the meeting, said Verizon would have to raise its level of debt to acquire Charter Communications, which could make a deal a non-starter. What’s more, the same people told the paper it’s not clear if the Trump Administration would support a deal between the two. Charter, which in May purchased Time Warner Cable for $71 billion, has a market capitalization of $78.8 billion. Ever since AT&T Inc.’s move to acquire Time Warner Inc. and launch its own streaming video content service, DirecTV Now, speculation has been swirling about other M&A in the telecom industry. While some industry watchers said Charter could go after a content company, CEO Tom Rutledge poured cold water on that at a recent investor conference. The executive said Charter is happy where it’s at and doesn’t need to buy a content company. But he didn’t rule out making cable acquisitions, pointing out that the incoming Trump Administration appears more open to consolidation. (See also: Comcast Is Launching Netflix on Set-Top Boxes.)

Speaking during the Sohn Conference in London last week, Hohn, who owns shares of Charter, said he thinks the company will be a takeover target given the consolidation going on in the U.S. market, naming Verizon as a bidder. Hohn’s comments echo a similar assessment by RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin, who recently initiated coverage of Charter with an outperform rating and $325 price target.

Image source: Getty Images. Instead, Wheeler's FCC has been extremely pro-consumer, to the consternation of the industry. The news that Wheeler is now departing his position could mean a reversal of his pro-consumer legacy and, most notably, his signature net neutrality ruling. In 2015, Wheeler's FCC cemented its pro-consumer legacy. By classifying Internet-service providers (ISPs) as ""common carriers,"" the legislative rule-making body essentially guaranteed net neutrality by ensuring ISPs act as a neutral gateway to the Internet and banning ISPs from speeding up or slowing down legal content passing through their networks. While consumer advocates, digital publishers, and streaming video providers like Netflix were elated with the decision, network providers like Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Comcast were enraged with the FCC's Title II designation. Quickly after the ruling, the NTCA (yes, the same organization once led by Chairman Wheeler) and the American Cable Association quickly moved to sue the FCC. AT&T filed a separate lawsuit quickly thereafter. In June, the D.C. Court of Appeals sided with the FCC and upheld their common carrier status. However, as is customary when a new party wins an election, Wheeler has agreed to step down as FCC chairman on Jan. 20, when Donald Trump is inaugurated. The newly appointed FCC head will most likely be a net-neutrality foe and, along with the new republican FCC majority, will quickly chip away at earlier pro-net neutrality rulings. Net neutrality has become a partisan lawmaker issue, with Democrats in near-unanimous support with Republicans referring to the ruling as ""Obamacare of the Internet."" Recode succinctly described Wheeler's departure as the ""death knell"" for net neutrality. The obvious winners of a repeal of net neutrality would be the ISPs themselves. The ability to charge sites more for using their network is another monetization method to boost top-line results. However, ISPs could still benefit from net neutrality's demise without charging websites for faster delivery. For example, Verizon could be well positioned since it has doubled down on a digital-strategy by purchasing AOL (and its host of digital properties like Engadget, The Huffington Post, and TechCrunch ) and is in the process of buying Yahoo!. Delivering these websites faster while slowing down others should boost the company's bottom line by making these sites more attractive to users...and by extension, marketers. To be fair, some consumers could be beneficiaries of net neutrality laws as well. As wireless service has become a quite-competitive space, carriers have resorted to creative ways to differentiate themselves and to promote higher-margin products. For example, AT&T has announced that streaming on its DirecTV Now products does not count against wireless data cap limits. Verizon offers the same deal for its NFL Mobile and Go90 streaming-video app. The FCC had argued these data-free cutouts, also known as zero-metering, were violations of net neutrality since they amounted to unfair treatment of competing services. Consumers may ultimately receive cheaper internet, but at the expense of a more-limited user experience dictated by consumer interest. One thing is for sure: ISPs are elated about Wheeler's pending departure -- whether consumers should be is decidedly less clear. ","

Daniel B. Kline,12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) both operate subscription-driven businesses facing pressure from changing technologies, increased competition, and somewhat uncertain consumer behavior. The main differences between the two companies are scale -- AT&T had revenues of $40.9 billion in Q3, while Frontier had $2.52 billion -- and diversity. AT&T sells internet, cable, satellite, landline, and wireless service, while Frontier offers only cable, landlines, and internet. AT&T, of course, also has a deal to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), which would heavily diversify it outside its core businesses. AT&T is what Frontier hopes to be someday. It's a giant that has the most pay-television customers (when you add DIRECTV and its U-verse brand), the second-most wireless subscribers behind Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and the third most internet customers. Frontier has bought its way to a position of minor relevance with about 5.5 million customers, and about 4.4 million of those get broadband from the company and 1.5 million paying for cable. Still, while AT&T dwarfs Frontier, giants have a longer way to fall than those a little closer to the ground. Both companies face similar challenges, but each one is set up to handle them differently. AT&T has built a revenue machine where it can leverage its various products to attain customers, keep them, and get them to spend more. For example, it no longer offers new wireless subscribers unlimited data, but it made an exception to that policy for anyone who bundled wireless with DIRECTV. That's an attractive deal that's likely to win customers from rivals. It's also an offer that makes it that much harder for people to leave. AT&T, however, does face risks in a few areas. In wireless, the company faces pricing pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint, both of which are spending a lot of money on ads pointing out that AT&T and Verizon no longer have commanding leads when it comes to network quality. The company also faces cord-cutting issues on a grand scale. Broadly, its U-verse service has been losing customers (325,000 in Q3), while its cheaper DIRECTV has been gaining about the same amount (323,000 in Q3). That's an intentional move, as the company wants to move people to its satellite service, but ultimately it gives the company nearly 21 million eggs in the same DIRECTV basket. That's a risk that has so far paid off, but satellite is less reliable than wired service in many cases, and customers losing service during bad a snow or rain storm could tip them over the edge when it comes to cord-cutting. AT&T also has the very uncertain prospects of its purchase of Time Warner. Should the deal be approved, there's no guarantee that the company will be able to use the content company to increase loyalty to its other products. It's also worth noting that cord-cutting and skinny bundles are negative headwinds for Time Warner's cable channels as well. As the preceding chart showed, AT&T stock has been trending up while Frontier's has been inching down. Frontier opened the year at $4.60 and closed on December 14 at $3.44, a 25% drop. AT&T opened 2016 at $34.08 before closing on Dec. 14 at $41.11, a 20% gain. Those numbers tell you everything you need to know about how investors see the two companies against each other. But there is one case where in 2017 Frontier shareholders could see a better than 20% return. That's not likely to happen because of continuing operations, as the company has had a hard time holding onto or adding customers. That could, maybe even should, improve as the company further integrates the California, Texas, and Florida properties it bought from Verizon, but it's hard to see Frontier making any big leaps forward. Where Frontier could outpace AT&T in shareholder return next year is if it were to be acquired. There are very few smaller cable and internet players left to be acquired, and Frontier might fetch more than the 22% premium Altice paid for Cablevision  in September 2015. Cable and internet make up a space where size matters, and Frontier doesn't have it. AT&T faces some negative headwinds, and the Time Warner deal could be a short-term drag, but ultimately it simply has too many entrenched ways to make money. It faces the same challenges Frontier does, but it has more tools to combat the problem. An acquisition might bring Frontier shareholders a better return than AT&T delivers next year, but for the long term, despite the challenges it faces, AT&T has a more diverse company setup to win customers, keep them, and wrangle more money out of them. Frontier simply can't offer that. ","

"Evan Niu, CFA",12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Google. When Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unveiled its fancy new Pixel phone in October, which overall looks like a strong smartphone, there was one bizarre anachronism associated with the device: it was launching as a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exclusive. Well, at least in terms of distribution, as Big Red was the only U.S. carrier that would sell the Pixel at its retail store, even though technically the device is supported on all four major carriers. Android Police reported earlier this week that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is planning on rolling out Pixel displays at its retail locations. But here's the rub: The Un-carrier will only be displaying the Pixel, and won't be actively selling the device. What gives? T-Mobile sales reps will reportedly encourage interested customers to purchase the device directly from Google's online store. T-Mobile has been offering a Pixel promotion for a couple months, giving $325 to anyone that brings a Pixel to T-Mobile's network. The promotion value is spread out over two years via monthly bill credits, which is T-Mobile's way of making sure customers stick around. ""Verizon is spending millions to convince people that Google's Pixel is 'only on Verizon' and it is just not true,"" a T-Mobile spokesperson told FierceWireless. ""The Pixel works great on T-Mobile with unlimited high-speed data and a faster, more advanced LTE network. Buy one from Google or buy one from Verizon and bring it on over."" It goes without saying that this is an inconvenient solution for T-Mobile customers, who would much rather just buy the device directly from T-Mobile in a seamless transaction. Instead, customers have to buy the device from somewhere else, and then jump through all the hoops to get the promotion. T-Mobile is obviously interested in carrying the Pixel, but its hands are probably tied for the time being due to Verizon's exclusivity. Scoring an exclusive means exactly that. Verizon is the only carrier allowed to distribute Pixel for now, so the real question is how long the exclusivity window lasts. Once the exclusivity expires, I would imagine more carriers will look to sign on with Google to sell the Pixel at its retail stores, which is easily the most important distribution channel in the smartphone market -- as well as potentially the biggest limiting factor for Pixel. Considering the broader shift away from carrier exclusives, it's hard to imagine Verizon's exclusivity window lasting more than three to six months, which importantly should cover the busy holiday shopping season. T-Mobile's push to display the Pixel but not to officially sell the Pixel likely skirts the exclusivity, which Verizon probably doesn't take too kindly. In any event, there's a very good chance that the Pixel sees wider carrier availability once Verizon's exclusivity has ended, which will probably be in early to mid-2017. ","

Leo Sun,12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Most financial advisors will tell retirees to put most of their savings in bonds, which offer fixed income without the volatility -- so long as they aren't sold before maturity. That might seem wise as interest rates climb, but retirees can still consider buying a few high-yielding ETFs (exchange-traded funds) for better price appreciation or higher yields. Image source: Getty Images. Within this category, I prefer well-diversified ETFs that have a good track record of beating the S&P 500, or covered call ETFs that might lag the market but offer much higher yields. Let's take a look at three ETFs that fit those criteria: the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM), the iShares Core High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:HDV), and the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:SDY). The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF is a passively managed basket of the 419 highest-yielding stocks in the U.S. (excluding REITs and master limited partnerships), and it weights them according to their market caps. Its top 10 holdings -- which account for 31% of its portfolio -- include Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, and JPMorgan Chase. The ETF currently pays a 2.9% dividend, which is 38% higher than the S&P 500's average yield of 2.1%, and over the past decade it has roughly matched the performance of the S&P 500 (though it has lagged slightly over the past five years). Past performance doesn't guarantee future returns, but this well-diversified ETF represents a simple way to remain invested in the top dividend stocks at all times. Its low expense ratio of 0.09% also makes it much cheaper than actively managed ETFs. However, the ETF is currently trading above its NAV (net asset value) at the time of this writing, which means a slight correction could be coming. Investors looking for a higher-than-average yield should check out the iShares Core High Dividend ETF, which pays a 3.4% yield. The ETF consists of a smaller basket of 75 high-yielding U.S. dividend stocks (which also excludes REITs and MLPs), and its top holdings include ExxonMobil, AT&T, Chevron, Verizon, and Johnson & Johnson. Its exposure to oil, which accounts for 20% of its holdings, is slightly worrisome due to volatile oil prices and ExxonMobil and Chevron's current payout ratios of over 100%. However, oil prices could stabilize next year on production cuts and rising demand. This passively managed ETF has a low expense ratio of 0.08%, making it a lower-cost and higher-yielding play than Vanguard's High Dividend Yield ETF. However, the iShares ETF has slightly underperformed Vanguard's over the past five-year and 10-year periods, and currently trades slightly above its NAV. Investors looking for long-term dividend growth might favor the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF, which owns a basket of 108 Dividend Aristocrats (including REITs) -- that is, companies that have raised their payouts annually for at least 25 straight years. The fund's top holdings include AT&T, People's United Financial, HCP, Chevron, and Nucor. Its portfolio is heavily weighted toward the industrial and financial sectors, which each account for about 16% of its holdings. Dividend-generating ETFs can help retirees quickly diversify their portfolios across various sectors and generate a steady stream of income. However, some dividend ETFs that chase yield neglect crucial factors like free cash flows, payout ratios, and dividend hike histories. Therefore retirees might find that dividend stalwarts like AT&T or Johnson & Johnson can generate comparable income without the complexities of expense ratios and net asset values. For affordable stocks in that category, check out my other article on solid income stocks with P/E ratios under 15. ","

Michael Brush,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 8:46 a.m. ET Those with high deferred tax liabilities will be the real winners By Many investors are now hunting for companies that pay high U.S. taxes because they stand to benefit the most if Donald Trump cuts corporate taxes, as he said he would. But the real accounting sleuths are looking elsewhere for the hidden gems that may get the biggest boost. They’re digging up the companies that have the largest “deferred tax liabilities” on the books. If you want to skip the details on the moving parts and just get to examples of the biggest beneficiaries, then go to the “ big potential winners” section below. Otherwise, here’s a little background on what’s at work. (Also read: How S&P 500 companies would save $87.1 billion if Trump passes his tax plan.) You can think of a deferred tax liability as a store of value on the balance sheet that gets released on to the income statement over time for accounting purposes. Companies use this account to make up for differences in how they keep their two sets of books — one for the tax collector and the other for investors. Companies typically expense certain costs — the price of big-ticket items like equipment and plants, for example — more quickly for the IRS than they can in the books prepared for investors. This lowers their taxes in the near term. But then they go up in later years, all things being equal. To make up for the timing differences, companies set aside deferred tax liabilities. Here’s where things get interesting for investors. Companies calculate the amount to set aside using the prevailing tax rate, currently 35%. But if Trump and Republicans in Congress reduce the tax rate, companies will suddenly have to set aside far less money for deferred tax liabilities, providing an immediate boost to earnings. Suppose the tax rate gets cut to 20%, a likely compromise scenario in Washington. (Trump wants 15%, but many Congressional leaders don’t want to go quite that far.) This would mean a company’s new deferred tax liability would be 57% (or 20%/35%) of the old one. Deferred tax liabilities would decline by 43%, in other words. That money would go straight to the income statement as “earnings” and, theoretically at least, boost the value of a company’s market value. “It’s a gift from the government. It’s like debt forgiveness,” says Bastiat Capital founder Albert Meyer, an accounting expert whose stock picks are up an annualized 7.9% since April 2006 versus 5% for the benchmark S&P 500 Index. “If they lower the tax rate, the deferred tax liability has to be restated, and that provides a onetime credit in the income statement.” True, this is a “non cash” event. There is no money that magically appears out of nowhere. But it will affect reported earnings and thus influence investor sentiment on a stock. The big potential winners To find some of the biggest potential winners, I asked S&P Global Market Intelligence to screen for the companies with the largest deferred tax liabilities. The two companies with the biggest are Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

                                   at $31.7 billion. Those companies could see their market values rise 7% to 10% from the effect of the tax reduction. To see why, let’s walk through an example, with AT&T. If the tax rate drops to 20%, AT&T’s deferred tax liability would decline to $34 billion from $59.6 billion, a reduction of $25.5 billion. Hence, there would be a $25.5 billion credit adjustment in the income statement, effectively boosting earnings by $25.5 billion in the year of the restatement, says Meyer. Since the company has a $245 billion market value, that $25.5 billion gain theoretically represents a 10.45% increase in market value, he says. That is just an estimate, not a hard-and-fast rule. But it’s a good gauge of the potential impact the change may have on how investors think about valuing the company. Now, consider Pfizer. The tax cut reduction to 20% would take down its deferred tax liability of $31.7 billion to $18.1 billion, for a “savings” of $13.6 billion. That could represent a 7% increase in its $186 billion market value. Utilities While the six companies above have the biggest absolute deferred tax liabilities, the biggest potential impact to stock prices may lie elsewhere — among the companies that have the largest liabilities relative to their market values. Since utilities spend a lot on plants and equipment, they have some of the biggest depreciation expenses for tax purposes. So they have some of the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value. Utilities also happen to be out of favor among investors right now, which makes them an interesting contrarian play. Investors are fleeing bond-like stocks that pay high dividends, such as utilities, on fears that Federal Reserve interest-rate increases will be bad for those stocks. The theory is that the shares of bond-like stocks (and bond prices) can fall as interest rates go up, since the price moves “adjust up” their yields to match yields set higher in the markets because of Fed rate hikes. This widespread aversion to utilities is one reason Larry McDonald of the Bear Traps Report likes utilities as a contrarian buy right now. An added plus for utilities is that they typically have big deferred tax liabilities. Thus, they stand to gain a lot if Washington cuts the corporate tax rate. According to my calculations using data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, the six utilities with the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value are: Entergy

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P continues to digest the December breakout. From current levels, the 2,263 area remains an inflection point, and is followed by the S&P’s all-time high of 2,277.5. (The S&P’s record closing high rests at 2,271.72, and has been challenged early Tuesday.)

                                   is holding the range top. Consider that before Tuesday, the Dow’s all-time closing, and absolute peaks held at 19,911.21, and 19,966.43, respectively. Both areas remain under siege. Conversely, the range bottom matches last week’s low of 19,748. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains technical. As illustrated, the index bottomed twice last week at 5,426, precisely matching first support. Conversely, the Nasdaq’s all-time closing, and intraday peaks, rest at 5,463.83, and 5,486.75 respectively. Separately, the index has staged alternating tests of the range across five straight sessions. Technical price action within an uptrend is bullish. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has sustained the December breakout. First support closely matches the 5,400 mark, and is followed by the 5,340 breakout point. More broadly, the prevailing upturn builds on the steep July rally. An intermediate-term target projects to the 5,570 area. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has taken flight, thus far topping 34 points under the 20,000 mark. Though still near-term extended — and due to consolidate at some point — the prevailing bull flag is a continuation pattern, technically positioning the index for incremental gains. Near-term support matches last week’s close of 19,843, illustrated on the hourly chart, and is followed by a deeper floor around 19,750. Similarly, the S&P 500 has established a flag pattern, digesting the December spike. Recall that S&P 2,252 marks near-term support, illustrated on the hourly chart, and is followed by a more significant floor at 2,214. Broadly speaking, each major U.S. benchmark has established an orderly five-session range, consolidating slightly under record territory. The muted selling pressure, even after the Federal Reserve’s rate hike last week (and hawkishly revised outlook), is technically constructive. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. Recall that the IWM bottomed last week at 134.81 — slightly above the November peak — an area that pivots to support. Conversely, the all-time closing, and absolute peaks — 138.31, and 138.82, respectively — remain within striking distance. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has staged a flattish pullback from record territory. First support matches last week’s low, fractionally under 303, and is followed by the November peak of 298.77. Conversely, resistance matches the MDY’s all-time highs, technically spanning from 309.09 to 309.59. Widening considerably, to the S&P 500’s three-year view, adds perspective. Each bar on the chart above represents one week. As illustrated, the index has staged two directionally sharp 2016 spikes to uncharted territory. The prevailing late-year rally builds on the initial July Brexit-fueled breakout. The intervening downturn was comparably flat, punctuated by a brief pre-election violation of the 2,131 floor, and the more important 2,117 support. Fast forward to the present, and first support rests at S&P 2,252, an area pinned to price action, and a percentage downturn, detailed last week. This is followed by more significant support at the 2,214 breakout point, and the 2,190 mark, closely matching the December closing low. (Recall that the current leg higher originates from the Dec. 1 close of 2,191, effectively matching major support.) The S&P 500’s intermediate- to longer-term technical bias points higher barring a violation. Also see: Bull trend confirmed: Charting the approach of Dow 20,000 ahead of the Fed.

                                   plunged to its range bottom to start December, pressured after the European Central Bank’s policy directive. The shares subsequently followed through, plunging to record lows after the Federal Reserve’s policy statement. (Very generally, rising U.S. interest rates make the dollar more attractive versus the euro, a backdrop contributing to prevailing trends.) Fast forward to the present, and the euro has ventured closer to parity with the U.S. dollar, pressured amid rising geopolitical tensions, and following the Bank of Japan’s “status quo” policy statement, issued last night. Conversely, the U.S. dollar has extended its late-year rally. Consider that the breakout accelerated last week, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s second interest rate hike in a decade.

Image source: Getty Images. At first glance, Sprint (NYSE:S) vs. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) looks like a very simple, natural rivalry. Two of the four nationwide wireless networks, set up in a steel cage, do battle over traditional telecom metrics and issues, and a single survivor leaves the ring victorious. That's actually not how this rivalry works at all. Let's get complicated. First, let me give you a sense of the two companies' relative scale: Metric Verizon Sprint How Much Bigger Is Verizon's Number? Trailing revenue $128 billion $32.4 billion 4 times Net income $14 billion ($1.8 billion) N/A Trailing free cash flow $11.7 billion $2.4 billion 5 times Enterprise value $319 billion $65 billion 5 times Data source: Yahoo! Finance. In short, Sprint can't hold a candle to Verizon's hugeness. In an industry where economies of scale play a deciding role, this is a massive business advantage for Big Red. The company can strike billion-dollar deals without breaking a sweat, take large business risks without betting the farm, and negotiate from a position of cash-backed strength. Meanwhile, Sprint nurses negative earnings and returns on equity under a crushing debt load. The company depends on capital injections from majority owner SoftBank just to keep its network upgrades and other business plans alive. And for the income investors out there, Verizon sports a generous 4.3% dividend yield while Sprint can't afford to spend any cash at all on dividend checks. Knockout in round one, right? Verizon must be the only reasonable choice, thanks to a dominant financial performance. Well, not quite. Sprint investors have enjoyed a thrilling 138% return in 2016. Verizon shareholders had to settle for 16%, or 21% if you include reinvested dividend payments along the way. Market momentum is clearly on Sprint's side, and there are certainly plenty of buyers out there who see value in Sprint shares. Yes, more value than they see in Verizon's stock. In many ways, Sprint is a turnaround gamble. From the end of 2013 to the start of 2016, share prices had fallen a bloodcurdling 66%. The company is in the habit of reporting weak subscriber counts and even weaker bottom-line profits, and that hurts in the long run. This year's bounce rests on a firmer top line and smaller cash losses -- plus the tantalizing possibility of Sprint joining forces with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) to create a third megatelecom. Reports would have it that Sprint wants to buy T-Mobile in a deal financed by SoftBank cash. The Japanese company keeps inviting these rumors only to swat them away once the wild and woolly tales get going. In the latest round of this action, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son promised President-elect Donald Trump to invest $50 billion in the American market, raising the ghost of T-Mobile combination plans again. But the cash is reportedly meant for investment in smaller start-up businesses, not big-ticket buyouts. But that report's boost never faded from Sprint's stock chart, even after dismissing the direct buyout conclusion. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts.

    Stock Face-Off: Verizon Communications Inc. vs. Sprint Corp. -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Though it might seem simple and straightforward, investing in top telecom stocks is far more complex than it initially seems. As we learned in an earlier two-part blueprint for investing in telecom companies, providers of wireless and landline services operate in a multifaceted, highly regulated industry. If you really want to gain an in-depth sense of the industry, I suggest the above two articles as a great starting place. However, as a quick primer, we'll review three of the most important high-level takeaways that anyone considering buying telecom stocks absolutely must consider. When it comes to winning in the telecom space, history shows time and again that size matters. The telecom industry's massive fixed costs -- and the voluminous cash flows they can eventually produce -- allow the companies with the financial resources to invest in their wireless or wireline infrastructure to maintain their competitive positions. Moreover, closing the gap between market leaders and potential challengers requires massive capital expenditures on the insurgents' parts, which can strain companies' balance sheets along the way. Here's a quick example of how this dynamic plays out among U.S. wireless providers, where AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are the entrenched incumbents, and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) desperately want to steal market share from the former. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash Flow from Operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital Expenditures -$19.2 billion -$17.7 billion -$7.0 billion -$4.7 billion) Free Cash Flow $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending 3/31/16. To me, this is one of the most important charts in explaining the current competitive stance of the U.S. wireless market. Verizon (143 million) and AT&T (133 million) enjoy a roughly 2-to-1 wireless subscriber advantage over T-Mobile (69 million) and Sprint (59 million). As you can see, this larger scale translates into AT&T and Verizon needing to invest a far smaller percentage of their cash from operations into their networks than Sprint or T-Mobile. All of that extra free cash flow gives Verizon and AT&T the ability to invest in opportunities like Verizon's acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!, or AT&T's DIRECTV and Time Warner buyouts. When it comes to the telecom business, it pays to be one of the top dogs over the long term. With well-known names like AT&T and Verizon sporting dividend yields more than double the market average, the telecom industry can be a paradise for income investors. However, chasing yield in this sector can be the siren song of a money-losing investment. Here, a company like rural wireline provider Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) serves as a useful cautionary tale. WIN data by YCharts. In case you've never heard of it, Windstream provides landline telephone, broadband, digital TV, and security services to 1.4 million subscribers across the rural areas of 18 states. Spun out from the now-defunct Alltel in 2006, Windstream's strategy has been to roll up as many rural fiber assets and subscribers as possible to essentially become the biggest fish in an area of the telecom industry that's in structural decline. This ""growth via merger"" model works well on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but it ultimately lies on the losing side of history. The company continues to push forward, recently announcing an all-stock merger with the similar EarthLink. However, with demand for its services declining as our digital world evolves, Windstream's core business strategy appears unsustainable over the long term. What likely first pops out when looking at Windstream is its 8% dividend yield. However, as you saw in the above chart, Windstream's temptingly high dividend yield should more appropriately be viewed as a proxy for its risk. There's a long list to support this truism -- see Alaska Communications Systems or Frontier Communications -- but chasing yield in the telecom space is a quick way for investors to lose their shirts, which segues nicely into the final point on telecom investing. The final telecom investing tip might seem obvious, but given the industry's sneakily diverse mix of companies, investors must understand in detail the business model and strategy of a given company prior to buying. Are they in a growing segment of the industry? Wireless providers and the companies that supply their infrastructure are growing, while older technologies are fading. What does their competitive positioning in that market look like? As we saw with wireless providers, AT&T and Verizon remain far stronger than T-Mobile and Sprint. Despite the wireless space's overall favorable growth characteristics, the benefits of that growth are rarely distributed evenly. At the end of the day, this harkens back to Warren Buffett's concept of a circle of competence. Investors make unintended mistakes when they don't take the time to fully understand any potential investment. The seeming simplicity and sleepiness of the telecom industry can mask the underlying complexity of the sector, much to an investors' detriment. Taking the time to dig into a company's competitive position, its dividend details (if applicable), and its business model and outlook are critical steps that can save investors from making costly missteps or, better still, help identify stocks that can earn investors thousands.

    3 Telecom Investing Tips That Could Earn You Thousands -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image Source: Sprint. About two years ago, Sprint's (NYSE:S) marketing team started breaking out chainsaws and other power tools to promote the wireless carrier's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" offer. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) customers could bring their wireless bills to Sprint, and it would give them a service plan with nearly identical data allotments for half the price they paid at the two larger carriers. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) customers didn't get to join in on the overzealous chainsaw-bill-demolishing fun until last year. But those earliest takers of Sprint's bill-shredding offer are now facing the fact that the promotional pricing is limited to two years. Sprint faces the challenge of moving those customers to its regular pricing without losing them to competitors. Even Sprint knows that pricing is its only differentiating factor. Its newest advertising campaign featuring ""Paul from Verizon"" touts how its network is almost as good as Verizon's and its service costs half the price. When the thousands of Sprint customers who switched over for the Cut Your Bill in Half promotion see their bills increase, they're going to have a hard time rationalizing sticking with Sprint. It will also mark the end of any two-year installment or leasing plans they signed when joining Sprint, providing an optimal time to switch carriers. T-Mobile is trying to move away from being viewed as a low-cost service provider like Sprint to a best-value service provider. It's made a few significant price increases over the last few years with the shift to T-Mobile One -- its unlimited data plan -- being the most noticeable. Still, it's hard to argue that T-Mobile doesn't provide one of the best values in wireless service if it has good coverage in your market. And its coverage is improving significantly with the deployment of its recently acquired 700 MHz spectrum -- which provides better signal strength inside buildings. During T-Mobile's third-quarter earnings call, CEO John Legere noted that it's seeing improved porting ratios with Sprint in the early fourth quarter -- i.e., more Sprint customers are coming to T-Mobile for every customer that's leaving it for Sprint. The other carriers' porting ratios remain stable, indicating the results are largely due to customers leaving Sprint specifically, not anything T-Mobile is doing differently. During the first quarter that Sprint ran its Cut Your Bill in Half promotion, it saw a 20% increase in gross postpaid phone additions year over year. It saw strong double-digit percentage growth in postpaid phone gross additions for the next few quarters, although management would often obscure exact details in their earnings releases. The point is, the promotion worked in that it attracted a lot of new customers to Sprint. The problem currently is that those customers are now about to experience a rate hike -- if they haven't already. BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk expects Sprint's postpaid phone gross additions growth will decline to just 1.7% in the fourth quarter from 18.7% last year. He also sees subscriber churn increasing to 1.53% from 1.37% last quarter. As such, Sprint can expect to see continued declines in average revenue per user and slowing postpaid subscriber growth. The result is a likely return to net revenue declines after just breaking out of a two-year slide last quarter. ","
      
    1 Big Reason Sprint Subscribers Might Start Leaving -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. Investors have likely heard a lot about the Internet of Things (IoT). The term refers to the connection of formerly unconnected things to the Internet, so that they can collect data or automate processes. A smartwatch is an IoT device, and so is an Internet-connected tractor that knows how many seeds have been planted, and where. The IoT's broad applications have made it a favorite among some investors, and there are plenty of companies to choose from in the space. But is now a good time to invest? To help answer that question, let's take a look at a few key developments happening in the IoT space right now. Japanese telecom giant SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF) recently purchased the British chipmaker ARM Holdings for nearly $32 billion, mostly based on ARM's position in the IoT. SoftBank's billionaire CEO, Masayoshi Son, had this to say about the importance of IoT in the acquisition: ""First there was the internet, then the mobile internet and next there will be the internet of things, which is going to be the biggest paradigm shift in human history. I'm making this investment at the very beginning of this shift."" SoftBank's purchase of ARM was the company's largest acquisition, the biggest Japanese acquisition in Europe, and one of the largest acquisitions of 2016. The company is betting that ARM's IoT chip designs will be just as popular as ARM's tech has been in smartphones. But SoftBank isn't the only telecom betting on the IoT. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is already making inroads in the IoT space in the U.S. with its Hum automotive telematics service and its upcoming 5G network. The former allows drivers to add an internet-enabled device to their car's onboard diagnostics connection and pair it with an app that tracks how fast the car is going, monitors if it leaves a specified boundary, and provides maintenance reminders. But the real opportunity is in Verizon bringing an IoT-specific network online, to allow the billions future IoT devices to come online. Verizon's vice president of technology planning, Adam Koeppe, said in an interview earlier in 2016 that the ""IoT will be about tens of billions of devices connected to the network. When you think of truly connected societies -- traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters and everything within a city connected and interacting with itself -- that's where 5G comes into play."" The company says that 5G will be the ""foundation for creating more internet-connected devices"" and will bring part of the 5G network online sometime in 2017, with more expansion after that. Companies have been building out IoT platforms for developers for a few years now, but the number of platforms is increasing and their capabilities are expanding. Take Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for example. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been around for a while now, but the company is continually releasing new IoT platforms that help developers connect to it. Amazon's latest IoT platform, called Greengrass, debuted earlier this month and allows developers to set a single hub device to receive data from multiple low-energy devices and transmit the data to the cloud for those devices. All of this allows small IoT devices to conserve energy yet still collect data to be analyzed. That's just one small part of Amazon's broad-based IoT focus, but it's another example of the company building IoT platforms that tie directly into its AWS. That's good news for the company as it expands its AWS revenue, which was $3.2 billion in the third quarter. Amazon isn't the only one going down this path, of course. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has built out several iterations of IoT platforms, and just released its newest one, called Android Things. This version allows developers to build on Android APIs and connect with the company's new Google Assistant. Google has already released several different IoT plaforms (Android@Home and Brillo), but Android Things is already starting to gain traction, with Belkin, WeMo, and Honeywell already signing up. The benefit for Google is the same as with Amazon's IoT platform: If Google can get more developers to use its protocol when building IoT applications, then it might be able to host those devices on its cloud services as well. Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) strong position in the mobile space is undeniable, but as sales of smartphones slow down, even this mobile juggernaut is looking to the IoT for new opportunities. The company made a $37 billion bid for chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) in October and expects the purchase to boost its IoT prospects. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf commented on the acquisition's potential during a conference call: ""Our priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being transformed by mobile technologies. Our proposed acquisition of NXP and our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in these segments."" Qualcomm will use the NXP purchase to enter the growing semi-autonomous car market, while benefiting from NXP's IoT position in the near-field communication and radio-frequency identification spaces as well. Qualcomm says that after the deal closes on NXP, the company will earn about 30% of its total revenue from the Internet of Things and automotive segments, up from about 8% right now. ","
      
    Why 2017 Is the Year to Invest in IoT Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Selena Maranjian,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With fewer and fewer of us able to enjoy traditional pension income, it's more important than ever that we plan for our future financial security and set ourselves up to receive sufficient income when we're no longer working. Here are 10 ways you can boost your retirement income. Image source: Getty Images. You can accumulate a lot of money in tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. Traditional (not Roth) IRAs and 401(k)s receive pre-tax contributions. So, if you have taxable income of $75,000 and you contribute $5,000, you get to subtract that from your taxable income and avoid paying taxes on it now (you will ultimately be taxed on it upon withdrawal in retirement, when your tax rate may be lower). If you're in the 25% tax bracket and contribute $10,000 to these accounts, you'll cut your tax bill by $2,500! Roth varieties of these accounts offer no upfront tax break, but if you follow the rules, you can withdraw from them in retirement tax-free. Here's how much you might be able to accumulate over time: Growing at 8% for $5,000 Invested Annually $10,000 Invested Annually $15,000 Invested Annually 15 years $146,621 $293,243 $439,864 20 years $247,115 $494,229 $741,344 25 years $394,772 $789,544 $1.2 million 30 years $611,729 $1.2 million $1.8 million Calculations by author. A good way to have more income in retirement is to have no mortgage payments due every month. It's smart to pay off your mortgage before retiring, if you can. If you're still some years away from retiring, consider making extra payments in order to reduce your balance. It could even make sense to refinance to a 15-year loan if that will help you pay the house off sooner. Image source: Pixabay. Another option, though one with some significant drawbacks, is a reverse mortgage. With a reverse mortgage, you essentially borrow money based on your home equity and you don't have to pay it back until you die or stop living in your home. It can deliver a welcome income stream -- and a tax-free one at that, generally -- but it can mean your heirs don't get to inherit your home. Learn more about reverse mortgages if you're interested. You have to qualify for one, you may not get as much income as you'd hoped, and you'll face closing costs, but it's still a good solution for some people. Buying an annuity is a lot like buying yourself a pension. Stick with fixed annuities (that pay immediately or later), and think twice about variable or indexed annuities -- as those can have steep fees and restrictive terms and limits on growth. For $200,000, a 70-year-old couple might get an immediate fixed annuity that pays around $1,000 per month for as long as at least one of them is alive. A 70-year-old woman who spends $100,000 may get about $577 per month (that's around $6,900 per year), vs. $641 for a 70-year-old man (about $7,700 per year). Women will usually receive less because they tend to live longer than men. A fixed annuity can provide peace of mind, removing stock market moves and the economy's current condition from your worries. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to your health insurance, spend some time reading up on the topic so you can get the most bang for your buck. Once you're 65, you qualify for Medicare -- and in order to avoid paying a penalty premium every year, you need to not be late signing up. Know that you can choose between original Medicare (Part A and Part B, often with Part D and/or supplemental plans) and Medicare Advantage plans. There are pros and cons to each. For example, original Medicare is accepted across the country by thousands of doctors, whereas Medicare Advantage plans tend to be based in a region, offering access to a certain network of doctors. Medicare Advantage premiums can be lower, plus the plans feature out-of-pocket spending caps. Image source: Getty Images. Investing in stocks and bonds -- and staying invested throughout retirement -- can generate interest and dividend income for you. Remember that even at age 70, you might have another 20 years ahead of you, so it's not crazy to have some of your nest egg in stocks. A $300,000 portfolio of dividend-paying stocks with an average yield of 4% can deliver $12,000 in annual income -- plus the payouts are likely to increase over time as long as the companies remain healthy and growing. Here are some recent yields to give you an idea of what's out there: Stock Recent Dividend Yield AT&T 4.7% Verizon Communications 4.4% General Motors 4.2% Pfizer 3.9% Chevron 3.6% IBM 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Johnson & Johnson 2.8% Microsoft 2.5% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Image source: Getty Images. Another good way to increase your income in retirement is to stay at your job for a few more years than you originally planned. That lets you keep adding to your retirement accounts -- and a fatter nest egg can generate more income. It can also keep you on your employer's health insurance plan a bit longer, possibly saving you some money for a few years, and it delays your starting to withdraw funds from your savings to live off of. If you don't want to keep working full time for a few more years, you might start your retirement by only partially withdrawing from the work force. A part-time job, for example, can keep some money flowing in during your early retirement years, boosting your income. It can also be a good way to transition into full retirement, which can be jarring for some people, with the lack of routines and the big drop-off in socializing. Even working 12 hours per week at $10 per hour can generate $120 per week -- $6,240 per year -- in extra retirement income. There are lots of other ways to boost your retirement income, some of which might not occur to many people. For example, you might rent out a room to a boarder, or just take in occasional guests as an Airbnb host. You might become an online tutor in any subjects you know well, or you might turn a hobby into a profit center, perhaps selling soaps, jewelry, sweaters, or furniture you make. You might move to a smaller, less expensive home, or perhaps even to a less expensive part of the country. If you and your spouse each have a vehicle, consider downsizing to just one, if you can swing it. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, remember that the income many of us are counting on in retirement -- Social Security -- is something you can control, to some degree. The average Social Security retirement benefit was recently $1,350 per month, or about $16,000 per year, with the maximum benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age recently at $2,639 per month -- or about $32,000 annually. You can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you can make some smart moves by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. (For example, you could start collecting the lower-earner's benefits first while letting the higher-earner's benefits grow larger.) Putting just a few of the strategies above into use can significantly boost your retirement income. ","

Sara Sjolin,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 28, 2016 6:24 a.m. ET Benefiting from Trump’s policies is a major theme for next year By Ready to play the new commodity cycle? Or maybe buy into Trump’s defense-spending plans? Or even bet on one of Europe’s most hated airlines? According to a group of top fund managers, those plays are likely to offer you some of the best returns for the next year. Speaking at the Sohn Conference in London earlier in December, 14 fund managers from the U.S. and Europe each unveiled their top investment calls for the next year to a group of around 450 investors. How to benefit from president-elect Donald Trump’s expected fiscal policies was a major topic at the conference, but continued optimism over the commodity sector also featured highly among fund-manager favorites. Here’s a list of some of the most interesting calls from the annual conference: Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC

Croxson points to two key factors behind his Ryanair call: 1) The company’s cost structure is significantly lower than other airlines, including rival easyJet PLC

Ryanair is already Europe’s largest airline with a market share pf around 15%, but with an expanded route network to more popular airports coupled with continued low prices, Croxson expects the airline to control 25% of the European market in coming years.

Since those events, Autoliv has won 55% of all new orders, which means the market share should start to accelerate in the second half of 2017 and well into 2019, the Bodenholm fund manager said. Karlsson was so sure about his call that he promised to donate 1,000 pounds ($1,268.70) to the Sohn foundation for every investor at the conference that buys Autoliv before Christmas but then loses money on the stock over the next 12 months.

Walden added that the merits of the deal still made sense and that there were certain aspects of the investigation that had yet to be completed. She did not provide a time-frame for the completion of the deal. “We think it will take weeks at least, we don’t have a desire to have it drag on forever, that’s not our intent,” Walden said.

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"(Reuters) - Wall Street rose sharply on Tuesday as a post-election rally extended into the new year, helped by gains in Verizon Communications and technology companies Alphabet and Facebook. U.S. stocks have surged over the past two months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will stimulate the economy with tax cuts and infrastructure spending and slash regulations in the financial industry. “The market is picking up where it left off since the Trump presidency,” said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital. “What you are seeing is the market moving up in anticipation of fiscal expansion.” However, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near the never-before-reached 20,000 mark, some investors warned that additional strong gains would be unlikely in the short term. They want to see evidence that Trump’s campaign-trail promises will be approved by Republican lawmakers concerned about widening the federal budget deficit. “The president-elect can’t just wave a magic wand,” said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. “He has to deal with Congress, and Congress hasn’t proved to be able to agree with itself.” Oil prices hit an 18-month high before turning negative and falling more than 2 percent.

Image source: Getty Images. Though it might seem simple and straightforward, investing in top telecom stocks is far more complex than it initially seems. As we learned in an earlier two-part blueprint for investing in telecom companies, providers of wireless and landline services operate in a multifaceted, highly regulated industry. If you really want to gain an in-depth sense of the industry, I suggest the above two articles as a great starting place. However, as a quick primer, we'll review three of the most important high-level takeaways that anyone considering buying telecom stocks absolutely must consider. When it comes to winning in the telecom space, history shows time and again that size matters. The telecom industry's massive fixed costs -- and the voluminous cash flows they can eventually produce -- allow the companies with the financial resources to invest in their wireless or wireline infrastructure to maintain their competitive positions. Moreover, closing the gap between market leaders and potential challengers requires massive capital expenditures on the insurgents' parts, which can strain companies' balance sheets along the way. Here's a quick example of how this dynamic plays out among U.S. wireless providers, where AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are the entrenched incumbents, and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) desperately want to steal market share from the former. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash Flow from Operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital Expenditures -$19.2 billion -$17.7 billion -$7.0 billion -$4.7 billion) Free Cash Flow $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending 3/31/16. To me, this is one of the most important charts in explaining the current competitive stance of the U.S. wireless market. Verizon (143 million) and AT&T (133 million) enjoy a roughly 2-to-1 wireless subscriber advantage over T-Mobile (69 million) and Sprint (59 million). As you can see, this larger scale translates into AT&T and Verizon needing to invest a far smaller percentage of their cash from operations into their networks than Sprint or T-Mobile. All of that extra free cash flow gives Verizon and AT&T the ability to invest in opportunities like Verizon's acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!, or AT&T's DIRECTV and Time Warner buyouts. When it comes to the telecom business, it pays to be one of the top dogs over the long term. With well-known names like AT&T and Verizon sporting dividend yields more than double the market average, the telecom industry can be a paradise for income investors. However, chasing yield in this sector can be the siren song of a money-losing investment. Here, a company like rural wireline provider Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) serves as a useful cautionary tale. WIN data by YCharts. In case you've never heard of it, Windstream provides landline telephone, broadband, digital TV, and security services to 1.4 million subscribers across the rural areas of 18 states. Spun out from the now-defunct Alltel in 2006, Windstream's strategy has been to roll up as many rural fiber assets and subscribers as possible to essentially become the biggest fish in an area of the telecom industry that's in structural decline. This ""growth via merger"" model works well on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but it ultimately lies on the losing side of history. The company continues to push forward, recently announcing an all-stock merger with the similar EarthLink. However, with demand for its services declining as our digital world evolves, Windstream's core business strategy appears unsustainable over the long term. What likely first pops out when looking at Windstream is its 8% dividend yield. However, as you saw in the above chart, Windstream's temptingly high dividend yield should more appropriately be viewed as a proxy for its risk. There's a long list to support this truism -- see Alaska Communications Systems or Frontier Communications -- but chasing yield in the telecom space is a quick way for investors to lose their shirts, which segues nicely into the final point on telecom investing. The final telecom investing tip might seem obvious, but given the industry's sneakily diverse mix of companies, investors must understand in detail the business model and strategy of a given company prior to buying. Are they in a growing segment of the industry? Wireless providers and the companies that supply their infrastructure are growing, while older technologies are fading. What does their competitive positioning in that market look like? As we saw with wireless providers, AT&T and Verizon remain far stronger than T-Mobile and Sprint. Despite the wireless space's overall favorable growth characteristics, the benefits of that growth are rarely distributed evenly. At the end of the day, this harkens back to Warren Buffett's concept of a circle of competence. Investors make unintended mistakes when they don't take the time to fully understand any potential investment. The seeming simplicity and sleepiness of the telecom industry can mask the underlying complexity of the sector, much to an investors' detriment. Taking the time to dig into a company's competitive position, its dividend details (if applicable), and its business model and outlook are critical steps that can save investors from making costly missteps or, better still, help identify stocks that can earn investors thousands.

Daniel B. Kline,01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) knows how to put on a show. In fact, CEO John Legere clearly has borrowed from Steve Jobs, P.T. Barnum, and Vince McMahon to varying degrees. The outspoken wireless boss has a charisma and an arrogance that would not work if his company did not deliver on his promises. But like Muhammad Ali taunting an opponent and then knocking him out, T-Mobile does deliver. The company has added over 1 million subscribers for each of the past 15 quarters (including adding 2.1 million in Q4) while also leading rivals AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Sprint (NYSE:S) for most net adds for 11 straight quarters. It's an impressive performance driven by Legere's personality and the company's ongoing Un-carrier initiatives. That makes every T-Mobile press conference an event, and anticipation was running high in advance of the company's Jan. 5 ""Un-carrier Next"" event at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The stage was bathed in magenta lights in advance of the Un-carrier Next event. Image source: author. Legere concluded his taped bit by promising a big announcement. ""When you hear what I announce next, there is no way you would not want to switch,"" he said, before taking the stage to shrieks and whoops from the T-Mobile employees in the audience. ""Four years ago, I just snapped,"" he said. ""The Un-carrier took the form of a tirade. If you landed from Mars on this planet and saw how people sell wireless, you would turn around and go back."" At the time, T-Mobile was bleeding customers and losing money, the No. 4 player in the industry. ""We did not talk about a turnaround; we talked about changing wireless for good,"" Legere said. Legere took the audience on a walk through all the changes T-Mobile has pushed on the industry. He noted that most customers no longer have contracts, switching fees have been largely eliminated, and overage charges have decreased across the industry. Of course, the CEO also pointed out how AT&T and Verizon specifically fought many (if not all) of those changes before eventually giving in. For the company's latest move, dubbed Un-carrier Next, Legere told the crowd that T-Mobile has another big set of changes ahead based around the mobile internet, where he noted that 80% of all internet use happens. Calling wireless plans ""a mobile internet connection,"" Legere said that beginning on Jan. 22, T-Mobile will only sell unlimited plans. It will allow existing users to stay on their plans but is getting rid of the Simple Choice plans for new customers. He also said that ""what you see is what you should pay,"" pledging that the telecom's pricing would only advertise prices that are ""all in,"" with all taxes and fees included. ""We're doing it without raising prices,"" Legere said. ""Taxes and fees aren't going away. We're investing in our customers."" Legere showed a video featuring comedian Jason Jones going over subscribers' Verizon bills where each family paid much more than the advertised price. T-Mobile's new plans' selling point is that what you see is what you get. A family of four will pay $40 each for unlimited data, calls, and text with no extra fees for a total of $160. The company has also pledged that it won't raise prices, reduce service, or change its customers' plans without consent. In addition, if a consumer uses less than 2 GB of data in a month, they will get a $10 bill credit each month per line for up to 12 lines. This is another effort by T-Mobile to change how the industry works. The company now has an all-in-one unlimited plan with simple pricing that also takes into account users who will not be using a lot of data. It's another major shot at the rest of the industry, and it could win T-Mobile even more customers. It's also likely that dropping separate fees and offering transparent pricing could force AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint to follow suit. ","
      
    T-Mobile Dropping Fees and Surcharges, Not Raising Prices -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Cord-cutting grew worse in 2016 as an estimated more than 750,000 customers left pay-TV for other options over the last four quarters. Few operators bucked the trend this year, but there were still a handful of standout performers in the industry. Here are three of the best cable stocks from 2016. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the few pay-TV operators that have actually added customers over the past year. For the 12 months ending on Sept. 30, Comcast added 170,000 video subscribers. It's largely benefiting from a reduced focus from Verizon and AT&T on their telecom services, which had been encroaching on Comcast's territory. Comcast's cable communications segment grew revenue 6.5% through the first nine months of 2016. Comcast has been able to raise prices for cable and internet subscribers mainly as a result of its X1 platform. The X1 set-top box offers an improved user interface for cable, integrating internet services such as on-demand streaming or live sports stats into the viewing experience. The company reports that 45% of video subscribers have the X1 box. Comcast's stock price climbed about 24% in 2016. That's well ahead of the 10% returned by the S&P 500. As one of the few pay-TV operators still adding new customers and with the advantage of owning one of the largest media companies, Comcast looks poised to continue to outperform. Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) has lost about 57,000 video subscribers on a pro forma basis over the last four quarters. But it's transformed itself significantly in 2016 with the acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. Unlike Comcast, Charter is exclusively focused on its cable business. The addition of millions of new customers gives it a much-stronger position in the industry to continue raising prices. Indeed, Charter has been able to do just that. Its average revenue per residential subscriber increased 2% year over year in the third quarter, to $109.69 per month. The addition of Time Warner Cable negatively impacted its revenue per subscriber, but Charter is quickly rebranding the business to Spectrum and bringing non-digital customers to digital in an effort to keep its prices high. Charter's stock skyrocketed in 2016 following the approval of its Time Warner Cable and Bright House acquisitions and management's strong execution. The stock price went up about 59% in 2016. With 24.5 million customer relations -- nearly one-quarter of the entire market -- Charter is well positioned to continue growing revenue through regular price increases and continued internet customer additions. It may not be able to continue growing its video subscribers, however, given the headwinds it's facing. Cable One (NYSE:CABO) is a bit different from Comcast and Charter. Not only is it a tiny cable provider with about 316,000 video subscribers, but it's losing those subscribers at a fairly rapid clip. Over the last 12 months, Cable One lost nearly 51,000 video subscribers -- almost 14% of its customer base. It's making up for the losses with data customers and business services. Cable One's data revenue increased 18.8% year over year last quarter thanks to a 1.9% increase in connections and a 16.6% rate increase. Business services revenue grew 13.2% year over year last quarter as the company continues to expand its presence in small and medium-sized businesses. As a result, Cable One's overall revenue increased 3.7% for the quarter. Cable One's management has been able to effectively control costs while raising its rates, producing outsize increases in net income. Specifically, a decline in Cable One's headcount resulted in savings of about $2.4 million. Total operating expenses climbed just 1.9% last quarter, resulting in a large growth in net income. The stock price of Cable One climbed about 41% in 2016. Management's focus on raising rates and controlling costs has worked well so far, but the rapid decrease in video subscribers is a major concern heading into 2017. Investors interested in buying stock in a cable operator in 2017 may do better with one of the larger players such as Comcast or Charter. ","
      
    Best Cable Stocks of 2016 -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on the verge of hitting 20,000 points for the first time -- a major milestone. While most people have a general idea of what this means (the stock market is going up), the Dow's significance isn't well understood by many investors. With that in mind, here's how the Dow works, what the 20,000-point milestone represents, and what it means for your investment strategy. Image source: Getty Images. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, more commonly known as ""the Dow,"" is based on the performance of just 30 companies, which often surprises newer investors since it's considered a benchmark index for the entire U.S. stock market. Furthermore, the list of companies that make up the Dow changes from time to time. In fact, of the 12 original Dow components, only one (General Electric) is still in the index today. As of this writing on Jan. 3, 2017, here are the current components of the Dow. Another interesting characteristic of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is that it's a ""price-weighted"" index. Simply put, this means that higher-priced stocks have more of an influence over the index's performance than lower-priced ones. While the mathematics of how the Dow works can be a little confusing, let's consider one example. This is one of the biggest criticisms of the Dow. In contrast, the market-cap weighted S&P 500 places more weight on the largest companies, which many investors say is a far better way to gauge the overall performance of the stock market. It's important for investors to realize that while seeing the Dow hit 20,000 for the first time will be a psychological milestone, it's really just an arbitrary number based on a strange method of combining the performance of 30 stocks. As my colleague Sean Williams pointed out a few weeks ago, there's no more reason to celebrate Dow 20,000 than any other number that was recently reached for the first time. The bottom line is that while you're likely to see headlines celebrating Dow 20,000, it shouldn't have any effect on your investment strategy. Don't sell your stocks just because you think Dow 20,000 indicates that the market ""has gotten expensive."" If your original investment thesis still applies, there's no reason to exit any of your stock positions. Similarly, there could still be plenty of bargains to be had in the markets that are trading at low valuations, including some of the stocks in the ""Dow 30."" The index's value has no correlation with the valuations of any individual stocks. The best advice I can give for Dow 20,000 is to keep your eye on the long term. Focus on building a portfolio of attractively valued stocks and holding onto them for years. This advice will also hold true at Dow 25,000, Dow 30,000, and any other index-related milestones that may be reached during your lifetime. ","

                                   fell more than 2% after jumping as much as 2.6% as a deal by OPEC to limit output went into effect. The choppy action was the latest reminder of how the market has struggled in recent sessions with the Dow unable to break above 20,000, a key psychological milestone that some analysts see as a resistance level for the market. “Once you get closer to 20,000, historically it’s been hard to get through on the first pass,” said Kepner. Still, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion’s share of the market’s postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth. That thesis is still viewed as intact, although the size and speed of the recent rally could lead investors to take profits. “There are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump’s policies don’t come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising,” said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was “fairly optimistic” about U.S. stocks.

Michael Ashbaugh,01052017,MarketWatch,12292016,"Published: Jan 3, 2017 1:51 p.m. ET Focus: U.S. dollar trends higher, Crude oil’s breakout attempt, UUP, USO, RDC, MU, ASML, EXR By Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks have pulled in from record highs, thus far modestly, digesting the massive late-2016 breakout. Still, while a near-term consolidation phase has been long overdue, and remains underway, the U.S. benchmarks’ more important longer-term backdrop continues to support a firmly-bullish bias. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P staged a modest late-year pullback, closing 2016 at 2,238.8. From current levels, initial resistance holds around 2,252, and is followed by an inflection point at 2,263, matching Tuesday’s early high. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ backdrop remains slightly stronger. In its case, the blue-chip benchmark has effectively maintained its three-week range, underpinned by support around 19,750. The Dow closed last year at 19,762.6. Separately, consider that the 2016 peak missed the 20,000 mark by just 13 points. Similarly, the Nasdaq Composite has pulled in respectably from record territory, closing 2016 at 5,383.1. A posture above this level signals a year-to-date gain, and vice versa. Technically, the November peak matches a near-term inflection point, better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has pulled in from a record high slightly above the 5,500 mark. To reiterate, the 5,400 area defines an immediate inflection point, and is followed by firmer support at 5,340, closely matching the September and October peaks. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has pulled in less aggressively. Recall that near-term support holds around 19,750, closely matching the 20-day moving average, currently 19,770. The Dow has not closed under the 20-day since Nov. 4. On further weakness, near-term support remains poorly-defined. Potential floors rest at 19,665 and 19,550, though the Dow’s first true support holds around 19,275. Conversely, the headline 20,000 mark closely matches the 2016 peak, and remains a technical hurdle. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 concluded 2016 with its first close under the 20-day moving average since Nov. 4. Based on today’s backdrop, the 20-day moving average, currently 2,249, matches a near-term inflection point, illustrated on the hourly chart. On further weakness, the 2,214 breakout point marks notable support. Broadly speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have asserted a holding pattern, digesting the steep late-2016 rally. Against this backdrop, selling pressure remains flat, so far, and recent weakness has inflicted limited damage. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

More broadly, the directionally steep November breakout, and comparably flat December range, signal that bullish momentum is intact. The small-cap benchmark’s intermediate-term path of least resistance points higher. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has established a bull flag, digesting the late-2016 spike. In its case, first support spans from about 301.00 to 301.70, closely matching the late-December lows.

As always, the 20-day is a widely-tracked near-term trending indicator. Firmer support spans from about 221.55 to 221.80. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has concurrently notched its first close under the 20-day moving average since Nov. 4. To reiterate, the S&P’s 20-day, currently 2,249, closely matches a near-term inflection point, and remains firmly in play early Tuesday. This area defines the immediate bull-bear technical tension. Still, deeper, and more significant support, rests at the 2,214 breakout point, and the 2,190 mark, closing matching the December closing low. Within this band, the S&P’s 50-day moving average currently holds at 2,197. Recall that the 50-day effectively capped the pre U.S. election price action. Against the current backdrop, it remains a useful bull-bear gauge. Collectively, to the extent the 2,190-to-2,214 area holds — and it would be expected to hold on the first or second retest — the S&P 500’s intermediate- to longer-term backdrop supports a bullish bias.

Walden added that the merits of the deal still made sense and that there were certain aspects of the investigation that had yet to be completed.

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

Donna Fuscaldo,01122017,Investopedia,01052017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is doing away with its two-year service contracts for both new and existing customers and will require them to sign up for Verizon’s equipment installment plans (EIPs) according to a report in FierceWireless. According to FierceWireless, the telecom news website, Verizon confirmed the moves while also confirming it is increasing its activation and upgrade fees to $30 from $20. The move to get rid of two-year contracts comes at a time when most wireless carriers are scraping those plans in favor of EIPs, in which the price of the smartphone is separate than the price for wireless service. With an EIP, customers don’t get hit with interest on the phone and pay off their smartphones per month for one, two or three years. The contracts are attractive because once the phone is paid off, the monthly bill gets reduced and customers aren’t locked in with one carrier. They can take their phone to a competitor without having to break an expensive contract. FierceWireless noted that the increase in the upgrade and activation fee is likely designed to increase profits for its first quarter. The move to get rid of the two-year service contracts and, more importantly, raise the fee associated with activation and upgrade by $10 comes at a time when rival T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS), the third-place wireless carrier, is getting rid of all wireless service fees and taxes. In a move that will likely force the other carriers to respond, T-Mobile said late last week it was “completely wiping away” monthly wireless service fees including all taxes on its new T-Mobile One plan. Starting later this month, new and existing customers will pay $70 a month for the unlimited plan with additional line options available. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, a family of four will see a $20 a month savings from the change since T-Mobile isn’t raising rates to compensate for the fee and tax eliminations. (See also: T-Mobile Eliminates Fees, Taxes on Unlimited Plan.) The third-place carrier also launched KickBack, a program in which T-Mobile will pay customers back for data they don’t use. Customers who use 2 gigabytes or less a month get an up to $10 credit on the next month’s bill. “Wireless consumers pay Billions extra every year in added surcharges, taxes, monthly fees and carrier price hikes. It’s reached epidemic proportions. And, the carriers just keep inventing new ways to make their customers pay,” wrote John Legere, T-Mobile president and CEO, in a statement. “Today … we’re creating the first unlimited subscription to the Mobile Internet that works for absolutely everyone.”  ",Verizon Scraps the Two-Year Service Contract | Investopedia

Michael Santoli,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Patience is a virtue that the stock market seldom displays. The market travels in sudden bursts, not a steady pace. It gets antsy if made to sit still for a while. In football terms, investors are like an undisciplined linebacker ""overpursuing"" whatever trend they see developing - often falling flat when the trend stutter-steps. This is all relevant now because the indexes' run to record highs in recent months has been accompanied by a hopeful story line about what's to come – a rush of business-boosting policies under a President Trump and (almost as an afterthought) a sharp snapback in corporate profits as 2017 unfolds. Now that stocks appear a bit rich and the tape's momentum has slowed, it's worth asking if investors have the patience to hang on for months until it's known whether all this comes together as the bulls wish. If the market's fate comes down to getting taxes cut and regulations lifted and infrastructure spending deployed, things probably won't happen quickly enough for investors. All we have now are the unformulated proposals of a still-unformed administration, whose elected leader has not delivered a steady message about legislative priorities, to put it gently. Kim Wallace, head of Washington research at Renaissance Macro Advisors, told clients last week that he is ""skeptical on timing"" of any tax package out of Congress. ""Expect Trump to focus on tax and healthcare policy to start, but the process will be slow. We doubt anything significant is out of committee in the first half."" Six months with nothing significant reaching the House floor would probably outlast the patience of policy-focused investors. The good news, though? What we call the Trump Rally has not fully been that at all - and is probably less tied to Washington than the typical 2017 outlook commentary contends. Not only were interest rates and inflation indicators perking up starting last summer, but the election came amid the strongest run of upside economic surprises and the best levels for global manufacturing gauges in four years, notes Cornerstone Macro strategist Francois Trahan (who is among the only vocal market bears on the sell-side right now, worried that the macro improvement is priced in). There's no doubt that the election and its prospects of a fiscal jolt catalyzed and crystallized the mass recognition of a tightly wound economy gaining momentum, and better chances for the Federal Reserve to ""normalize"" interest rates. And it so happened that the obvious plays on higher growth, lower taxes, easier regulations and infrastructure investment were among the cheapest, most under-owned stocks. That sent them flying in the weeks after the election. Especially in the last month, the standard ""Trump trade"" stocks have not been lifting the indexes at all, though. Over that span, industrial and bank shares have lagged the S&P 500, while Big Tech (believed to be disadvantaged by Trumponomics) has outperformed. A basket of 16 stocks Goldman Sachs identified as the greatest beneficiaries of lower effective tax rates 
 is down 1.9 percent on average in the past month, versus a 1.2 percent gain in the S&P 500. If the S&P's latest trudge to new highs hasn't been all about policy, then the more salient question is whether the trajectory of corporate earnings and the economy alone, unenhanced by any possible goodies from Washington, could tide the market over.

"Brian Feroldi, Matthew DiLallo, Daniel Miller, and Dan Caplinger",01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Income-focused investors are constantly on the hunt for stocks that offer high yields, low valuations, and durable business models that can be counted on in good times and bad. While very few stocks are capable of satisfying all of those requirements, there are a handful of businesses out there that match those criteria perfectly. Want proof? Read on to see why our team of Fools believes that National Health Investors (NYSE:NHI), Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and General Motors (NYSE:GM) fit the bill. Image source: Getty Images. Dan Caplinger (National Health Investors): Real estate investment trusts can be a good area to find high-yielding dividend stocks with relatively low-maintenance business models, but you have to know the particular space in which a REIT operates to see if its fundamentals are solid. National Health Investors specializes in providing financing for senior housing and medical facilities, including independent and assisted living facilities, memory care communities, skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings, and specialty hospitals. Through sale-and-leaseback transactions, joint ventures, and standard debt and equity financing, National Health Investors has a portfolio of more than 200 properties across the nation and has strong relationships with operating companies to make the most of its facilities. For investors, a yield of nearly 5% is obviously attractive, but equally important is National Health Investors' growth over time. For 14 straight years, NHI has boosted its regular dividend distributions, and it has also regularly supplemented those payouts with additional amounts as well. The demographics of the U.S. population will require more senior housing in the future, and NHI is well-positioned to provide it. With so much going for its business, National Health Investors is a good way to get regular income without having to keep tabs on the company on a daily basis just to make sure things are going well with your investment. Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Renewable Partners): With a current yield of 6.2%, Brookfield Renewable Partners certainly checks off the high-yield box. Further, while may high-yield stocks appear cheap because of question marks about the sustainability of the payout, this is not the case with the hydro and wind power operator. That's because Brookfield Renewable Partners derives 90% of its cash flow from secure long-term contracts, pays out only 70% of its income through distributions, and has an investment-grade balance sheet. It's due to this firm financial footing that investors won't need to keep a close eye on this investment. However, despite its lucrative yield and healthy financial condition, Brookfield Renewable's units are cheap compared with the underlying value of its asset base: Source: Brookfield Renewable Partners inventor presentation. As that slide shows, the assets Brookfield owns typically trade for a higher value in the market than investors currently value the company's units. In other words, if the company were to replicate its business on the open market, it would need to pay between $34 and $42 per unit to do so, implying that its current sub-$30 per unit price vastly undervalues the franchise. Add it all up, and Brookfield Renewable Partners offers investors the potential for strong capital appreciation and a growing income stream without the potential headaches often associated with high-yield or value plays. Brian Feroldi (Verizon Communications): Investors who seek safety, yield, and income should really consider giving Verizon a hard look. With more than 143 million wireless subscribers on its network, Verizon enjoys the enviable position of being the top dog in the U.S. cellular market. That massive subscriber base allows Verizon to crank out far more cash flow than its smaller rivals even as it vastly outspends them on network upgrades. That means shareholders can rest easy knowing that the company will maintain its lead and be able to return huge amounts of cash to them each year. Better yet, despite its mammoth size, the company stands a good chance at putting up modest growth over the long term. My bullishness stems from Verizon's recent actions to get a foothold in the growing Internet-of-Things trend. With billions of devices set to come online over the coming years, Verizon is investing now to carve out its share of the market. Image Source: Getty Images. Down the road, the rollout of 5G connectivity could also help get the company's top line growing. After all, 5G connectivity promises to be so fast that it could cause some consumers to ditch their cable provider altogether and simply use ultra-fast wireless connections for home broadband. While we wait for those growth trends to play out, investors can sit back and enjoy the company's steady cash flow production and ever-rising rising dividend. With shares trading for only 15 times trailing earnings and offering up a juicy yield of 4.4%, Verizon is an income stock that has it all. Daniel Miller (General Motors): Despite the many stipulations this article sets forth, General Motors is probably one of the few that entirely fits the bill. Let's tackle the stipulations one at a time. First up: cheap. It's no secret that General Motors has been posting record EBIT-adjusted profits recently. In fact, since the fourth quarter of 2015 to present, it's set a record for that individual quarter and topped it by an all-time quarterly record during the second quarter of 2016. However, rather than valuing GM with a higher price relevant to those increasing profits, the market has left the stock price stuck in neutral, which has sent its price-to-earnings multiple into the low single digits. GM PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts Next up: high yield. This one goes hand-in-hand with ""cheap,"" and thanks to GM's willingness to continue increasing its dividend over the past two years, at a time its stock price hasn't budged much, its yield has blossomed to roughly 4.3% -- which is lower than it's been recently thanks to a small post-election rally. GM Dividends Paid (TTM) data by YCharts Last up: babysitter not required. This might be the toughest stipulation, at least for many investors, when it comes to General Motors. However, the company has done an incredible job of making better and more efficient decisions. Its fleet sales accounted for under 20% of total sales this year, a very low level historically. It also has plans to substantially reduce its number of global platforms, and it has a goal to keep a cash pile of $20 billion on hand for rainy days. As we march through 2017, GM will need to again prove it can continue to balance inventory and keep a lid on incentive spending, all while investing intelligently for the future of autonomous vehicles and smart mobility projects. But for now we have to give management the benefit of the doubt that no babysitter is required after an impressive post-bankruptcy turnaround. ","

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) knows how to put on a show. In fact, CEO John Legere clearly has borrowed from Steve Jobs, P.T. Barnum, and Vince McMahon to varying degrees. The outspoken wireless boss has a charisma and an arrogance that would not work if his company did not deliver on his promises. But like Muhammad Ali taunting an opponent and then knocking him out, T-Mobile does deliver. The company has added over 1 million subscribers for each of the past 15 quarters (including adding 2.1 million in Q4) while also leading rivals AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Sprint (NYSE:S) for most net adds for 11 straight quarters. It's an impressive performance driven by Legere's personality and the company's ongoing Un-carrier initiatives. That makes every T-Mobile press conference an event, and anticipation was running high in advance of the company's Jan. 5 ""Un-carrier Next"" event at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The stage was bathed in magenta lights in advance of the Un-carrier Next event. Image source: author. Legere concluded his taped bit by promising a big announcement. ""When you hear what I announce next, there is no way you would not want to switch,"" he said, before taking the stage to shrieks and whoops from the T-Mobile employees in the audience. ""Four years ago, I just snapped,"" he said. ""The Un-carrier took the form of a tirade. If you landed from Mars on this planet and saw how people sell wireless, you would turn around and go back."" At the time, T-Mobile was bleeding customers and losing money, the No. 4 player in the industry. ""We did not talk about a turnaround; we talked about changing wireless for good,"" Legere said. Legere took the audience on a walk through all the changes T-Mobile has pushed on the industry. He noted that most customers no longer have contracts, switching fees have been largely eliminated, and overage charges have decreased across the industry. Of course, the CEO also pointed out how AT&T and Verizon specifically fought many (if not all) of those changes before eventually giving in. For the company's latest move, dubbed Un-carrier Next, Legere told the crowd that T-Mobile has another big set of changes ahead based around the mobile internet, where he noted that 80% of all internet use happens. Calling wireless plans ""a mobile internet connection,"" Legere said that beginning on Jan. 22, T-Mobile will only sell unlimited plans. It will allow existing users to stay on their plans but is getting rid of the Simple Choice plans for new customers. He also said that ""what you see is what you should pay,"" pledging that the telecom's pricing would only advertise prices that are ""all in,"" with all taxes and fees included. ""We're doing it without raising prices,"" Legere said. ""Taxes and fees aren't going away. We're investing in our customers."" Legere showed a video featuring comedian Jason Jones going over subscribers' Verizon bills where each family paid much more than the advertised price. T-Mobile's new plans' selling point is that what you see is what you get. A family of four will pay $40 each for unlimited data, calls, and text with no extra fees for a total of $160. The company has also pledged that it won't raise prices, reduce service, or change its customers' plans without consent. In addition, if a consumer uses less than 2 GB of data in a month, they will get a $10 bill credit each month per line for up to 12 lines. This is another effort by T-Mobile to change how the industry works. The company now has an all-in-one unlimited plan with simple pricing that also takes into account users who will not be using a lot of data. It's another major shot at the rest of the industry, and it could win T-Mobile even more customers. It's also likely that dropping separate fees and offering transparent pricing could force AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint to follow suit. ","

"Evan Niu, CFA",01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: John Legere's social media account. CES 2017 is now winding down, but last week T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere held a press conference at the annual tech extravaganza. In it, Legere made eight bold predictions of what the telecommunications industry might have in store for 2017, and also subsequently penned a blog post on T-Mobile's site. Let's go through Legere's calls and see what they could mean for investors. Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which buy wholesale capacity from the major network operators and resell service under a different brand, have always occupied a tenuous place within the mobile value chain. Facing sluggish landline growth, many cable companies have looked toward establishing MVNOs for some exposure to wireless growth. For instance, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced plans late last year that it would launch an MVNO on Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) network in 2017, supplemented by Wi-Fi hotspots. Legere doesn't think these MVNO ambitions will play out well for anyone, and the Un-carrier will not ink any MVNO agreements with cable operators. There are a few candidates for tech giants that may look to jump into the wireless sector, but Legere thinks Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is the most obvious pick. Of course, the search giant launched Project Fi in 2015, which is a sort of hybrid MVNO that uses several networks (including T-Mobile's) in conjunction with Wi-Fi hotspots. Google is experimenting with and pioneering several interesting ideas, such as prorated data fees. Thus far, Project Fi has been limited to a small number of devices, mostly Nexus and Pixel phones, but Google has the groundwork in place if it wants to make a bigger impact. Over-the-top (OTT) streaming services are proliferating in lockstep with cord-cutting, and Legere sees the shift to mobile accelerating. The chief executive notes that a third of TV watching occurs on devices other than TVs. By the end of 2017, he believes that the majority of TV viewing will be delivered via mobile. Roughly 61% of mobile traffic is video, and this should jump to 77% by 2020, according to CTIA. T-Mobile delivers quite a bit of (downscaled) video for free via its Binge On program, so it only benefits financially from this increased usage if consumers pay extra for high-resolution streams or opt out of Binge On. DISH Network has been sitting on unused spectrum for years, fueling speculation that it would jump into the wireless world. Legere is calling for ""the end of DISH as we know it"" this year, saying it will cease to be a stand-alone entity. DISH's TV business has been on the decline, also a victim of cord-cutting, for quite some time. The company lost 116,000 net TV subscribers last quarter, and currently has about 13.6 million subscribers left. T-Mobile recently noted that it is already approaching gigabit LTE speeds, thanks to its ongoing investments in spectrum and LTE infrastructure. Other carriers are hoping for gigabit speeds on 5G, but Legere says T-Mobile will be there first using existing technologies. Of course, hitting peak theoretical speeds is quite different than what average consumers experience, and most users won't see gigabit speeds in real-world performance anytime soon. T-Mobile reached 979 Mbps in its labs, using a combination of technologies and an unreleased handset. Legere hosts a live-streamed video segment on social media every Sunday under #SlowCookerSunday. Currently, about 500,000 viewers tune in to watch him cook each week, and he predicts he'll have 1 million weekly viewers by the end of 2017. Legere uses his segment as an example of the rise of OTT content, which continues to threaten cable channels. This is a pretty bold one, but Legere predicts that three of the four CEOs of the current major wireless operators will be out by year's end. That's an ambitious forecast not only because that's a lot of CEOs losing their jobs, but also because of the ongoing consolidation speculation that T-Mobile isn't exactly downplaying. If T-Mobile ends up merging with Sprint, Legere would immediately score at least one point on this one. Pointing to the deterioration in both Verizon's and Comcast's core businesses, Legere says that the two telecom giants will be ""forced"" to entertain the idea of a blockbuster megamerger that would combine ""two of the most hated brands in America."" Note that Legere doesn't believe a deal will be officially announced or closed, but rather the pair would have ""discussions."" Seeing as how discussions of this nature often leak and spur speculation, Legere is essentially speculating on speculation. In fairness, the idea isn't out of the question altogether, given AT&T's recent moves. ","

Image source: Getty Images. If you're in your 70s, you'll likely appreciate a solid investment that can supply you with a steadily rising stream of income. One that can help support you in retirement, provide the cash to pay for the activities you enjoy, and that you can count on year after year. Fortunately, there are some stocks that fit the bill. Read on to learn about one of the best available in the market today. Image source: Verizon Communications. Given the low-risk nature of its business and its stock's current 4.2% dividend yield, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) offers investors two important benefits: capital preservation and income generation. The telecom giant's subscription-based, utility-like business generates strong and stable cash flow that helps to insulate its stock from wild price swings. This lower volatility makes it less likely an investor will suffer a large loss should an unexpected need to sell shares arise in the near-term. Moreover, Verizon's cash flows remain well insulated from the competition. Verizon's network consistently ranks as the best in the industry, even as rivals such as T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) claim that they're chipping away at its lead. That's helped Verizon continue to add postpaid wireless subscribers -- who are generally the most profitable and sought-after customers -- despite heavy promotions from T-Mobile, Sprint, and other competitors. Looking ahead, Verizon offers investors a safe-yet-attractive play on increasing internet connectivity and rising data usage. The company is well positioned to lead the transition to 5G networks, which could provide it with exciting new opportunities in the home broadband market. Additionally, Verizon has been steadily acquiring assets to strengthen its Internet of Things technology. The company is making clear progress in the segment, with revenue growth from IoT services rising 24%, to $217 million, in the third quarter. And although the business is currently small (by Verizon's standards), the massive potential of the Internet of Things could help this segment develop into a significant source of Verizon's revenue and profits in the years ahead. Together, these growth opportunities ought to help Verizon improve its already impressive cash flow generation, which should, in turn,  allow the telecom titan to continue to do what it's done consistently over the past decade: reward its shareholders with steadily rising stream of dividend income.

T-Mobile CEO John Legere at CES. Image Source: T-Mobile. John Legere provided a sneak peak at T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) quarterly numbers during his Consumer Electronics Show (CES) presentation. He spouted off numbers like 2.1 million total net adds, 1.2 million postpaid net adds, and 933,000 postpaid phone net adds. But the most interesting thing he said, in my opinion, is that he expects to overtake AT&T (NYSE:T) in total phone customers in around four or five years. If he had said something similar when he took over as CEO of T-Mobile four years ago, nobody would have believed him. Even today, it's still hard to believe. But he points out that T-Mobile is adding 5 million to 6 million phone customers every year while AT&T is standing still. At that rate, it won't be more than five years before T-Mobile surpasses AT&T's phone base. From the first quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2016, AT&T managed to add 184,000 net phone subscribers across its postpaid and prepaid brands. In the same period, T-Mobile has added over 10 million new phone customers. T-Mobile is rapidly closing the gap between itself and AT&T, which currently stands at less than 29 million. That's before counting the nearly 1.5 million phone customers T-Mobile added last quarter and whatever results AT&T posts. Last year, AT&T added just 213,000 phone customers in the fourth quarter. AT&T has returned to phone subscriber growth in each of the last six quarters, however, largely on the back of its prepaid brand Cricket Wireless. Management says that it's fine trading low-end postpaid customers for prepaid customers, but the claim seems dubious. T-Mobile, meanwhile, is also experiencing stronger net adds this year. T-Mobile added 1.4 million phone customers last year compared to 1.5 million this year. Additionally, in each of the first three quarters of the year, T-Mobile added more phone customers than in the year-ago period. It's impossible to predict what will happen four or five years into the future, but right now, T-Mobile is poised to continue grabbing market share from all three of its major competitors. AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are splitting their focuses between their telecom businesses and their newer media businesses. AT&T, in particular, is investing heavily in building out its position in pay-TV with the acquisitions of DirecTV and its plan to acquire Time Warner. Meanwhile, Sprint (NYSE:S) may find it difficult to hold onto its subscribers as its ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion expires. The first customers to sign up using that promotion are just now seeing price increases. Conversely, T-Mobile just announced a pledge to never increase prices for any of its customers. Legere said T-Mobile noticed an increase in Sprint customers switching to its services last quarter. With T-Mobile's focus on providing the best value in wireless, it should continue to attract the vast majority of wireless customers to its service. Only time will tell if it surpasses AT&T's phone customer base, but it's not as crazy of a thought as it once was. ","

A new report (link open PDF) released by the National Economic Council (NEC), a board created in 1993 to advise the president on domestic and global economic policy, shows that declining competition in some markets has led to rising pricing in the form of hidden fees for American consumers. The NEC noted that competition not only keeps prices down, it also forces companies to innovate and can push wages higher. In its December report, though, the agency found several indicators of declining competition in the United States. These include ""increasing levels of industry concentration, increasing returns to capital accruing to a few firms, lower levels of firm entry, and decreased labor market mobility."" It's a situation where more money has become concentrated in the biggest companies. That creates a market where consumers often pay the price. In many situations, according to NEC, this involves ""hidden"" or ""muddy"" prices, situations where the advertised cost does not equal what a person actually pays. Image source: Getty Images. A hidden fee is not an add-on for an extra service, but a mandatory charge that people must pay in order to use whatever they are buying. For example, both AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) charge ""line access fees"" on top of their advertised prices. Since consumers can't use their phones or data plans without paying this fee, it's not really an extra charge, but part of the basic price. ""In many industries, businesses use so-called 'hidden fees' -- the addition of a mandatory or quasi-mandatory fee to the advertised price of a good or service ... to effectively raise the final price,"" NEC wrote. ""At their worst, such fees can be fraudulent or deceptive; at a minimum, they make prices unclear, hinder effective consumer decision making, and dull the competitive process."" The NEC report listed a number of hidden fees that consumers routinely pay. In some cases, like the AT&T and Verizon example above, these fees have become so ingrained in various industries that people no longer even question them. The worst offenders, according to the report, include: Not appearing in the report is the cable and broadband industries, where most major players add ""broadcast fees,"" and ""sports fees"" to their advertised prices and on the internet side charge rental fees for needed equipment. In all these cases, what's consistent is that consumers have no choice but to pay a cost that's more than what they expected based on advertised prices. In addition to potential regulatory solutions, and new competition forcing companies to abandon deceptive pricing, the NEC said that customers can force an end to these practices. ""Consumers and consumer groups play a crucial role in moderating fees,"" according to the report. ""For example, in event ticketing, even absent regulation, consumer outrage at fees has been acknowledged by some vendors who, in turn, have made some effort to clarify why they charge the fees they do."" Of course, the easiest way to end these practices would be to outlaw them. One method of doing that would be to legally require ""all-in"" pricing. There are various versions of this legislation, but in a broad sense the laws would require companies to advertise pricing that reflects exactly what a person will pay. It's easy to see why consumers would want this and some companies would not. Forcing businesses to disclose the final ""all-in"" price may not lower prices, but it would at least allow for a level playing field and a more informed buying public. ","

Kristine Harjes,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. From celebrity deaths to shocking political news, people found plenty to complain about in 2016. Me, though? I actually had a really good year. I met some incredible people, had unbelievable adventures, and learned a ton. In the financial realm, I saved responsibly (even given the crazy-high D.C. cost of living) and added quality companies to my stock portfolio. Indeed, I'd say I pretty fully met my 2016 resolution to diversify. My next challenge -- and my resolution for 2017 -- is to take a smarter approach to finding stocks to buy by creating a watchlist. Going into 2016, my portfolio was overweight in healthcare and largely packed with higher-risk growth stocks. I resolved to achieve more balance by finding stocks outside of healthcare and established, dividend-paying stocks. Overall, I think I did pretty well. Over the course of the year, in addition to adding to prior holdings, I opened positions in the following stocks: I'd give myself a B rating for following my 2016 resolution. I did diversify pretty nicely, but I'm still missing exposure to financials -- particularly since I talked a big game this time last year about getting exposure to this industry. While I did purchase Wells Fargo, I never found a replacement financials stock after I sold off my position. As I write this, healthcare is still the sector with the most representation in my holdings -- but it was narrowly trailed by consumer goods until two late-year healthcare pops reinflated that section of my portfolio. In any case, with the exception of the gaping hole of financials, the various sectors are much more evenly represented than they were going into the year. And in hindsight, this resolution was pretty wise, as my non-healthcare buys buffered the stinging biotech losses I suffered in 2016. (The broader industry, as measured by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), sank 19%.) In the past, my buying went something like this: I'd like to improve upon this process by forcing myself to be patient. I want to do my research ahead of time and come up with a list of companies that I like, along with the prices at which I'd buy in. Now, let me be very clear that I'm in no way using this list to try and time the market. I simply think I should have my research already done on a sizable list of intriguing companies before a buying opportunity presents itself. In particular, I'm looking to fill this list out with blue-chip Fool favorites like Coca-Cola, Procter and Gamble, General Motors, Chevron, Verizon Communications, and Microsoft. I know relatively little about the inner workings of these businesses, but I owe it to myself to do some research and figure out what I think is an attractive price for each of them. While I'm at it, I'm going to summarize my buy thesis for each, as well as some areas to watch. This organized, systematic approach takes some of the emotion out of investing, which is a huge advantage. When a stock hits my target price, and assuming nothing has changed about the business, I'll know I want to pick up shares for great reasons, rather than being temporarily excited about a company I just researched. Who knows what 2017 will bring, but I feel confident that building a watchlist will be the best financial move I can make. ","
      
    A Smart Approach to Portfolio Diversification: My 2017 Financial Resolution -- The Motley Fool

Dan Caplinger,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks offer current income and growth potential, and the dividend stocks that you'll find among the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) are some of the best-known, highest-quality dividend payers you'll find. Rather than simply buying the entire Dow, however, many dividend investors choose instead to follow a strategy called the Dogs of the Dow. These stocks offer better yields than the Dow as a whole, and often, they've been able to outperform the Dow over the course of the year. Let's take a first look at 2017's Dogs of the Dow to see what you should watch out for over the coming year. Stock Dividend Yield Verizon 4.3% Pfizer 3.9% Chevron 3.7% Boeing (NYSE:BA) 3.7% Cisco Systems 3.4% Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) 3.4% IBM 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.3% Caterpillar 3.3% Merck 3.2% Data source: DogsoftheDow.com. Because of the way that the Dogs of the Dow get picked every year, you can count on seeing some turnover among the 10 stocks that make the cut. However, 2017 is a remarkably stable year for the Dogs, with just two new entrants joining eight carryover picks from 2016. Leaving the Dogs this year are Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble. Interestingly, neither of the two consumer giants had particularly good years, with both stocks underperforming the broader Dow in 2016. However, a combination of factors resulted in their falling to the No. 11 and 12 spots on the Dow yield list. First, the addition of Coca-Cola came from even worse performance from the beverage giant than its consumer goods peers. Coca-Cola saw its share price fall more than 3% during 2016, as ongoing challenges related to its long-struggling carbonated beverage segment continued to weigh on its prospects. The threat of greater regulation and taxation in some areas has hit Coca-Cola, and efforts to find efficiency gains haven't been adequate to give investors the optimism in the company's future prospects to justify share-price gains. Moreover, the recent strength in the U.S. dollar could once again create difficulties for Coca-Cola, given how much it relies on foreign currency for its revenue and profits. The much more unusual move in the Dogs came from Boeing, which saw its yield jump not because of a decline in share price but rather from a huge raise that the aerospace giant made late in the year. Boeing boosted its quarterly payout in December by 30%, making its quarterly payout $1.42 per share. That helped send its yield up by more than a full percentage point compared to where it started 2016, despite Boeing's solid share-price increase of 8% for the year. The move shows how much confidence Boeing has in its recent success, despite some concerns among investors that the volume of new orders in the future might begin to slow from its breakneck pace of recent years. Image source: Getty Images. You can't count on the Dogs of the Dow always beating the entire Dow, but it has had a recent string of good outcomes. For 2016, the strategy led to a rise of about 16%, topping the 13% gain in the overall Dow. Moreover, the Dogs paid higher dividends that gave the strategy another percentage point of outperformance compared to the overall Dow. That good result brought the Dogs of the Dow's track record to six wins in seven years. The strategy didn't manage to match the Dow in 2012, and in 2014, it took the added returns from dividends for the Dogs to pull ahead. A small win in 2015 also didn't bring much outperformance, but better performance in 2010, 2011, and 2013 has many investors convinced that the Dogs of the Dow are back for good. Yet when you go back 20 years, the win-loss record is much closer to .500 than investors would like to see. The main reason to follow the Dogs of the Dow is that it's a simple way to get performance that's roughly in line with the Dow. Some years will be winners and others losers, but if you want a conservative dividend strategy that emphasizes blue-chip stocks, it's hard to beat the Dogs of the Dow. ","
      
    Here Are the 2017 Dogs of the Dow -- The Motley Fool

  "
,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Yahoo was already a shell of its former self. Now part of the company is getting an obscure new name: Altaba. When Verizon agreed to buy the company for $4.8 billion in July, it planned to purchase just Yahoo's core Internet businesses, which include its email service, sports verticals and various apps. What's left of the embattled technology company would essentially be its ownership in the very valuable Chinese Internet giant Alibaba. When the deal closes, the remaining part will change its name to Altaba, the company announced in security filings on Monday. The sale is expected to be completed by late March, Yahoo said. The new name is meant to be a combination of the words “alternative and Alibaba,” according to a person familiar with the company’s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak on the record about the name change. Today Yahoo owns roughly 15 percent of Alibaba, holdings that are worth about $35 billion. The idea behind the name is that Altaba’s stock can now be tracked as an alternative to Alibaba because Yahoo owns a sizable chunk of the Chinese company. The name change reflects just how far Yahoo has fallen. The company that was once an Internet giant and is still the third most visited Web property in the United States is now essentially a vehicle for holding Alibaba's stock. The new company, which will be publicly traded and until now has been referred to as RemainCo in security filings, also owns a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, the company’s Japanese affiliate, and Yahoo’s cash, as well as a patent portfolio that is being sold off in a separate auction. A Yahoo spokeswoman, Suzanne Philion, would not comment on the name. She emailed the following statement: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” The company also announced in the filings that Eric Brandt is now the chairman of Yahoo's board. He is a former finance chief of semiconductor company Broadcom. Marissa Mayer remains chief executive and plans to step down from the board when the deal closes. Philion declined to comment further on these changes. ",How Yahoo came up with its new name: Altaba - The Washington Post

The $30 billion-plus entity that holds on to all of that, which will exist only if the deal with Verizon goes through, would eventually be called Altaba. Altaba, though, will do virtually nothing but hold these assets, as what is known as “an investment company.” Because there is little decision-making involved in being basically a ticker symbol, Altaba does not need a full board of directors, so it will slash the size of the current Yahoo board in half. Among those who will no longer be on the board are Mayer, who could still be acting as the head of Yahoo under Verizon leadership, and Yahoo co-founder David Filo. “His or her intention to resign is not due to any disagreement with the company on any matter relating to the company’s operations, policies or practice,” Yahoo noted in the Securities and Exchange Commission filing that launched a thousand confusing tweets. So Yahoo will still be Yahoo, Altaba will be a zombie company comprising a bunch of assets and few, if any, tasks, and Mayer may or may not still be running the actual Yahoo. No matter what anyone on Twitter says. ","Altaba, explained: Yahoo will still be Yahoo, and Marissa Mayer is still CEO (for now) - MarketWatch"
Jack Hough,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Published: Jan 9, 2017 9:49 a.m. ET Why actively managed mutual funds are poised to make a comeback after years of being trounced by ETFs By In 2017, consider committing an act of financial heresy: Buy an actively managed mutual fund. Look for one whose manager is frugal, odd and stubborn—or, put more politely, a value manager with high active share and low turnover. The ideal candidates will have disappointed in 2015 but shined in 2016. We list seven funds for consideration. A long, humiliating period for professional stockpickers might be giving way to something different. Stocks that have moved in near unison in recent years are beginning to chart more distinct paths. Data points that haven’t mattered in a decade, like the ­relationship between prices and fundamental measures of value, are starting to have more sway on returns. The divide between cheap stocks and expensive ones remains exceptionally wide, which could mean last year’s shift in favor of value investing is just the beginning. We know: Recommending a shift to active fund management now is a little like saying the time is right to take up smoking. Evidence to the contrary is vast and convincing. Most stockpickers struggle to beat their benchmarks. Index funds, by contrast, have much to recommend them, ­including simplicity, low fees, and tax efficiency. Investors have been stripping money out of active funds and stuffing it in passive ones at a record pace, and following the herd has never looked so smart. But for tactical investors, the timing might be good for a contrarian move. All that cash pouring into index funds might have flattered the relative performance of the indexes in recent years. And the broad U.S. stock market trades at an elevated valuation. “I have no religious objection to index funds,” says Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of the GoodHaven fund

                                   launched in 2011. “But investors are stepping on the gas with valuations high. If anything, it’s better to use an index when the market is cheap.” From here, returns for index investing could underwhelm for a while, and talented value managers should be better rewarded for their efforts. Meanwhile, recent evidence points to better ways to identify promising funds than simply searching for five-year standouts. Don’t smoke. Don’t even vape. But do consider complementing a core portfolio of low-cost index funds with targeted bets on active management—what indexing champion Vanguard calls a core-and-satellite approach. In what follows, we don’t intend to argue that active beats passive, broadly speaking, because too many active managers are either high-fee index huggers or else fidgety flippers who add hidden costs that sap returns. But the question isn’t whether active management as a whole is a good deal. It’s whether any fund managers can reliably outperform, over long time periods or ­under certain conditions, and whether investors can identify those managers and conditions ahead of time. On that question, we’re somewhere between a strong maybe and a sheepish probably. And now seems like a low-risk time to give active a chance. This year will mark the 15th anniversary of a publication that causes active fund managers to toss in their 1,020 thread-count sheets. It’s the Spiva Scorecard. The acronym stands for Standard & Poor’s Indices Versus Active. Among other things, the biannual report now published in eight world regions shows the percentage of active funds that fail to beat their benchmarks. In 2015, 66% of large-cap funds did worse than the S&P 500 index

                                   . That was almost cause for popping Champagne corks. Just a year earlier, 86% came up short. When the 2016 numbers come out, expect them to be damning, too. Since 2000, there have only been three years when most U.S. large-cap managers succeeded at what they do for a living. Results across other size and style categories are poor, too. The Spiva reports beget a steady flow of news stories about the failings of active funds, and investors have been taking action. Over the past five years, passive funds have received inflows of more than $1 trillion. Last year, active funds saw withdrawals of more than $200 billion, a postcrisis high. Active funds still hold two-thirds of mutual fund money. If index funds simply accept market prices as they are, and active funds seek to identify pricing mistakes and exploit them, the stampede to the former from the latter raises the question of whether stock pricing has been affected. In recent years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has tracked a trading strategy that buys what active managers shun, and shuns what they buy, to profitable effect. As cash flows toward indexes, it flows almost by definition against the interests of active funds. Many active funds have taken to what’s derided as closet indexing, in which managers stick close to the benchmarks for fear of being drastically wrong in any single year, thereby marring their marketing brochures. But, of course, that’s a recipe for gradual but certain failure. Active funds have higher fees than passive ones. If the two funds hold much the same merchandise, the costlier one will usually do worse. Research by Martijn Cremers, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, has shown that funds with high active share—that is, ones whose portfolios are distinct from their benchmarks—tend to outperform after fees. The struggles of active funds, it would seem, might boil down to managers not being bold enough to justify their fees. There’s just one problem. A paper published last July by S&P showed that even after ignoring fees, active funds tend to lag behind their benchmarks. If fees aren’t the problem, what is? Maybe there’s ­another, hidden drag on industry returns. Or maybe stockpickers are just bad at picking stocks. There is, indeed, a hidden drag. Trading costs aren’t included in a fund’s published expenses. That makes them a possible explanation for why so many ­active funds underperform even before fees are subtracted. In a study published in November in the Journal of Financial Economics, Cremers looks at how active share and average holding periods jointly relate to performance. Funds with high active share and long holding periods, he finds, tend to outperform by two percentage points a year after fees. Those with high active share and short holding periods underperform. Different is good, but only if it comes with lasting conviction. As for the skill of stockpickers themselves, reliably bad ones aren’t supposed to exist any more than reliably good ones, according to efficient-market devotees. But strange things are happening. Looking at the Spiva record since 2000, the first eight years show 55% of active funds doing worse than their benchmarks. The most recent eight years show 65% underperforming. Fees for active and index funds have fallen by ­similar amounts since 2000. So why are stockpickers getting worse? “I think the big inflows have perpetuated the ­performance of passive,” says John Linehan, manager of the $22.7 billion T. Rowe Price Equity Income fund

                                   “If you own companies outside the index, you’ve been disadvantaged. Nothing can go on like that forever.” In Linehan’s view, passive portfolios will reach a breaking point when valuations become too skewed relative to those in active portfolios, and fund flows are no longer pushing the indexes to outperform. “When people are piling into a trade, it can pay to take the other side,” he says. That happened just after the dot-com stock bubble, which is one of the periods when even average active managers beat the benchmarks. Another such period occurred around the market top in 2007. The stock market doesn’t have to tumble for good active managers to earn their fees now, however. All that’s needed are some changes in the pattern of individual stock returns. One change that could already be underway is a long-awaited comeback for value stocks. Barron’s predicted just such a comeback in “Move Over, Facebook and Netflix: Value Investing Is ­Rebounding” (March 12, 2016).

                                   Such shifts can play out over many years. During the last good run for value stocks, after the dot-com bust, they beat growth in five out of seven years by ­double-digit percentages. Value stocks still look like a good deal now, says Bob Schmidt, manager of the Brandes Institute, which researches market ­behavior on behalf of Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego value manager overseeing $28 billion. Schmidt divides the world’s stocks into 10 equal groups, ranked by the ratio of share prices to tangible book value. On average, he found that over the past two decades, the cheapest decile was about 40% as expensive as the costliest. By last year, that figure had fallen to 15%. The only period close to that was during the dot-com bubble, at 25%. “During the tech-stock bubble, many active managers had a hard time keeping up with Dell, Cisco, and AOL,” says Schmidt. “Until recently, it was the same thing with Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix.” There are other green shoots for active managers, according to Jill Hall, a stock strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch. Correlations among stocks have been coming down, and the spread between the best-performing and worst-performing stocks has been widening. In other words, conditions are becoming more favorable for stockpickers, or at least less punishing. Read: Mark Hulbert on the real message behind those plunging stock-market correlations In a report published this past week, strategists at Nomura Instinet predict that the market is at or near “peak passive” and will soon experience an “active renaissance.” Active managers have gone through periods when they struggled to keep up with their benchmarks, followed by periods of mean ­reversion when they outperformed. The last big slumps occurred in the mid-1970s, the years around 1990, and the late ’90s dot-com bubble. “We believe the direction of interest rates is the key determinant of when mean reversion occurs,” the strategists wrote. “Rising rates ­anticipate economic growth, which benefits small-cap stocks, and when small-caps outperform, market diversity increases, giving active managers a tail wind.” Don’t expect active managers to begin beating benchmarks as a class. For talented managers, however, there could be more of what we see among the funds on our list—underperformance giving way to outperformance as the market begins repricing undervalued shares. For purposes of judging the talent of value managers, a poor 2015 is excusable. It might even be a badge of honor. That year, dot-com highfliers soared, and many cheap stocks got cheaper. Moreover, the best managers tend not to have spotless records. A recent Morningstar analysis showed some surprising characteristics among the top 10% of active mutual funds by performance over the past two decades. On average, they trailed their benchmarks in one out of every three rolling three-year periods. The shortfall during those slumps was close to three percentage points a year. During their worst three-year stretches, they underperformed by nine percentage points a year. That said, we restricted our list—compiled in part based on screen results from Morningstar—to funds that did well in 2016, when value stocks began coming around. Closet indexers are generally funds with an active share of 20% to 60%. The funds on our list have active share ranging from the top of that range to well above it. In general, a fund with a high active share works well as an add-on to a passive portfolio. Expect it to have plenty of volatility relative to the broad market. A good fund whose active share is only slightly above average has potential as a core holding, provided its fees are competitive. AllianzGI NFJ Dividend Value

Its managers screen the market to select the cheapest slice based on the relationship between share prices and the value of a company’s assets. They then favor smaller and more-prosperous companies. The approach keeps costs and turnover low for an active fund, but not returns. Over the past 15 years, the fund has beaten the S&P 500 by nearly two percentage points a year.

The fund lagged behind the S&P 500 in both 2014 and 2015 but trounced it last year, and is now ahead by two percentage points a year on average over the past five years. The GoodHaven fund is managed by a pair of alumni from the Fairholme fund, which is known for concentrated positions and spectacular periods of over- and underperformance, mostly the former. This has added up to long-term returns well ahead of the market, but also plenty of discomfort along the way. Launched in 2011, GoodHaven, too, is keeping things interesting. Last year, it beat the S&P 500 by eight percentage points. The year before it trailed by 20.

Its managers start with an index portfolio and then slightly tweak weightings according to valuation, momentum, and other factors. That kept the fund from getting clobbered in 2015 but also helped it outperform the S&P 500 by more than four percentage points last year. Fees are blessedly low at 0.23%. That compares with 1.13% for the average large-cap value fund. Vanguard U.S. Value isn’t a closet indexer. It’s an out-of-the-closet indexer that adds an active component—and comes at a bargain price. This article first appeared in Barron’s ",Heresy?

                                   has pulled in modestly from the 20,000 mark. The index topped last week at 19,999.63 — just 0.37 points under the milestone — and has subsequently extended the pullback to first support. From current levels, the Dow’s first notable floor holds around 19,750, an area also illustrated on the daily chart. Looking elsewhere, the Nasdaq Composite has sustained a slight break to record territory, outpacing the S&P and the Dow. First support rests at the December peak of 5,512, and is followed by a deeper floor at 5,487, matching the Nasdaq’s former record close. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has confirmed its uptrend, reaching another all-time high. Consider that a projected target of 5,570 is within striking distance. Conversely, support broadly spans from 5,487 to 5,512, and is followed by an inflection point matching the 20-day moving average, currently 5,462. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark topped last week at 19,999. Technically, notable resistance spans from the December peak of 19,987 to the 20,000 mark. Conversely, the Dow has maintained a posture atop the 20-day moving average, currently 19,884, on a closing basis. The index has not closed under the 20-day since Nov. 4. Also recall that firmer support holds around 19,750, detailed previously. Similarly, the S&P 500 has pulled in from a nominal record high. Consider that its one-month range effectively spans from about 2,250 to 2,277. The index has tried to break lower, and higher, thus far concluding with a bull-bear stalemate. Separately, the S&P’s 50-day moving average, currently 2,210, closely matches notable support at 2,214. Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks are off to a constructive 2017 start. Each index reached all-time highs last week, and the ensuing selling pressure remains muted.

                                   has thus far sustained its breakout. Recall that first support matches the 2016 close of 134.85. The IWM closed Monday five cents lower, at 134.80, and has maintained support with Tuesday’s early upturn. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is digesting the 2016 breakout. The prevailing pullback has been fueled by decreased volume, thus far inflicting no real damage. Notable support matches the late-December low of 301.05. (The 2016 close rests at 301.73.) Beyond the details, the U.S. benchmarks’ bigger-picture backdrop supports a firmly-bullish bias. Consider that the Nasdaq Composite has confirmed its uptrend, notching consecutive all-time closing highs. The breakout has been fueled by a FANG stocks resurgence — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — detailed Monday. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 have registered nominal record highs, without truly breaking out. Still, the price action is constructive against the current backdrop. And notably, the prevailing bull trend has recently weathered a retail sector downdraft, familiar political uncertainty, and a very early batch of fourth-quarter earnings reports. Tactically, initial S&P 500 support rests at 2,252, and is followed by the late-December low of 2,233. This is followed by deeper, and more significant support, spanning from S&P 2,190 to 2,214. (Recall that the December closing low held at 2,191.) The S&P 500’s intermediate-term technical bias points firmly higher barring a violation.

At the risk of too much detail, consider that significant resistance rests at the 2014 peak of 119.75, an area closely matching the 2016 peak of 118.69. More plainly, major overhead rests slightly under the 120 mark, and is currently under siege. Against this backdrop, the shares are rising from an orderly three-week range, underpinned by support matching the bottom of the October gap. A constructive posture.

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

(TMUS) and Sprint Corporation (S) may be the third- and fourth-place U.S. wireless carriers, but they are chipping away at the dominance AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), and more of that is expected to come in 2017 whether or not the two ending up merging. Pacific Crest Securities, which recently raised its fourth-quarter subscriber numbers for both T-Mobile and Sprint, expects more market-share gains, pointing to recent promotions and a focus on unlimited data plans as ways to grab business from the likes of AT&T and Verizon. “Unlimited data is what consumers desire. It is becoming a differentiating factor, with Verizon the only carrier not offering unlimited data, and AT&T only offering it in limited fashion,” wrote Pacific Crest analysts Michael Bowen and Brandon Nispel said in a research note published by Barron’s. “Consumers are tired of being hit with overages and fees from using their data plan. Our survey has found a sharp increase in the amount of unlimited data customers, which we expect will continue to trend higher.” Recognizing a movement to unlimited and a frustration with fees, T-Mobile announced during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month that it was getting rid of fees and taxes on its unlimited plans, which will eventually force the other carriers to respond. Sprint had its own news during the annual technology confab, announcing it will let customers put more than one number on a single device and is working with cloud-based platform Movius to provide the service. The wireless carrier also announced a promotion last week in which it will give families up to $800 in gift cards when they switch to a unlimited data, talk and text plan. (See also: Sprint Offers $800 Sign-Up Bonus for Certain Plans.) According to the Pacific Crest Securities analysts, in 2017 the big carriers are going to have a tough time gaining or keeping subscribers with Verizon having a better go of it than AT&T. The analysts said there is a chance Verizon will post a slight upside to its estimates for postpaid-phone net additions in the fourth quarter, but it could still be disappointing to investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is projected to lose 330,000 postpaid phones subscribers. “Net losses at AT&T and the struggles at Verizon indicate T-Mobile and Sprint should take share; 2017 brings a new year, but competition will persist,” said the analysts noting that Sprint should see the most gains while T-Mobile will still be “market share taker” during the year.

The FCC recently declared that AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) ""sponsored data"" programs -- which exclude their own streaming media from data caps -- violate net neutrality rules. Many streaming companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) believe that practice, also called ""zero rating"", gives telcos an unfair advantage as they expand into the streaming market with their own data-free content. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T lets other companies zero rate their content across its networks for a fee, but the FCC claims that those fees are much higher than the ones it charges its own subsidiary, DirecTV. The FCC also expressed similar concerns about Verizon's comparable FreeBee Data 360 program. Will the FCC actually force AT&T and Verizon to drop its sponsored data strategies, or does all this sound and fury signify nothing? Sponsored data lets AT&T bundle together its wireless and DirecTV platforms. To build the foundation of that ecosystem, AT&T started offering unlimited wireless data plans for DirecTV subscribers. All streaming DirecTV content was then zero rated for AT&T wireless customers, and AT&T launched new streaming platforms like DirecTV Now -- a $35 per month service with 100 channels -- to expand that ecosystem. By zero rating all that content, AT&T enables its customers to watch DirecTV across mobile devices, PCs, and TVs without worrying about data caps. That gives it a distinct advantage against Netflix, which is throttling the quality of its own content and letting users download videos locally to reduce their data usage. This is why AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) for $85 billion last year. By adding HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. movies, and other content to that zero rated ecosystem, AT&T could create a prisoner-taking media ecosystem which widens its moat against Netflix and its competing carriers. But if regulators force AT&T to stop zero rating its own content, its DirecTV platforms could become less competitive, and the Time Warner buyout would become much less appealing. Like AT&T, Verizon is building a zero rated ecosystem for selling advertisements and streaming videos. That's why it acquired AOL in 2015, which it plans to merge with Yahoo's internet business if that long-delayed deal finally closes. Verizon has integrated video content from those companies into go90, a mobile video app it launched in late 2015. It subsequently zero rated that app for its wireless subscribers to counter AT&T's DirecTV push. Verizon also started offering data-free streaming of NFL games through the NFL Mobile app. To address criticisms about those apps violating net neutrality, Verizon launched the FreeBee Data 360 program, which let other companies pay to zero rate their own content across its networks. The FCC's ruling is a harsh condemnation of AT&T and Verizon's sponsored data strategies, but it probably won't mean much in the long run. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will be replaced on Jan. 20, and his likely successor, Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai, said that the report ""does not reflect the views of the majority of Commissioners."" Pai also claimed that such ""midnight regulations"" were ""sad"". AT&T and Verizon have both repeatedly defended their sponsored data programs as consumer-friendly ones that let subscribers watch video without racking up data fees. However, both telcos clearly depend on these plans to expand their ecosystems, squeeze out more revenue per user (via ads or add-on services), and offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless subscribers. The FCC report probably won't lead to any regulatory actions against AT&T and Verizon, but it reveals how heavily both companies are leveraging their dominance of wireless networks to build content-rich digital ecosystems. That strategy could help them counter streaming rivals like Netflix, which have piggybacked off their networks while convincing customers to drop their traditional pay TV services. But it could also corral consumers within telco-controlled streaming ecosystems -- an anti-competitive move which could be tough for Netflix (which lacks the ISP infrastructure) to retaliate.

    Will AT&T and Verizon's Sponsored Data Dreams Be Crushed? -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image Source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) management expects 2017 to be another year of solid revenue growth for the third-place carrier. ""We're looking at another year of very significant value creation,"" CFO Braxton Carter said at a recent investors conference hosted by Citi. Carter expects T-Mobile's service revenue -- the money customers pay for their plans -- to grow in the double digits, yet again, in 2017, which will ultimately translate into a sustainable ramp up in cash flow. Meanwhile, T-Mobile's competitors have seen service revenue decline. AT&T's (NYSE:T) service revenue declined 0.9% in the third quarter, Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) fell 5.2%, and Sprint's (NYSE:S) fell 6.8%. Comparatively, T-Mobile increased service revenue 13.2% in the third quarter. Here are five reasons why T-Mobile expects that trend to continue. The easiest way to increase service revenue is to bring on more subscribers. Over the past few years, no wireless carrier has done a better job than T-Mobile. In 2016, T-Mobile added 8.2 million total customers, 3.3 million of which are the extremely high-value postpaid phone subscribers. In fact, T-Mobile boasts that it captured over 100% of the postpaid phone net additions across the industry in both 2016 and 2015. (Other carriers -- specifically AT&T -- lost postpaid phone subscribers during those years.) There's no indication that the trend is slowing in 2017. If anything, T-Mobile stands to gain from the expiration of Sprint's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion for its earliest sign-ups. CEO John Legere has already noted an increase in switchers from Sprint to T-Mobile in the fourth quarter. AT&T and Verizon's split focus on wireless and media ensures T-Mobile will be able to fill in more pain points and continue funneling customers away from the larger carriers. T-Mobile's most recent Un-Carrier move, announced at CES earlier this month, is to include taxes and fees in its pricing. It's also doing away with its Simple Choice plans with data buckets, and only offering its unlimited data T-Mobile One plan. Carter believes the latest move, dubbed All In, ""will set the stage for very nice front-end growth"" in 2017. T-Mobile is betting on a simple pricing structure to front-load its subscriber growth in 2017. If Carter is correct, it would result in sustained service-revenue growth throughout the year. The other benefit of getting rid of Simple Choice plans is that customers will be forced to choose T-Mobile's more expensive plan. During the third quarter, when T-Mobile introduced its T-Mobile One plan, it saw a 2.2% sequential increase in average revenue per postpaid phone subscriber. And Carter points out the new service plan was only available for one month that quarter. While including taxes and fees in its new pricing seems like it could be a price cut, T-Mobile has also done away with its $5 per-line autopay discount. Effectively, it's replacing one pricing promotion with another. As a result, the new All In promotion shouldn't impact average revenue per user (ARPU) on T-Mobile One accounts very much. T-Mobile currently has the lowest ARPU in the industry for postpaid phone subscribers, as seen in the table below. Wireless Carrier Postpaid Phone ARPU Q3 2016 AT&T $59.64 Sprint $58.03 Verizon $47.52* T-Mobile $48.15 *Includes lower-value connections like tablets and IoT devices.Source: Company earnings reports. There's clearly room for T-Mobile to increase its ARPU, but it's also been able to put pressure on its competitors' ARPU. The result is a growing T-Mobile customer base that's also paying more per month, on average. T-Mobile dramatically improved its network coverage in 2016, but its retail footprint hasn't quite caught up with its network. Carter says the company plans to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores by mid-2017. Since T-Mobile's marketing campaigns are all done on a nationwide scale, it already has strong brand recognition in those areas, which generally have lower competition. Carter estimates the additional stores will reach 30 million to 40 million potential customers, which could add meaningful growth to its subscriber base. When it comes to grabbing share of the enterprise market, Verizon and AT&T are dominant forces. Carter says, ""We still index very low on B2B [business to business]."" T-Mobile has taken less than 5% of the marketplace. AT&T counts 50 million postpaid connections in its Business Solutions segment. In fact, AT&T's business customers outnumber its retail wireless customers. While business customers are harder to convert than retail customers due to the need to convert so many people at once, T-Mobile is much better positioned to win these valuable contracts than just two years ago. It may be a slow process, but investors should look for enterprise customers to add meaningfully to service revenue in 2017 and beyond. Overall, T-Mobile is poised for another strong year of service-revenue growth as its competitors struggle to tread water. ","

"Jason Hall, George Budwell, Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Steve Symington",01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","

Good luck finding a Pixel XL or one with more storage. Image source: Google. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages. That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around, we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report. While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course. The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge: We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis. Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders. The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels. How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product. ","

Daniel B. Kline,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A new report (link open PDF) released by the National Economic Council (NEC), a board created in 1993 to advise the president on domestic and global economic policy, shows that declining competition in some markets has led to rising pricing in the form of hidden fees for American consumers. The NEC noted that competition not only keeps prices down, it also forces companies to innovate and can push wages higher. In its December report, though, the agency found several indicators of declining competition in the United States. These include ""increasing levels of industry concentration, increasing returns to capital accruing to a few firms, lower levels of firm entry, and decreased labor market mobility."" It's a situation where more money has become concentrated in the biggest companies. That creates a market where consumers often pay the price. In many situations, according to NEC, this involves ""hidden"" or ""muddy"" prices, situations where the advertised cost does not equal what a person actually pays. Image source: Getty Images. A hidden fee is not an add-on for an extra service, but a mandatory charge that people must pay in order to use whatever they are buying. For example, both AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) charge ""line access fees"" on top of their advertised prices. Since consumers can't use their phones or data plans without paying this fee, it's not really an extra charge, but part of the basic price. ""In many industries, businesses use so-called 'hidden fees' -- the addition of a mandatory or quasi-mandatory fee to the advertised price of a good or service ... to effectively raise the final price,"" NEC wrote. ""At their worst, such fees can be fraudulent or deceptive; at a minimum, they make prices unclear, hinder effective consumer decision making, and dull the competitive process."" The NEC report listed a number of hidden fees that consumers routinely pay. In some cases, like the AT&T and Verizon example above, these fees have become so ingrained in various industries that people no longer even question them. The worst offenders, according to the report, include: Not appearing in the report is the cable and broadband industries, where most major players add ""broadcast fees,"" and ""sports fees"" to their advertised prices and on the internet side charge rental fees for needed equipment. In all these cases, what's consistent is that consumers have no choice but to pay a cost that's more than what they expected based on advertised prices. In addition to potential regulatory solutions, and new competition forcing companies to abandon deceptive pricing, the NEC said that customers can force an end to these practices. ""Consumers and consumer groups play a crucial role in moderating fees,"" according to the report. ""For example, in event ticketing, even absent regulation, consumer outrage at fees has been acknowledged by some vendors who, in turn, have made some effort to clarify why they charge the fees they do."" Of course, the easiest way to end these practices would be to outlaw them. One method of doing that would be to legally require ""all-in"" pricing. There are various versions of this legislation, but in a broad sense the laws would require companies to advertise pricing that reflects exactly what a person will pay. It's easy to see why consumers would want this and some companies would not. Forcing businesses to disclose the final ""all-in"" price may not lower prices, but it would at least allow for a level playing field and a more informed buying public. ","

Mark Hulbert,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 17, 2017 10:20 a.m. ET Low-volatility shares, such as the six listed here, beat the broader market in the long run By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — The two-plus months since Donald Trump’s election has been exciting for stock market investors. Still, they need to be reminded that boredom has its virtues too. That’s because excitement works both ways: The stocks that perform best when the market is rising tend to fall the most when the market heads south. We tend to forget that after the market has mounted an impressive rally. So, with anxiety about the Trump rally stalling, now is an especially good time to remember that low-volatility stocks are the opposite of exciting: Though they lag behind during rallies, they usually beat the market when it’s falling. They therefore hold their own over an entire market cycle, if not come out well ahead. A column on this subject would not have been necessary as recently as this past summer and fall. That’s because low-volatility approaches at that time were riding a crest of popularity; exchange traded funds that employ such approaches were amassing huge sums. No fewer than six such ETFs, for example, each had over $2 billion in assets under management. The period since the election in early November has taken some of the wind out of those ETFs’ sails. Since Nov. 8, the S&P 500 Index

                                   has gained an impressive 6.3% and the Nasdaq Composite 7.3%. The lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500, in contrast, have gained only 2.8%. Read: How I lost money in the Trump rally Yet this market-lagging performance is precisely what history teaches us would happen, as you can see from the accompanying chart. On average during the last three bull markets (as identified by Ned Davis Research), the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has risen 58.9% versus 71.8% for the S&P 500. It’s during bear markets, of course, that low-volatility approaches tend to shine. On average during the past three bear markets, the S&P Low Volatility Index has fallen 15.2%, compared with 29.5% for the S&P 500. Due to the magic of compounding, these smaller losses more than make up for the market-trailing returns during bull markets. Over the past decade, for example, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has beaten the S&P 500 by an annualized margin of 8.5% to 7% (on a dividend-adjusted basis). Beating the market by 1.5 percentage points a year would be reason enough to consider such stocks. But there’s an added bonus as well: They’re also less volatile. That’s very much a winning combination. To pursue a low-volatility stock strategy, however, you must be willing to give up the potential for some upside excitement. With the market at all-time highs, that’s something you should seriously consider. Think of it this way: A low-volatile-stock strategy, in effect, allows you to take some chips off the table without giving up on the stock market as a whole. Probably the easiest way to pursue such a strategy is via an ETF, since it’s important to be well-diversified. The two largest such ETFs are the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 15, 2017 7:49 a.m. ET Overseas blue-chip dividend stocks are better buys now, says Michael Binger of Gradient Investments By Back in May, Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager with Gradient Investments LLC, told MarketWatch about six of his favorite dividend stocks at that time. Binger’s outlook has changed a bit since then, and he thinks dividend stocks as a group are looking pricey. He’s now looking beyond the U.S. for attractively valued dividend stocks. The change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. Here’s how his “Gradient 50” strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by Orion Advisor Services: In this table, “total return” for the “Gradient 50” strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. Binger said his firm’s clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. As cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends. Gradient Investments is a registered investment adviser based in Arden Hills, Minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. The Gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies Binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark S&P 500

                                   by selecting stocks of what they consider “high quality” U.S. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. They will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market. The aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 2.07%, according to FactSet. Gradient generally selects stocks with yields of at least 2.5% for the Gradient 50 strategy, and the portfolio’s dividend yield now is roughly 3.5%. The 50 stocks held within that portfolio are rebalanced each quarter, so each stock tends to amount to about 2% of the assets. This chart shows how high the S&P 500 is trading relative to the past 12 months’ earnings. By this measure, the index hasn’t traded this high since January 2004: Asked if there were alarming signs for stock valuations, Binger replied: “Sure there are. At the current time, I would say the dividend-paying group, as a whole, is subjectively overvalued. If I have a group of 50 dividend paying stocks and the portfolio was up 20% while the market was up 12% [in 2016], what does that tell you?” This is why Binger said it was a “pefect time” for his firm to roll out a new strategy, which it calls the “Gradient 40 International.” The portfolio includes 40 stocks, and Binger said each “needs to be a blue-chip company domiciled outside the U.S.” They also need to be publicly traded in the U.S., or have American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) traded on U.S. exchanges. Rather than shifting the holdings of the domestic G50 strategy, Binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about U.S. stock valuations reduce exposure to the G50 and consider investing in the G40-I, because he believes “global markets are a little bit cheaper than their U.S. counterparts.

According to FactSet, the company’s free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $689 million, while dividends on common shares totaled $264 million. That’s a dividend payout ratio of just 38%. “This makes me feel comfortable that the [4.85%] dividend yield isn’t in any danger at all,” Binger said.

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:50 a.m. ET A deep dive yields generous income-producing stocks coupled with some downside protection By Income-hungry investors continue to flock to stocks over bonds, where yields, while rising, remain relatively low. But how to find attractive investments? Last year’s “flight to yield” pushed many stock valuations to relatively high levels, making some dividend stocks appear to be risky short-term investments. For long-term growth investors, there are plenty of solid arguments against dividend stocks, including these from Meb Faber. But dividend stocks still appeal to investors who need income now and to those who think it’s only fair for companies to reward their owners with a good portion of the profits. And if a high dividend-payer’s sales and profits are also increasing, so much the better. Meanwhile, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds range from 75 to 150 basis points over 10-year U.S. Treasury notes

This left us with 164 stocks. We then excluded any stock trading above the aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio (based on consensus 2018 earnings estimates) for its sector or for the entire S&P 1500, whichever was lower. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and its 11 sectors: That last cut left us with 50 stocks. Here are the 20 with the highest dividend yields, as of the market close on Jan. 9: This group of dividend stocks is certainly not universally loved by Wall Street analysts, as the following summary shows. Then again, the analysts’ ratings are built on one-year price targets, rather than current income and the hope of long-term capital growth to sweeten the pot. Note that while only three of these stocks have “buy” ratings from 50% of the analysts and just one does better than that, only three are expected by analysts to show price declines over the next 12 months. Those expected price decline, however, are small, and shareholders are being paid to wait through the dividends. No method of screening stocks can save you from doing the important research that will help you form an opinion about a company’s likelihood of long-term success with its business strategy. So that’s your next step, hopefully with the help of your broker or investment adviser, if you seen any names you like here.

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:51 a.m. ET Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings values and high rates of earnings growth By In a recent interview, Erick Ormsby, the founder of Alcosta Capital Management, looked ahead by a year and based several stock picks on companies expected to post double-digit earnings growth in 2018.

                                    SPX, -0.15% It may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. Banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. So long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations. Don’t miss: Twitter must change course, and this tech executive has some tips The method Beginning with the S&P 500, we isolated companies with forward price-to-earnings ratios for 2018 that were lower than the aggregate P/E ratio for their sector or for the entire index, which ever was lower. The P/E ratios were rounded to the nearest tenth. A positive P/E ratio assumes that a company will be profitable in 2018. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and all of its sectors, except the new real estate sector, which S&P Dow Jones Indices carved out of the financial sector in September, and for which an aggregate price-to-earnings ratio isn’t yet available: The energy sector was trading highest to consensus 2018 earnings estimates at the market close Jan.6. This reflects expectations that oil prices will at least remain stable, and analysts’ expectations that 2018 earnings will still be relatively low. But we’ve made a rather severe cut, only listing energy companies that trade at a discount to the entire S&P 500. We then excluded any company whose revenue is not expected by analysts to increase in 2018 from 2017. Also see: If you bought the Trump rumor, now it’s time to sell the news Here are the three remaining companies in each sector expected to post the greatest increase in earnings per share in 2018, except for the telecommunications sector, which is quite small to begin with, and for which only one company made the cut: Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings ratios and high rates of expected EPS growth. But you must consider why those companies may be deemed undervalued by other investors. If you see any names of interest here, do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or financial adviser. Put simply: You need to form an opinion about how likely a company is to succeed with its business strategy over the next five years at least.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P is traversing its range. The 2,277 resistance matches the December peak and the S&P’s all-time closing high, established Jan. 6. Conversely, the 2,263 area matches a near-term floor, and is followed by firmer support around 2,252. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound. Notable resistance matches the range top, technically spanning from 19,987 to 19,999. The Dow’s record close rests slightly lower, at 19,974.62. Separately, consider that last week’s close of 19,885 matched a near-term inflection point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains stronger. The index has rallied to yet another all-time high, punctuating a successful test of support, better illustrated below. From current levels, the 5,464 breakout point pivots to first support. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended the January rally, rising last week from a successful test of the breakout point. Notable support broadly spans from 5,487 to the December peak of 5,512, an area closely matching the ascending 20-day moving average. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has virtually flatlined just under record territory. Consider that last week’s low of 19,770 held just eight points above the 2016 close. This area remains an inflection point, matching support more broadly spanning from 19,718 to 19,770. Separately, the Dow’s tight five-week range is a continuation pattern, currently capped by the 20,000 mark. Similarly, the S&P 500 has maintained first support — the 2,252 area — bottoming last week at 2,254. More broadly, the S&P’s recent backdrop resembles the late-July/August post-Brexit price action. Its formerly overbought posture is working off via time, rather than price. (The S&P has flatlined, without pulling in materially.) As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend is intact. The Nasdaq Composite has notched another all-time high — confirming its uptrend — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials remain range-bound, but firmly within view of record territory. In fact, the S&P mised an all-time closing high last week by less than three points. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, it’s maintained support matching the 2016 close (134.85), surviving a strong-volume retest last week. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains slightly stronger. Consider that the MDY has maintained a posture firmly atop first support, closing last week within striking distance of record territory. Resistance technically spans from 309.09 to 309.59.

                                   has also flatlined just under record highs. Recall that last week’s low of 224.96 closely matched first support around the 225 mark. The successful retest, amid the orderly January range, is technically constructive. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained first support at 2,252, bottoming last week two points higher. The rally from support marked a bullish single-day reversal, and was punctuated by last week’s close, missing a record by less than three points. From current levels, the S&P’s all-time closing high rests at 2,276.98 — and remains within view — while the absolute record peak holds at 2,282.10. Both levels were established Jan. 6. The S&P 500’s persistence near the range top signals muted selling pressure, improving the chances of an eventual leg higher. More broadly, significant support spans from 2,190 to 2,214, an area matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,222. The S&P’s intermediate-term backdrop supports a bullish view barring a violation.

                                   remains well positioned. Technically, the shares continue to challenge two inflection points. With Tuesday’s strong start, the shares have gapped atop the breakdown point — the 115 area — though, as always, it’s the close that matters. A close higher would neutralize the November breakdown, more firmly signaling a trend shift. Meanwhile, the GLD’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered another six-month high, improving the chances of incremental follow-through. Tactically, the 50-day offers an area from which to work, and a rally attempt is in play barring a violation. An intermediate-term target matches trendline resistance, and the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Conversely, the U.S. dollar — also detailed last week — has extended its downturn amid gold’s resurgence, and a related safe-haven trade.

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

(TMUS) and Sprint Corporation (S) may be the third- and fourth-place U.S. wireless carriers, but they are chipping away at the dominance AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), and more of that is expected to come in 2017 whether or not the two ending up merging. Pacific Crest Securities, which recently raised its fourth-quarter subscriber numbers for both T-Mobile and Sprint, expects more market-share gains, pointing to recent promotions and a focus on unlimited data plans as ways to grab business from the likes of AT&T and Verizon. “Unlimited data is what consumers desire. It is becoming a differentiating factor, with Verizon the only carrier not offering unlimited data, and AT&T only offering it in limited fashion,” wrote Pacific Crest analysts Michael Bowen and Brandon Nispel said in a research note published by Barron’s. “Consumers are tired of being hit with overages and fees from using their data plan. Our survey has found a sharp increase in the amount of unlimited data customers, which we expect will continue to trend higher.” Recognizing a movement to unlimited and a frustration with fees, T-Mobile announced during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month that it was getting rid of fees and taxes on its unlimited plans, which will eventually force the other carriers to respond. Sprint had its own news during the annual technology confab, announcing it will let customers put more than one number on a single device and is working with cloud-based platform Movius to provide the service. The wireless carrier also announced a promotion last week in which it will give families up to $800 in gift cards when they switch to a unlimited data, talk and text plan. (See also: Sprint Offers $800 Sign-Up Bonus for Certain Plans.) According to the Pacific Crest Securities analysts, in 2017 the big carriers are going to have a tough time gaining or keeping subscribers with Verizon having a better go of it than AT&T. The analysts said there is a chance Verizon will post a slight upside to its estimates for postpaid-phone net additions in the fourth quarter, but it could still be disappointing to investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is projected to lose 330,000 postpaid phones subscribers. “Net losses at AT&T and the struggles at Verizon indicate T-Mobile and Sprint should take share; 2017 brings a new year, but competition will persist,” said the analysts noting that Sprint should see the most gains while T-Mobile will still be “market share taker” during the year.

The video-streaming service blew past quarterly subscriber expectations, as it celebrated a decade of being online. After burning through still more cash, its share price soared to a new high. Apparently growth can come at almost any cost. The $57 billion company led by Reed Hastings added 7.1 million new customers after many initially blanched at a price increase last year. Both in the United States and internationally, Netflix surpassed its own forecast, tallying nearly 94 million for the quarter ending Dec. 31. It was 10 years ago that Hastings disrupted his own groundbreaking DVD mailing service by making the big bet that people would watch movies and TV shows using an internet connection instead.

Leo Sun,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The FCC recently declared that AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) ""sponsored data"" programs -- which exclude their own streaming media from data caps -- violate net neutrality rules. Many streaming companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) believe that practice, also called ""zero rating"", gives telcos an unfair advantage as they expand into the streaming market with their own data-free content. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T lets other companies zero rate their content across its networks for a fee, but the FCC claims that those fees are much higher than the ones it charges its own subsidiary, DirecTV. The FCC also expressed similar concerns about Verizon's comparable FreeBee Data 360 program. Will the FCC actually force AT&T and Verizon to drop its sponsored data strategies, or does all this sound and fury signify nothing? Sponsored data lets AT&T bundle together its wireless and DirecTV platforms. To build the foundation of that ecosystem, AT&T started offering unlimited wireless data plans for DirecTV subscribers. All streaming DirecTV content was then zero rated for AT&T wireless customers, and AT&T launched new streaming platforms like DirecTV Now -- a $35 per month service with 100 channels -- to expand that ecosystem. By zero rating all that content, AT&T enables its customers to watch DirecTV across mobile devices, PCs, and TVs without worrying about data caps. That gives it a distinct advantage against Netflix, which is throttling the quality of its own content and letting users download videos locally to reduce their data usage. This is why AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) for $85 billion last year. By adding HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. movies, and other content to that zero rated ecosystem, AT&T could create a prisoner-taking media ecosystem which widens its moat against Netflix and its competing carriers. But if regulators force AT&T to stop zero rating its own content, its DirecTV platforms could become less competitive, and the Time Warner buyout would become much less appealing. Like AT&T, Verizon is building a zero rated ecosystem for selling advertisements and streaming videos. That's why it acquired AOL in 2015, which it plans to merge with Yahoo's internet business if that long-delayed deal finally closes. Verizon has integrated video content from those companies into go90, a mobile video app it launched in late 2015. It subsequently zero rated that app for its wireless subscribers to counter AT&T's DirecTV push. Verizon also started offering data-free streaming of NFL games through the NFL Mobile app. To address criticisms about those apps violating net neutrality, Verizon launched the FreeBee Data 360 program, which let other companies pay to zero rate their own content across its networks. The FCC's ruling is a harsh condemnation of AT&T and Verizon's sponsored data strategies, but it probably won't mean much in the long run. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will be replaced on Jan. 20, and his likely successor, Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai, said that the report ""does not reflect the views of the majority of Commissioners."" Pai also claimed that such ""midnight regulations"" were ""sad"". AT&T and Verizon have both repeatedly defended their sponsored data programs as consumer-friendly ones that let subscribers watch video without racking up data fees. However, both telcos clearly depend on these plans to expand their ecosystems, squeeze out more revenue per user (via ads or add-on services), and offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless subscribers. The FCC report probably won't lead to any regulatory actions against AT&T and Verizon, but it reveals how heavily both companies are leveraging their dominance of wireless networks to build content-rich digital ecosystems. That strategy could help them counter streaming rivals like Netflix, which have piggybacked off their networks while convincing customers to drop their traditional pay TV services. But it could also corral consumers within telco-controlled streaming ecosystems -- an anti-competitive move which could be tough for Netflix (which lacks the ISP infrastructure) to retaliate.

    Will AT&T and Verizon's Sponsored Data Dreams Be Crushed? -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image Source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) management expects 2017 to be another year of solid revenue growth for the third-place carrier. ""We're looking at another year of very significant value creation,"" CFO Braxton Carter said at a recent investors conference hosted by Citi. Carter expects T-Mobile's service revenue -- the money customers pay for their plans -- to grow in the double digits, yet again, in 2017, which will ultimately translate into a sustainable ramp up in cash flow. Meanwhile, T-Mobile's competitors have seen service revenue decline. AT&T's (NYSE:T) service revenue declined 0.9% in the third quarter, Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) fell 5.2%, and Sprint's (NYSE:S) fell 6.8%. Comparatively, T-Mobile increased service revenue 13.2% in the third quarter. Here are five reasons why T-Mobile expects that trend to continue. The easiest way to increase service revenue is to bring on more subscribers. Over the past few years, no wireless carrier has done a better job than T-Mobile. In 2016, T-Mobile added 8.2 million total customers, 3.3 million of which are the extremely high-value postpaid phone subscribers. In fact, T-Mobile boasts that it captured over 100% of the postpaid phone net additions across the industry in both 2016 and 2015. (Other carriers -- specifically AT&T -- lost postpaid phone subscribers during those years.) There's no indication that the trend is slowing in 2017. If anything, T-Mobile stands to gain from the expiration of Sprint's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion for its earliest sign-ups. CEO John Legere has already noted an increase in switchers from Sprint to T-Mobile in the fourth quarter. AT&T and Verizon's split focus on wireless and media ensures T-Mobile will be able to fill in more pain points and continue funneling customers away from the larger carriers. T-Mobile's most recent Un-Carrier move, announced at CES earlier this month, is to include taxes and fees in its pricing. It's also doing away with its Simple Choice plans with data buckets, and only offering its unlimited data T-Mobile One plan. Carter believes the latest move, dubbed All In, ""will set the stage for very nice front-end growth"" in 2017. T-Mobile is betting on a simple pricing structure to front-load its subscriber growth in 2017. If Carter is correct, it would result in sustained service-revenue growth throughout the year. The other benefit of getting rid of Simple Choice plans is that customers will be forced to choose T-Mobile's more expensive plan. During the third quarter, when T-Mobile introduced its T-Mobile One plan, it saw a 2.2% sequential increase in average revenue per postpaid phone subscriber. And Carter points out the new service plan was only available for one month that quarter. While including taxes and fees in its new pricing seems like it could be a price cut, T-Mobile has also done away with its $5 per-line autopay discount. Effectively, it's replacing one pricing promotion with another. As a result, the new All In promotion shouldn't impact average revenue per user (ARPU) on T-Mobile One accounts very much. T-Mobile currently has the lowest ARPU in the industry for postpaid phone subscribers, as seen in the table below. Wireless Carrier Postpaid Phone ARPU Q3 2016 AT&T $59.64 Sprint $58.03 Verizon $47.52* T-Mobile $48.15 *Includes lower-value connections like tablets and IoT devices.Source: Company earnings reports. There's clearly room for T-Mobile to increase its ARPU, but it's also been able to put pressure on its competitors' ARPU. The result is a growing T-Mobile customer base that's also paying more per month, on average. T-Mobile dramatically improved its network coverage in 2016, but its retail footprint hasn't quite caught up with its network. Carter says the company plans to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores by mid-2017. Since T-Mobile's marketing campaigns are all done on a nationwide scale, it already has strong brand recognition in those areas, which generally have lower competition. Carter estimates the additional stores will reach 30 million to 40 million potential customers, which could add meaningful growth to its subscriber base. When it comes to grabbing share of the enterprise market, Verizon and AT&T are dominant forces. Carter says, ""We still index very low on B2B [business to business]."" T-Mobile has taken less than 5% of the marketplace. AT&T counts 50 million postpaid connections in its Business Solutions segment. In fact, AT&T's business customers outnumber its retail wireless customers. While business customers are harder to convert than retail customers due to the need to convert so many people at once, T-Mobile is much better positioned to win these valuable contracts than just two years ago. It may be a slow process, but investors should look for enterprise customers to add meaningfully to service revenue in 2017 and beyond. Overall, T-Mobile is poised for another strong year of service-revenue growth as its competitors struggle to tread water. ","

"Jason Hall, George Budwell, Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Steve Symington",01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States.

Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","

Good luck finding a Pixel XL or one with more storage. Image source: Google. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages. That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around, we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report. While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course. The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge: We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis. Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders. The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels. How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product. ","

Daniel B. Kline,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A new report (link open PDF) released by the National Economic Council (NEC), a board created in 1993 to advise the president on domestic and global economic policy, shows that declining competition in some markets has led to rising pricing in the form of hidden fees for American consumers. The NEC noted that competition not only keeps prices down, it also forces companies to innovate and can push wages higher. In its December report, though, the agency found several indicators of declining competition in the United States. These include ""increasing levels of industry concentration, increasing returns to capital accruing to a few firms, lower levels of firm entry, and decreased labor market mobility."" It's a situation where more money has become concentrated in the biggest companies. That creates a market where consumers often pay the price. In many situations, according to NEC, this involves ""hidden"" or ""muddy"" prices, situations where the advertised cost does not equal what a person actually pays. Image source: Getty Images. A hidden fee is not an add-on for an extra service, but a mandatory charge that people must pay in order to use whatever they are buying. For example, both AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) charge ""line access fees"" on top of their advertised prices. Since consumers can't use their phones or data plans without paying this fee, it's not really an extra charge, but part of the basic price. ""In many industries, businesses use so-called 'hidden fees' -- the addition of a mandatory or quasi-mandatory fee to the advertised price of a good or service ... to effectively raise the final price,"" NEC wrote. ""At their worst, such fees can be fraudulent or deceptive; at a minimum, they make prices unclear, hinder effective consumer decision making, and dull the competitive process."" The NEC report listed a number of hidden fees that consumers routinely pay. In some cases, like the AT&T and Verizon example above, these fees have become so ingrained in various industries that people no longer even question them. The worst offenders, according to the report, include: Not appearing in the report is the cable and broadband industries, where most major players add ""broadcast fees,"" and ""sports fees"" to their advertised prices and on the internet side charge rental fees for needed equipment. In all these cases, what's consistent is that consumers have no choice but to pay a cost that's more than what they expected based on advertised prices. In addition to potential regulatory solutions, and new competition forcing companies to abandon deceptive pricing, the NEC said that customers can force an end to these practices. ""Consumers and consumer groups play a crucial role in moderating fees,"" according to the report. ""For example, in event ticketing, even absent regulation, consumer outrage at fees has been acknowledged by some vendors who, in turn, have made some effort to clarify why they charge the fees they do."" Of course, the easiest way to end these practices would be to outlaw them. One method of doing that would be to legally require ""all-in"" pricing. There are various versions of this legislation, but in a broad sense the laws would require companies to advertise pricing that reflects exactly what a person will pay. It's easy to see why consumers would want this and some companies would not. Forcing businesses to disclose the final ""all-in"" price may not lower prices, but it would at least allow for a level playing field and a more informed buying public. ","

Mark Hulbert,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 17, 2017 10:20 a.m. ET Low-volatility shares, such as the six listed here, beat the broader market in the long run By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — The two-plus months since Donald Trump’s election has been exciting for stock market investors. Still, they need to be reminded that boredom has its virtues too. That’s because excitement works both ways: The stocks that perform best when the market is rising tend to fall the most when the market heads south. We tend to forget that after the market has mounted an impressive rally. So, with anxiety about the Trump rally stalling, now is an especially good time to remember that low-volatility stocks are the opposite of exciting: Though they lag behind during rallies, they usually beat the market when it’s falling. They therefore hold their own over an entire market cycle, if not come out well ahead. A column on this subject would not have been necessary as recently as this past summer and fall. That’s because low-volatility approaches at that time were riding a crest of popularity; exchange traded funds that employ such approaches were amassing huge sums. No fewer than six such ETFs, for example, each had over $2 billion in assets under management. The period since the election in early November has taken some of the wind out of those ETFs’ sails. Since Nov. 8, the S&P 500 Index

                                   has gained an impressive 6.3% and the Nasdaq Composite 7.3%. The lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500, in contrast, have gained only 2.8%. Read: How I lost money in the Trump rally Yet this market-lagging performance is precisely what history teaches us would happen, as you can see from the accompanying chart. On average during the last three bull markets (as identified by Ned Davis Research), the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has risen 58.9% versus 71.8% for the S&P 500. It’s during bear markets, of course, that low-volatility approaches tend to shine. On average during the past three bear markets, the S&P Low Volatility Index has fallen 15.2%, compared with 29.5% for the S&P 500. Due to the magic of compounding, these smaller losses more than make up for the market-trailing returns during bull markets. Over the past decade, for example, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has beaten the S&P 500 by an annualized margin of 8.5% to 7% (on a dividend-adjusted basis). Beating the market by 1.5 percentage points a year would be reason enough to consider such stocks. But there’s an added bonus as well: They’re also less volatile. That’s very much a winning combination. To pursue a low-volatility stock strategy, however, you must be willing to give up the potential for some upside excitement. With the market at all-time highs, that’s something you should seriously consider. Think of it this way: A low-volatile-stock strategy, in effect, allows you to take some chips off the table without giving up on the stock market as a whole. Probably the easiest way to pursue such a strategy is via an ETF, since it’s important to be well-diversified. The two largest such ETFs are the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 15, 2017 7:49 a.m. ET Overseas blue-chip dividend stocks are better buys now, says Michael Binger of Gradient Investments By Back in May, Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager with Gradient Investments LLC, told MarketWatch about six of his favorite dividend stocks at that time. Binger’s outlook has changed a bit since then, and he thinks dividend stocks as a group are looking pricey. He’s now looking beyond the U.S. for attractively valued dividend stocks. The change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. Here’s how his “Gradient 50” strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by Orion Advisor Services: In this table, “total return” for the “Gradient 50” strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. Binger said his firm’s clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. As cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends. Gradient Investments is a registered investment adviser based in Arden Hills, Minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. The Gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies Binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark S&P 500

                                   by selecting stocks of what they consider “high quality” U.S. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. They will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market. The aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 2.07%, according to FactSet. Gradient generally selects stocks with yields of at least 2.5% for the Gradient 50 strategy, and the portfolio’s dividend yield now is roughly 3.5%. The 50 stocks held within that portfolio are rebalanced each quarter, so each stock tends to amount to about 2% of the assets. This chart shows how high the S&P 500 is trading relative to the past 12 months’ earnings. By this measure, the index hasn’t traded this high since January 2004: Asked if there were alarming signs for stock valuations, Binger replied: “Sure there are. At the current time, I would say the dividend-paying group, as a whole, is subjectively overvalued. If I have a group of 50 dividend paying stocks and the portfolio was up 20% while the market was up 12% [in 2016], what does that tell you?” This is why Binger said it was a “pefect time” for his firm to roll out a new strategy, which it calls the “Gradient 40 International.” The portfolio includes 40 stocks, and Binger said each “needs to be a blue-chip company domiciled outside the U.S.” They also need to be publicly traded in the U.S., or have American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) traded on U.S. exchanges. Rather than shifting the holdings of the domestic G50 strategy, Binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about U.S. stock valuations reduce exposure to the G50 and consider investing in the G40-I, because he believes “global markets are a little bit cheaper than their U.S. counterparts. Binger named 10 stocks held in the new G40-I portfolio. Here they are, sorted by dividend yield: When MarketWatch spoke with Binger in May, he had just sold the G50’s holdings of AT&T Inc.

According to FactSet, the company’s free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $689 million, while dividends on common shares totaled $264 million. That’s a dividend payout ratio of just 38%. “This makes me feel comfortable that the [4.85%] dividend yield isn’t in any danger at all,” Binger said.

But how to find attractive investments? Last year’s “flight to yield” pushed many stock valuations to relatively high levels, making some dividend stocks appear to be risky short-term investments. For long-term growth investors, there are plenty of solid arguments against dividend stocks, including these from Meb Faber. But dividend stocks still appeal to investors who need income now and to those who think it’s only fair for companies to reward their owners with a good portion of the profits.

This left us with 164 stocks. We then excluded any stock trading above the aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio (based on consensus 2018 earnings estimates) for its sector or for the entire S&P 1500, whichever was lower. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and its 11 sectors: That last cut left us with 50 stocks. Here are the 20 with the highest dividend yields, as of the market close on Jan. 9: This group of dividend stocks is certainly not universally loved by Wall Street analysts, as the following summary shows. Then again, the analysts’ ratings are built on one-year price targets, rather than current income and the hope of long-term capital growth to sweeten the pot. Note that while only three of these stocks have “buy” ratings from 50% of the analysts and just one does better than that, only three are expected by analysts to show price declines over the next 12 months. Those expected price decline, however, are small, and shareholders are being paid to wait through the dividends. No method of screening stocks can save you from doing the important research that will help you form an opinion about a company’s likelihood of long-term success with its business strategy. So that’s your next step, hopefully with the help of your broker or investment adviser, if you seen any names you like here.

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:51 a.m. ET Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings values and high rates of earnings growth By In a recent interview, Erick Ormsby, the founder of Alcosta Capital Management, looked ahead by a year and based several stock picks on companies expected to post double-digit earnings growth in 2018. The companies were also trading at relatively low price-to-forward earnings valuations. So we decided to follow up by applying similar criteria to the entire S&P 500 Index 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    SPX, -0.15% It may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. Banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. So long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations. Don’t miss: Twitter must change course, and this tech executive has some tips The method Beginning with the S&P 500, we isolated companies with forward price-to-earnings ratios for 2018 that were lower than the aggregate P/E ratio for their sector or for the entire index, which ever was lower. The P/E ratios were rounded to the nearest tenth. A positive P/E ratio assumes that a company will be profitable in 2018. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and all of its sectors, except the new real estate sector, which S&P Dow Jones Indices carved out of the financial sector in September, and for which an aggregate price-to-earnings ratio isn’t yet available: The energy sector was trading highest to consensus 2018 earnings estimates at the market close Jan.6. This reflects expectations that oil prices will at least remain stable, and analysts’ expectations that 2018 earnings will still be relatively low. But we’ve made a rather severe cut, only listing energy companies that trade at a discount to the entire S&P 500. We then excluded any company whose revenue is not expected by analysts to increase in 2018 from 2017. Also see: If you bought the Trump rumor, now it’s time to sell the news Here are the three remaining companies in each sector expected to post the greatest increase in earnings per share in 2018, except for the telecommunications sector, which is quite small to begin with, and for which only one company made the cut: Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings ratios and high rates of expected EPS growth. But you must consider why those companies may be deemed undervalued by other investors. If you see any names of interest here, do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or financial adviser. Put simply: You need to form an opinion about how likely a company is to succeed with its business strategy over the next five years at least.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P is traversing its range. The 2,277 resistance matches the December peak and the S&P’s all-time closing high, established Jan. 6. Conversely, the 2,263 area matches a near-term floor, and is followed by firmer support around 2,252. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound. Notable resistance matches the range top, technically spanning from 19,987 to 19,999. The Dow’s record close rests slightly lower, at 19,974.62. Separately, consider that last week’s close of 19,885 matched a near-term inflection point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains stronger. The index has rallied to yet another all-time high, punctuating a successful test of support, better illustrated below. From current levels, the 5,464 breakout point pivots to first support. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended the January rally, rising last week from a successful test of the breakout point. Notable support broadly spans from 5,487 to the December peak of 5,512, an area closely matching the ascending 20-day moving average. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has virtually flatlined just under record territory. Consider that last week’s low of 19,770 held just eight points above the 2016 close. This area remains an inflection point, matching support more broadly spanning from 19,718 to 19,770. Separately, the Dow’s tight five-week range is a continuation pattern, currently capped by the 20,000 mark. Similarly, the S&P 500 has maintained first support — the 2,252 area — bottoming last week at 2,254. More broadly, the S&P’s recent backdrop resembles the late-July/August post-Brexit price action. Its formerly overbought posture is working off via time, rather than price. (The S&P has flatlined, without pulling in materially.) As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend is intact. The Nasdaq Composite has notched another all-time high — confirming its uptrend — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials remain range-bound, but firmly within view of record territory. In fact, the S&P mised an all-time closing high last week by less than three points. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, it’s maintained support matching the 2016 close (134.85), surviving a strong-volume retest last week. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains slightly stronger. Consider that the MDY has maintained a posture firmly atop first support, closing last week within striking distance of record territory. Resistance technically spans from 309.09 to 309.59. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500

                                   has also flatlined just under record highs. Recall that last week’s low of 224.96 closely matched first support around the 225 mark. The successful retest, amid the orderly January range, is technically constructive. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained first support at 2,252, bottoming last week two points higher. The rally from support marked a bullish single-day reversal, and was punctuated by last week’s close, missing a record by less than three points. From current levels, the S&P’s all-time closing high rests at 2,276.98 — and remains within view — while the absolute record peak holds at 2,282.10. Both levels were established Jan. 6. The S&P 500’s persistence near the range top signals muted selling pressure, improving the chances of an eventual leg higher. More broadly, significant support spans from 2,190 to 2,214, an area matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,222. The S&P’s intermediate-term backdrop supports a bullish view barring a violation.

                                   remains well positioned. Technically, the shares continue to challenge two inflection points. With Tuesday’s strong start, the shares have gapped atop the breakdown point — the 115 area — though, as always, it’s the close that matters. A close higher would neutralize the November breakdown, more firmly signaling a trend shift. Meanwhile, the GLD’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered another six-month high, improving the chances of incremental follow-through. Tactically, the 50-day offers an area from which to work, and a rally attempt is in play barring a violation. An intermediate-term target matches trendline resistance, and the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Conversely, the U.S. dollar — also detailed last week — has extended its downturn amid gold’s resurgence, and a related safe-haven trade. (As always, gold and the U.S. dollar are inversely correlated.)

A sustained break higher opens the path to major resistance, circa 104.90, an area matching the bottom of the November gap.

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

(TMUS) and Sprint Corporation (S) may be the third- and fourth-place U.S. wireless carriers, but they are chipping away at the dominance AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), and more of that is expected to come in 2017 whether or not the two ending up merging. Pacific Crest Securities, which recently raised its fourth-quarter subscriber numbers for both T-Mobile and Sprint, expects more market-share gains, pointing to recent promotions and a focus on unlimited data plans as ways to grab business from the likes of AT&T and Verizon. “Unlimited data is what consumers desire. It is becoming a differentiating factor, with Verizon the only carrier not offering unlimited data, and AT&T only offering it in limited fashion,” wrote Pacific Crest analysts Michael Bowen and Brandon Nispel said in a research note published by Barron’s. “Consumers are tired of being hit with overages and fees from using their data plan. Our survey has found a sharp increase in the amount of unlimited data customers, which we expect will continue to trend higher.” Recognizing a movement to unlimited and a frustration with fees, T-Mobile announced during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month that it was getting rid of fees and taxes on its unlimited plans, which will eventually force the other carriers to respond. Sprint had its own news during the annual technology confab, announcing it will let customers put more than one number on a single device and is working with cloud-based platform Movius to provide the service. The wireless carrier also announced a promotion last week in which it will give families up to $800 in gift cards when they switch to a unlimited data, talk and text plan. (See also: Sprint Offers $800 Sign-Up Bonus for Certain Plans.) According to the Pacific Crest Securities analysts, in 2017 the big carriers are going to have a tough time gaining or keeping subscribers with Verizon having a better go of it than AT&T. The analysts said there is a chance Verizon will post a slight upside to its estimates for postpaid-phone net additions in the fourth quarter, but it could still be disappointing to investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is projected to lose 330,000 postpaid phones subscribers. “Net losses at AT&T and the struggles at Verizon indicate T-Mobile and Sprint should take share; 2017 brings a new year, but competition will persist,” said the analysts noting that Sprint should see the most gains while T-Mobile will still be “market share taker” during the year.

Leo Sun,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The FCC recently declared that AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) ""sponsored data"" programs -- which exclude their own streaming media from data caps -- violate net neutrality rules. Many streaming companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) believe that practice, also called ""zero rating"", gives telcos an unfair advantage as they expand into the streaming market with their own data-free content. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T lets other companies zero rate their content across its networks for a fee, but the FCC claims that those fees are much higher than the ones it charges its own subsidiary, DirecTV. The FCC also expressed similar concerns about Verizon's comparable FreeBee Data 360 program. Will the FCC actually force AT&T and Verizon to drop its sponsored data strategies, or does all this sound and fury signify nothing? Sponsored data lets AT&T bundle together its wireless and DirecTV platforms. To build the foundation of that ecosystem, AT&T started offering unlimited wireless data plans for DirecTV subscribers. All streaming DirecTV content was then zero rated for AT&T wireless customers, and AT&T launched new streaming platforms like DirecTV Now -- a $35 per month service with 100 channels -- to expand that ecosystem. By zero rating all that content, AT&T enables its customers to watch DirecTV across mobile devices, PCs, and TVs without worrying about data caps. That gives it a distinct advantage against Netflix, which is throttling the quality of its own content and letting users download videos locally to reduce their data usage. This is why AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) for $85 billion last year. By adding HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. movies, and other content to that zero rated ecosystem, AT&T could create a prisoner-taking media ecosystem which widens its moat against Netflix and its competing carriers. But if regulators force AT&T to stop zero rating its own content, its DirecTV platforms could become less competitive, and the Time Warner buyout would become much less appealing. Like AT&T, Verizon is building a zero rated ecosystem for selling advertisements and streaming videos. That's why it acquired AOL in 2015, which it plans to merge with Yahoo's internet business if that long-delayed deal finally closes. Verizon has integrated video content from those companies into go90, a mobile video app it launched in late 2015. It subsequently zero rated that app for its wireless subscribers to counter AT&T's DirecTV push. Verizon also started offering data-free streaming of NFL games through the NFL Mobile app. To address criticisms about those apps violating net neutrality, Verizon launched the FreeBee Data 360 program, which let other companies pay to zero rate their own content across its networks. The FCC's ruling is a harsh condemnation of AT&T and Verizon's sponsored data strategies, but it probably won't mean much in the long run. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will be replaced on Jan. 20, and his likely successor, Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai, said that the report ""does not reflect the views of the majority of Commissioners."" Pai also claimed that such ""midnight regulations"" were ""sad"". AT&T and Verizon have both repeatedly defended their sponsored data programs as consumer-friendly ones that let subscribers watch video without racking up data fees. However, both telcos clearly depend on these plans to expand their ecosystems, squeeze out more revenue per user (via ads or add-on services), and offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless subscribers. The FCC report probably won't lead to any regulatory actions against AT&T and Verizon, but it reveals how heavily both companies are leveraging their dominance of wireless networks to build content-rich digital ecosystems. That strategy could help them counter streaming rivals like Netflix, which have piggybacked off their networks while convincing customers to drop their traditional pay TV services. But it could also corral consumers within telco-controlled streaming ecosystems -- an anti-competitive move which could be tough for Netflix (which lacks the ISP infrastructure) to retaliate.

Adam Levy,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image Source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) management expects 2017 to be another year of solid revenue growth for the third-place carrier. ""We're looking at another year of very significant value creation,"" CFO Braxton Carter said at a recent investors conference hosted by Citi. Carter expects T-Mobile's service revenue -- the money customers pay for their plans -- to grow in the double digits, yet again, in 2017, which will ultimately translate into a sustainable ramp up in cash flow. Meanwhile, T-Mobile's competitors have seen service revenue decline. AT&T's (NYSE:T) service revenue declined 0.9% in the third quarter, Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) fell 5.2%, and Sprint's (NYSE:S) fell 6.8%. Comparatively, T-Mobile increased service revenue 13.2% in the third quarter. Here are five reasons why T-Mobile expects that trend to continue. The easiest way to increase service revenue is to bring on more subscribers. Over the past few years, no wireless carrier has done a better job than T-Mobile. In 2016, T-Mobile added 8.2 million total customers, 3.3 million of which are the extremely high-value postpaid phone subscribers. In fact, T-Mobile boasts that it captured over 100% of the postpaid phone net additions across the industry in both 2016 and 2015. (Other carriers -- specifically AT&T -- lost postpaid phone subscribers during those years.) There's no indication that the trend is slowing in 2017. If anything, T-Mobile stands to gain from the expiration of Sprint's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion for its earliest sign-ups. CEO John Legere has already noted an increase in switchers from Sprint to T-Mobile in the fourth quarter. AT&T and Verizon's split focus on wireless and media ensures T-Mobile will be able to fill in more pain points and continue funneling customers away from the larger carriers. T-Mobile's most recent Un-Carrier move, announced at CES earlier this month, is to include taxes and fees in its pricing. It's also doing away with its Simple Choice plans with data buckets, and only offering its unlimited data T-Mobile One plan. Carter believes the latest move, dubbed All In, ""will set the stage for very nice front-end growth"" in 2017. T-Mobile is betting on a simple pricing structure to front-load its subscriber growth in 2017. If Carter is correct, it would result in sustained service-revenue growth throughout the year. The other benefit of getting rid of Simple Choice plans is that customers will be forced to choose T-Mobile's more expensive plan. During the third quarter, when T-Mobile introduced its T-Mobile One plan, it saw a 2.2% sequential increase in average revenue per postpaid phone subscriber. And Carter points out the new service plan was only available for one month that quarter. While including taxes and fees in its new pricing seems like it could be a price cut, T-Mobile has also done away with its $5 per-line autopay discount. Effectively, it's replacing one pricing promotion with another. As a result, the new All In promotion shouldn't impact average revenue per user (ARPU) on T-Mobile One accounts very much. T-Mobile currently has the lowest ARPU in the industry for postpaid phone subscribers, as seen in the table below. Wireless Carrier Postpaid Phone ARPU Q3 2016 AT&T $59.64 Sprint $58.03 Verizon $47.52* T-Mobile $48.15 *Includes lower-value connections like tablets and IoT devices.Source: Company earnings reports. There's clearly room for T-Mobile to increase its ARPU, but it's also been able to put pressure on its competitors' ARPU. The result is a growing T-Mobile customer base that's also paying more per month, on average. T-Mobile dramatically improved its network coverage in 2016, but its retail footprint hasn't quite caught up with its network. Carter says the company plans to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores by mid-2017. Since T-Mobile's marketing campaigns are all done on a nationwide scale, it already has strong brand recognition in those areas, which generally have lower competition. Carter estimates the additional stores will reach 30 million to 40 million potential customers, which could add meaningful growth to its subscriber base. When it comes to grabbing share of the enterprise market, Verizon and AT&T are dominant forces. Carter says, ""We still index very low on B2B [business to business]."" T-Mobile has taken less than 5% of the marketplace. AT&T counts 50 million postpaid connections in its Business Solutions segment. In fact, AT&T's business customers outnumber its retail wireless customers. While business customers are harder to convert than retail customers due to the need to convert so many people at once, T-Mobile is much better positioned to win these valuable contracts than just two years ago. It may be a slow process, but investors should look for enterprise customers to add meaningfully to service revenue in 2017 and beyond. Overall, T-Mobile is poised for another strong year of service-revenue growth as its competitors struggle to tread water. ","

"Jason Hall, George Budwell, Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Steve Symington",01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","

Good luck finding a Pixel XL or one with more storage. Image source: Google. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages. That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around, we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report. While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course. The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge: We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis. Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders. The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels. How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product. ","

Daniel B. Kline,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A new report (link open PDF) released by the National Economic Council (NEC), a board created in 1993 to advise the president on domestic and global economic policy, shows that declining competition in some markets has led to rising pricing in the form of hidden fees for American consumers. The NEC noted that competition not only keeps prices down, it also forces companies to innovate and can push wages higher. In its December report, though, the agency found several indicators of declining competition in the United States. These include ""increasing levels of industry concentration, increasing returns to capital accruing to a few firms, lower levels of firm entry, and decreased labor market mobility."" It's a situation where more money has become concentrated in the biggest companies. That creates a market where consumers often pay the price. In many situations, according to NEC, this involves ""hidden"" or ""muddy"" prices, situations where the advertised cost does not equal what a person actually pays. Image source: Getty Images. A hidden fee is not an add-on for an extra service, but a mandatory charge that people must pay in order to use whatever they are buying. For example, both AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) charge ""line access fees"" on top of their advertised prices. Since consumers can't use their phones or data plans without paying this fee, it's not really an extra charge, but part of the basic price. ""In many industries, businesses use so-called 'hidden fees' -- the addition of a mandatory or quasi-mandatory fee to the advertised price of a good or service ... to effectively raise the final price,"" NEC wrote. ""At their worst, such fees can be fraudulent or deceptive; at a minimum, they make prices unclear, hinder effective consumer decision making, and dull the competitive process."" The NEC report listed a number of hidden fees that consumers routinely pay. In some cases, like the AT&T and Verizon example above, these fees have become so ingrained in various industries that people no longer even question them. The worst offenders, according to the report, include: Not appearing in the report is the cable and broadband industries, where most major players add ""broadcast fees,"" and ""sports fees"" to their advertised prices and on the internet side charge rental fees for needed equipment. In all these cases, what's consistent is that consumers have no choice but to pay a cost that's more than what they expected based on advertised prices. In addition to potential regulatory solutions, and new competition forcing companies to abandon deceptive pricing, the NEC said that customers can force an end to these practices. ""Consumers and consumer groups play a crucial role in moderating fees,"" according to the report. ""For example, in event ticketing, even absent regulation, consumer outrage at fees has been acknowledged by some vendors who, in turn, have made some effort to clarify why they charge the fees they do."" Of course, the easiest way to end these practices would be to outlaw them. One method of doing that would be to legally require ""all-in"" pricing. There are various versions of this legislation, but in a broad sense the laws would require companies to advertise pricing that reflects exactly what a person will pay. It's easy to see why consumers would want this and some companies would not. Forcing businesses to disclose the final ""all-in"" price may not lower prices, but it would at least allow for a level playing field and a more informed buying public. ","

Mark Hulbert,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 17, 2017 10:20 a.m. ET Low-volatility shares, such as the six listed here, beat the broader market in the long run By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — The two-plus months since Donald Trump’s election has been exciting for stock market investors. Still, they need to be reminded that boredom has its virtues too. That’s because excitement works both ways: The stocks that perform best when the market is rising tend to fall the most when the market heads south. We tend to forget that after the market has mounted an impressive rally. So, with anxiety about the Trump rally stalling, now is an especially good time to remember that low-volatility stocks are the opposite of exciting: Though they lag behind during rallies, they usually beat the market when it’s falling. They therefore hold their own over an entire market cycle, if not come out well ahead. A column on this subject would not have been necessary as recently as this past summer and fall. That’s because low-volatility approaches at that time were riding a crest of popularity; exchange traded funds that employ such approaches were amassing huge sums. No fewer than six such ETFs, for example, each had over $2 billion in assets under management. The period since the election in early November has taken some of the wind out of those ETFs’ sails. Since Nov. 8, the S&P 500 Index

                                   has gained an impressive 6.3% and the Nasdaq Composite 7.3%. The lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500, in contrast, have gained only 2.8%. Read: How I lost money in the Trump rally Yet this market-lagging performance is precisely what history teaches us would happen, as you can see from the accompanying chart. On average during the last three bull markets (as identified by Ned Davis Research), the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has risen 58.9% versus 71.8% for the S&P 500. It’s during bear markets, of course, that low-volatility approaches tend to shine. On average during the past three bear markets, the S&P Low Volatility Index has fallen 15.2%, compared with 29.5% for the S&P 500. Due to the magic of compounding, these smaller losses more than make up for the market-trailing returns during bull markets. Over the past decade, for example, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has beaten the S&P 500 by an annualized margin of 8.5% to 7% (on a dividend-adjusted basis). Beating the market by 1.5 percentage points a year would be reason enough to consider such stocks. But there’s an added bonus as well: They’re also less volatile. That’s very much a winning combination. To pursue a low-volatility stock strategy, however, you must be willing to give up the potential for some upside excitement. With the market at all-time highs, that’s something you should seriously consider. Think of it this way: A low-volatile-stock strategy, in effect, allows you to take some chips off the table without giving up on the stock market as a whole. Probably the easiest way to pursue such a strategy is via an ETF, since it’s important to be well-diversified. The two largest such ETFs are the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 15, 2017 7:49 a.m. ET Overseas blue-chip dividend stocks are better buys now, says Michael Binger of Gradient Investments By Back in May, Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager with Gradient Investments LLC, told MarketWatch about six of his favorite dividend stocks at that time. Binger’s outlook has changed a bit since then, and he thinks dividend stocks as a group are looking pricey. He’s now looking beyond the U.S. for attractively valued dividend stocks. The change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. Here’s how his “Gradient 50” strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by Orion Advisor Services: In this table, “total return” for the “Gradient 50” strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. Binger said his firm’s clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. As cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends. Gradient Investments is a registered investment adviser based in Arden Hills, Minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. The Gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies Binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark S&P 500

                                   by selecting stocks of what they consider “high quality” U.S. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. They will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market. The aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 2.07%, according to FactSet. Gradient generally selects stocks with yields of at least 2.5% for the Gradient 50 strategy, and the portfolio’s dividend yield now is roughly 3.5%. The 50 stocks held within that portfolio are rebalanced each quarter, so each stock tends to amount to about 2% of the assets. This chart shows how high the S&P 500 is trading relative to the past 12 months’ earnings. By this measure, the index hasn’t traded this high since January 2004: Asked if there were alarming signs for stock valuations, Binger replied: “Sure there are. At the current time, I would say the dividend-paying group, as a whole, is subjectively overvalued. If I have a group of 50 dividend paying stocks and the portfolio was up 20% while the market was up 12% [in 2016], what does that tell you?” This is why Binger said it was a “pefect time” for his firm to roll out a new strategy, which it calls the “Gradient 40 International.” The portfolio includes 40 stocks, and Binger said each “needs to be a blue-chip company domiciled outside the U.S.” They also need to be publicly traded in the U.S., or have American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) traded on U.S. exchanges. Rather than shifting the holdings of the domestic G50 strategy, Binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about U.S. stock valuations reduce exposure to the G50 and consider investing in the G40-I, because he believes “global markets are a little bit cheaper than their U.S. counterparts. Binger named 10 stocks held in the new G40-I portfolio. Here they are, sorted by dividend yield: When MarketWatch spoke with Binger in May, he had just sold the G50’s holdings of AT&T Inc.

According to FactSet, the company’s free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $689 million, while dividends on common shares totaled $264 million. That’s a dividend payout ratio of just 38%. “This makes me feel comfortable that the [4.85%] dividend yield isn’t in any danger at all,” Binger said.

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:50 a.m. ET A deep dive yields generous income-producing stocks coupled with some downside protection By Income-hungry investors continue to flock to stocks over bonds, where yields, while rising, remain relatively low. But how to find attractive investments? Last year’s “flight to yield” pushed many stock valuations to relatively high levels, making some dividend stocks appear to be risky short-term investments. For long-term growth investors, there are plenty of solid arguments against dividend stocks, including these from Meb Faber. But dividend stocks still appeal to investors who need income now and to those who think it’s only fair for companies to reward their owners with a good portion of the profits. And if a high dividend-payer’s sales and profits are also increasing, so much the better.

We then excluded any stock trading above the aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio (based on consensus 2018 earnings estimates) for its sector or for the entire S&P 1500, whichever was lower. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and its 11 sectors: That last cut left us with 50 stocks. Here are the 20 with the highest dividend yields, as of the market close on Jan. 9: This group of dividend stocks is certainly not universally loved by Wall Street analysts, as the following summary shows. Then again, the analysts’ ratings are built on one-year price targets, rather than current income and the hope of long-term capital growth to sweeten the pot. Note that while only three of these stocks have “buy” ratings from 50% of the analysts and just one does better than that, only three are expected by analysts to show price declines over the next 12 months. Those expected price decline, however, are small, and shareholders are being paid to wait through the dividends. No method of screening stocks can save you from doing the important research that will help you form an opinion about a company’s likelihood of long-term success with its business strategy. So that’s your next step, hopefully with the help of your broker or investment adviser, if you seen any names you like here.

So we decided to follow up by applying similar criteria to the entire S&P 500 Index 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    SPX, -0.15% It may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. Banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. So long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations. Don’t miss: Twitter must change course, and this tech executive has some tips The method Beginning with the S&P 500, we isolated companies with forward price-to-earnings ratios for 2018 that were lower than the aggregate P/E ratio for their sector or for the entire index, which ever was lower. The P/E ratios were rounded to the nearest tenth. A positive P/E ratio assumes that a company will be profitable in 2018. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and all of its sectors, except the new real estate sector, which S&P Dow Jones Indices carved out of the financial sector in September, and for which an aggregate price-to-earnings ratio isn’t yet available: The energy sector was trading highest to consensus 2018 earnings estimates at the market close Jan.6. This reflects expectations that oil prices will at least remain stable, and analysts’ expectations that 2018 earnings will still be relatively low. But we’ve made a rather severe cut, only listing energy companies that trade at a discount to the entire S&P 500. We then excluded any company whose revenue is not expected by analysts to increase in 2018 from 2017. Also see: If you bought the Trump rumor, now it’s time to sell the news Here are the three remaining companies in each sector expected to post the greatest increase in earnings per share in 2018, except for the telecommunications sector, which is quite small to begin with, and for which only one company made the cut: Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings ratios and high rates of expected EPS growth. But you must consider why those companies may be deemed undervalued by other investors. If you see any names of interest here, do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or financial adviser. Put simply: You need to form an opinion about how likely a company is to succeed with its business strategy over the next five years at least.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P is traversing its range. The 2,277 resistance matches the December peak and the S&P’s all-time closing high, established Jan. 6. Conversely, the 2,263 area matches a near-term floor, and is followed by firmer support around 2,252. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound. Notable resistance matches the range top, technically spanning from 19,987 to 19,999. The Dow’s record close rests slightly lower, at 19,974.62. Separately, consider that last week’s close of 19,885 matched a near-term inflection point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains stronger. The index has rallied to yet another all-time high, punctuating a successful test of support, better illustrated below. From current levels, the 5,464 breakout point pivots to first support. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended the January rally, rising last week from a successful test of the breakout point. Notable support broadly spans from 5,487 to the December peak of 5,512, an area closely matching the ascending 20-day moving average. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has virtually flatlined just under record territory. Consider that last week’s low of 19,770 held just eight points above the 2016 close. This area remains an inflection point, matching support more broadly spanning from 19,718 to 19,770. Separately, the Dow’s tight five-week range is a continuation pattern, currently capped by the 20,000 mark. Similarly, the S&P 500 has maintained first support — the 2,252 area — bottoming last week at 2,254. More broadly, the S&P’s recent backdrop resembles the late-July/August post-Brexit price action. Its formerly overbought posture is working off via time, rather than price. (The S&P has flatlined, without pulling in materially.) As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend is intact. The Nasdaq Composite has notched another all-time high — confirming its uptrend — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials remain range-bound, but firmly within view of record territory. In fact, the S&P mised an all-time closing high last week by less than three points. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, it’s maintained support matching the 2016 close (134.85), surviving a strong-volume retest last week. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains slightly stronger. Consider that the MDY has maintained a posture firmly atop first support, closing last week within striking distance of record territory. Resistance technically spans from 309.09 to 309.59.

                                   has also flatlined just under record highs. Recall that last week’s low of 224.96 closely matched first support around the 225 mark. The successful retest, amid the orderly January range, is technically constructive. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained first support at 2,252, bottoming last week two points higher. The rally from support marked a bullish single-day reversal, and was punctuated by last week’s close, missing a record by less than three points. From current levels, the S&P’s all-time closing high rests at 2,276.98 — and remains within view — while the absolute record peak holds at 2,282.10. Both levels were established Jan. 6. The S&P 500’s persistence near the range top signals muted selling pressure, improving the chances of an eventual leg higher. More broadly, significant support spans from 2,190 to 2,214, an area matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,222. The S&P’s intermediate-term backdrop supports a bullish view barring a violation.

                                   remains well positioned. Technically, the shares continue to challenge two inflection points. With Tuesday’s strong start, the shares have gapped atop the breakdown point — the 115 area — though, as always, it’s the close that matters. A close higher would neutralize the November breakdown, more firmly signaling a trend shift. Meanwhile, the GLD’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered another six-month high, improving the chances of incremental follow-through. Tactically, the 50-day offers an area from which to work, and a rally attempt is in play barring a violation. An intermediate-term target matches trendline resistance, and the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Conversely, the U.S. dollar — also detailed last week — has extended its downturn amid gold’s resurgence, and a related safe-haven trade.

,02092017,Reuters,02022017,"The Appellate Division, First Department in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in rejecting a class-action settlement requiring Verizon to disclose more information to shareholders who thought it overpaid, and get a “fairness opinion” if it sold some of the venture’s assets. It also entitled the shareholders’ lawyers to up to $2 million for fees and expenses. “Disclosure-only” settlements have lost favor in recent years, with critics saying they provide little benefit to shareholders and companies, while forcing companies to pay fees of shareholders’ lawyers in a so-called “merger tax.” Judges in Delaware courts routinely approved such settlements for many years but have in recent decisions made clear those days are over, causing lawyers to file dozens of merger-related lawsuits in other courts instead. The Verizon settlement drew objections from two shareholders, and was rejected in December 2014 by New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer. He said the accord failed to materially boost shareholder knowledge about the merger, which had closed in February 2014, and could impede the New York-based phone company’s ability to sell assets. But in Thursday’s decision, a four-judge appellate division panel said the added disclosures provided at least “some benefit” to shareholders, while the fairness opinion requirement could help insure good prices for asset sales. The panel also tightened its nearly 27-year-old test for approving such settlements, adding requirements that they be in shareholders’ and companies’ best interests. It said the Verizon settlement achieved both. “Given the changing circumstances and concerns surrounding nonmonetary settlements of class actions,” the Verizon case offered an opportunity “to address present day concerns,” Justice Marcy Kahn wrote. The appellate division returned the case to the lower court to determine legal fees. “We are pleased,” Juan Monteverde, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email. “Litigation that provides enhanced corporate disclosures and corporate governance will continue to play a vital role in protecting public shareholders.” A lawyer for one of the objecting shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The other objector, Gerald Walpin, a former inspector general under President George W. Bush, died last year. The case is Gordon et al v.

,02092017,Reuters,02022017,"Under the Obama administration, the Federal Communications Commission had sent letters raising concerns about whether some data practices by AT&T and Verizon violated net neutrality rules. The FCC had also sent letters to Comcast about its “Stream TV” service and to T-Mobile about its “Binge On” service in 2015. Millions of mobile phone users benefit from free data video services but critics warn that the practice may prod users into avoiding competitors’ services. Net neutrality rules imposed by the FCC in 2015 require broadband providers to treat all data equally and bar service providers from slowing consumer access to web content. Tom Wheeler, who was FCC chairman until Jan. 20, told Reuters last month that its investigation found some free data practices were abusive and anticompetitive. But in an about-face on Friday, the regulator now under Republican control said it was closing its investigation. “These free-data plans have proven to be popular among consumers, particularly low-income Americans, and have enhanced competition in the wireless marketplace,” new FCC chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. Sponsored or zero-rated free data programs allow mobile phone users free data if they use certain video services. AT&T phone subscribers can watch DirecTV, which is owned by the company, on their phones without incurring data charges. Verizon also offers mobile phone subscribers some sponsored “go90” video content that does not count against data caps. In a Jan. 11 report, the FCC’s wireless bureau said Binge On did not violate net neutrality rules, but it found concerns with AT&T and Verizon’s data programs. Pai voted against the net neutrality rules and said last month he thought the regulation’s “days are numbered.” “It is clear that net neutrality is public enemy number one for Chairman Pai,” Democratic U.S. Senator Edward Markey said on Friday. “He is starting his campaign by protecting harmful zero-rating plans.” Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the company has always believed its free data programs benefit customers. Joan Marsh, an AT&T’s senior vice president said the decision was a “win for the millions of consumers who are reaping the benefits of services made available through free data programs.” Comcast declined to comment, but has said its “Stream TV” is an IP-based cable service that is not covered by net neutrality rules.

,02092017,Reuters,02022017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Vector Capital said on Wednesday it raised a $1.4 billion private equity fund, giving the U.S. buyout firm more firepower to pursue acquisitions in the technology sector as it faces increasing competition from rival investment firms. The new fund comes as Vector vies for deals against bigger technology-focused private equity firms such as Vista Equity Partners Management LLC and Thoma Bravo LLC, while also competing with smaller peers such as Francisco Partners, Marlin Equity Partners and Siris Capital Group LLC. Vector’s fifth fund was oversubscribed by $200 million, and is the largest to date for the San Francisco-based firm, which was spun off from Ziff Brothers Investments in 1997. Vector’s previous fund, Vector Capital IV, was raised in 2007 and amassed $1.2 billon. It had a net internal rate of return of 14.4 percent and delivered a multiple on investment of 1.7 times as of the end of June, according to the most recent data available from one of its investors, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). By comparison, CalPERS’ private equity program delivered a net internal rate of return of 10.6 percent since inception to the end of June. Alex Slusky, Vector’s founder and chief investment officer, said that Vector differentiates itself by investing in turnarounds that other buyout firms avoid. “We focus on more complex projects that other private equity firms will not undertake,” Slusky said. “Investing in a contrarian manner gives us the opportunity to buy companies well below their intrinsic value.” Last month, Vector lobbed a non-binding joint bid with private equity firm Clearlake Capital Group for Tangoe Inc TNGO.O, an expense management firm company with a market capitalization of $265 million that is facing delisting from the Nasdaq over accounting issues. With its new fund, Vector will look to invest between $75 million to $150 million of equity in each deal, a slightly larger amount than its last fund. It may also invest through its smaller credit business. Vector will target companies valued between $100 million and $2 billion, including debt, in North America, Europe and Israel. Vector still has some capital to invest from its last fund before it starts deploying its new fund, Slusky said. ","

The fee, known as the “Broadcast TV Fee” can be anywhere from $3 to $6 a month and, according to Motley Fool, cable operators pass on the fees they have to pay local channels to rebroadcast their signals. Customers of both Charter and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) can’t waive or decline the fee even if they get rid of local channels, noted the report. Charter has started passing that fee on to new customers it acquired via the two cable system buys, with some customers in Massachusetts receiving notices that they have to pay the broadcast fee. MassLive.com reported customers were informed they would have to pay a $4.47 a month local broadcast TV surcharge starting in February. For Charter, news of new fees isn’t likely to sit well with consumers who are increasingly balking at increased fees and are looking for ways to cut the cord from their set-top boxes and satellite dishes. It doesn’t help that Charter and Comcast are among the most hated companies in America, according to 24/7 Wall St.’s annual rankings. Holding the rank of 12th-most hated company in America, 24/7 Wall Street said Charter scored below average in customer service for both the fixed-line telephone industry and the internet provider market, owning one of the poorest customer-service reputations in the subscription-television service industry. It doesn’t help that Comcast acquired Time Warner Cable, another outfit with a bad customer-service reputation, adding to its woes. (See also: Comcast, Sprint, DISH, Charter on Most-Hated List.) Meanwhile, in December the Consumer Federal of America came out with a scathing report in which it argued that Charter, Comcast, AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) operate as a “tight oligopoly on steroids,” in which they can get away with overcharging customers to the tune of $60 billion per year. Mark Cooper, CFA’s director of research and the author of the report, said a typical household with two wireless subscriptions, a landline, broadband service and multichannel video, will face a total overcharge of about $45 per month, or $540 per year. All together, the overcharges come to almost $60 billion per year, he said. ",Charter Passing on Broadcast Fee to New Customers | Investopedia
Donna Fuscaldo,02092017,Investopedia,02022017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) may be a darling of Wall Street, with the consensus rating standing at buy, but Morningstar thinks investors should hold off. While Morningstar, which has a two-star rating on the nation’s top cable operator, applauded Comcast’s ability to offer multiple services over one connection and said Comcast continues to steal market share from the likes of phone companies, all of that good news is priced into the stock, with analyst Neil Macker calling shares overvalued. Since the start of the year, shares of Comcast have gained close to 8%, and it’s up more than 36% from its 52-week low of $54.70. Recently, shares were inching down 0.04% or $0.03 to $74.83. Morningstar did note that Comcast remains well positioned competitively but that the cable business isn’t expected to see rapid growth, an assessment that hurt the stock. Although shares of Comcast have been climbing over the past few months, there are competitive threats coming from the likes of AT&T Inc. (T) and DISH Networks Corp. (DISH) with their over-the-top streaming video services. AT&T’s DirecTV Now already has more than 200,000 customers, and DISH’s Sling TV has been a revenue booster for the satellite provider. Comcast is getting in to the over-the-top market but has yet to roll out a service. It has announced it’s getting into the wireless market and recently inked deals with Netflix and Roku to remain competitive at a time when consumers are increasingly cutting the cord on their cable boxes and satellite dishes. Earlier this month Comcast announced the Xfinity TV app for Roku, which gives Xfinity TV customers access to all of their Comcast content on Roku devices. In a blog post announcing the beta test, Comcast said the Xfinity TV beta app enables customers to use the beta Roku channel while Comcast continues to test and improve its performance. Comcast said initially the Xfinity TV beta app will be available on Roku TV models and all Roku players released in the last couple of years. (See also: Comcast Releases Beta of Xfinity TV App for Roku.) At the same time that Comcast is seeing increased competition from alternative services, it does have an ally on the regulatory front. President Donald Trump has put in place a lot of M&A-friendly people to run some federal regulatory bodies, including the Federal Communications Commission. Ajit Pai, the new FCC chairman, is a staunch critic of net neutrality and recently held back from taking action against AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) for not counting customer’s data allotment when streaming their own content under a practice called sponsored data. Former FCC chief Tom Wheeler had slammed both telecom companies for the practice, which he alleged violated net neutrality. ",Morningstar: Comcast Overvalued at Current Levels | Investopedia

It's a sign the media conglomerate has failed in efforts to find his replacement since Tom Staggs left last year. Clinging to power, though, can get messy. Executives within Disney are betting that Iger, who has run the company for 12 years and turns 66 on Friday, will have to stick around longer, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. By all accounts, Iger is a worthy boss. Since he took over in 2005, Disney's market value rose from $46 billion to about $148 billion at the end of its fiscal 2016 year. Total shareholder return over the same period increased 350 percent, Disney said in its proxy. Beyond the numbers, Iger has boosted the company in other ways by making savvy acquisitions such as the $4 billion deal for ""Star Wars"" studio Lucasfilm. And no company is better at cross-promoting its products: Princess Elsa costumes from the animated hit ""Frozen"" are a big hit with toddlers, for example.

Andrew Tonner,02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Though cash is king in business and investing, successful publicly traded companies also tend to be highly profitable on an accounting basis as well. Where there's one, you often find the other. Here's a quick overview of two large-cap stocks that are set to see their profits rise meaningfully in the year ahead: Company Name Market Capitalization Estimated Annual EPS Growth The Kraft Heinz Company $106.9 billion 50.6% T-Mobile US $49.4 billion 64.1% Data source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. Of course, profit growth is only one facet of the investment narrative for Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). To get a better sense of whether these names deserve further research on your part, let's examine each company in greater detail. The future looks bright, in 2017 and beyond, for the $137 billion love child resulting from the 2015 merger of consumer-staples giants Kraft and Heinz. The company figures to be an earnings growth powerhouse in the years to come, as it continues to realize its merger-related synergies. In fact, the company reaffirmed its plans to shave $1.5 billion in costs from its business model  by the end of 2017, according to its most recent earnings release. This kind behavior is typical of the culture at the new Kraft Heinz, in which Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and the Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital both own large minority stakes. A favorite saying of 3G co-founder and billionaire  Carlos Sicupira is that ""costs are like fingernails; you have to cut them constantly."" This dedication makes Kraft Heinz a safe bet to continue to compound its earnings growth and dividend payments over the long term. Management's dedication to continued cost savings should indeed come as a relief amid a tepid outlook for revenue growth. Sales are projected to decline 0.6% this year and only increase a mere 1.6% next year. In terms of its valuation, the company trades at 22.7 times its consensus 2017 earnings estimates. Taking into account its 2.7% dividend, its focus on long-term earnings growth, and its reasonable valuation, Kraft Heinz presents an intriguing opportunity for investors in the consumer-staples space today. The fastest-growing company among major U.S. telecoms, T-Mobile has kept proving doubters wrong in recent years. Branding itself as the customer-centric foil to larger incumbents AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile has gained market share in 14 consecutive quarters and delivered some impressive earnings growth in the process. Thanks to its continued execution, T-Mobile's revenue increased 18%, net income rose 165%, and earnings per share climbed 180% in its most recent quarter.  More encouraging still, the company appears poised to build off this momentum in the year ahead. The average of sell-side analysts currently rates T-Mobile stock as a buy, calling for sales to expand 15.1% in 2017 and a further 9.4% in 2018. Despite all its successes, though, it's important to note that T-Mobile and Sprint face important size disadvantages against their better-heeled rivals. AT&T and Verizon enjoy customer bases roughly twice the size of T-Mobile and Sprint. The annuity-like nature of the telecom market allows AT&T and Verizon to generate significantly higher cash flows, which in turn enables them to more easily invest in future growth initiatives. For example, Verizon has spent nearly $10 billion to acquire mobile content and advertising businesses in AOL and Yahoo! What's more, recent rumors of a discussed merger with Charter Communications implies that Verizon might continue to aggressively engage in M&A to shore up its future competitive positioning. AT&T has already done just that by agreeing to buy Time Warner, which should help the company lead the continuing shift in content consumption flowing through mobile devices. Competing against these offerings will be a tall order for T-Mobile. However, the company has repeatedly proved itself to be the most entrepreneurial player in the U.S. telecom market, which is arguably entering an entirely new era -- one in which it isn't clear whether T-Mobile will be able to as easily fuel its growth by prying away customers from AT&T and Verizon in the medium term. As its sizable earnings growth this year signals, though, betting against T-Mobile tends to be a losing proposition as well. ","
      
    2 Stocks Projected to Grow Profits the Most in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

  "
Brian Feroldi,02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Every investor dreams of getting in on the next great growth stock. However, it can be quite difficult to invest in companies that promise extreme growth rates because they are often bid up to premium valuations that can make them quite risky to own. Still, fast growth can often flame out. Regardless, it can be worthwhile to build a watchlist of potential multi-baggers. To help you do just that, I ran a screen to identify companies with the following characteristics: Of the companies identified by the screen, three stood out to me as poised for exceptional growth: Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM). Are any of them worth buying today? Read on to learn more about these companies so you can make that call for yourself. Image source: Getty Images. Payroll is a boring but mission-critical task for every business. The market for this service is mature and extremely competitive, but Paycom Software has been rapidly rising up in this industry since its founding in 1998. What makes Paycom's product offering stand apart from more established competitors? First, Paycom's platform is provided exclusively through the cloud. That makes it easy to implement and access from anywhere. Second, Paycom offers far more than just simple payroll processing solutions. The company's platform is an all-in-one human capital management software solution that assists with many other HR tasks such as time management, performance reviews, recruiting, training, and more. This unique combination is helping Paycom grow like wildfire. Revenue has grown by more than 40% annually over the past five years, which has allowed the company's bottom line to swell. Better yet, 98% of the company's revenue is recurring, which gives the company a predictable base to grow from. Image source: Getty Images. The only knock against Paycom is that Wall Street is aware of the company's potential and has priced its stock accordingly. Trading for nearly 65 times trailing earnings, Paycom stock is far from cheap, so if the company's growth engine stalls, shareholders could be in for a world of pain. Still, fast-growing stocks that are already profitable don't come along every day, so I think this is one growth stock worth paying up to own. The U.S. wireless market is mature and dominated by AT&T and Verizon, so you'd be forgiven for assuming that there isn't any room for anyone else to grow. I thought so, too, which is why I was surprised to learn that T-Mobile showed up on my screen. If you live in the U.S., then you are likely familiar with T-Mobile's ""Un-carrier"" messaging. The company has been calling out other wireless carriers for using hidden fees and charges to jack up their customers' bills. By contrast, T-Mobile promises customers great service, unlimited access to data, and transparent pricing terms that are free of hidden costs. Image source: T-Mobile. This simple messaging is clearly resonating with consumers -- T-Mobile has been steadily taking market share away from incumbent carriers for years. In fact, the company has gained over 1 million customers each quarter for more than three years running. Looking ahead, T-Mobile has announced plans to expand its footprint by opening 1,000 new stores and making a bigger push into the business market. CEO John Legere is so confident that these moves will drive new customer growth that he recently made the bold statement that he expects to overtake AT&T in total phone customers in five years' time. If that prediction comes true, T-Mobile's investors look poised to reap substantial rewards from here. Each year, Americans spend more than $176 billion treating diabetes, which is a chronic disease that affects more than 29 million Americans. Sadly, both of these figures continue to climb higher with each passing year. Diabetes is a burdensome disease that requires patients to measure their blood sugar by pricking their finger on a daily basis. To help ease this burden, Dexcom launched a small medical device that is worn on the body and constantly measures blood glucose levels. Not only is this device far more consumer-friendly than traditional glucose monitors, it also allows patients to track their blood sugar in real time. Patients and providers around the world have been flocking to Dexcom's solution for years, which has caused the company's revenue to soar: DXCM Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Amazingly, these extreme growth rates have been achieved without reimbursement access from Medicare. Thankfully, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently announced that it was changing its policy and will begin offering coverage for Dexcom's G5 Mobile system. That's big news that promises to open up a massive new group of patients to Dexcom's system. Like Paycom, the markets have caught on to Dexcom's growth potential and have awarded it a crazy valuation. Still, diabetes isn't going away anytime soon, and Dexcom looks well-positioned for fast growth ahead. Time could prove that paying up to own this company's stock is well worth it. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's no big secret that dividend-paying stocks tend to do better over the long run than their non-dividend counterparts, and also tend to perform better during tough economic times. If you're not comfortable picking individual stocks, as many investors aren't, there are some great ETFs available that can make dividend stocks a part of your portfolio. Two of the biggest dividend stock ETFs are the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) and the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:SDY). Here's a little about each, and which could be the best buy for you. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which includes 412 stocks that pay higher-than-average dividend yields, specifically excluding REITs. The fund's current dividend yield is 2.9% as of this writing, and here's a look at its 10 largest holdings: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets Microsoft 2.45% 5.1% ExxonMobil 3.59% 4.1% Johnson & Johnson 2.82% 3.5% JPMorgan Chase 2.20% 3.4% General Electric 3.23% 3.1% Wells Fargo 2.65% 3% AT&T 4.75% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 3.06% 2.5% Chevron 3.80% 2.4% Verizon 4.76% 2.4% Source: Vanguard. Dividend yields are current as of 2/6/17. The fund has $24.3 billion of total assets, and charges a rock-bottom 0.09% expense ratio. Over the past 10 years, the annualized average total return of the fund is 7.14%. Image Source: Getty Images. The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF seeks to track the performance of the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of the highest-yielding stocks on the S&P Composite 1500 index that have increased their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. The fund holds just 112 stocks, just over one-fourth of the Vanguard fund, and pays a 3.2% dividend yield as of this writing, but interestingly, the holdings are more spread out. If you look at the chart of the fund's top 10 holdings, you'll notice that no single stock makes up more than 1.9% of the total assets. Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets AT&T 4.75% 1.9% Old Republic International 3.57% 1.7% Realty Income 4.22% 1.7% AbbVie 4.22% 1.7% National Retail Properties 4.23% 1.6% Consolidated Edison 3.72% 1.5% Chevron 3.80% 1.5% People's United Financial 3.60% 1.4% Emerson Electric 3.22% 1.4% IBM 3.19% 1.4% Source: SPDR. Dividend yields are current as of 2/6/17. You'll also notice that while there is some overlap (AT&T and Chevron) between the funds' largest holdings, they are not as similar in composition as you may think. These are two funds with a similar objective (higher-than-average dividends) that take significantly different approaches to achieve it. As far as expenses go, the SPDR fund charges a 0.35% expense ratio, and has just over $15 billion in assets as of this writing. Over the past 10 years, the SPDR fund's annualized average total return has been 7.74%. To recap, here are some of the major differences between these two ETFs that investors should be aware of: Although the Vanguard ETF has a lower expense ratio, I prefer the SPDR because of the differences listed above. I'm a big fan of REITs for long-term dividend growth, I like the SPDR fund's lower reliance on its top holdings, and the fact that every single one of the SPDR fund's stocks have increased their dividend for at least 20 years in a row gives me confidence that the income generated by the fund will continue to grow.
