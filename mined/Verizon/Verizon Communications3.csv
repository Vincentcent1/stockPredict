Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was the longest holdout of the four major U.S. wireless carriers when it came to unlimited data plans. While T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) released their unlimited plans with aggressive pricing, Verizon fought back by offering free iPhones and other device promotions. However, after disappointing fourth-quarter results, Verizon finally made the decision to go unlimited. What investors didn't know at the time was how bad Verizon's first quarter was going before it unveiled its new data plan. ""Prior to the unlimited launch, we had retail postpaid phone net losses of 398,000 customers,"" CFO Matt Ellis told analysts on the first-quarter earnings call. That was just halfway through the quarter. Verizon ended the quarter with 289,000 net postpaid phone losses, so the unlimited plan worked to attract new subscribers and retain old ones, but the trajectory was clearly the impetus for unlimited. The questions for Verizon are: Can it continue its postpaid phone subscriber momentum throughout the rest of 2017, and how will unlimited data plans affect its revenue? Image source: Verizon. Ellis was keen to note that Verizon added 109,000 net postpaid phone subscribers since mid-February, when it introduced the unlimited plan. That ""gives us momentum entering the second quarter,"" he said. However, when asked specifically about whether market dynamics have gotten better in the second quarter and if Verizon could see an improvement in its net adds, Ellis dodged the question: ""We'll have to wait and see,"" he responded, continuing: Right now, we're very happy with how the customer base is responding to the offers that we have out there. ... We will continue to be competitive in the marketplace, but we will do that in a disciplined fashion and we'll see how the quarter plays out. That said, Sprint ended its ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion. T-Mobile was particularly aggressive last quarter, running a friends and family discount and offering a free line to customers in early March. While there's no telling what the competition will do this quarter, things are starting to cool down. Verizon's second quarter is historically stronger than its first quarter. In 2015, it added 321,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the second quarter. Last year, that fell to 86,000 net adds. But as Ellis said, we'll have to wait and see what kind of affect the unlimited plan will have on net adds. The first set of subscribers to switch to Verizon's unlimited plan are those who stand to save some money -- that is, customers who were previously on Verizon's highest data plan. Additionally, unlimited data plans ensure Verizon won't be able to capitalize on data overage fees, which contribute meaningfully to its revenue. Verizon's wireless operating revenue declined 6.1% year over year last quarter. Verizon uses a metric that masks the affects of these changes -- average revenue per account. ARPA increased to $166.01 in the first quarter compared to $165.03 last year. But connections per account also increased, from 3.0 to 3.08. As such, average revenue per connection actually declined from $55.01 to $53.90. Ellis elaborated on the earnings call: We believe this revenue trend will persist through the first half of the year, but remain confident that these plans will be ARPA neutral over time, as more users step up in price, which is already taking place. New customer accounts added after the unlimited launch on average had higher account access fees. While we absorb overages in the near term, we expect that the increase in account access fees will replace overages over time. It could get worse before it gets better for Verizon investors. The competition remains fierce, but the strength of Verizon's network and brand will help it keep its churn rate low, and the relatively competitive pricing of its unlimited plan could attract new subscribers. The first full quarter of its unlimited plan will be a major test, and we'll see if Verizon can turn things around. Watch for continued declines in revenue and improvements in net postpaid phone additions. ","

T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) aggressive pursuit of growth over the past few years has already been paying off, but Verizon Communications' (NYSE:VZ) earnings report this morning showing that it lost retail customers for the first time represents an important inflection point in the U.S. wireless industry. While T-Mobile has been poaching customers from all other carriers for years, the dominant domestic wireless carrier has held up relatively well despite intensifying competition -- until now. Big Red has relied on its brand strength and strong retention of valuable postpaid subscribers to defend itself, and has only made modest concessions in response to T-Mobile's various Un-carrier initiatives, which now number over a dozen different moves to upend the industry. Verizon's latest reactive effort was relaunching unlimited data plans in February, which were still priced at a premium relative to T-Mobile One. T-Mobile management on an earnings call. Image source: T-Mobile. For what it's worth, Verizon says that Verizon Unlimited helped mitigate some of the customer losses in the first quarter; it ended up losing 307,000 net postpaid customers, but would have lost 398,000 if it weren't for Verizon Unlimited. Never one to let up, T-Mobile poked fun at the date of Verizon's earnings release, insinuating that Verizon may have been celebrating the ""holiest of high days"" (bonus points for puppy memes). In an emailed statement to CNBC, Verizon responded: We like puppy memes too. But today, like every day, we're focused on improving America's most reliable network. We're also busy enhancing our network to handle 3D, virtual reality and holographic puppy memes. Verizon is still the market leader by far, but T-Mobile has been making incredible progress growing its customer base. Verizon closed out the first quarter with 113.9 million total retail connections. T-Mobile hasn't reported first-quarter results yet, but finished 2016 with 71.5 million total customers (including wholesale) after adding 6.6 million throughout the year. Verizon does not report wholesale connections, and for reporting purposes Verizon's ""retail"" connections are synonymous with T-Mobile's ""branded"" customers. For comparability purposes, if we stack up T-Mobile's branded net additions next to Verizon's retail net additions (excluding wholesale for both carriers), the aforementioned inflection point becomes clear: Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. The U.S. wireless market is quite mature at this point, and overall isn't really growing all that much any more in terms of connections and customers. As the market leader, it makes sense that Verizon has struggled to find growth, while T-Mobile has been growing by gaining share and stealing customers. There are still revenue growth opportunities as data consumption continues to rise, driven in large part by mobile video, and carriers attempt to monetize that increased usage. The tough part is that aggressive pricing is the key to T-Mobile's success (in addition to savvy marketing campaigns that appeal to younger demographics), which undermines efforts to increase average revenue per user (ARPU); T-Mobile's branded postpaid phone ARPU was effectively flat in the fourth quarter ($48.37). Verizon reports average revenue per account (ARPA), which includes all lines in an account, and as such isn't directly comparable with T-Mobile's ARPU metrics; Verizon ARPA was $136.98 last quarter (down 6%). Overall, the Un-carrier continues to crush it, while Big Red searches for growth elsewhere. ","

Dividends aren't sexy but they are effective. While companies that offer regular payouts aren't likely to triple in value in any given year, dividends are the strong and steady force behind many retirement portfolios. Over time, such payments create dynamic wealth. Consider the two companies we are investigating today: telecom giant Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Over the last 25 years, their stocks have gone up 130% and 940%, respectively. But when we take dividends into account, this is what happens. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts. If I had my way, I'd jump into a time machine, grab my beginner investor self, and tell him, ""Brian, there's nothing more important to your success than picking companies with the strongest sustainable competitive advantages."" That's because these advantages, often referred to as ""moats,"" are what separate a companies from the rest of the field. They provide that special something that keeps customers coming back for more and the competition at bay for ages. Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson has three different divisions, each with its own moat. The consumer division, which accounts for 18% of sales, is buoyed by the strength of the company's brands like Band-Aid and Tylenol. The medical device division -- which comprises 35% of all sales -- benefits from large installed bases and moderately high switching costs for hospitals. And biggest of all, pharmaceuticals -- pulling in 47% of all sales -- is protected by patents. It's somewhat concerning that patents only last a specific amount of time, and yet they protect almost half of the company's revenue. At the same time, the reliability of the other two divisions allows Johnson & Johnson some leeway that other pharmaceutical companies don't have. Verizon is also making inroads into becoming a content company. The acquisitions of AOL and part of Yahoo! are evidence of this. If this seems like a lot of ink spilled over the moats for these two, that's because it is. It's impossible for me to solidly declare a winner here, as both are very strong. Investors love seeing cash returned to them. But it's important to keep cash sitting in the bank, too. That's because every company will deal with tough economic times. When those times hit, companies with cash have options: buy back shares on the cheap, acquire competitors, or outspend them in an attempt to gain market share. Those with a lot of debt are in the opposite boat, fragilized by their tenuous obligations. In the chart below, I've adjusted Verizon's free cash flow numbers to normalize them. They were artificially lower due to the fact that the company paid a large one-time tax bill for divesting some of its business, and it changed its business model to do far less subsidizing of phone plans. Remember that Johnson & Johnson is valued 70% higher than Verizon. Here's how the two stack up: Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $4 billion $105 billion $13.1 billion $13.8 billion Johnson & Johnson $42 billion $22 billion $16.5 billion $15.5 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Verizon 13 14 3.0 4.8% 67%* Johnson & Johnson 19 22 2.7 2.6% 55% Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. *FCF for Verizon is adjusted for the factors mentioned above. On the face of it, Johnson & Johnson appears to be the more expensive stock, trading at a significant premium on an earnings and free cash flow basis. But the company is growing faster than Verizon as well, and trades at a 10% discount to Verizon on the PEG ratio. In the end, the differentiator is the dividend. Verizon's payout is safe and much larger than Johnson & Johnson's. So there you have it: We have a draw. Both companies have solid moats, Johnson & Johnson has the stronger balance sheet, and Verizon is more attractively valued. If I were forced to choose, I would side with Johnson & Johnson, as I like the company's opportunities to grow in the future, while I think Verizon's foray into content is a bit riskier. Either way, both of these companies are solid dividend payers worthy of your careful consideration. ","

Verizon (NYSE:VZ) wants to find a merger partner, and it's not being shy about making it known to Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Disney, or any other big player that might be willing to entertain the idea. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam specifically mentioned he'd be open to talking with Comcast's CEO Brian Roberts, telling Bloomberg last week: If Brian came knocking on the door, I'd have a discussion with him about it. But I'd also tell you there isn't much that I wouldn't have a discussion around if somebody came and said ""here's a compelling reason why we ought to put the businesses together."" Image source: Getty Images. Why is the nation's largest wireless telecom company dropping not-so-subtle hints that it's interested in a merger? The answer came, at least in part, when Verizon reported its first-quarter 2017 earnings later in the week. Verizon lost 307,000 subscribers in the first quarter of this year, down from a net gain of 640,000 this time last year. Those losses in net subscribers are a symptom of a larger problem within Verizon: The company needs much more than its wireless services to survive. The company earns 75% of its top line from its wireless business, which is taking a beating from the self-proclaimed un-carrier, T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). Verizon's been losing this battle as T-Mobile has released a torrent of deals over the past few years, along with boosting its LTE coverage, speed, and dependability. All of this is starting to take its toll on Verizon. The carrier's chief financial officer, Matt Ellis, responded to all the news reports of McAdam's comments by saying on the earnings call that: We're confident in executing our strategy organically. If there's the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way that adds shareholder value, we're always looking at those opportunities. Basically, Ellis is saying that Verizon doesn't need a merger to succeed, but if someone's offering, then it's certainly open to talks. One could argue that it wouldn't be wise for a CFO to say anything less than ""we got this"" on an earnings call. The fact is that wireless networks in the U.S. have quickly become the boring roads that lead their subscribers to more interesting destinations on the internet. Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T (NYSE:T) all get you to the same place, with a relatively smooth ride, and it's getting harder and harder to stand apart from the crowd. To get there, Verizon has stepped further into the content space, which is why the company purchased AOL and is buying Yahoo!, and why it invested in its go90 video platform. But those moves pale in comparison to rival AT&T's $85 billion deal to merge with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL). The deal is still pending approval, but once it closes it will give AT&T access to Time Warner's treasure trove of content, including HBO, TNT, CNN, and Warner Bros. Verizon could soon be left on the content sidelines, with its stalling wireless business, and no major long-term growth prospects in sight. McAdam admitted to Bloomberg that he knows there's ""never a dream deal"" that will bring the company everything it wants. But a major merger could bring his company something that it desperately needs: a big step toward content. Verizon spent years building out an extensive wireless network so its subscribers could access anything they wanted online. And it achieved that goal arguably better and faster than any of its wireless competitors. But now it's time for the company to transition away from building roads for the internet, and start creating destinations of its own. If it can't do that alone, then a merger is the most logical choice. ","

High dividend yields can be tantalizing, especially with interest rates so low. But a high yield sometimes comes with the risk that the dividend could be slashed. Not only will that cut into your income, but the stock price will likely fall as well, a double whammy for dividend investors. Avoiding high-yield stocks that have an elevated risk of dividend cuts is a good idea, even if it means missing out on some dividend income today. Here's why Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), GameStop (NYSE:GME), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) should be avoided. Image source: Getty Images. Embattled toy maker Mattel has so far maintained its generous dividend, even as sales and profits continue to sink. Total revenue dropped 8% year over year during the critical holiday quarter, driving a 19% plunge in net income. This weak performance left retailers with elevated levels of inventory, reducing new orders during the first quarter and leading Mattel to report a 15% decline in sales. The company posted a net loss of $113 million during the seasonally weak quarter, more than 50% bigger than the loss during the prior-year period. Mattel stock has tumbled since peaking in early 2014, driving the dividend yield up over the 6% mark. That certainly looks tempting, but earnings haven't been sufficient to cover that dividend since 2013. This is a situation that can go on for a while, but not forever. If Mattel can't improve its bottom line substantially in the near future, a dividend cut will become necessary. Mattel has some things going for it. The company owns popular brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher Price, and its recent revenue shortfalls are partly due to the one-off loss of the Disney Princess license. In the long run, Mattel has a good shot at eventually turning things around. If you're a dividend investor, though, best to stay away. That juicy dividend may not be long for this world. Video game retailer GameStop is already preparing for the possibility that video games one day go completely digital. The company is expanding its fleet of stores that sell consumer electronics and collectibles while reducing its massive footprint of video game stores. But GameStop remains heavily dependent on selling physical games, particularly used games. During 2016, used and value games accounted for more than one-third of the company's gross profit. GameStop may well survive past the point when console games go fully digital, but it will be a completely different company. GameStop stock looks like a bargain, trading for less than seven times earnings, but those earnings are generated by a line of business that may not exist five or 10 years from now. The dividend also looks enticing, yielding about 6.5%, but it won't survive if GameStop's core business falls apart. Buying GameStop stock is a bet that a retailer with more than 7,600 stores, the vast majority of which sell physical games, will be able to adapt to a world where games are going digital and where retail in general is in upheaval. That's not a bet I'm willing to make, and investors shouldn't be tempted by a dividend that will look perfectly sustainable right until the rug is pulled out from under them. Verizon's dividend may seem safe, given its long-held status as the leading provider of wireless service in the U.S. But competition is catching up. Verizon reported its first net decline in wireless customers ever during the first quarter, losing over 300,000 to scrappy rivals like T-Mobile. The company was forced to reintroduce unlimited plans to keep up with the competition, a move that prevented an even bigger decline in subscribers. But revenue fell by 7.3% year over year, and net profit plunged 20%. Verizon stock sports a dividend yield of 4.75%, and until recently there wasn't much concern that the dividend could be at risk. But Verizon paid out $9.3 billion in dividends last year compared to just $5.1 billion in free cash flow and $13.6 billion in net income. The era when Verizon could charge premium prices and still post healthy subscriber gains appears to be over. If subscribers keep fleeing, Verizon will be forced to slash prices, and that will hit the bottom line. A big acquisition could be in the cards, which would likely saddle the company with even more debt. Verizon may look to diversify away from wireless, but the balance sheet already has $105 billion of long-term debt, more than double compared to 2012. The dividend may be harder to maintain if even more cash must go toward interest payments. There's a lot to dislike about Verizon at this point, and dividend investors shouldn't assume that the dividend is safe. A dividend cut is far less likely with Verizon compared to the other two companies above, but it's still a risk. ","

With a market cap around $600 million, Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) doesn't generate a lot of headlines. (In fact, just three analysts joined the company's most recent conference call.) But with its shares rising 140% over the last 12 months, you can bet more and more people are beginning to notice this Canadian company with a peculiar name. TCX data by YCharts Tucows -- yes, its logo includes two cows -- says its mission is to ""provide simple, useful services that help people unlock the power of the Internet."" In a nutshell, the company operates a large Internet domain registration business, as well as smaller mobile and fiber internet businesses. Image source: Tucows. From 2012 to 2016, Tucows' revenue increased from $114.7 million to $189.8 million -- a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 13.4%. As a result of the significant operating leverage in its lean business structure, its bottom line grew nearly three times as fast over the same period, from $4.5 million to $16.1 million -- a 37.3% CAGR. A couple other highlights from 2016 show more strong performance. Owing to rapid expansion of the company's mobile business, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 43% last year to $30.1 million. And perhaps most importantly to the company's long-term strategy, the company produced substantial cash flow from operations of $21.6 million in 2016, a 62% increase from the prior year. Image source: Tucows Feb. 2017 investor presentation Tucows says it is the second-largest domain registry in the world, behind only GoDaddy. While the company does sell domain names directly to consumers and businesses, the lion's share of revenue in this segment comes from registration fees charged to resellers. Tucows has grown its domain businesses substantially over the years through a series of acquisitions. The latest was announced in January, when TuCows agreed to purchase eNom for $83.5 million. As an example of how Tucows wrings efficiencies out of these acquisitions, eNom was generating around $15 in annual EBITDA at the time of sale, but Tucows believes it will be able to grow this to roughly $20 million within two years. Domain services is Tucows largest segment, comprising 61% of the company's total revenues. While organic growth is not expected to be robust, the domain business throws off large, reliable amounts of cash, (the company has had 14 consecutive years of positive cash flow from operations ) which Tucows then uses to invest in its other, faster-growing segment. Tucows' other segment includes a fast-growing mobile business, as well as its nascent high-speed internet division. Ting Mobile launched nationally in 2012 and offers phone service at deep discounts, with the company saying an average monthly bill is about $23 per device. All of Ting's services are provided on a pay-as-you-go basis with no fixed contracts. The company also boasts top-notch customer service, reporting a ""net promoter score"" -- which measures customers' enthusiasm for a business -- of 73, which it says is on par with beloved tech companies Amazon (69) and Apple (76) and far above the 16 of the broad category of mobile phone providers.. At the end of 2014, the company had 94,000 Ting Mobile subscribers. By the end of 2016, that number had risen more than 60% to 151,000. With that kind of meteoric growth, and with Ting Mobile's gross margins of around 50%, it's easy to get excited about the company's efforts to scale this business up. Mobile services revenue for 2016 grew 22% to $70 million, which was 37% of the company's total revenue. Image source: Getty Images. Then there's Ting Internet, launched in 2015, which provides high-speed fiber internet access to a few small towns -- Holly Springs, North Carolina; Westminster, Maryland; and Charlottesville, Virginia. While deep-pocketed broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon are competition, Ting believes it offers much better value, and like its mobile sibling, offers services on a monthly basis with no fixed contracts. Ting Internet is tiny at only 2% of revenue, but it's also just getting started. Ting plans to add service to Centennial, Colorado, and Sandpoint, Idaho, in 2017, and it expects to announce plans for additional towns later this year. In its first year of launching Ting Internet in a community, the company expects 20% uptake, growing to 50% uptake within five years. And while Ting Internet is not yet profitable, the company is targeting late 2018 or early 2019 as its breakeven point. Tucows has been rewarding shareholders by buying back massive amounts of its own stock -- around 50% of total shares since 2007. In addition, in February the company announced its latest buyback program, planning to repurchase up to $40 million worth of shares over the next 12 months. This represents 7% of Tucows' market cap at current prices. Tucows strategy of milking its core domain business to fund its higher-growth mobile and internet ventures has provided some incredible returns for shareholders. But keep in mind this is a pricey small cap with lumpy earnings, and has been growing heavily through acquisitions. In other words, expect plenty of volatility. While it may be a bumpy ride, so long as the company continues to execute, Tucows growth prospects continue to look mighty appetizing. ","

Dividend-paying stocks tend to perform better, as a group, than their non-dividend counterparts, and also generally do better during tough economic times. For investors who want exposure to rock-solid dividend stocks, but don't want the guesswork and risk involved with choosing individual stocks, there are some excellent ETFs available that could work well in your portfolio. Two of the biggest dividend stock ETFs are the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT:SCHD). Here's some information about each, and the key differences between them. Image source: Getty Images. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, and invests in 428 stocks that pay higher-than-average dividend yields, and specifically excludes REITs (I'll discuss more details of the portfolio shortly). Based on the past 12 months of distributions, the fund yields 2.95%, and over the past 10 years, the fund has averaged a total return of 7.58%. The ETF has $24.7 billion in assets, and charges a rather low expense ratio of 0.08%. In other words, this means that for every $10,000 you have invested in the fund, you'll pay $8 in fees annually. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks a different index, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Like the FTSE index tracked by the Vanguard fund, this consists of high-yield dividend stocks and specifically excludes REITs, but contains far fewer stocks (roughly one-fourth). Over the past 12 months, the Schwab ETF has generated a distribution yield of 2.89%. A 10-year performance record isn't available, as the fund's inception took place in 2011, but the performance is on par with its index so far. The fund has about $5.3 billion in assets, and charges an even lower expense ratio than the Vanguard product at just 0.07%. The 0.01% difference won't have too much of an impact on investment performance, even over the long run, but still -- cheaper is cheaper. Both funds are weighted, which means that certain stocks make up a greater portion of the respective portfolios than others. For this reason, it's a good idea to take a look at the top holdings of each fund. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF 1 Microsoft Microsoft 2 ExxonMobil ExxonMobil 3 Johnson & Johnson Intel 4 JPMorgan Chase Pfizer 5 Wells Fargo Coca-Cola 6 General Electric Johnson & Johnson 7 AT&T Home Depot 8 Procter & Gamble Procter & Gamble 9 Pfizer Verizon 10 Chevron Pepsi Data Source: Fund documents from Vanguard and Schwab. As you can see, both portfolios have significant overlap. Not only are the two largest holdings exactly the same, but there are a total of five common stocks among these top 10 lists. However, an important distinction is that because the index on which it's based is much smaller, the Schwab fund is much more ""top-heavy."" Specifically, the top 10 holdings of the Vanguard ETF account for 31.2% of that fund's portfolio. With the Schwab ETF, the top 10 make up 45% of the total. In other words, the performance of the Schwab ETF is more dependent on a smaller group of stocks. To recap, here are some of the key differences between the two ETFs: Vanguard Schwab Expense ratio 0.08% 0.07% Target index FTSE High Dividend Yield Index Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index Number of stocks 428 118 Top 10 weight (% of assets) 31.2% 45.1% Distribution Yield (TTM) 2.95% 2.89% Data Sources: Vanguard and Schwab.

Ryan Knutson,04272017,MarketWatch,04202017,"Published: Apr 20, 2017 11:16 a.m. ET By Verizon Communications Inc., once the untouchable leader of the U.S. wireless industry, is struggling to hold onto customers and getting them to pay a premium for its service. The carrier posted its first ever quarterly net loss of wireless subscribers during the first three months of 2017, showing the extent of the damage resurgent rivals T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. have inflicted on the nation's largest carrier by subscribers. Verizon unexpectedly brought back unlimited data plans in February, which it had stopped selling in 2011, seeking to blunt the appeal of similar offers from T-Mobile and Sprint. That offer hit financials: Verizon had a 5.1% decline in revenue in its wireless business, to $20.9 billion. The results will put pressure on Verizon's management to either find a way to turn things around or make moves that will diversify the company away from the wireless business, where most Americans already have a smartphone and price wars have pinched profits. Verizon stock is trading more than 1.5% lower Thursday. The industry's bruising price war has been a boon to consumers. Wireless bills are a major household expense, and their continued decline had a big impact on March's surprising 0.3% drop in the consumer price index. Prices for wireless telephone services fell 11.4% in March from a year earlier, after a 7% decline in February. Rival AT&T Inc. has diversified with its acquisition of DirecTV and proposed purchase of media giant Time Warner Inc. But Verizon doubled down in 2014 with its $130 billion purchase of Vodafone Group PLC's 45% stake in their Verizon Wireless joint venture. Since then, Verizon has spent more than $10 billion on smaller deals such as AOL and Yahoo Inc., but neither deal is enough to move the needle. The company has also explored bigger transactions, including with Charter Communications Inc., The Wall Streeet Journal has reported, though executives have recently signaled the two sides are far apart. ""We're confident in executing our strategy organically, but if there's the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way that adds shareholder value, we're always looking at those opportunities,"" said Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis on a call with analysts. More Verizon customers used the unlimited plan to reduce their bills -- moving from expensive data plans to the cheaper unlimited one -- than customers chose to pay up. Average revenue per account, including device payments, increased by only $1, to $166 from $165 in the year-ago period. The introduction of unlimited plans, along with a ""safety mode"" feature launched last year, also chipped away at lucrative ""overage"" revenue, which comes from the fees Verizon charges when customers exceed their monthly data limits. Much of the pain Verizon is going through began as a result of moves T-Mobile began making in 2013, such as ending two-year contracts and canceling overage fees. John Legere, T-Mobile's brash chief executive, mocked Verizon's results on Twitter. T-Mobile and AT&T are slated to report their latest quarterly results in the coming weeks. The company's revenue and profit came in less than Wall Street was expecting. The stock, already down 8.3% so far this year, fell another 2% to $48.03 in early Thursday trading. Verizon said Thursday the unlimited data plan ""positively changed the trajectory of customer additions"" in the quarter, but it still reported a net decline of 307,000 retail postpaid connections during the first three months of the year, including 289,000 phone losses. That compares with 640,000 retail postpaid net additions in the year-ago period, including 8,000 phone losses. Before the launch of its ""Verizon Unlimited"" plans in mid-February, Verizon had a retail postpaid phone net loss of 398,000; after the launch, Verizon said it added 109,000 retail postpaid phone connections. Much of the pain Verizon is going through began as a result of moves T-Mobile began making in 2013, such as ending two year contracts and cancelling overage fees. John Legere, T-Mobile's brash CEO, mocked Verizon's results on Twitter. Verizon's rivals are slated to report their latest results in coming weeks. Verizon's decision in recent years to give away free tablets as a way to juice subscriber numbers is also coming back to haunt it, as many of the customers who signed up for two-year data plans in exchange for a free tablet aren't renewing their subscriptions. Verizon expects improvement in wireless service revenue this year, with total revenue ""fairly consistent"" with 2016. But that stands to leave Verizon in a familiar position: slowing growth on the top and bottom lines, and a sliding stock price. Overall, for the March quarter, Verizon reported net income of $3.45 billion, or 84 cents a share, compared with $4.31 billion, or $1.06 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding certain items, Verizon earned 95 cents a share. Total revenue, which includes the wireline segment and FiOS service, fell 7.3% to $29.8 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of 96 cents on $30.5 billion in revenue.

lost more customers than it gained for the first time, but the telecommunications giant's revenues missed expectations in a Tuesday report as sales of wireless equipment hit an all-time low. AT&T reported net income of $3.5 billion, or 56 cents a share, on revenue of $39.4 billion. After adjusting for amortization and other factors, the company claimed adjusted earnings of 74 cents a share. Analysts expected on average for AT&T to report adjusted earnings of 74 cents a share on revenue of $40.5 billion, according to FactSet. AT&T said it added 2.7 million wireless customers in the quarter, well above analysts' average estimate of 1.3 million wireless net adds, with AT&T crediting the performance largely to prepaid phone plans and connected devices. However, the company's sales total dropped from $40.5 billion in the year-ago quarter because of its lowest wireless equipment sales on record, suggesting new customers were bringing their own phones or buying cheaper models. AT&T also updated its full-year guidance to remove its revenue forecast, explaining that it ""is no longer providing consolidated revenue guidance primarily due to the unpredictability of wireless handset sales.""

Ziedins also cheerily notes that this “half-full” market remains robustly optimistic and is ignoring every reason it should sell off, even as Congress, Trump, the Fed, Britain, France, Syria, Russia and North Korea “have all given us reasons to be cautious.” Here’s something that really has been moving: Amazon.com’s stock

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday declined to rehear a challenge to the Obama administration’s landmark “net neutrality” rules requiring internet providers to guarantee equal access to all websites. The decision by the full appeals court in Washington not to reconsider a three-judge panel’s decision that upheld the ruling comes days after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai proposed to undo the 2015 net neutrality that reclassified internet providers like public utilities. The 2015 order bars internet providers from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. Pai has proposed reversing the reclassification and scrapping internet conduct standards, and has asked for comment on whether the FCC can or should retain any of the rules barring blocking, throttling or “fast lanes.” Judge Sri Srinivasan said in a written opinion reviewing the decision “would be particularly unwarranted at this point in light of the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the FCC’s order.” The FCC is set to hold an initial vote on May 18 on Pai’s proposal but Srinivasan questioned why the full court should review “the validity of a rule that the agency had already slated for replacement.” US Telecom, the trade group representing major telephone companies that sued the FCC in 2015 over the rules, said Monday it will “review our legal options going forward to fully protect our open internet.” Two dissenting opinions said the 2015 order was unlawful because Congress did not grant the FCC authority to reclassify internet providers. Judge Janice Rogers Brown said the order “shows signs of a government having grown beyond the consent of the governed.” Judge Brett Kavanagh wrote that the order violates the First Amendment rights of internet providers. “The government must keep its hands off the editorial decisions of Internet service providers,” he wrote, suggesting the government cannot force a bookstore or Amazon.com Inc “to feature and promote all books in the same manner.” In a statement Monday, Pai said the decision not to rehear the decision was expected and he praised points raised in the dissents. Websites like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and others back the rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet. Internet providers such as AT&T Inc , Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp opposed the Obama order, saying it made it harder to manage internet traffic and discouraged investment. Chip Pickering, head of the trade group INCOMPAS that includes Amazon, Facebook and Netflix Inc, said the decision was a “blow to those who want to take away open internet protections, raise prices and cut off the streaming revolution.” ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday released a 58-page draft plan to reverse the landmark 2015 “net neutrality” order and disclosed the agency may withdraw “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by Trump in January, disclosed his intent Wednesday to repeal the Obama era rules that reclassified internet service and tightly regulated providers as if they were utilities. The FCC also plans to scrap the 2015 internet conduct standard and an ombudsman position created to hear complaints of net neutrality violations. The plan asks if network disclosure requirements should remain in force for internet providers. Pai’s plan faces an initial May 18 vote. He wants public comment on whether the FCC should keep its “bright line” rules, and said his decision on the rules would depend partly on the comments the agency receives. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeny opposed Pai’s plan, saying it “would allow broadband providers to erect barriers or charge tolls to any application, connected device, or website that the broadband providers’ customers want to reach. It would allow broadband providers to favor their own content over others, and pick winners and losers on the internet.” Pai said the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary because large internet providers did not block websites before they were imposed. “We were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us,” Pai said Wednesday. The FCC proposal seeks comment “on whether a codified no-blocking rule is needed to protect such freedoms.” The order also asks whether a legal bar on throttling “is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers.” The proposal also questions the ban on “paid prioritization” that the proposal argues was adopted to “address an apparently nonexistent problem.” AT&T said the question “is not whether the internet will remain open - it undoubtedly will. The question is how, as a country, we will regulate the internet ecosystem.” ","

Sales in its NBCUniversal unit were up 14.7 percent, helped by a 43.2 percent increase in filmed entertainment revenue.

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"Cyxtera will be the latest private equity-backed company  looking to take advantage of U.S. businesses’ burgeoning demand to have their data hosted and connected to the Internet, which has raised valuations in the data center space. Earlier this year, Digital Bridge Holdings LLC, a private firm that invests in data centers, agreed to acquire Vantage Data Centers Management Co LLC from buyout firm Silver Lake Partners for more than $1 billion. Private equity firms BC Partners and Medina Capital will co-own Cyxtera, and said they would try to make the new company stand out by mixing data centers with cyber security assets. While CenturyLink’s 57 data centers make up the majority of the company, the cyber security firms that were rolled into it by Medina Capital, called Cryptzone, Catbird, Easy Solutions, and Brainspace, will be key to helping the Miami-based company grow revenues, said Cyxtera CEO Manny Medina. “Like we did at Terremark, we have a game plan to acquire products that work well together and integrate them into solutions that will become market leaders,” Medina said. Cyxtera will be able to cross-sell cyber products to its 3,500 existing data centers. The company will also be able to develop new cyber products to help protect data centers specifically, which is an emerging area with revenue potential, said BC Partners managing director Justin Bateman. CenturyLink will retain a minority stake in the company worth $150 million, while Longview Asset Management is also an investor. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"Dish was the second-largest winner in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission auction of broadcaster airwaves this year, bidding $6.2 billion to increase its spectrum holdings. Companies taking part in the auction were restrained from holding merger talks for over a year until the ban ended last week. On the company’s post-earnings conference call, Dish Chief Executive Charlie Ergen declined to comment on whether it had been approached by other companies. But when asked whether Dish would prefer to sell or leasing its spectrum as opposed to keeping it, he said that the company was open to options that would ultimately increase shareholder value. “At least today, we think that means someone looking at the wireless world in a disruptive manner,” Ergen said. The company said it lost about 143,000 net pay-TV subscribers in its first quarter through March 31, after losing 23,000 a year earlier. The number was roughly double analysts’ average estimate of a loss of 72,000 subscribers, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Churn, or the rate of customer defections among pay-TV subscribers, rose to 1.69 percent in the quarter, from 1.63 percent a year earlier. Net income attributable to Dish fell to $376 million, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, from $400 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 3.9 pct to $3.68 billion from $3.83 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 69 cents per share on revenue of $3.78 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Dish shares fell 2.3 percent to close at $62.93. The stock has surged more than 26 percent in the past 12 months. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"For the first quarter ended March 31, the New York-based media company, which is home to the popular series “The Big Bang Theory” and “Homeland,” reported a 16 percent jump in revenue from content licensing and distribution. Affiliate and subscription revenue - which include revenue from cable TV operators and from its own streaming content - was up 16.6 percent. But advertising sales, which account for half of the company’s total revenue, dropped 23 percent to $1.6 billion from a year earlier, when the broadcaster’s results included popular events such as the 50th anniversary of the National Football League’s Super Bowl championship and an extra NFL playoff game. CBS anticipates its retransmission consent and reverse compensation - which is the revenue from distributors and broadcast affiliates - to increase about 25 percent this year, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves told investors on an analyst call on Thursday. The company, which also owns cable television’s Showtime, is anticipating continued affiliate revenue growth at a time when the pay TV industry just reported its worst-ever subscriber loss for the first quarter. “We are not being affected in any way by any changes in subscription numbers throughout the industry,” Moonves said on the call. CBS shares were up 1.8 percent at $65 in extended trading on Thursday. Subscription and retransmission fees help the company offset fluctuations in advertising revenue, which can vary from quarter to quarter, depending on events. The company said it is also focused on owning more of its content to help control costs and monetize it more effectively. CBS owns 16 of the 19 shows it is renewing this season. Excluding one-time items, CBS reported quarterly profit from continuing operations of $1.04 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 95 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income from continuing operations rose to $454 million, or $1.09 per share, in the first quarter from $442 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue fell to $3.34 billion from $3.59 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $3.27 billion. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday released a 58-page draft plan to reverse the landmark 2015 “net neutrality” order and disclosed the agency may withdraw “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by Trump in January, disclosed his intent Wednesday to repeal the Obama era rules that reclassified internet service and tightly regulated providers as if they were utilities. The FCC also plans to scrap the 2015 internet conduct standard and an ombudsman position created to hear complaints of net neutrality violations. The plan asks if network disclosure requirements should remain in force for internet providers. Pai’s plan faces an initial May 18 vote. He wants public comment on whether the FCC should keep its “bright line” rules, and said his decision on the rules would depend partly on the comments the agency receives. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeny opposed Pai’s plan, saying it “would allow broadband providers to erect barriers or charge tolls to any application, connected device, or website that the broadband providers’ customers want to reach. It would allow broadband providers to favor their own content over others, and pick winners and losers on the internet.” Pai said the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary because large internet providers did not block websites before they were imposed. “We were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us,” Pai said Wednesday. The FCC proposal seeks comment “on whether a codified no-blocking rule is needed to protect such freedoms.” The order also asks whether a legal bar on throttling “is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers.” The proposal also questions the ban on “paid prioritization” that the proposal argues was adopted to “address an apparently nonexistent problem.” AT&T said the question “is not whether the internet will remain open - it undoubtedly will. The question is how, as a country, we will regulate the internet ecosystem.” ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"Dish was the second-largest winner in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission auction of broadcaster airwaves this year, bidding $6.2 billion to increase its spectrum holdings. Companies taking part in the auction were restrained from holding merger talks for over a year until the ban ended last week. On the company’s post-earnings conference call, Dish Chief Executive Charlie Ergen declined to comment on whether it had been approached by other companies. But when asked whether Dish would prefer to sell or leasing its spectrum as opposed to keeping it, he said that the company was open to options that would ultimately increase shareholder value. “At least today, we think that means someone looking at the wireless world in a disruptive manner,” Ergen said. The company said it lost about 143,000 net pay-TV subscribers in its first quarter through March 31, after losing 23,000 a year earlier. The number was roughly double analysts’ average estimate of a loss of 72,000 subscribers, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Churn, or the rate of customer defections among pay-TV subscribers, rose to 1.69 percent in the quarter, from 1.63 percent a year earlier. Net income attributable to Dish fell to $376 million, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, from $400 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.

Affiliate and subscription revenue - which include revenue from cable TV operators and from its own streaming content - was up 16.6 percent. But advertising sales, which account for half of the company’s total revenue, dropped 23 percent to $1.6 billion from a year earlier, when the broadcaster’s results included popular events such as the 50th anniversary of the National Football League’s Super Bowl championship and an extra NFL playoff game. CBS anticipates its retransmission consent and reverse compensation - which is the revenue from distributors and broadcast affiliates - to increase about 25 percent this year, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves told investors on an analyst call on Thursday. The company, which also owns cable television’s Showtime, is anticipating continued affiliate revenue growth at a time when the pay TV industry just reported its worst-ever subscriber loss for the first quarter. “We are not being affected in any way by any changes in subscription numbers throughout the industry,” Moonves said on the call. CBS shares were up 1.8 percent at $65 in extended trading on Thursday. Subscription and retransmission fees help the company offset fluctuations in advertising revenue, which can vary from quarter to quarter, depending on events. The company said it is also focused on owning more of its content to help control costs and monetize it more effectively. CBS owns 16 of the 19 shows it is renewing this season. Excluding one-time items, CBS reported quarterly profit from continuing operations of $1.04 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 95 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The stock had surged nearly five-fold since April 7, a day before AT&T made the first move with a $95.63 per share offer. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of millimeter wave spectrum, which is expected to play a large role in 5G. In general, 5G is expected to boast higher speeds, shorter response times and more capacity. The spectrum is particularly important for 5G broadband services that AT&T and Verizon hope to launch to better compete with high-speed Internet offerings from cable companies. “Verizon now has all of the pieces in place to quickly accelerate the deployment of 5G,” Hans Vestberg, president of global network and technology at Verizon, said in a statement. AT&T did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In April, AT&T said it would buy Straight Path for $1.25 billion in an all stock deal. Straight Path said later that it received a bid from an unnamed bidder that Reuters reported was Verizon, citing sources. The transaction “positions Verizon well ahead of peers in access to high frequency spectrum holdings suitable for 5G,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note. But shares of Straight Path slumped 20 percent in midday trading to $178 as news of the deal dashed investor hopes of a bidding war between the two largest U.S. wireless carriers. The frenzy around Straight Path started after an anonymous short-seller tipped off regulators in November 2015 that the company had not built communications systems as it had claimed, leading to an investigation by the U.S. Federal Communication Commission. The company settled with the FCC and put itself on the block in January. Verizon will pay, on behalf of Straight Path, a termination fee of $38 million to AT&T. The deal is expected to close within nine months, pending review by the FCC. As part of the earlier settlement with FCC, Straight Path will pay the U.S. government a 20 percent cut from the sale of its spectrum licenses. Evercore was financial adviser to Straight Path and Weil, and Gotshal & Manges served as company counsel on the deal. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP served as counsel to Verizon. ","

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wants the commission repeal the rules that reclassified internet service providers as if they were utilities. He thinks the open internet rules adopted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, were unnecessary and harm jobs and investment. “We propose to repeal utility-style regulation,” Pai said on  Thursday. “This is the right way to go.” Stocks of major internet providers rose on Thursday. The public will have until mid-August to offer comments before the FCC votes on a final plan. Pai wants public input on whether the FCC has the authority or should keep its “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. Pai declined on Thursday to commit to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” He added he would make public a final proposal before a final vote. Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who voted against the plan, said the end game appears to be an internet without FCC regulatory oversight. She said the proposal “jeopardizes the ability of the open internet to function tomorrow, as it does today.” Many companies and Republicans think Congress should pass legislation clarifying the FCC’s role to resolve a decade-long dispute over internet regulations. The FCC, which has already received more than 1 million comments, is also seeking comment on whether U.S. states should be able to set their own internet regulations governing broadband privacy and other issues. Providers insist they will not engage in blocking or throttling even in the absence of rules, but critics are skeptical. U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat, said “it will take millions of people standing up, just like they did before, to say that the internet needs to stay free and open. That’s what it will take to win.” ","

Though they operate in the same industry, Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) are two telecom companies of a very different nature. In fact, the past decade has seen Frontier's business model come under siege, while Verizon has largely strengthened its hand, even if it has underperformed the market averages over the past five years (before the effect of dividends). VZ data by YCharts However, this kind of backward-looking analysis doesn't necessarily say much about which company represents the better investment today. After all, contrarian stock picks can yield the best returns under the right circumstances. To get a better sense of which stock looks like the better buy today, let's analyze Frontier and Verizon in three important areas. The telecom industry is well known for its heavy use of debt, and that trend holds true for both Verizon and Frontier. Here's a snapshot of four of the most important financial metrics to gauge a company's liquidity and solvency positions. Data sources: Frontier Communications and Verizon investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Click here to learn about the current ratio. Although they operate at different scales, Verizon and Frontier share plenty in common in their capital structure and cash flow composition. Each company keeps between 2% and 3% of its debt allocation in liquid assets and maintains a ratio of debt to cash from operations of about 10-to-1. In fact, it's difficult to ascertain an advantage for either company in this section, so let's call it a tie and move on. Image source: Getty Images. When we look at their moats, the material differences between Verizon and Frontier really start to show. Though Verizon provides Internet, cable, and landline phone services, the overwhelming majority of its subscribers and revenue come from its wireless telecom operations. As of its most recent earnings release, Verizon had 113 million pre-paid and post-paid wireless subscribers. Although the wireless market in the U.S. is reaching maturity, Verizon's shared place along with telecom giant AT&T at the top of the U.S. telecom market gives it a powerful position from which to grow its business empire. For example, Verizon has delved deeper into content and mobile advertising with its recent acquisitions of AOL and of Yahoo!'s core Internet business. Both moves should help increase the company's average revenue per user even as subscriber growth slows. On the other end of the spectrum, Frontier's business focuses on providing landline, TV, and internet packages to a small base of subscribers. As of its most recent earnings report, Frontier counted about 5.2 million consumer and business subscribers, down from about 5.4 million in the prior quarter. These are, in general, not growth businesses, but Frontier has done its best to position itself as one the strongest players in this space. Last year, for example, Frontier paid Verizon $8.6 billion to acquire customers in California, Texas, and Florida.  The company's CEO, however, blamed merger-related issues for its recent customer defections, and while that could indeed be the case, the big-picture comparison is a no-brainer: Verizon is in every sense the stronger to the two companies here. The differences in the quality of the two businesses shine through when considering their valuations. To that end, let's look at three of the most popular valuation metrics for Frontier and Verizon. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio. EV = enterprise value. EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Though Frontier generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations over the past 12 months, it lost $373 million last year, its second straight year of GAAP losses. Its cash-flow-generation capabilities have increased year over year in each of the past two years, so Frontier doesn't appear to be facing an imminent demise. However, the company's business model is flying in the face of many of the telecom industry's long-term trends, and that shows with its valuation. Verizon, on the other hand, is valued conservatively relative to the market, but that should come as no surprise, given the utility-like nature of the telecom business. For comparison, AT&T trades at 19 times past EPS and 13 times forward earnings, although its slightly higher valuation can also be attributed to its superior growth prospects versus Verizon. This contest was easy. Frontier has made some admirable moves to shore up its customer base in recent years, and these moves will benefit it in the years to come. But the long-term trends in the telecom industry could become too great for the company to overcome. Though Verizon could be more proactive in pursuing wireless video rights, the company's dominant position should allow it to remain one of the most powerful telecoms in the U.S., which makes Verizon the superior stock to buy today.

During the first quarter of 2017, Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) bread-and-butter business got a little bit smaller. Retail subscribers to the nation's leading wireless network shrank for the first time in years, and profits decreased 21% from the same period in 2016. The mobile phone industry is a mature market with growth a thing of the past, leaving the few big competitors to fight over the same customers. For Verizon, the next big thing could be right around the corner. Verizon reported that net retail subscribers declined by 324,000 in the first three months of the year. Laying claim to ""the nation's best network,"" Verizon has managed to grow its customer base for years. As competitors' offerings have improved, though, the growth began to dry up, and last quarter's decline now looks all but inevitable in hindsight. Chart by author. Data source: Verizon quarterly earnings reports. As customers left for cheaper pastures, Verizon management wanted shareholders to know that things could have been worse. Before reluctantly rolling out an unlimited data plan similar to ones offered by smaller rivals, the exodus had reached 398,000. While the bad news has taken the spotlight, it isn't as if Verizon's strategy consists of just defending its turf. The company has been on the move in the last year gearing up for tomorrow. With the advent of 4G LTE technology, telecommunications began to look a lot like the internet. On a 4G network, calls and other information are all transmitted as data packets much like information sent across the worldwide web. Verizon is betting that, with that fundamental change in mobile networks, it can grow into more than just a phone company. It sees leveraging its leading mobile network to facilitate all sorts of communications of the future, chief among them the Internet of Things. The IoT, which is simply communication between devices, is fueling growing demand for an extensive, secure, and reliable medium to transmit information across. In response to that demand, which is arising from things like wearable devices, automobiles, and industrial equipment, Verizon has purchased a fair share of small companies and incorporated them into its IoT division. Purchases have included fleet and mobile workforce tracking and management systems and smart-city Wi-Fi hub developers. Image source: Verizon. Verizon's IoT business grew 17% year-over-year in the first quarter, with the telematics division (which includes connected auto and fleet management services) bringing in $214 million. That's a small amount compared to the $29.8 billion total revenue reported, but at least something is growing. Closely related to the IoT business is the company's continued work on its next-generation 5G mobile network, said to be a necessary development for the projected billions of devices expected to hit the streets each year that are transmitting and receiving communications. Verizon closed its acquisition of fiber optic telecom company XO Communications in the first quarter, which it plans to use for the faster and more reliable network of the future. The IoT division at Verizon barely even shows up on the quarterly radar, so it could take some time for shareholders to reap any rewards from it. In the meantime, we are left waiting with bated breath to see current wireless subscriber growth numbers each quarter. Perhaps the unleashing of the unlimited data plan was the silver bullet needed to keep things afloat in the short term, but patience should pay off as Verizon's IoT and 5G projects could eventually lead to exciting things down the road.

Shares of Straight Path Communications Inc. (NYSEMKT:STRP) were down 20.4% as of 1:00 p.m. EDT on Thursday as the one-sided bidding war for the wireless spectrum company finally came to an end. More specifically, today Straight Path announced it will sign a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) for $184 per share, representing an enterprise value of roughly $3.1 billion. For perspective, Straight Path stock closed yesterday at just under $224 per share. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. But this shouldn't be entirely surprising. Recall that Straight Path's meteoric rise began in January, when the company reached a favorable settlement with the Federal Communications Commission amid allegations that it obtained certain spectrum licenses from the FCC under fraudulent circumstances. In addition to paying a $15 million civil penalty to the FCC, Straight Path agreed to pursue strategic alternatives to sell its remaining licenses, or be forced to pay an additional penalty and surrender them to the FCC. Thankfully for Straight Path shareholders, the stock skyrocketed 150% in a single day last month after it agreed to be acquired by AT&T (NYSE:T) for $95.63 per share, or an enterprise value of $1.6 billion. Then shares continued to climb in the subsequent weeks after the company fielded successively higher offers from an unnamed ""multi-national telecommunications company"" -- widely presumed to be Verizon -- with Straight Path giving AT&T several days after each offer to respond with its own superior proposal. Most recently, Straight Path shares popped another 33% on Monday, to around $212 per share, as investors hoped the bidding would climb even higher than what turned out to be Verizon's winning $184-per-share bid. That's not to say AT&T came out empty-handed; Verizon has agreed to pay its largest competitor the required $38 million termination fee on behalf of Straight Path. But considering Straight Path's wireless spectrum assets are expected to play a key part in the impending rollouts of 5G networks, it seems safe to say that Verizon was more than happy to foot that bill. As it stands, the final deal has been approved by the boards of directors of both Verizon and Straight Path, is expected to close within nine months (subject to FCC review), and will be completed as an all-stock transaction intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization. So with Straight Path shares now trading within 3% of the agreed acquisition price, shareholders can either wait for the transaction to close and receive Verizon shares in return or -- keeping in mind any sales between now and then will be subject to capital gains (or loss) tax treatment -- take their money off the table and put it to work elsewhere.

New Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has quickly taken action to loosen regulation on internet service providers (ISPs). After exempting ISPs with fewer than 250,000 subscribers from disclosing network performance, fees, and data caps back in February, the next proposal takes aim at net neutrality rules that were put in place in 2015. The debate has been dredged back up, but it may not be the same this go-around. New FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. Image source: FCC. Last month, Pai proposed scaling back regulation on ISPs and scheduled an FCC meeting on it for May 18. That regulation, now known as net neutrality, gives the FCC strict oversight and regulation of ISPs and puts them in the same category as utility companies. What is net neutrality? Here is the FCC's description: ""The FCC's Open Internet rules protect and maintain open, uninhibited access to legal online content without broadband Internet access providers being allowed to block, impair, or establish fast/slow lanes to lawful content."" In other words, your internet connection provider of choice, whether it's a cable company such as Time Warner Cable or a cellphone company such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ), cannot arbitrarily slow down, speed up, or block your connection based on what website you're on or how you're using the web. The new FCC proposal would still support an open internet, but specific net neutrality rules would be eliminated in lieu of a ""light-touch"" approach to oversight. The FCC invited comment from the public on the proposal in the period leading up to the May 18 meeting. Taking advantage of that invitation was comedian John Oliver, telling viewers of his comedy news show to use a website he set up, gofccyourself.com. The address took you to the FCC page where you could weigh in on the net neutrality debate. The day after the show, the FCC website went down, which it claims was not due to increased commenting volume but rather the result of a cyberattack. Funny business aside, this debate can be argued either way. Oliver, a champion of the net neutrality rules now in place, makes the point that if the FCC defangs itself, who would prevent ISPs from tampering with our portal to the internet? That's a valid concern, as there are cases of it happening  before the landmark ruling in 2015. And some of the ISPs could be more incentivized than ever to do so. Using Verizon as an example, the company bought AOL shortly after the net neutrality ruling in early 2015 and is closing in on purchasing Yahoo!. Some people worry the company, as a gatekeeper to the internet, could begin looking for ways to drive traffic to its new media sites. On the other side of the argument, there is concern that strict net neutrality rules have driven down investment in networks. However, ISPs have come out in support of net neutrality since the concept entered public awareness and have stated that the regulation doesn't affect how they invest in infrastructure. To back that up, Verizon and other mobile providers have been busy building out the infrastructure for next-generation networks called 5G. As part of this effort, Verizon bought out the ISP XO Communications for $1.8 billion last year and has followed it up this year with Straight Path Communications for over $3.1 billion. It hasn't all been about acquisitions either. Verizon recently signed a contract with Corning, a maker of materials for fiber optic line, for a minimum of $1.05 billion in new material through 2020 to help Verizon build its 5G infrastructure. Image source: Getty Images. I think the important takeaway here is that ISPs have moved on from this debate. They have found ways to continue expanding and improving internet service, so getting rid of net neutrality should theoretically be a non-issue. Many of them have also begun transforming themselves into media companies as well, diversifying revenue streams away from subscription internet services. Net neutrality or not, the plain-vanilla ISP business is as old and boring as a utility company. Should the rules cracking down on throttling of internet delivery be loosened, the ISPs should have already figured out by now that the ""tampering with the internet"" game isn't one they need to play.

    Is the Net Neutrality Debate as Important as It Used to Be? -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have rallied 30% since the beginning of the year, fueled by the company's robust growth in subscribers, revenue, and earnings. Wall Street expects those good times to continue, with 28% sales growth and 144% earnings growth this year. Netflix's strengths are easy to see -- it has an expanding lineup of critically acclaimed shows, its margins are improving as it relies less on licensed content, and its total paid subscribers rose 21% annually to 98.75 million last quarter. But investors should still be wary of one long-term threat which could throttle the growth of Netflix and other streaming platforms in the near future -- sponsored data. Image source: Netflix. ""Sponsored data"" refers to telecom companies like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exempting their own streaming content (or content from paid partners) from their own data caps. Critics claim that this strategy -- also known as ""zero rating"" -- violates net neutrality and gives ISPs an unfair advantage over streaming competitors if they evolve into media companies. AT&T and Verizon have already been making big investments in sponsored data. AT&T zero-rated its own streaming content from DirecTV and U-verse, enabling subscribers of its wireless and pay TV bundles to watch videos on multiple devices without worrying about data costs. AT&T also plans to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) once regulators approve the megamerger. AT&T recently added Time Warner's HBO as a free bonus to its unlimited wireless subscribers, and it might zero-rate that content for capped subscribers in the future as well. Last year, it launched FreeBee Data -- a platform that allows content providers to subsidize the data costs of streaming their content. Looking ahead, Verizon's planned acquisition of Yahoo's internet business -- which will be merged with AOL to create a new company called Oath -- will further expand that video ecosystem with fresh content. Over the past few years, ISPs noticed that customers were dumping their pay TV services in favor of broadband-only services to use with Netflix. This hurt ISPs in two big ways -- they were losing pay TV revenue and incurring higher expenses from hosting Netflix's massive streaming videos. Image source: Netflix. In response, the ISPs fired back by throttling Netflix's data transfers. Netflix protested the industrywide move, but eventually agreed to sign ""paid peering"" deals with AT&T, Verizon, and other ISPs to boost the network capacity of its streams. Those deals revealed that the ISPs still had tremendous leverage against Netflix -- controlling the pipes mattered more than controlling the content. This trend represents a long-term threat to Netflix, since people are watching an increasing number of streaming videos on mobile devices. Unfortunately, Netflix's two main responses to sponsored data programs haven't inspired much confidence. First, Netflix started throttling its own videos to 480p on AT&T and Verizon's mobile networks in early 2016, claiming that it was preventing users from exceeding their data caps. Second, Netflix allowed users to download videos to their devices for offline playback while they had a Wi-Fi connection. Unfortunately, those two fixes won't do much to counter ISPs if they zero-rate their own HD content. For example, AT&T could lure away Netflix subscribers, who might find it more appealing to simply subscribe to AT&T's internet and pay TV bundles -- which include DirecTV, HBO, and other major networks. Netflix certainly can't turn itself into a major ISP, so its best move is to simply produce more hit shows to lock in customers. But that strategy is getting pricey -- the company recently proposed a €1 billion ($1.09 billion) offering of senior notes for overseas investors to fund its original programs. Meanwhile, ISPs like AT&T and Verizon can simply use zero-rated content asloss leaders to gain wireless or pay TV subscribers. If the quality of Netflix's content starts slumping, it could lose customers to these carrier-backed streaming video ecosystems.  ","

Adam Levy,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The two largest U.S. cable operators are going to work together to take on the wireless telephone industry. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) entered an agreement that will allow them to collaborate as they both expand into wireless service. Comcast announced that its wireless service, Xfinity Mobile, will launch later this year. Charter may launch a similar service next year. Both will use Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireless network as well as public WiFi hotspots. The agreement stipulates that neither party can make an acquisition related to the wireless industry without the other's consent. So, if Comcast wanted to buy T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), for example, it couldn't do so without Charter signing off on it. It will also allow them to innovate more quickly since they'll share research and development, and leverage their combined forces in negotiations with Verizon or other wireless distributors for better rates. Image source: Comcast. The reason this agreement works is because Comcast and Charter will only sell their wireless service in the same markets where they sell television and internet service. That allows them to take advantage of existing marketing campaigns. Note that the service will work nationwide. The main strategy behind Comcast's Xfinity Mobile is to lock customers into bigger bundles and reduce subscriber churn. The pricing strongly incentivizes subscribing to Comcast's preferred bundle. Charter will likely offer something similar. The distinct territories in which Charter and Comcast operate means they won't be competing against each other for wireless customers. But their combined near-nationwide footprint means that they make a formidable competitor to the established nationwide wireless carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile. That makes the partnership not only viable, but a very smart move on the parts of Comcast and Charter. The stipulation that neither Comcast or Charter can make an acquisition without the other's consent means it's very unlikely either will get a deal done. It does open the door for a joint acquisition of a wireless provider, but that's somewhat farfetched. Importantly, it forces Verizon to look elsewhere for a tie-up. In the past, the company has been linked to both Charter and Comcast in merger and acquisition rumors. Ultimately, it should make Dish Network, with its treasure trove of wireless spectrum, that much more attractive to Verizon. That said, Verizon's management did recently say its network strength is just fine despite comments from T-Mobile's CEO that its network is slowing after launching an unlimited data plan. The move by Charter and Comcast also means T-Mobile isn't as big of a buyout candidate. Removing the cable giants from the table means it may try to merge with Sprint once again. The FCC blocked a merger last time, but the new administration has already proven to be much more lenient. It'll be interesting to see how the market plays out over the next year or so, now that companies are free to explore mergers and acquisitions following the quiet period induced by the FCC's 600 MHz spectrum auction. Investors hoping for an acquisition for either Verizon or T-Mobile just saw two big buyers practically take themselves out of the market. That's one reason it's always best not to invest based on acquisition rumors. ","

Thursday was a down day for the stock market, but major benchmarks recovered from much steeper losses earlier in the day. Political concerns bled into the financial markets in the morning session, and some pointed to uncertainty about the status of major government initiatives that investors have been quite pleased about in the recent rally. For the market as a whole, those concerns gave way to optimism about the prospects for the U.S. economy. But some pockets of weakness remained, and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ), and Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Shares of J.C. Penney dropped 7% on a tough day for the retail industry. Some of its department store retail peers, including Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Macy's (NYSE:M), reported ugly results. For Macy's, comparable-store sales declines of around 5% showed the pressure that even relatively healthy retailers are seeing, and Kohl's suffered a 3% drop in comps. Penney will report its results on Thursday, and investors will be watching to see if its strategic decision to start offering appliances and other new products will pay off not only in higher sales but also in greater profits. Given all the efforts that Penney has made recently, the retailer needs a win in order to reassure its shareholders that its long-term prospects are solid. Image source: J.C. Penney. Sears Holdings stock declined 10% after investors tried to digest irate comments from CEO Eddie Lampert at its annual shareholders' meeting on Wednesday. Lampert blamed negative media coverage for much of the difficulty that Sears has had in sustaining its business, including nervousness among suppliers and vendors that has led to more tense relationships. As J.C. Penney and its fellow retail industry players have seen, the environment for shopping mall anchor retailers has been extremely harsh, and it's not surprising to see Sears struggling at least as much as its counterparts. Nevertheless, shareholders didn't seem convinced by the argument, and the stock gave up some of the gains it made when Lampert and major institutional investor Fairholme Capital made substantial investments in Sears shares during March. Finally, shares of Straight Path Communications plunged nearly 21%. The communications company and holder of wireless spectrum assets said definitely that it would merge with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), accepting its $184-per-share bid over an earlier bid from Verizon rival AT&T (NYSE:T). It might seem odd that Straight Path fell on that news, but investors had sent the stock price well above the value of the Verizon bid, thinking that AT&T would increase its offer and start a longer bidding war. However, AT&T didn't make a higher counteroffer within the required period, and so traders who had bet on more upside took a substantial hit. Going forward, if the deal gets necessary approvals, Straight Path's spectrum will be of use to Verizon as it develops new advanced networks. Meanwhile, AT&T will pocket a termination fee and is likely seek other spectrum holders to beef up its own portfolio going forward. ","

"Anders Bylund, Chuck Saletta, and Brian Feroldi",05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Here at The Motley Fool, you can get started investing in the stock market with the help of our 13-step beginner's program. Choosing to invest at all is an important first step, so congratulations on making it this far! But what stocks should a new investor look at first? We asked three top contributors to The Motley Fool the same question. Read on to see why our panelists believe that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) belong in any brand-new investor's starting portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Chuck Saletta (Verizon Communications): Verizon's business runs the gamut in telecommunications. It operates lowly old wireline telephones, high-speed internet and cable delivered through a fiber optic network, and the wireless networks that connect cellphones and other mobile devices.  Even if you don't directly use its services, you've very likely both heard of the company and know someone who does. Verizon's broad reach and established market positions in fairly mature industries mean the market isn't expecting much growth from the company. In fact, analysts estimate about 2.5% per year earnings growth over the next five years, a small but positive anticipated upward trend. Fortunately, the market's modest expectations are also pretty well reflected in its market price. Verizon's shares are trading at around twelve times its forward looking estimated earnings. That reasonable valuation combined with a 5% dividend yield that's covered by both its past and expected earnings makes Verizon a company worth considering as an investment for a rookie investor. It probably won't set the world on fire with a tremendous total return. Still, its dividend should hand investors cash back on a regular basis, and there's a potential for modest value increases over time if its business delivers on that expected growth. Anders Bylund (Walt Disney): ""Never invest in any idea you can't illustrate with a crayon,"" said investing guru Peter Lynch. I can't think of a stock that fits this classic maxim better than Walt Disney. You don't need me to explain what Disney is, what the company does, or how investors can benefit from one of the strongest brands in the world. Grab a crayon and do it yourself. It's really that simple. Maybe it isn't immediately obvious how Disney wrings every last penny of investor value out of its core movie business. In short, excellent storytelling begets rabid fans. These highly committed fans won't think twice about spending money on Marvel and Pixar movie tickets, in the company's global network of theme parks and cruise ships, and on licensed merchandise such as T-shirts, lunch boxes, and bed sheets. This is what Disney does better than anyone else. It starts with top-quality movies and TV shows, and the company tends to lasso in its target audience at a young and impressionable age. Then it's just a simple matter of exploiting that brand loyalty from every possible angle. As long as the company's creative talent stays on board, I think just about anybody could run Disney effectively. The main gist of this business is immediately obvious to any beginning investor, and then you can learn all the finer details with a few Disney shares comfortably tucked in your pocket. It doesn't take much more than a crayon or two to explain the House of Mouse. Brian Feroldi (Home Depot): Retailers offer investors a simple business model that makes them a great place for new investors to search for their first stock. However, the retail world has recently been turned on its head as e-commerce companies continue to take market share. That's why it is important as ever for investors to be choosy about which retailer they buy. One retailer that continues to thrive is today's ever-changing environment is Home Depot. The home-improvement king sells products that are bulky and often needed immediately, which helps to protect its business from internet competition. When combined with Home Depot's operational excellence, strong brand, and knack for offering helpful customer service, it has had no problem cranking out strong quarterly results. Despite its massive size, there are reasons to believe that Home Depot's growth engine will continue to hum along from here. The housing market remains strong and the company's digital business continues to grow rapidly. When combined with its healthy share repurchase program and continued margin improvements, Home Depot's bottom line looks poised for double-digit growth. That's a compelling story for a company that dominates its industry and offers up a juicy dividend yield of 2.3%. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

Todd Campbell,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Megamergers aren't very common, but when they happen, the numbers involved are truly massive. For example, Exxon's $79 billion merger with Mobil doesn't even crack the top seven deals of all time in terms of value. Here's a list of seven deals that were bigger. Image source: Getty Images. In the late 1990s, mobile phones were becoming mainstream, and that was fueling excitement among telecom providers, including Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). Vodafone spent $60 billion buying AirTouch, a U.S. cellular company, in 1999, and subsequently, it launched a contentious battle to buy German telecom giant Mannesmann in 2000. Sadly, this big merger was a big dud. After Mannesmann rejected Vodafone's first offer, Vodafone had to nearly double its offer to about $180 billion to get this deal done. Unfortunately, the combination didn't work out the way Vodafone hoped, and as a result, it had to write off tens of billions of dollars in the following years because of it. Image source: Getty Images. Before blazing-fast Internet was offered by cable companies, most Americans used their landline phone service to access the Internet via America Online, or AOL. Founded by Steve Case, a technology visionary, AOL became one of the biggest technology companies in America, and that success led to media giant Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) forking out a staggering sum to acquire it in 2000. Unfortunately, broadband Internet access ultimately left AOL's dial-up service in the cold, and big differences in culture caused major problems integrating the two companies. Synergies (and growth) that had been promised never materialized, and eventually that caused large write-offs. Ultimately, AOL was spun off with market value of only $3.5 billion. Image source: Getty Images. Remember how Vodafone bought AirTouch in the late 1990s? Well, shortly thereafter, it cut a deal with Bell Atlantic -- now Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ)-- to combine AirTouch with Bell Atlantic's wireless business to create Verizon Wireless. Verizon Wireless went on to become a dominant force in U.S. wireless services, and in 2013, Vodafone sold its 45% stake in it to Verizon for $59 billion in cash and $60 billion in Verizon shares. That's a pretty good return on the $60 billion Vodafone initially spent on AirTouch. Image source: Getty Images. RFS Holdings was a three-bank consortium spear-headed by Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS) that acquired the Netherlands banking powerhouse ABN Amro right before the global financial crisis (talk about bad timing!). RBS, the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, and Banco Santander paid the now unbelievable sum of three times book value to acquire ABN Amro in 2007. RBS landed ABN Amro's London investment banking business, plus some Asian operations. Fortis got ABN Amro's Dutch banking, asset management, and private banking businesses. Santander walked away with assets in Italy and Brazil. The bad timing -- and the steep price -- made this acquisition a big bust. Fortis ended up being nationalized, and two big bailouts left the British Treasury owning two-thirds of RBS. In addition to writing off assets acquired in the ABN Amro deal, RBS has lost an astonishing 58 billion pounds since 2008. Image source: Getty Images. Combining these two companies created a brewing behemoth boasting over $55 billion in annual sales that's responsible for nearly 3 of every 10 beers sold worldwide. But, since this deal only happened last year, it will be a while before we know if it's a success or a failure. AB InBev (NYSE:BUD) and SABMiller were forced to sell some of their brands to secure regulatory approval for their tie-up, but the deal has made AB InBev a much bigger player in emerging markets, including China, and the company thinks those markets will be a big driver of future growth. Only time will tell if sales growth in the Middle Kingdom and beyond ends up justifying this deal's lofty cost. Image source: Getty Images. Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) acquisition of Warner-Lambert in 2000 created the planet's second-biggest drug company, but it wasn't just scale that was behind this deal. Pfizer's interest in Warner-Lambert was driven predominately by Warner-Lambert's top-selling cholesterol drug, Lipitor. Pfizer had commercial rights to Lipitor, but Pfizer was splitting profits on it with Warner-Lambert, and in 1999, Warner-Lambert sued Pfizer to end their licensing pact. Pfizer's acquisition removed the risk of losing out on Lipitor, and since Lipitor's sales ended up growing from about $5 billion annually to more than $13 billion annually, gaining full control over it was smart -- especially since this acquisition was an all-stock deal. Image source: Getty Images. When AT&T (NYSE:T) announced its acquisition of BellSouth in 2006, it emphasized billions of dollars in potential cost savings, but Cingular Wireless -- the wireless company shared by the two telecom providers -- was the real reason behind this combination. In the mid-2000s, Cingular Wireless was the biggest wireless provider in the U.S., with 54 million customers. AT&T owned 60% of it, so it was already a big beneficiary of Cingular's success. However, AT&T recognized that telecom market was moving toward a convergence of television, computers, and wireless accessibility, and that made acquiring the remaining 40% of Cingular that BellSouth owned very important to it. Today, smartphones and tablets are commonly used to access entertainment wirelessly, and  AT&T's mobility segment represents 43% of the company's total revenue. In my book, that makes this a smart deal for AT&T. ","
      
    The 7 Biggest Mergers of All Time (Exxon Didn't Even Make the List) -- The Motley Fool

Keith Speights,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett would be the first to admit that not every stock pick he makes is successful. Although most of the holdings in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio have done pretty well this year, there are several stocks that haven't. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) currently rank as Buffett's worst stocks of 2017 so far. Here's why. Image source: The Motley Fool. Verizon has been Warren Buffett's worst stock by far in 2017. Shares of the telecommunications provider have fallen 13% year to date. To Buffett's credit, though, he sold most of his stake in Verizon in the fourth quarter of 2016. His current position in the stock doesn't even amount to a rounding error in Berkshire's financial figures, making Verizon the smallest stake Berkshire has in any company. The big problems for Verizon are that its revenue and earnings are declining. Verizon's wireless business is especially struggling. After holding out longer than its major rivals, the company finally decided to offer unlimited data plans to wireless customers in the first quarter. That could help Verizon keep more of its subscribers and even attract new ones. I don't expect Buffett to buy more shares anytime soon, though. General Electric (GE) stock is down close to 9% so far in 2017, making it Buffett's second-worst stock of the year. Unlike Verizon, though, GE's bottom line improved considerably in the first quarter compared to the prior year period. So why have GE shares dipped? The primary issue for the blue-chip industrial giant is that its industrial cash flow from operations (CFOA) for the first quarter was $1 billion below expectations. One reason for the CFOA shortfall was lower receivables, in part due to delinquent accounts in regions such as the Middle East. Another relates to timing of contracts. GE also had lower healthcare sales than expected, which resulted in less reduction of inventory. Like GE, IBM stock is down around 9% this year. Buffett was once enchanted with the technology company, but that's not the case anymore. He recently announced that Berkshire had sold roughly one-third of its stake in IBM. Why has Warren Buffett lost confidence in the tech company? He says that he was overly optimistic about how IBM would perform and now values the stock lower. IBM is still very profitable and generates huge revenue, but both its top and bottom lines have declined in recent years. The company does expect to return to earnings growth this year, but revenue will remain sluggish. UPS' share price has fallen around 8% in 2017 so far. That's not too concerning for Buffett, however, since Berkshire has only a small stake in the package delivery giant. The reason behind UPS' dismal year-to-date stock performance stems from its disappointing fourth-quarter 2016 results announced in late January. Revenue grew, but adjusted operating profit for the company's U.S. domestic package and supply chain & freight businesses decreased from the prior-year period. Even though UPS beat revenue and earnings expectations with its first-quarter 2017 results, it wasn't enough to serve as a big catalyst for the stock. Phillips 66 stock is down around 7% this year. It could have been worse for Buffett, though. The oil company's shares were down more than 12% in April. A poor performance in the fourth quarter of 2016 hurt Phillips 66 earlier in the year. The company badly missed earnings expectations due in large part to higher costs. However, Phillips 66 rebounded in the first quarter of 2017 -- handily beating the consensus analysts' estimate thanks to solid results from its chemicals business and higher midstream earnings. Although these stocks have declined in 2017, it probably doesn't bother Warren Buffett much. He's more concerned about the fundamentals of each company's business than temporary movements in the share prices. I suspect that most, if not all, of these stocks will make Buffett and Berkshire plenty of money over the long run. His stock picks usually do. ","

Mark Hulbert,05182017,MarketWatch,05112017,"Published: May 16, 2017 4:48 p.m. ET A look at whether low-volatility stocks will continue to live up to their impressive past By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — Some skeptics recently have argued that low-volatility stocks are forming a bubble that’s about to pop — and financial advisers therefore need to stop recommending them to their clients. And since a lot is riding on this disagreement, it’s important to get to the bottom of it. Low-volatility stocks are those that have exhibited low levels of historical price volatility. Though there is no one way in which analysts define volatility, the definition used by the late Robert Haugen — the finance professor who devoted much of his three-decade academic career to documenting the impressive performance of such stocks — is the standard deviation of monthly returns over the trailing two years. Such stocks exhibit two characteristics that make them valuable to investors. The first: They tend to continue being low volatility and less risky than the overall market. In fact, one of the strongest patterns statisticians have documented in the stock market is the high correlation between a ranking of stocks based on their volatility in one period and a ranking based on their volatility in a subsequent period. This means that investors can reliably expect that a portfolio of stocks with low past volatility will continue to exhibit low volatility. The second notable characteristic of low-volatility stocks is even more extraordinary: In the past they on average performed every bit as well as the market as a whole, if not better, and significantly better than the highest-volatility stocks. Professor Haugen was met with considerable skepticism when he first reported this result, since it flew directly in the face of what Finance 101 taught us about the relationship between risk and return. But this pattern was the consistent finding of a number of subsequent studies, both of U.S. stocks but also of stocks around the world. Taking these two characteristics together, it meant that you could equal the market, if not beat it, while incurring substantially below-market risk. That’s a winning combination. No wonder that financial planners have been urging low-volatility stocks to their risk-averse clients. Imagine such an investor who has previously concluded he should allocate only 50% of his portfolio to the broad stock market. For ease of illustration, assume that this client has allocated the other 50% of his portfolio to a money-market fund. To appreciate what low-volatility stocks can do for this investor, consider the iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA ETF

                                   , which is the largest of the several ETFs that invest in such stocks in the U.S. Its beta is 0.74, according to MSCI, which means that it historically has fallen 26% less than the S&P 500 during bear markets. Yet since the index’s inception in 1988, it has produced a 10% annualized return, versus 9.74% for the S&P 500. Assuming the future is like the past, that client could instead invest 68% of his portfolio in the USMV and incur no additional risk. But his return would be dramatically better, since 18% of his portfolio that was otherwise earning a money market rate would now be earning an expected rate of 10.0% annualized. But will the future continue to be like the past? That is the $64,000 question, since no strategy works forever in the wake of ever-increasing popularity. One adviser who believes we’ve reached that point is Richard Moroney, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts. Earlier this month, he wrote to clients that low-volatility stocks are in a bubble, since their average P/E ratios currently are much higher than in the past. For an additional perspective, I checked in with Nardin Baker, who co-authored with Professor Haugen many of the seminal research studies into the performance of low-volatility stocks. Baker currently is Chief Strategist at South Street Investment Advisors in Boston; he previously was a global equity manager at Guggenheim Partners. Mr. Baker acknowledged in an interview that low-volatility stocks today are trading at higher valuations than they often have in the past. But, Mr. Baker quickly added, that doesn’t mean the low-volatility approach isn’t still compelling. That’s for two reasons. The first: Low volatility isn’t merely a proxy for low P/E. If that were the case, then it would be more alarming that low-volatility stocks are now trading for higher P/E ratios. But the low-volatility approach is more than that. To be sure, there have been times in the past when the lowest-volatility stocks also sported some of the lowest P/Es. This was the case in the early aughts, for example, when value stocks dominated the low-volatility universe. But in recent years the low-volatility universe has drawn fairly evenly from both the value- and growth-stock camps, and as a result such stocks’ average P/E has risen. But that’s no reason to conclude that the low-volatility approach has stopped working. The second reason that Mr. Baker argues the low-volatility approach remains compelling: Such stocks would have to trade at much higher valuations before it would be rational to avoid them. Imagine, for purposes of illustration, that low-volatility stocks in the future lag the S&P 500 by a percentage point per year. That would represent a change, of course, since historically such stocks have equaled or beaten the broad market. But notice that they would still handily beat the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis: They will forfeit 10% of the market’s return while immunizing followers from 26% of the risk. That means you still will be able to improve your long-term returns, without any additional risk, by increasing your allocation to low-volatility stocks. How much more expensive would low-volatility stocks have to become before they would no longer hold out the potential of beating the broad market on a risk-adjusted basis? Mr. Baker estimates that their average P/E ratios would have to be 30% higher than the S&P 500’s before this would be the case. Since they currently are just 5% higher, Mr. Baker concludes that low-volatility stocks still have a lot to offer. To be sure, none of this discussion should be taken to mean that P/E ratios don’t also matter. Between two low-volatility stocks between which you are otherwise indifferent, the one with the lower P/E would certainly seem the better alternative.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 on Thursday to advance a Republican plan to reverse the Obama administration’s 2015 “net neutrality” order. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wants the commission repeal the rules that reclassified internet service providers as if they were utilities. He thinks the open internet rules adopted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, were unnecessary and harm jobs and investment. “We propose to repeal utility-style regulation,” Pai said on  Thursday. “This is the right way to go.” Stocks of major internet providers rose on Thursday. The public will have until mid-August to offer comments before the FCC votes on a final plan. Pai wants public input on whether the FCC has the authority or should keep its “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. Pai declined on Thursday to commit to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” He added he would make public a final proposal before a final vote. Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who voted against the plan, said the end game appears to be an internet without FCC regulatory oversight. She said the proposal “jeopardizes the ability of the open internet to function tomorrow, as it does today.” Many companies and Republicans think Congress should pass legislation clarifying the FCC’s role to resolve a decade-long dispute over internet regulations. The FCC, which has already received more than 1 million comments, is also seeking comment on whether U.S. states should be able to set their own internet regulations governing broadband privacy and other issues. Providers insist they will not engage in blocking or throttling even in the absence of rules, but critics are skeptical. U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat, said “it will take millions of people standing up, just like they did before, to say that the internet needs to stay free and open. That’s what it will take to win.” ","

                TIMELINE-S&P Telecommunications index dwindles to four companies | Reuters"
,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 Telecommunications Services Sector index as-we-know it may have to hang up on investors, as its creators are considering a restructuring of the once-hot index which has shrunk to just four companies from 14. After years of consolidation and diversification, today’s telecommunications sector would be unrecognizable to investors in the index, which was created in 1996. The index could be three stocks in the third quarter. “The telecom sector has evolved,” said David Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman of the Index Committee, S&P Dow Jones Indices. “We have been discussing how these changes are impacting the market and expect to consult with investors in the near future.” Back in 1996, AT&T’s network carried long-distance calls over the wired network. Verizon Communications - then called Bell Atlantic - made most of its money connecting local calls. Cellphones were a luxury for many, and companies were still figuring out how the internet might be most useful. Fast forward to 2017, telecom companies are desperately trying to diversify with non-traditional services like TV and home security as they are now largely dependent on the highly competitive cellphone and internet industry for revenue. Mergers will further shrink the percentage of revenue from traditional telecommunications as AT&T Inc - the sector’s biggest company - has eyes on media company Time Warner Inc. Regional telecom operator CenturyLink Inc plans to buy Level 3 in the third quarter, a deal that would leave the index with just three companies. Unlike the other 10 sectors, the S&P 500 telecom segment is so small there is not a single exchange-traded fund (ETF) that mirrors it because a fund holding just a few stocks would fall short of regulatory requirements. Instead, the telecom ETFs that do exist include smaller telecom companies outside the S&P 500 and firms in the technology industry. The index currently represents just 2 percent of the S&P’s market value down from 9 percent at its peak in 1999. But the path to reorganizing the index is not so clear cut for S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc, which together manage the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) industry taxonomy for indexes. MSCI declined to comment. S&P Dow Jones Indices is a venture of S&P Global Inc and CME Group Inc. Options could include an expansion of the current index with competitors such as cable operators or an absorption of telecom companies into another S&P sector such as consumer discretionary, technology or utilities. The telecommunications sector’s biggest competitors in the S&P 500 are cable operators Comcast Corp and Charter Communications, while media rivals include online services such as Netflix Inc. These companies are in the consumer discretionary index. But cable companies are regulated differently and have different service offerings than telecom companies, so they may not be an exact match for a new index. Including AT&T and Verizon in the consumer discretionary index would be a massive change for that sector as AT&T would be the second biggest company by market value behind only Amazon.com, while Verizon would be the fourth biggest company, just behind Home Depot. Since slow-growing telecom operators are notable for their high dividend yields, some investors including David Haviland, managing partner at Beaumont Capital Management in Needham, Massachusetts, say they should be added to the utilities index. So far, investors have not been banging on S&P’s door looking for an elimination of the sector, according to S&P’s Blitzer. But many do question its relevance. “Four companies does not a sector make,” said Haviland, who uses the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund for telecom exposure. “The viability of a three-company sector is highly questionable.” ","

Going public allows Altice’s founder, French billionaire Patrick Drahi, to expand his budding U.S. cable empire by giving Altice USA public stock it can use to finance more acquisitions. Asked what U.S. assets he would look at, Drahi told reporters at a meeting on Tuesday that he considered cable expansion a priority, followed by mobile and content. “We’re too small in cable to go into mobile at the moment.” Altice is the fourth-biggest U.S. cable provider, with 4.9 million customers. It completed its $17.7 billion acquisition of Cablevision last June, after buying Suddenlink for $9.1 billion in 2015. Altice has said it is considering ways to enter the wireless business as other cable providers prepare to offer mobile services. “We are having discussions on lots of different types of alternatives out there,” Dexter Goei, chief executive of Altice USA, told reporters on Monday in remarks embargoed for Tuesday. Goei called the partnership between the two companies “interesting and innovative,” adding, “we’re clearly not the types of people to sit back and watch.” Asked whether his company would consider joining the Comcast-Charter alliance, he said, “I don’t think there is a necessity for us to join anything today.” Altice USA’s parent company also said on Tuesday it planned to rebrand Optimum, formerly known as Cablevision, and Suddenlink, as well as most of the other businesses under its umbrella, as Altice by mid-2018.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, May 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed China Mobile Limited's (CML) Long-Term Foreign-Currency and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A+'. The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Dominant Mobile Market Position: The ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that CML would be able to maintain its dominant position in China's mobile market over the medium term due to its significant economies of scale, robust financial position and solid execution ability. In 2016, CML's mobile service revenue market share remained high at 67%. At end-April 2017, it controlled subscriber share of 64% and 68% for all mobile and 4G services, respectively. The company also utilises its strength in mobile services to develop its broadband business, controlling a subscriber share of 28% at end-April 2017, based on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's data. Government-Directed Tariff Cuts: Further tariff reductions directed by the government may affect CML's revenue and EBITDA growth in 2017. However, we believe that the overall impact should be manageable for CML, as we expect to see continued favourable price elasticity. We believe this round of government-directed tariff cuts is less severe than the previous round in 2015. Chinese operators each pledged to substantially reduce dedicated internet access tariffs for small- and medium-sized enterprises and international long-distance call tariffs, and from 1 October 2017, cease to charge domestic long-distance and roaming fees for their mobile subscribers. Solid Profitability: We expect CML's EBITDA margin to remain solid at around 35%-36%, despite some pressure in 2017 due to utility- and labour-cost inflation and increased competition on 4G from the other two Chinese operators. CML's EBITDA margin rebounded to 36% in 1Q17, from 34% in 4Q16, after higher year-end customer retention and faster phasing-out of domestic long-distance and roaming fees in 2H16. We expect rising data demand, lower handset subsidies and improvement in the tower company's efficiency to help mitigate margin pressure. Declining Capex: CML's pre-dividend FCF margin should expand to over 14% in 2017-2019 as capex decreases. Fitch expects the company to continue to accumulate excess cash despite an increase in dividend payout ratio to 46% from 43%. CML will cut capex in 2017 to CNY176 billion as 4G investment declines. We forecast further capex cuts in 2018 and perhaps 2019. CML may start to spend on 5G capex slightly earlier than the other Chinese operators. However, we believe the majority of China's 5G capex is some years away; investment may start from 2019 at the earliest, but initial 5G spending is likely to be limited. Constrained by Sovereign Ratings: CML's ratings are constrained by China's sovereign rating (A+/Stable) as CML is ultimately controlled by the state. CML's standalone rating is 'AA-'. CML is 73%-owned by China Mobile Communications Corporation, which is 100%-owned by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. DERIVATION SUMMARY CML's standalone rating of 'AA-' remains the highest among all Fitch's telecoms credits, but its rating is constrained by China's sovereign ratings (A+/Stable). CML has significantly stronger market position and more substantial net cash position than its global peers. Its credit profile remains stronger than that of global and local telecoms peers, including China Telecom Corporation Limited (A+/Stable), Singapore Telecommunications Limited (A+/Stable), SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (A-/Stable), Telekom Malaysia Berhad (A-/Stable), Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable) and AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative). KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - around mid-single digit revenue growth with rising data revenue offsetting the decline in voice revenue - operating EBITDAR margin at 43%-44% in two to three years - capex of CNY176 billion in 2017 and CNY160 billion-190 billion in 2018-2019 - dividend payout ratio at 46% RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A positive sovereign rating action Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to a Downgrade of the Standalone Rating to 'A+' - Reversal of its net cash position - Pre-dividend FCF margin falling below 8% on a sustained basis - Operating EBITDAR margin falling below 40% on a sustained basis CML has high rating headroom and Fitch therefore does not envisage a downgrade of the standalone rating to 'A+' from 'AA-' over the medium term. As CML's ratings are constrained by the sovereign's rating, any downgrade of the sovereign will lead to a corresponding downgrade in CML's ratings. LIQUIDITY Abundant Liquidity: At end-December 2016, CML's unrestricted cash balance of CNY426 billion far exceeded its interest-bearing borrowing of CNY5 billion. CML has no maturities due before October 2017. Debt Structure: Its debt totalled CNY5 billion at end-2016 (end-2015: CNY5bn), which consisted of the unsecured long-term bonds guaranteed by China Mobile Communications Corporation due in 2017.

Billy Duberstein,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Only a little more than a month ago, Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP) stock was at $36 per share. Last week, however, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) agreed to buy the company in an all-stock deal for $184, a whopping 404% premium to where the little-known, nine-employee company was trading on April 7. That's because AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon were involved in a bidding war for Straight Path's high-band spectrum assets, which may be the building blocks of a future 5G network. As I previously wrote, AT&T and Verizon are competing to assume pole position in the 5G race because their core wireless businesses are in trouble, due to the incredible success of low-cost provider T-Mobile. AT&T and Verizon are still much bigger so they are attempting to leverage their scale to be the leader in the next wave of innovation and differentiate their service based on quality. Right now, both Sprint and T-Mobile have upgraded their networks to a similar level of quality as the bigger players, so that advantage has waned. It is perhaps fitting that Verizon won this bidding war, as the new 5G is most crucial to its future. 5G is also important to AT&T, but the company has more diversification than Verizon, with a large media arm due to its acquisition of Direct TV and the pending acquisition of Time Warner, a larger enterprise fiber network, and a growing Latin American division. T-Mobile has promised a 5G network by 2020 as well. It believes that it will be able to deploy 5G on the low-band spectrum it purchased in the government auction this winter, when it spent $8 billion for lots of low-band 600 MHz spectrum. It's still unclear how comprehensive that network will be, however. Verizon, however, seems to be betting on leading technological innovation of the core network. There is still a debate about what 5G is and what it will mean. Perhaps the most bullish and intriguing thesis is that 5G could eventually replace cable companies' fixed broadband delivery. That would be an incredible boon for companies with 5G capabilities and a potential danger for players such as Comcast and Charter, which dominate this space. Interestingly, those two companies recently teamed up to offer wireless service and coordinate on similar technology platforms going forward. This is intriguing, and could be due to this potential threat as wireless operators move into cable and vice versa. Image source: Getty Images. Cowen & Co.'s analyst Colby Synesael recently discussed this phenomenon in a 25-minute video, in which he concludes that 5G could very well be a cable killer, but will not arrive until 2020 or later, and then only in developed countries such as the U.S. Also, the 5G buildout is likely to be complex and expensive. In the presentation, he notes that 5G will initially incorporate millimeter-wave spectrum (the kind that Straight Path owned), but will eventually be available on all spectrum waves. The government is likely to open up even more spectrum for 5G deployments in the years ahead. One might ask, then, why Verizon just paid $2.2 billion for these spectrum assets, when 5G will eventually become available on mid-band spectrum as well. Probably because even at $2.2 billion, the price paid for Straight Path's spectrum amounted to a rate of less than a penny per megahertz per person. This is in contrast to the recent auction the Federal Communications Commission held for the 600 MHz band, where that spectrum went for $0.93 per MHz-POP. So, Verizon is paying up now to likely be the first -- though not the only -- company to build out 5G, which will require this millimeter-wave spectrum for the first part of the network. Verizon shelled out $2.2 billion in stock for spectrum that will allow it to be a leader in the race for 5G. It's still unclear how much this will mean for its network superiority and its earnings in the 2020s, but investors need to keep an eye on the 5G race, as it will likely transform many big industries as we know them.

Brian Stoffel,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If there was one class of stocks retirees could always count on to provide regular income in the past, it was telecoms. While the investments in infrastructure these companies have to make are onerous, the businesses had huge moats: the aforementioned costs, long-term contracts, and -- often -- government sanctioned monopolies. However, over the last 20 years, that's all been turned on its head. In the age of mobile communications, landlines are a liability -- not an asset. And yet, the two telecoms we're matching up today -- Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) -- still have huge dividends: both yielding over 8%! Image source: Getty Images. Which is the better buy? That's an impossible question to answer with 100% certainty. But as you'll see below, there are three key ways we can approach the question. That should help give us clarity as to which is a better deal at today's prices. Simply put, there's nothing more important than a company's sustainable competitive advantages -- often referred to as its ""moat."" A solid moat is what differentiates a company from the competition and promises to keep it that way for the foreseeable future. As I said at the outset, the barriers to entry in telecom are high, as infrastructure costs are onerous. Since both of these companies are established players, that doesn't really serve as a differentiator. Frontier used to be primarily focused on landline businesses in rural America. Obviously, that's a dying business -- and so it has expanded out by focusing on two areas: providing Internet services to businesses, and buying up the Internet properties of AT&T and Verizon in Connecticut, Texas, California, and Florida. Unfortunately, those acquisitions aren't panning out very well, with the company losing customers at a brisk clip. CenturyLink also focuses on providing Internet and voice services. But its plan to acquire Level3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT) shows a shifting strategy. With the acquisition, CenturyLink would become one of the largest Internet providers in the nation -- able to sell its Internet capacity to rivals for a premium. While I'm not terribly excited about either company's moat, I think CenturyLink's is much wider as Frontier's, as the latter's inability to hold onto customers from its acquisitions shows just how narrow the moat is. Telecom investors make a crucial trade-off: They're willing to buy companies that have heavy debt-loads because there's lots of free cash flow (FCF) coming through that's passed on to them in the form of dividends. But it's still important to keep cash on hand. That's because every company, at one point or another, will experience difficult economic times. Those with cash on hand have options: to buy back shares on the cheap, continue paying a dividend, or even make strategic acquisitions. Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite boat, forced to figure out ways to stay solvent. Keeping in mind that CenturyLink is valued at over eight times the size of Frontier, here's how the two stack up. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow CenturyLink $0.2 billion $18.7 billion $0.6 billion $1.1 billion Frontier $0.3 billion $17.5 billion ($0.5 billion) $0.6 billion Data source: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance. To be honest, both of these balance sheets look pretty awful: very little cash, and a mountain of debt. Additionally, while there is FCF coming in, it's hardly enough to give investors confidence that the companies would be unscathed in the face of an economic downturn. Finally, we have valuation. While we don't have a one-size-fits-all metric to compare any two companies, we can use multiple data points to make an informed analysis. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend Yield FCF Payout CenturyLink 11 12 N/A 8.7% 107% Frontier N/A 3 N/A 12.4% 126% Here we have a very interesting case. Both stocks appear to be very cheap. But it's important to note that for most investors, it's all about the dividend. And in terms of dividend sustainability, neither appears to be doing quite well. Frontier slashed its dividend recently, and both CenturyLink and Frontier have paid out more in dividends over the past 12 months than they have brought in from FCF. That's not sustainable, and it should make investors think twice before falling in love with those outsized dividend yields. That being the case, I'm going with Frontier, here. Despite its recent payout reduction, and even though the company's FCF isn't terribly impressive, the stock is priced so incredibly low -- at three times FCF -- that there's a lot of pessimism already baked into the stock's price. So, there you have it: We've got a tie. Both stocks look cheap, have questionable balance sheets, and pretty narrow moats. But whenever there's a tie, I always side with the company with stronger competitive advantages. In this case, that's CenturyLink. If you're looking for outsized dividends, it might be worth investigating CenturyLink, but I also suggest you find companies that have more sustainable payouts for your portfolio. ","

The company of course still pays taxes, but if it advertises four lines for $160, that's actually the price consumers pay for the service. That's much different from how the other wireless companies operate, two of which -- AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) -- also sell cable and internet service. Legere, who never misses a chance to mock his two big rivals, went right after them in a press release when T-Mobile's offer was introduced. He was only speaking about wireless; he made no mention of cable or internet, though he might as well have: Wireless consumers pay billions extra every year in added surcharges, taxes, monthly fees and carrier price hikes. It's reached epidemic proportions! And, the carriers just keep inventing new ways to make their customers pay. Below are five of the most egregious ways many cable, internet, and wireless companies may be charging their customers more than their advertised prices. These aren't the only tricks up these companies' sleeves, but they are the most common -- and probably the most expensive. You don't have to rent a cable modem. Image source: Getty Images. In many cases cable companies, including Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), charge a monthly rental fee -- generally between $6 and $10 a month -- to rent a cable modem. What many cable providers don't explicitly tell you is that this is not a mandatory charge. Instead of renting a modem and paying its full cost many times over its lifespan, you can buy your own. The companies that offer modem rentals generally have Web pages that list alternatives, and some smaller players will actually sell you one up front at a fair price if you elect to buy it. For consumers, this is a no-brainer. Cable modems generally cost under $100, and while it's not fun to pay that up front, it makes a lot more sense than spending that much or more each year. Many cable companies charge extra fess for broadcast networks and sports channels that are not optional. Image source: Pixabay. Another cable and satellite add-on fee, the broadcast network fee is an attempt by these companies to recoup the money they pay to retransmit ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX. The problem with this fee, which is generally between $2 and $5 (though it can be more), is that it's not disclosed when companies advertise prices. For example, a cable or satellite company may advertise a $99-per-month package offering 100 channels. What they neglect to mention is that you won't actually pay $99 a month, or even $99 a month plus tax, because the broadcast network fee is added on on top of the base price. Overage fees have amounted to billions in profits from AT&T and Verizon. Image source: Getty Images. While unlimited plans have started to make overage fees a thing of the past, many AT&T and Verizon customers who opt for metered data plans still pay them. An overage fee is a charge consumers pay when they use more than their allotted data amount. Sometimes consumers aren't even notified they have gone over, nor are they offered the option of simply waiting until the next month before using any more data. AT&T and Verizon have made billions by charging consumers overage fees -- and convincing customers to buy more data than they need in order to avoid those charges. Now, in the cable space, Comcast is getting in on the game: In some markets, it caps internet usage and charges overage fees when subscribers exceed that allotment. Some cable companies charge extra mandatory fees for sports networks they also own. Image source: Comcast. Much like the broadcast network fee, the regional sports fee is a charge that some cable and satellite providers add to the base price they advertise. In this case, the added charge goes toward paying for regional sports networks, some of which are owned by the cable companies themselves. This fee may be even more egregious than the broadcast fee, because many of the people forced to pay it would simply choose not to get these channels if that were a choice. Instead, consumers are forced to pay a few extra dollars each month for channels they may not watch -- and in some cases, that money goes directly to the same company selling them pay television.

    4 Sneaky Fees You May Be Paying to Your Wireless, Cable, or Internet Provider -- The Motley Fool

Billy Duberstein,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investors in the telephone or cable industries have had a tumultuous year -- unless they've picked a very small handful of winners. Telecom giants AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) have been hit hard by low-priced upstart T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and are now in the midst of a vicious pricing war despite the existence of only four national carriers. Cable companies have been able to grow with increased broadband use, but those with large media arms have been hit by the cord-cutting phenomenon resulting from the rise of streaming services. Given these headwinds, most of the industry is looking hard at acquisitions to expand capabilities and lower costs. Now that a certain milestone has passed, the time for acquisitions may be now. Let's look at who may be flirting with whom. Image source: Getty Images. The end of March marked the end of a multistage wireless-spectrum auction. Wireless companies agreed to pay $19.77 billion for 70 Mhz of spectrum that television broadcasters sold for around $10 billion. The government -- which pocketed the spread -- compelled broadcasters to sell, since wireless had the need and many people now receive their broadcast channels by cable or satellite. This spectrum auction was a long process, and during the bidding period, telecom and cable companies weren't allowed to speak with each other about bidding strategies, mergers, and acquisitions. Now that it's over, telecom companies can talk to each other about hooking up. The company in the catbird seat is T-Mobile. It's earned a reputation as a low-cost disrupter in the space, and its stock has increased 60% in the past year. T-Mobile and Sprint (NYSE:S) tried to merge in the recent past, but the Obama administration preferred to keep the number of wireless-carrier choices at four instead of three. Now that the more business-friendly Trump administration is in power and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is in charge, the common wisdom is that more mergers will be allowed. On the recent quarterly earnings call, T-Mobile CEO John Legere pointed to M&A as a potential benefit to both T-Mobile's own business and its customer, but reiterated that the company didn't need to do something: ""[F]irst of all, we should be clear that there are strategic possibilities between wireless companies, cable players, adjacent industries, Amazon, internet players that should be thought about, because they drive great value for shareholders and also new opportunities for customers. So there definitely are some things that are intuitively obvious."" [Transcript via Seeking Alpha.] Legere specifically pointed to Sprint as having ""an awful lot of scale and a good customer base,"" and to DISH Network as having ""access to good content and spectrum."" DISH, for its part, has been amassing a collection of spectrum that it will have to use by 2020 or face penalties. The company said it's planning to build an Internet of Things network with its spectrum, but it's still in the early planning stage. Since the company's main business of satellite cable is declining, it may be a better option to get acquired. Sprint's parent company recently indicated Sprint is open to a merger with T-Mobile or some other deal with another partner. At the same time, Comcast announced plans to sell its own wireless plans on Verizon's networks, so it's possible those companies may look to merge. That would be a blockbuster, but if AT&T's merger with Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) goes through, why not? Charter Communications is also planning a wireless partnership with Verizon and speculation has swirled about a tie-up. The bigger the deal, the more difficult it would be to get through the FCC, even a business-friendly one. Finally, there are small companies with spectrum assets. Given the recent bidding war for Straight Path Communications, these companies may also be targets going forward. One is Globalstar, and its spectrum that works well with small cells, which helps with densification, or serving places with lots of people. There is also private Ligado Networks, which is building a network geared toward the Industrial Internet of Things for transportation fields. Given Verizon's purchase of Fleetmatics, which provides fleet-management software, in 2016, that may be an interesting combination as well. Much of this is speculation, and investors shouldn't buy a stock just because they think it will get acquired. However, investors interested in the space should watch closely, because whatever happens, the telecom industry is likely to look much different in a few years. ","

Daniel B. Kline,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Things have not gone as planned for Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) since the company acquired Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) for $10.54 billion. In the just-over-a-year since that deal closed, the company has met its cost-savings targets, but it has struggled mightily with revenue and holding onto customers. Those problems have led to a massive decline in the company's share price, which, as you can see on the chart below, has collapsed. None of these problems have discouraged CEO Dan McCarthy, who remains relentlessly optimistic even as his company's picture gets bleaker. It's not that the CEO is delusional, he just strongly believes that despite his company's struggles, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. ""During the quarter, we continued to realize our targeted efficiencies and synergies, and I am also pleased to have achieved our third consecutive quarter of improved FiOS gross additions in the California, Texas and Florida markets,"" he said in the first-quarter earnings release. ""We are executing on a number of initiatives with the goal of enhancing customer experience, reducing churn, stabilizing revenues and generating cash flow."" That's a very rosy read on another quarter where the company lost paying subscribers and saw revenue drop. McCarthy may be able to turn his company around, but there are significant hurdles that could bring Frontier down. Image source: YCharts. McCarthy has done a good job of managing expenses and exploiting the synergies created by the Verizon deal. He has created over $1 billion in annual cost savings, but that number won't mean anything if the company keeps bleeding subscribers. Frontier has lost customer in all four quarters it has owned the CTF properties. McCarthy first blamed that on the switchover from Verizon, then a lack of marketing, and most recently, an effort to clear non-paying customers from the company's books. Those excuses all seem valid, but if the company can't stabilize and then start adding paying customers, the reasons will no longer matter. Frontier bought the CTF properties to give it scale, and so far, that has paid off in operational savings, but continued drops will jeopardize the entire operation. While it has struggled, Frontier has kept shareholders happy by paying a dividend. That isn't going away, but it iss getting a lot worse. The company's board has authorized both a 15 for 1 reverse stock split and a cut in its dividend from $0.105 to $0.04 per share, beginning with the dividend payable on June 30, 2017. That's a sort of double-whammy of bad news that could cause shareholders to say enough is enough. Frontier exists in all of its markets as a secondary choice for customers fed up with the major players in the cable and broadband markets. That could serve the company well as consumers cut the cord with pay television but still need to keep a broadband provider. The risk the company faces in that area is that a number of companies are testing what could be considered national, alternative sources of broadband. There may not be an imminent risk in this area, but any new competition in offering internet service will drive prices down and cost Frontier market share. In addition, while McCarthy's company has a marketing edge in simply not being one of its well-known, little-liked-by-consumers cable/internet/phone giants, it would not have that edge over a technology company. This is sort of a vague threat hanging over every broadband provider, but the creation of a new rival in providing internet service could be a finishing blow for Frontier. ","
      
    3 Things That Could Bring Frontier Communcations Down -- The Motley Fool

"Rich Duprey, Tyler Crowe, and Travis Hoium",05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're a dividend investor, by definition, you're looking to earn an income from your stocks today. But equally important, if not more so, is ensuring that the companies you buy will be strong performers tomorrow, too. The goal should be to get paid day in, day out, for the life of your portfolio. So, we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to highlight dividend stocks they believe are not only great investments now thanks to their payouts, but will give income-seeking investors great returns for years to come. Read on to find out why they think Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE), and Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) fit the bill. Image source: Getty Images. Travis Hoium (Verizon): A great dividend stock has consistent cash flow from operations and a business with a strong competitive advantage. As a wireless leader in the U.S., Verizon is in a great position on both fronts. The chart below shows Verizon's net income and cash flow from operations over the last five years, and while there's been a decline recently as promotional activity picked up, the company is a cash flow machine. VZ Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts Verizon's advantage has always been its network, which has long been superior to those of competitors like Sprint, T-Mobile, and even AT&T in most of the country. What makes its business great is its continuing investment in new network technology. The next step is the build-out of its 5G network, which it plans to launch on a trial basis this summer. That will make wireless connections available for billions of new connected devices, from cars to wearables. And each one will pay to use the network. Verizon's cash flow and the potential for 5G networks in the future make this a great dividend stock for tomorrow. And with a 5% dividend yield today, it's an stock every investor can get behind. Image source: Sempra Energy. Tyler Crowe (Sempra Energy): The more quarters that go by, the more I think I was initially wrong about Sempra Energy. The electric-and-gas company is looking to become more than just a run of the mill regulated utility that keeps its head down. Instead, it is making massive investments in utilities outside the U.S., as well as branching out into other energy-related businesses such as LNG exports. I had my doubts that the company could pull off the multibillion-dollar expansion it planned without either getting into debt troubles or needing to do some accounting wizardry. Over the past few quarters, though, it has become clear that management timed the execution of these projects well enough that earnings and cash flow growth are keeping pace with their ambitious spending plan. With $900 million in natural gas pipelines coming on line in the second quarter, Sempra will free up lots of cash to plow into its next big venture: The Cameron LNG export terminal. According to management, this project -- along with several other regulated utility upgrades, and a large investment portfolio to expand Mexico's energy infrastructure -- should boost earnings per share by 10% to 11% annually until 2021. Based on that, investors have been told to expect annual dividend raises in the 8% to 9% range over the same time frame. Over the past 10 years, Sempra Energy has more than doubled its dividend -- it yields roughly 3% at the current stock price -- and it looks like there is plenty of growth in the works to keep up that pace for quite some time. I may have been wrong about Sempra in the past, but I'm warming to the idea that this is a utility stock you'll want to own in the future. Image source: Whirlpool. Rich Duprey (Whirlpool): Appliance makers like Whirlpool aren't typically thought of as ""technology companies,"" but as the Internet of Things continues to expand into all facets of our life, even the most mundane of manufacturers will eventually need to embrace the digital age. This maker of ovens, refrigerators, and washing machines is grabbing the future with both hands. Whirlpool is the world's biggest major appliance manufacturer, with approximately $21 billion in annual sales and some of the most recognized brands in the industry, including KitchenAid, Maytag, Amana, Jenn-Air, and, of course, its own name products. In recent periods, it has put an increased emphasis on the connected kitchen and developing the smart appliances of the future that will help ease the tasks of cooks everywhere. Emblematic of that commitment is its recent purchase of personalized digital recipe platform Yummly. While that acquisition isn't material to its business, one thing Whirlpool can get out of the purchase (beyond its 20 million registered users) is an extension  of its appliances' usefulness. Those machines are already connecting with Amazon.com's voice-activated virtual assistant Alexa and its Dash automatic replenishment service; offering scan-to-cook technology that automatically downloads correct cooking instructions to your stove, oven, or microwave when the user scans in a product's UPC code; and giving you the ability to control appliances from anywhere in the house. Whirlpool's stock trades at just 10 times next year's earnings estimate, which analysts' average forecast places at around $17.38 per share, a 15% rise year over year. Its dividend of $4.40 annually currently yields 2.4%. Based on its present strength and its embrace of the future, the appliance maker could be one of the best dividend stocks for tomorrow.

    The 3 Best Dividend Stocks of Tomorrow -- The Motley Fool

  "
Dan Caplinger,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When a stock soars, investors take notice. In those extremely rare cases when a company's share price climbs 400% or more in a single year's time, it points to the sort of extraordinary circumstances that make many wonder if those gains are just the beginning of an even bigger rise. With that in mind, it makes sense to take a closer look at recent multibaggers Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP), Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI), and Tellurian (NASDAQ:TELL), to try to figure out whether further big gains are likely in their futures. STRP data by YCharts. Straight Path Communications has posted almost exactly a 400% return over the past 12 months. That sharp rise came as a shock to many investors, who had gotten used to the holder of wireless spectrum license assets trading in a relatively sedate manner. That all changed in April, when AT&T (NYSE:T) made a bid to purchase Straight Path in a deal that sent the stock up 150% in a single day. Many believed that AT&T's $96 per share bid would be a fitting end to Straight Path's efforts to divest its spectrum assets. Yet rival Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) came in with an even bigger bid, and after a few rounds of a bidding war, Verizon ended up with the final deal at $184 per share. Investors had briefly hoped that another bid would come in, but AT&T bowed out, which makes it unlikely that Straight Path will see any further gains before its acquisition by Verizon is completed. Image: Straight Path Communications. Elsewhere in the technology world, Applied Optoelectronics provides fiber-optic networking services to the telecommunications industry. Much of the stock's gain of nearly 700% over the past 12 months stemmed from the rise in demand for its services, which have become increasingly relevant as enterprise customers look to implement data centers and other cloud-computing based solutions. Solid performance from the business has built momentum for the stock, and investors now expect a round of upgrades by telecommunications providers could spur dramatic additions in capacity for fiber-optic networks. Most recently, Applied Opto's first-quarter results showed a doubling of data center revenue, and overall gains of 91% on the top line. Strong profits have also helped bolster the stock, and the company's management continues to have upbeat views about its prospects. With implementation of new fiber optic assets likely, Applied Optoelectronics has many investors excited for what could become a long period of strength for its core business. Finally, Tellurian managed to bounce back from adversity, rising almost 650% over the past year. Yet alone among these three stocks, Tellurian hasn't yet recovered all of its lost ground since 2014. Even after its huge gains recently, shares of the liquefied natural gas specialist are down more than 40% over the past three years. The explanation relates to the way in which Tellurian stock became available to the public. Last August, the then-privately held company did a reverse merger with Magellan Petroleum, which was already publicly traded. As a result, it was Magellan's stock-price history that Tellurian had to overcome. With the move, Tellurian shareholders gained exposure to the Driftwood LNG project in Louisiana, and big players in the energy industry have paid attention. In November, General Electric's (NYSE:GE) oil and gas division made a $25 million preferred stock investment in Tellurian, and Total (NYSE:TOT) followed suit in December, spending more than $200 million for an almost one-quarter equity stake in the LNG specialist. Tellurian isn't expecting to start construction of Driftwood until next year, and production there might not start until 2022. But investors think that the project could be extremely profitable, although the speculative nature of the company right now has made Tellurian shares quite volatile. You won't often find stocks that quintuple, but when you do, it's worth taking a closer look. Of the three, Applied Optoelectronics seems to have the clearest prospects for future growth, but the potential rewards from Tellurian are also quite extensive. ","

,06012017,Reuters,05252017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc has built a reputation as a scrappy underdog by offering cell service with no contracts and cheap prices. Now it’s aiming for another title: America’s No. 1 wireless carrier. That might seem a stretch for a cell-phone company long known for its lousy coverage outside of major cities. But over the past five years T-Mobile has been on a buying binge to extend its reach. Bankrolled by a $3 billion break-up fee from a failed 2011 merger with AT&T Inc, it has snapped up wireless airwaves in states ranging from New York to Washington. Suddenly, T-Mobile, the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier, is within striking distance of market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T, at least when it comes to delivering nationwide coverage. OpenSignal, a London-based startup that measures network experience based on data from users of its app, said in February that T-Mobile and Verizon were tied in speed rankings in the last quarter of 2016. Testers found a Verizon signal 88 percent of the time; T-Mobile’s network availability was just two percentage points lower. T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray says the bulk of the country will soon have access to its network. “There’s nothing that stands between us delivering and matching, if not beating, Verizon and AT&T’s coverage,” Ray said in an interview with Reuters in May. Verizon and AT&T still maintain a hefty lead when it comes to retail subscribers, each boasting around double T-Mobile’s 55 million users. They also have higher profit margins. Still, T-Mobile’s client base has been growing steadily. Its share of retail subscribers grew to 18 percent in the first quarter of 2017, up from 10 percent in the same period in 2012, according to data from financial services firm Barclays. And when it comes to users who pay a monthly bill, the industry's most valuable customers, T-Mobile has grown that segment for four straight years, while Verizon and AT&T lost monthly subscribers in the first quarter of 2017. T-Mobile’s German majority owner Deutsche Telekom AG, which owns roughly 65 percent of the U.S. carrier, says T-Mobile is now positioned to call its own shots as it plots its course in the United States. “We decide what, when, and how,” Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges said at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. That includes T-Mobile remaining a stand-alone carrier. But the real intrigue in telecom circles is about a possible merger or acquisition. Rival Sprint Corp , America’s No. 4 carrier, has expressed interest in a tie-up. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, Sprint’s controlling shareholder, was prepared to give up control to do a deal with T-Mobile, sources familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters in February. Cable companies, too, could be interested as they roll out wireless services to bundle more products together. In January, John Malone, whose Liberty Broadband Corp is the largest stakeholder in Charter Communications Inc, raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy T-Mobile. The buzz has boosted T-Mobile’s stock price, which is up nearly 60 percent from a year ago. First-quarter profits hit $698 million, or 80 cents per share, up 46 percent from a year earlier and well ahead of analysts’ expectations. The success of T-Mobile, which has dubbed itself the “Un-carrier,” can be attributed partly to its straight-up approach to mobile. It was the first major carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has continued to badger rivals, most recently with its unlimited data plans. But copious data and fast speeds are pointless if mobile users can’t get a signal. Verizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, says T-Mobile still has a lot of catching up to do. Chief network officer Nicola Palmer pointed to data from testing firm RootMetrics, which has called Verizon the clear U.S. leader in coverage and reliability. Some T-Mobile customers, too, say their service isn’t what it should be. Austin, Texas-resident Abbie Scheider, an avid camper, says she’s out of luck in the woods of central Texas. “I never have service even when others do,” the 24-year-old ad agency account executive said. “It’s frustrating for sure.” T-Mobile’s big push to boost coverage began in 2012 when it received cash plus spectrum from a failed merger with AT&T. The U.S. Justice Department in 2011 sued to block the deal on concerns it would harm competition. Facing the prospect of a lengthy regulatory battle, AT&T walked away. T-Mobile subsequently picked up spectrum from a 2013 merger with Texas-based MetroPCS Communications, followed by a 2014 asset swap with Verizon. Its most ambitious effort yet came in April when it committed $8 billion to become the biggest spender in a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves. The purchase, which T-Mobile executives refer to as the “mother lode,” will strengthen the company’s presence this year across the western United States, including Arizona, Montana, Texas and Wyoming. And T-Mobile isn’t done yet. Like its competitors, the company is pushing into so-called fifth generation wireless or 5G, a new network that is expected to offer higher speeds and lower response times. While it continues to invest in its network, T-Mobile says it is open to considering various strategic options. Company officials have acknowledged interest in talking with Sprint. At an investor conference in May, T-Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said Sprint’s spectrum was a “treasure trove that you could do amazing things with.” A Sprint spokeswoman declined to comment. Industry executives and analysts said T-Mobile has shown that it can go it alone, giving it leverage as it enters any discussions. “We want to be a global leader in this space,” Ray said. “That’s the plan and now the capability we have for T-Mobile.” ","

,06012017,Reuters,05252017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, May 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed China Mobile Limited's (CML) Long-Term Foreign-Currency and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A+'. The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Dominant Mobile Market Position: The ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that CML would be able to maintain its dominant position in China's mobile market over the medium term due to its significant economies of scale, robust financial position and solid execution ability. In 2016, CML's mobile service revenue market share remained high at 67%. At end-April 2017, it controlled subscriber share of 64% and 68% for all mobile and 4G services, respectively. The company also utilises its strength in mobile services to develop its broadband business, controlling a subscriber share of 28% at end-April 2017, based on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's data. Government-Directed Tariff Cuts: Further tariff reductions directed by the government may affect CML's revenue and EBITDA growth in 2017. However, we believe that the overall impact should be manageable for CML, as we expect to see continued favourable price elasticity. We believe this round of government-directed tariff cuts is less severe than the previous round in 2015. Chinese operators each pledged to substantially reduce dedicated internet access tariffs for small- and medium-sized enterprises and international long-distance call tariffs, and from 1 October 2017, cease to charge domestic long-distance and roaming fees for their mobile subscribers. Solid Profitability: We expect CML's EBITDA margin to remain solid at around 35%-36%, despite some pressure in 2017 due to utility- and labour-cost inflation and increased competition on 4G from the other two Chinese operators. CML's EBITDA margin rebounded to 36% in 1Q17, from 34% in 4Q16, after higher year-end customer retention and faster phasing-out of domestic long-distance and roaming fees in 2H16. We expect rising data demand, lower handset subsidies and improvement in the tower company's efficiency to help mitigate margin pressure. Declining Capex: CML's pre-dividend FCF margin should expand to over 14% in 2017-2019 as capex decreases. Fitch expects the company to continue to accumulate excess cash despite an increase in dividend payout ratio to 46% from 43%. CML will cut capex in 2017 to CNY176 billion as 4G investment declines. We forecast further capex cuts in 2018 and perhaps 2019. CML may start to spend on 5G capex slightly earlier than the other Chinese operators. However, we believe the majority of China's 5G capex is some years away; investment may start from 2019 at the earliest, but initial 5G spending is likely to be limited. Constrained by Sovereign Ratings: CML's ratings are constrained by China's sovereign rating (A+/Stable) as CML is ultimately controlled by the state. CML's standalone rating is 'AA-'. CML is 73%-owned by China Mobile Communications Corporation, which is 100%-owned by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. DERIVATION SUMMARY CML's standalone rating of 'AA-' remains the highest among all Fitch's telecoms credits, but its rating is constrained by China's sovereign ratings (A+/Stable). CML has significantly stronger market position and more substantial net cash position than its global peers. Its credit profile remains stronger than that of global and local telecoms peers, including China Telecom Corporation Limited (A+/Stable), Singapore Telecommunications Limited (A+/Stable), SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (A-/Stable), Telekom Malaysia Berhad (A-/Stable), Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable) and AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative). KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - around mid-single digit revenue growth with rising data revenue offsetting the decline in voice revenue - operating EBITDAR margin at 43%-44% in two to three years - capex of CNY176 billion in 2017 and CNY160 billion-190 billion in 2018-2019 - dividend payout ratio at 46% RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A positive sovereign rating action Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to a Downgrade of the Standalone Rating to 'A+' - Reversal of its net cash position - Pre-dividend FCF margin falling below 8% on a sustained basis - Operating EBITDAR margin falling below 40% on a sustained basis CML has high rating headroom and Fitch therefore does not envisage a downgrade of the standalone rating to 'A+' from 'AA-' over the medium term. As CML's ratings are constrained by the sovereign's rating, any downgrade of the sovereign will lead to a corresponding downgrade in CML's ratings. LIQUIDITY Abundant Liquidity: At end-December 2016, CML's unrestricted cash balance of CNY426 billion far exceeded its interest-bearing borrowing of CNY5 billion. CML has no maturities due before October 2017. Debt Structure: Its debt totalled CNY5 billion at end-2016 (end-2015: CNY5bn), which consisted of the unsecured long-term bonds guaranteed by China Mobile Communications Corporation due in 2017.

Michael J. Kramer,06012017,Investopedia,05252017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A hotly debated topic among tech dealmakers has been how much Yahoo Inc.'s (YHOO ) assets are worth. The new holding company for Yahoo will have its work cut for it after the company sells its search and other assets for an estimated $4.5 billion to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). If that deal is completed this month, Yahoo will shed its name and the holding company will be called Altaba Inc. How do you pronounce that new name? Al-ta-ba or Al-taba? That's a mouthful. No matter how you pronounce it, Altaba will operate as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The question every investor should ask themselves is this. Will the old Yahoo - under a new name - be good at managing the assets? YHOO Market Cap data by YCharts As of March 31, the company reported an investment in Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) of $41.3 billion and an ownership interest in Yahoo Japan of $9.3 billion.  Yahoo beneficially owns 15.4 percent of Alibaba, representing 383.5 billion ordinary shares. Alibaba has a market cap as of June 1 of $310.99 billion, which would mean that Yahoo's current stake in Alibaba is roughly $47.89 billion. Yahoo Japan has a market cap of roughly $25.4 billion. Yahoo owns a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, representing a current market value of around $9.02 billion. YHOO Long Term Deferred Tax Liabilities (Quarterly) data by YCharts It seems like a no brainer right? Yahoo's current market cap - before the Verizon deal -  is $48.10 billion, and its stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is worth $56.91 billion. So Yahoo currently trades for less than the market value of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Then throw in that Yahoo shows cash and short-term marketable securities of $6.91 billion, then add the sale from Verizon of roughly $4.5 billion, it bring Yahoo's cash value to $11.41 billion. That takes the valuation for Yahoo up to $68.32 billion. YHOO Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts As of March 31, the company reported deferred tax liabilities for its Alibaba investment of $16.7 billion; this represents nearly 40 percent of the value of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba of $41.3 billion. As of December 31, Yahoo reported deferred tax liabilities of $13.6 billion, while its investment stake was $33.6 billion, representing 40 percent of the value of the stake. With a $48.10 billion valuation on its Alibaba stake, its tax deferred liability, using the same 40 percent, would be $19.46 billion. The company lists other long-term tax liabilities at $519.95 million. Also, the company recently announced a stock buy-back program of $3 billion. So based on these liabilities, how much is Yahoo worth then? It may be less than the current valuation the market is assigning to it. There's a big ""IF"" in all of this. First, can Yahoo figure out how to avoid the tax bill from its Alibaba stake? If not, and Altbaba has to pay that bill at some point, then you can subtract $20 billion from the value of its investment stake in Alibaba.

Many retirees are attracted to large-cap dividend stocks for their hefty yields, and because their size and name recognition give many an impression of safety. If only investing were so easy. Last week, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shed almost 8% after earnings, joining IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) as significant laggards in an otherwise strong earnings season. These companies have the same basic problem: They have traditionally been able to charge exceptionally high prices for their products and services, but customers are becoming savvier, especially in tech, and smaller competitors are offering solutions rivaling the quality of ""price leaders"" -- at much lower price points. In response, all three companies are investing in next-generation technologies and acquiring smaller businesses to reposition themselves for the future. Let's examine each in greater detail. Source image: Getty Images. Cisco has long dominated enterprise hardware. While the company has acquired its way into greater diversification, it still makes 45% of its revenue from its core switching and routing hardware. These segments are currently under attack due to the rise of software-defined networking. Rival vendor Arista Networks has come out with its own switches geared for the data center. Its powerful EOS software allows the company to use the latest, most cost-effective hardware components to run its switches. In contrast, Cisco has long used custom chips developed in-house to run its switches, which is more expensive. Cisco has even reportedly contemplated selling its switching software separately in order to compete on ""whitebox"" solutions, as its data center segment fell 5% last quarter. Cisco also faces pressure on its wireless segment, which contributed 5% of revenue in 2016. Low-cost vendor Ubiquiti Networks is rolling out its Unifi Elite service this quarter, aiming to poach Cisco's enterprise-class clients with lower-cost offerings. Any loss of share there could also put pressure on Cisco's enterprise switching as well. While Cisco is touting growth in software, security, and services, its forecast of 4%-6% revenue declines reveals increased pressure in its core. IBM has long talked up its ability to run mission-critical functions for the largest organizations. The company makes mainframes, where sensitive company data and records are stored, and its consulting wing was the go-to for any advanced IT project. The rise of cloud computing and software-defined systems, however, posed a threat to IBM's core mainframe, consulting, and integration businesses. A turning point came in 2014, when IBM lost a huge contract with the Central Intelligence Agency, which switched to Amazon's cloud services in order to foster open collaboration between agencies and save money at the same time. The contract proved ultra-high-security entities could move to the cloud and away from locked-in data centers run by companies like IBM. IBM countered the loss with the acquisition of cloud-storage provider SoftLayer, and has been vigorously attempting to become a force in cloud ever since. In the most recent quarter, IBM marked impressive cloud growth of 35% year over year. The problem is, total revenue from its technology services and cloud platforms segment declined 2% and gross profit margin declined 200 basis points. That means either IBM is merely converting existing on-premise customers to its cloud, or it's losing more legacy customers than it's gaining new ones. IBM has spent years developing Watson, its cognitive artificial intelligence product, and its cognitive computing software segment grew 5% in the first quarter. Still, that only made up roughly 20% of revenues. With most other segments declining, the company will have to grow its new initiatives faster than it currently is able to. Verizon is slightly different from Cisco or IBM, but has long benefited from the same advantage -- having the highest-quality, most advanced solution, which allowed the company to price its offerings expensively. The problem for Verizon is that lower-cost wireless companies T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint have networks that are getting closer to Verizon's. Sprint is running ads with Verizon's old pitchman, taunting that its network quality was within 1% of Verizon's. Meanwhile, T-Mobile has been acquiring spectrum while forcing Verizon to go with an unlimited data plan, which has apparently also slowed down Verizon's leading network. In response, Verizon is acquiring digital-media businesses such as AOL and Yahoo!, telematics businesses like Fleetmatics, and next-generation 5G infrastructure with XO Communications for fiber, and Straight Path Communications for millimeter-wave spectrum. However, the segment, which includes digital media and telematics, generated only 5% total revenue last quarter. Meanwhile, the wireless segment, which makes up over half of Verizon's revenue, declined 5.2%. Investors in these companies likely own them for safety and yield, but none are buy-and-forget companies right now. It's possible today's growth seeds will become big moneymakers in the future, but investors won't know that for years. Meanwhile, it's possible these companies are facing a long, secular decline. Investors should be aware of both possibilities and tread carefully. ","

Daniel B. Kline,06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Proprietary content can keep customers loyal. That's the logic behind Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) ill-fated go90 platform. The problem, and it's a big one, is that creating content people actually want presents major challenges. In addition, go90 launched at a time when consumers have an unprecedented amount of content to choose from. Verizon, which spent $200 million on content for the service and another $80 million marketing it in 2016, according to Business Insider, also made the mistake of entering a market already owned by YouTube. go90 was an attempt to lure millennials, a generation particularly resistant to craven marketing efforts. It was an attempt that was badly off base and failed quickly. go90 still exists, but it has been dramatically scaled back, with 155 full-time staff losing their jobs in January, Deadline reported. Verizon hoped to lure young people in with go90. Image source: Getty Images. When it blows hundreds of millions of dollars on an idea that never had any hopes of working, a company like Verizon won't admit it made a mistake. Instead, it releases a statement like this one: Our focus with go90 and our Verizon digital media efforts are to fulfill our strategy of leveraging Verizon content investments, enhancing user experience, and strengthening our advertising infrastructure. Fulfilling this strategy has resulted in some duplicative resources and has required organizational changes impacting 155 employees as we consolidate offices in Los Angeles, San Jose, and New York. That's a whole lot of corporate gobbledygook to avoid saying what a terrible idea spending so much trying to create viral videos was. Of course, shareholders and the 155 who lost their job were probably delighted to hear that ""these changes are not indicative to a change in our strategy."" The biggest mistake Verizon made with go90 was attempting to launch it based on spending big. It would have made more sense to take a slower, more grassroots approach. That's how Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Hulu, and Amazon.com entered the content game. Verizon instead had the hubris to assume that it could throw money at the problem and millennials would be easy to lure in. That would seem to be the case given the enormous volume of highly watched yet awful content on YouTube, but that platform had the advantage of being first. At best, go90 was a me-too player in an already crowded field, and in reality it was never really a player at all. In addition, breaking into episodic programming and viral videos requires both talent and luck. All of the aforementioned platforms, as well as the broadcast networks and cable channels that produce original content, sometimes fail with shows that deserve an audience. There was no reason to believe that Verizon -- even a deep-pocketed Verizon -- would have quick and easy success in the content space. It's easy to see why Verizon wants to have a draw beyond a high-priced wireless service. The advantage its network once had over lower-cost rivals Sprint and T-Mobile has shrunk, taking away what has been its key marketing pitch. Owning content that people want to watch would be that draw. The problem is that creating content that keeps people paying for a service that costs more than its rivals isn't easy. HBO, Netflix, and very few others have been able to achieve that. Maybe in time go90 would have gotten there, but it doesn't seem likely. ","

"Travis Hoium, Timothy Green, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Long-term investing is often talked about in terms of a few years in today's stock market. But at The Motley Fool, we love to find stocks we can hold for decades and make money on over the very, very long term. We asked three of our contributors which stocks they want to own for the next 50 years, and SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) made the top of their lists. Reuben Gregg Brewer (SYSCO Corporation): SYSCO Corporation is the largest food distributor in the United States, serving restaurants, schools, and hospitals, among other customers. It also operates in Canada and Mexico, and recently bought a large European food distributor to expand its reach into a new market. Food distribution is a highly fragmented industry with ample opportunity for SYSCO to do ""bolt-on"" deals, which have been its bread and butter for decades. The company has faced two notable problems, lately. The first was a failed attempt to buy US Foods, one of SYSCO's largest U.S. competitors. The hope was to achieve cost savings through that deal that would improve SYSCO's margins, which had been falling since 2010. Weak margins in an already low-margin business is the second big problem. With the deal scuttled, however, SYSCO has renewed its focus on improving its own operations. And that's led to a notable operating-margin improvement over the last year. SYY Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. SYSCO is clearly aware of the problem, is dealing with it, and achieving success. That's actually not so surprising from a company that's increased its dividend for 47 years and counting. The dividend-growth rate has slowed to about the rate of inflation over the last few years, but over the past decade, the annualized growth rate has been roughly twice that level. With a solid 2.5% yield, as well as a long history of successfully expanding via acquisition in a fragmented industry and rewarding investors along the way, SYSCO is the type of company you can own for a very long time. Tim Green (McDonald's): Restaurants, perhaps more than any other type of business, come and go. The industry is brutal, with no barrier to entry driving intense and unending competition. But McDonald's is no ordinary restaurant. The company has been around for decades, and its business model of having most of its restaurants run by franchisees is wildly profitable. McDonald's earned $4.7 billion of net income last year on $24.6 billion of revenue. Image source: McDonald's. In order to thrive for another 50 years, McDonald's will need to change with the times. McDonald's now offers delivery through the UberEATS service in some cities, and it plans to roll out mobile ordering and pickup to all of its U.S. restaurants by the end of the year. McDonald's is a laggard when it comes to digital strategy, but it's aiming to catch up quickly. If I had to bet on any restaurant chain being around in 50 years, it would be McDonald's. The company is nearly recession-proof, with its focus on low prices driving sales in even the worst of times. Revenue dipped slightly in 2009 during the financial crisis, but it quickly recovered, and the bottom line was completely unaffected. McDonald's has thrived during its first 50 years, and it will likely do the same for decades to come. Travis Hoium (Verizon): Besides food and housing, I think one thing that will be similar 50 years from now as it is today is data flowing through the air wirelessly, and then being disseminated to other people or things. Maybe it'll be phone calls, or maybe it'll be data from self-driving cars, or maybe personal drones will need to communicate with central command wirelessly. Whatever it is, I think Verizon is well positioned to be at the center of that wireless-communications future. You can see below that Verizon is essentially tied with AT&T as the most profitable U.S. telecommunications company. This gives Verizon a powerful position in a market with very few players and the cash flow needed to upgrade its network, when necessary. VZ Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Over the next few years, we'll see Verizon's strong position playing out as it rolls out a 5G network, starting with an 11-city pilot by the end of this year. Meanwhile, Sprint and T-Mobile don't plan on rolling out 5G until 2019. As more devices become connected and the Internet of Things grows, Verizon's network will become more and more valuable. Fifty years from now, this still will be a company that will likely be making tons of money for investors. And getting a 5% dividend yield in the meantime is a nice way to generate cash from a great long-term investment. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Hold for the Next 50 Years -- The Motley Fool

  "
Travis Hoium,06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Sprint (NYSE:S) are two of the biggest mobile network operators in the U.S., but they are very different companies for investors. Sprint is the low-cost provider trying to disrupt the market, while AT&T is the decades-old behemoth that's now expanding into mobile television. Which stock is the better buy for investors today? Here's a look at how they stack up against each other. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has one of the biggest and best wireless networks in the U.S., rivaled only by Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in scale and quality. Sprint's network isn't quite as good, which everyone knows and forces Sprint to compete mostly on price. If it can't offer customers lower prices than AT&T or Verizon, it simply can't compete. Being the cost leader may not necessarily be a problem if it weren't for the fact that wireless companies leverage their scale to make money and have to constantly invest billions of dollars into network upgrades. And if you have lower margins than your competitors, you also have less money for upgrades. That brings us to the difference in these two companies' scale. The chart below does a good job of showing the difference between Sprint's and AT&T's pricing power and their total assets. AT&T's sheer scale shows how much it's invested in its network advantage and the higher margin is the result. T Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Sprint has chipped away at some of that advantage as 4G wireless networks have aged and the difference between networks has subsided. But that gap is about to open again. Where Sprint will have real difficulty competing is when 5G networks start to launch later this year. AT&T has said it will have 5G in at least 20 metro areas by the end of 2017, and Sprint doesn't have plans to enter the 5G market until at least late 2019. That will give AT&T a huge head start in signing up high-end customers willing to pay a premium for 5G speeds. Then there's the DirecTV acquisition by AT&T that allows it to offer a more complete wireless and digital service across the country. It can now bundle services together like cable companies did with TV, internet, and phone. Except this time around, all of those services will be wireless. In telecommunications, AT&T is just a better company today. Its roomier balance sheet is a big advantage, as shown by much higher margins. And it's investing more in future technologies than Sprint has the ability to do. To top it off, the stock's dividend yields 5.1%, a nice payout for owning a company built to last in a world going more mobile every day. ","
      
    Better Buy: AT&T, Inc. vs. Sprint -- The Motley Fool

Brian Stoffel,06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. As our lifespans increase in the 21st century, our nest eggs need to provide for a longer time frame. This is a good problem to have, but it does present unique challenges. Image source: Getty Images. Retirements often last over two decades. Remembering that, here are the two big reasons I believe retirees should look elsewhere for their dividends. One of the things I look for in an investment is redundancy. That means when shocks hit the company, it can emerge stronger than it was before. There are two key metrics to measure redundancy: On both fronts, American Tower falls short. Currently, the company has $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents, but over $17 billion in debt. That means in times of stress, its highly levered balance sheet would be a liability. But it's customer concentration risk that really concerns me. American Tower relied upon AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile for 21%, 15%, 11%, and 9% of their sales in 2016, respectively. And if we look at the trends, this has been the case for a while. American Tower's Reliance on the ""Big Four""Create column charts Think about it: All it would take is one decision by one committee -- or even one person -- at one of these companies to drastically affect both American Tower's business, and its stock price. Sudden downward swings in prices are not a retiree's friend. Of course, you could rightfully argue that American Tower is without substantial peer, that these companies would be foolhardy to abandon American Tower, and its moat is wider than I'm letting on. Many of the contracts in place, after all, are long term in nature. To that, I would say two things. First, consolidation in the industry is a bad thing for American Tower, but there are hints that it might already be happening. When one more customer is eliminated, the amount paid to American Tower will surely drop. Second, there are plausible scenarios that could make American Tower obsolete over the next two decades. While several technology companies have experimented, for instance, with beaming down Internet connectivity from unmanned solar drones, who's to say the same couldn't eventually be done for wireless telephony? The possibility for a leap-frogging technology could undermine American Tower's expansion abroad -- particularly in Brazil and India. To get my gist, imagine the possibilities that PC makers imagined for international expansion back in the early 2000s. But then, they were leap-frogged by smartphones. Today, virtually all Internet users coming online in emerging economies do so from mobile devices. The fact of the matter is that American Tower is relying upon the status quo -- in terms of wireless connectivity -- to remain exactly the same. And in today's communications field, that's not a great stance to have. The company's mission is ""to make wireless communication possible anywhere."" That's actually a great mission statement, but the company's business is almost entirely dependent upon land-based towers to transmit signals. Such an approach doesn't lend itself to flexibility, adaptability, or the possibility of ""multiple futures"" in the face changing industry dynamics. When you're counting on your nest egg to continue providing for you until -- at least -- 2037, I think there are better dividend-paying bets for your retirement dollars. ","
      
    1 Terrible Stock for Retirees -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With the stock market hovering near all-time highs, it can be a smart idea to think a little defensively in your portfolio. However, that doesn't mean you need to give up your growth potential if the market keeps rising. Blue chip dividend stocks have historically performed better than their non-dividend counterparts during tough times, and many have outperformed the overall market over long time periods. With that in mind, here are five of the largest dividend payers in the market, all of which pay out more than $5 billion per year to shareholders and could make excellent additions to your portfolio now. Company Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Annual Dividends Paid ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) $81.55 3.8% $12.9 billion AT&T (NYSE:T) $38.12 5.1% $12.0 billion Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $52.41 2.9% $7.6 billion Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) $87.25 3.2% $7.2 billion International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) $152.49 3.9% $5.6 billion Data source: CNBC and author's calculations. Stock prices, dividend yields, and annualized dividend rates are current as of May 29, 2017. Annual dividends paid are calculated by multiplying the current quarterly dividend rate by four, and then multiplying by the number of outstanding shares. Integrated oil giant ExxonMobil is one of the largest companies in the world, so it should be no surprise that it's also one of the biggest dividend payers. One major reason to like Exxon is for the diversification of its business. The company has operations in offshore and onshore oil drilling, chemicals, refining, and more. And while much of Exxon's revenue suffers when oil prices fall, some areas of the business actually tend to do better. For example, as my Foolish colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out, 2015 was a terrible year for Exxon's drilling operations, but the company's refining business more than doubled its profits. As far as the dividend goes, Exxon is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats index, having raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years, and pays 3.8% as of this writing. Considering the company's financial strength and profitability, the streak shouldn't be in jeopardy anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. Telecom giant AT&T is a favorite stock among dividend-seeking investors, and for good reason -- its 5.1% yield is among the best you'll find from such a stable company. And like Exxon, AT&T has a streak of consecutive dividend increases that exceeds three decades. There are a few good reasons to like AT&T over the long term. For one thing, AT&T has a pending acquisition of Time Warner. That will add all of the latter's content, helping AT&T to keep building a moat around its business, and allowing it to continue to bundle more and more services together -- potentially capturing market share from rivals such as Verizon and Sprint. Wells Fargo has significantly underperformed the rest of the banking sector over the past nine months or so, as a result of the now-infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal. This was certainly a major misstep by the bank, and the fallout from the scandal is obvious. The bank's non-interest income has fallen significantly, expenses are up, and the bank's normally strong efficiency ratio has suffered. Having said that, I believe that the effects of the scandal will be temporary. Wells Fargo remains one of the most well-run banks in the world, in terms of risk management, efficiency of operations, and profitability. The bank has consistently delivered better returns on equity and assets than its rivals, while maintaining a relatively low-risk asset portfolio. Consumer product giant Procter & Gamble's strength lies in its vast portfolio of well-known brand names, including Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Downy, just to name a few. To be clear, there certainly are some challenges facing Procter & Gamble going forward. For example, discounted and subscription-based razor competitors such as Dollar Shave Club have cost the Gillette brand market share in recent years. However, the long-term outlook is still strong for P&G shareholders. The company has proactively shed non-core brands to focus on its biggest winners, and has done an excellent job of controlling costs and boosting margins. Finally, Procter & Gamble has one of the longest streaks of consecutive dividend increases in the market at 60 years and counting. It was recently disclosed that Warren Buffett had unloaded about 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in International Business Machines, better known as IBM. Buffett said that the company was facing strong competition, and therefore he had valued its stock ""somewhat downward."" However, don't be too quick to abandon IBM -- Buffett still owns more than 50 million shares of the tech giant, and the central reasons Buffett bought IBM in the first place still apply. For one thing, IBM still has great relationships with large organizations, which not only provide stability to its revenue, but also give the company a strong base on which to grow with new product developments. The business also has ""stickiness,"" meaning that it would cost its customers a lot of money to choose a new provider for the integrated solutions (hardware, software, and services) that IBM provides.

    5 Dividend Stocks That Pay Out Over $5 Billion a Year -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Apple's iPhone, which heralded the age of touchscreen smartphones and app ecosystems, was one of the most successful tech products of the past decade. But for every hit product that reshapes the market, there are countless flops that became cautionary tales. Let's look back at ten of the biggest technological duds of the past decade. Image source: Getty Images. Back in late 2002, Toshiba and NEC developed the HD DVD as the high-capacity successor to DVDs. But at the same time, Sony was developing the competing Blu-Ray format in partnership with eight other leading electronics companies. Sony -- which had its own movie studio and extensive media partnerships -- also convinced other major studios to launch their films in the Blu-Ray format. The disc war was over by 2008, and companies withdrew their support for HD DVDs. By the end, Toshiba had sunk over $1 billion into the doomed technology. Image source: Google. Image source: Microsoft. In late 2001, Apple changed digital music forever with the launch of the iPod. Microsoft launched its rival, the Zune, five years later. Despite positive reviews, the Zune flopped due to its delayed entry, weak marketing efforts, and lack of support among major record labels. Sales never picked up, but Microsoft kept the Zune alive for six more generations before killing it off in 2012. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft launched Windows Phone 7, its first multi-touch mobile operating system, in 2010 -- three years after the first iPhone arrived and two years after the first Android devices launched. That delay was costly, since most developers and consumers were already tethered to the iOS and Android ecosystems. In a desperate bid to expand Windows Phone, Microsoft acquired Nokia's handset unit in 2014 -- which resulted in billions of dollars in writedowns a year later. Today, Windows Phone accounts for less than 1% of the smartphone market. Image source: BlackBerry. After the iPhone arrived, smartphone market leader BlackBerry dismissed the idea of touchscreen phones, claiming that enterprise users would always want keyboards. When enterprise users started buying iPhones, BlackBerry tried straddling touchscreens and keyboards with the Storm, a bizarre touchscreen phone which had a ""clickable"" screen that simulated the physical response of a keyboard. Yet that odd mechanism frequently failed, and Verizon reportedly replaced most of the 1 million Storms which it sold in 2008, resulting in nearly $500 million in losses. BlackBerry's market share continued plunging afterwards, and it finally stopped making its own phones last year. Image source: HP. HP launched the Touchpad in July 2011 as a potential competitor to Apple's iPad. But just a month later, HP announced that it would discontinue all devices running webOS -- including the Touchpad -- to pivot away from the competitive mobile market. The remaining Touchpad inventory was subsequently liquidated for $99 per unit -- making it one of the shortest-lived tablets in history. Image source: Facebook. In 2013, Facebook tried to take over Android devices with Facebook Home, a replacement launcher that let users quickly view and post content on Facebook, message other users, and launch apps. The lock screen also displayed notifications from Facebook and other apps. Facebook Home was a clear attempt to take over a mobile OS without actually creating one -- but the app was skewered by poor reviews (generally complaining about the pushy and overbearing nature of the app) and privacy concerns. That flop caused Facebook to go back to the drawing board and make Messenger a platform instead. Image source: Google. Google initially launched Glass via a limited ""Explorer"" program in 2013, then offered the augmented-reality device to the public the following year. Its initial price of $1,500 was steep, but Google intended to lower it for a commercial launch. Many tech enthusiasts hailed Glass as the next big computing platform, but Google didn't consider the privacy implications of putting cameras on users' faces. Businesses banned Glass from their establishments, while mainstream consumers disliked the device's awkward appearance and high price tag. Google discontinued Glass in 2015 but promised to launch a next-gen version in the near future. Image source: Amazon. In 2014, Amazon believed that its success with the prisoner-taking Kindle Fire tablets could be replicated with the Fire Phone. However, the mid-range hardware failed to impress customers who were already using iPhones and Android devices. Amazon slashed the price of the Fire Phone from $199 to $0.99 (with a two-year contract) within the first month, took a $170 million writedown on unsold phones later that year, then killed off the device in 2015. Image source: Samsung. Last year, Samsung's well-received Note 7 smartphones started exploding due to faulty batteries. The ensuing debacle resulted in millions of units being recalled and the cancellation of the flagship device -- which resulted in a $2.3 billion writedown during Samsung's third quarter and plenty of lost revenue during the holiday season. Despite that big setback, initial demand for Samsung's new Galaxy S8 devices appears to be robust -- indicating that the brand wasn't tarnished by the scandal. ","
      
    The 10 Biggest Tech Product Failures of the Past Decade -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Daniel Kline: We're coming to you from the past, but talking about the future, so it's very confusing. Shen: You had some issues getting to Fool HQ this time around. Kline: I was three miles from the airport, about 45 minutes from my house, when my low-pressure light comes on. Being the responsible fellow I am, I decide I'll pull over to the righthand lane. Boom, my right front tire blows up. I have no idea what happened. Fortunately, AAA said they would be there in 45 minutes. Two hours and 45 minutes later, they showed up. I missed my flight, I had to fly to a different airport, but I did eventually get here, all for you. Shen: Dan, I was giving you an opportunity to say that you rolled up your sleeves yourself, jacked the car up, changed the tire. Kline: Here's the sad thing. One, I couldn't have done that, because I was on a highway with absolutely no room. But I could have been in a parking lot, and I still couldn't have done that. The guy from AAA asked me, ""Do you have a spare?"" I was like, ""I don't know?"" I said, ""I have a trunk? There's a possibility."" Shen: Regardless, I'm glad that you can make it. It's always really nice to have you in studio. Fools, our focus for this episode will be technology in the restaurant sector. Before we get into that, Dan, you cover a ton of wireless companies and cable companies, too. You cover them quite extensively. Last week, I spoke with Asit a little bit about the partnership that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) entered with Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) to unite their very significant resources, as they get into the wireless business. Xfinity Mobile from Comcast is expected to hit the market soon. What are your thoughts? Kline: I think it's a major uphill battle. On paper, it makes sense. Just like when any of those companies, any of the cable companies, decide to sell home alarms, there's a logic of, they have the customer base, they already have an install force. But it never works that well, because the reality is, all Americans that want mobile phones have mobile phones. And while there is some churn, the four major wireless carriers are really well setup to bring your number over, to bribe you to make the change. So just because you're going to pay a little less, you're going to get $5 or $10 back in credit, whatever it works out being with the bundling, I just don't see too many people. And while not all the details are out, these systems tend to be limited, where it's just the iPhone. I think in this case, it is just the iPhone so far. And consumers are used to choices. So I don't think it's necessarily going to be a failure in terms of, will it add some bottom line for these companies for relatively little effort on their part. But I don't think this becomes the fifth wireless carrier that gets up to, T-Mobile is in 70-something million homes, I'm guessing at that number, but T-Mobile plus Sprint is right around where AT&T and Verizon are. I don't think it becomes even a blip on that. It'll be a few million people if they're lucky. Shen: Sure. As far as I know, from what I could find out about the offering, iPhone is definitely the focus, but they mentioned a few other flagship devices will be available from competing handset makers like Samsung. But, don't you feel like, in terms of sheer resources, if there's any company that's going to try and get into the very competitive wireless space, Comcast is in a position where they can throw their weight around. Kline: I think they should buy Sprint. If you want to get into this space and you're Comcast, just get into this space. Then make a Sprint movie and have a Sprint ride at Universal Studios, have the can you hear me now guy, where he says now I'm talking, or whatever it is, have him in a TV series on NBC. I don't really get this playing around the edges. Cablevision did this. When Cablevision did it, it was much more based on wifi and being as cheap as possible in terms of using the airwaves, which is part of what Comcast and Charter are doing but only part of it. And it was very incremental. It was for parents who wanted a third phone for their child but didn't necessarily want to spend the real money. It's very hard to make people switch from something that works. I have T-Mobile, I'm not sure what you have. Shen: I have Straight Talk, which is essentially AT&T, similar service to this, in a way, piggybacking off of a major carrier. Kline: Right. I know that I get better offers. Sprint and T-Mobile are perpetually battling each other. If I'm happy, I'm not going to change. You have to mail your phones back and go to a store and fill out paperwork, it's not simple, and I'm not going to deal with it just to give Charter more money. Charter is still one of the least liked companies out there. I don't think people are clamoring to do more business -- Shen: Along with Comcast, no less. Kline: Yeah, I don't think people are going, ""Oh, I really want to give these guys a bigger chunk of my business!"" Shen: OK. Well, I wanted to get your first impressions on this. Once it launches and we have more information, maybe some first-hand experience from subscribers, we'll talk about it more, see if it's having any impact for the business -- Kline: Yeah, we'll test it. My mom lives in a Comcast van at home, so we'll try to get a phone and see what it looks like. Shen: There you go. Moving on to our main topic, we have restaurants. Specifically within this space, the role of technology. For any Fools who have been following this sector, you've seen in headlines recently that restaurants have struggled with some low traffic, declining same-store sales from a period of overexpansion, but I was thinking about this in relation to these other industries that I've talked about today, with you and earlier in the studio with Adam, the fact that department stores, on the one hand, and cable companies, they face some existential threats. You have e-commerce on one hand, you have various streaming internet alternatives on the other for cable companies. I think the restaurant industry is interesting because fast-casual might take share from quick service, the broad industry might see weakness due to excessive expansion, like in this case. But in the end, people have to eat, they love eating out. And as a result, I think execution becomes a really clear differentiator between different chains, and there's not as much of an industry boogeyman that you can pin your problems to. But on the flip side, you have the success stories, and some of the big trends I get excited for the restaurant industry include loyalty programs, restaurants trying to source ingredients locally, and also, there's technology. That's where we will focus. I think previously, we spoke about how robots, for example, eliminate the need for human employees all together. But a lot of the technology initiatives that we'll talk about today seem to be previews of how that might work. Kline: I think if you look at some of the technology we're talking about, what you're really focusing on is, restaurant sales overall are down a little bit, 1% or 2%. It's not anywhere near the retail drop. So you're looking here and saying, I'm Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), or McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), or whatever the chain is -- how do I maximize my business? What's worked, and it's worked for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Panera, and we've talked about this before, is mobile ordering. I think mobile ordering at Chipotle makes a ton of sense and will be a game changer. When I say game changer, I mean a 2% to 3% net sales gain. It's not suddenly going to explode their business. But if you walk into a Chipotle -- and we've both done this -- and there's 10 people in line ahead of you, you might leave, because it's slow. So what a lot of Chipotles have done is set up a second production line in the store, and if you order from the app, your food will be ready when you get there. And they're having all the same execution problems Starbucks had. The people at the front don't know where the order is, have you paid, how do you handle it, do you pick it up. But all that will get sorted out, that's just growing pains and retail training, which is not an easy thing to do. So I think at your higher-end places like Chipotle that have lines, that's actually going to allow them to serve more customers during peak hours. At a place like McDonald's, I think ultimately, there's a gain in taking workers out of the equation. But in the short-term, maybe there's some drive-thru benefit to being able to order and pick up, not going through the line. But in a McDonald's, I don't see as big a benefit when most things are not made to order, and it's sort of a production line, of even if you want a pretty special order, it's coming out quickly. So there's not really a major need to cut that. So McDonald's will gain eventually from technology, but in the short-term, I think you're going to see some of your higher-volume fast casual places like Chipotle, as you've seen with Panera, really benefit from this technology. Shen: Yeah. And we're definitely still, I think, in the early stages of the launch and the testing phases for a lot of the companies that are dipping toes into this. There are companies like Domino's (NYSE:DPZ), which are turning this into an art for themselves, and really juicing their quarterly results, seeing tons of growth with the technology and how they implemented it really well. With Chipotle, you mentioned the second make line, I think they call it, they're calling it ""smarter pickup times"". They've been able to quantify some of the benefits in that this better management of their digital orders, they give them more accurate estimates of when orders will be ready. In some of their testing, they mentioned that digital order wait times decreased as much as 50%. Restaurant staff have better tools to essentially manage this channel, like you mentioned, during peak business times. If they have a bottleneck, in terms of those peak hours and how many people they can serve, this can alleviate some of that, then that does flow through to their top and bottom line. Kline: And there's a major customer service benefit. If you call Domino's -- back in the old days when you called Domino's. I'm sure your generation now is Snapchatting Domino's and then paying via Venmo. Shen: Exactly. Kline: But back when you used to call Domino's, if they told you your pizza was going to be an hour, you went, ""OK, my pizza will be an hour."" If in an hour, your pizza showed up, you were satisfied. So I was talking with you earlier. I use the Pei Wei app. The Pei Wei app is pretty innovative in that you can completely customize any order. If you want sweet and sour chicken with no sweet and sour sauce, hold the chicken, you can do that. And you can put in what time you want to pick it up. I was picking up, it was maybe 5:20, so I put in 5:40, that was the distance from my house. And the app came back and said, ""Your time has been adjusted to 5:50."" And I went, OK, no problem, I'll leave 10 minutes later versus if I had been at the store, waited in line, placed my order, I would have been there for 30 minutes. So it was an absolute benefit of my time, better customer service, and it will make me much more likely to go back. And I think that's where you're starting to see some of the value in these. Pei Wei is a higher end fast casual concept that can take quite a while in a line. Shen: So we've talked so far about Chipotle, Pei Wei, in your experience. I think those are places where the food quality may be up a tier, they're bringing in plenty of customers in that regard. Going to the more fast casual side, where a company like McDonald's -- Kline: The more fast food side. Shen: Yeah, the fast food side. Bringing out their ""Experience of the Future"", they're dubbing it, testing with kiosks for ordering, technology that allows their employees to bring food to your tableside. McDonald's management has cited that 500 million orders were lost to their direct fast food competitors in the past few years, due to their issues they faced. The thing with McDonald's is, they saw quite a nice bump, at least relative to their more stable industry in their business, due to all day breakfast. That has essentially dissipated. Do you think that technology in this regard can help them overcome some concerns that there always are, in terms of food quality? Kline: It's eventually going to help them overcome some costs. That, we've covered. In the short term, we've talked about this personally but I'm not sure if we've talked about it on the show, if I walk into McDonald's and I want a Big Mac with no special sauce, with an extra slice of cheese, with four pickles, not three, and I try to tell that to the human being behind the counter, who may be a college kid, may be a go-getter, super smart, they've been working at McDonald's for seven hours at that point, they don't care that I want four pickles. So if that goes into a kiosk, not only is there a much easier ability for the person -- eventually robot -- making that hamburger to get it right, and a record for if they don't get it right, for me to hand them a receipt, to say, ""This wasn't supposed to have ketchup."" So I think you're going to see a subtle but important improvement, especially on drive-thru where there is nothing worse than, you order your 10-piece McNuggets, your large fries, and you get home with your drive-thru back and open it up and it's someone else's Big Mac that you don't want. So I think this is going to eliminate a lot of that pain point, and that will absolutely have an impact on the bottom line, but it's not as direct as, ""Boy, the line is long, now I can serve twice as many people."" Shen: Yeah. I will add, in addition to McDonald's, Wendy's announced earlier this year that they would install kiosks at about 1,000 of their locations by the end of this year. They've cited similar things that we've talked about, reducing labor costs, for example. But on the Panera side, Panera 2.0, some things management has said that I think make it really interesting, in terms of the lift in ticket size that you can get from these kiosks, there is a quote from, I don't know if it was somebody in their management, but I found this quote that basically said, ""People who order at a kiosk will generally spend about twice as long ordering with that kiosk than they do if they're speaking directly to a cashier."" What that ultimately means or leads to is more opportunities for upselling -- every time you place an order for a salad, do you want to pair that with a soup? You order a coffee, do you want to pair that with a donut? Then, they're able to customize their orders, and ultimately get larger tickets. Domino's has spoken to this as well with their apps. People upsell themselves. When they're ordering a pizza, they add things to it that they wouldn't otherwise if ordering by the phone. Kline: And it takes away shame. If I'm at Starbucks, and there's a person, I'm going to buy black coffee, room for cream. If I'm ordering on my own, I'm like, ""I'll have a Unicorn Frappuccino with extra chocolate chips, could you grind up a pie in that?"" So, I think there's a level where, if I'm ordering Domino's and I'm a person talking to a person, I might be like, ""I'll have a medium pizza with pepperoni, please."" If I'm on my own, bacon, pepperoni, sausage, and put another pizza on top of it. So you get into some impulse control issues. And I think there might be some technology ability going forward to manage calories and things like that, in a way that you'll still spend, but maybe not make the stupid decisions I just described. But, yeah, absolutely, if you don't have to interact with another human being, you're going to order more. You might get that soda you'd be embarrassed to buy from a person, or the dessert, or whatever it is. Shen: I think trying to quantify some of these things, some of the benefits we see, beyond the labor cost, the large ticket sizes, the fact that people order more, and the fact that if you order exactly what you want and you're not worried about it because you're on a kiosk, you're not worried about telling the cashier about all the different customizations that you want to make, you'll enjoy the food more. And maybe that leads to better loyalty to that chain, or whatever it is. Kline: It's also about removing uncomfortableness. We've talked a lot about this, we both like all sorts of different ethnic food. If I'm an American and I've never had Thai or Korean or Japanese or whatever, and I walk in and it says, whatever the local name is, it says Pad See Ew, and I'm like, ""I don't know what that is. Is that chicken? Is that noodles?"" If it says Pad See Ew, they're noodles with this and that and that. Or, an empanada, here's what an empanada is, and it lays it out. Shen: Or, if it's spicy, and you worried about that -- Kline: Right, where you want to remove the spice, or allergen concerns, or whatever it is, the more of that you can make not embarrassing -- as someone who has a food allergy, I hate walking into a restaurant, and I have cousins who have very serious peanut allergies, so you have to make a big deal out of it. If that could just be something that I could automate and still know they were going to be safe and things were going to be done, it would make times I cook at home times I go out to restaurants. Shen: Sure. So we have these kiosks, and we have, even beyond the mobile ordering, which obviously, hopefully, can help some of these restaurants during the peak hours speed customers through, increase their volume. The idea of some of these tablets that restaurants are also outfitting some of their tables with. This is more of a sit-down experience. Shen: And a lot of restaurants that have outfitted their tables with these tablets have found that people are more likely to order the ancillary items, higher instances of customers ordering dessert, coffee, other drinks. Those are all nice margin boosters for those businesses. Kline: There's a window. If you're a restaurant, there's a period between the end of dinner and the feeling of fullness when people will buy dessert. They often regret desert by the time it shows up. That's why most restaurants have a to-go container for desserts you shouldn't have ordered. But if the waitress is too busy or misses that window, or I would have had another beer if she got to me 10 minutes into my meal, but at 20 minutes into the meal I'm like, ""Oh, I'm driving too soon,"" or, ""Maybe I don't need to spend this money."" So there's an amazing ability to give me every impulse if I'm sitting there and finish my gin and tonic and want another one, I just hit the button and there it comes whereas if I had that extra five minutes of reflection, maybe I would go, this is a bad idea. Shen: An overarching theme, in terms of some of the technology we've had, eliminating the need for an employee, or someone to actually be the cashier, to be the server, also maybe minimizing some of the inconsistency that you can get in terms of the service experience. I want to end the show, though, on a bit of irony. You brought this up before we filmed, and I thought it was really interesting. Some reports that we have from insiders in the fast food industry, various recruiters for these companies who are running into a lot of problems, actually, staffing restaurants, and reducing some of the turnover that we see, which is at record levels right now, and keeping well-trained employees there. The management team at Chipotle, for example, has spoken about how they lost sight of that service side, about keeping restaurants clean, keeping the beverage and fountain machine clean, napkins off tables, trash off tables. I just thought it was interesting that, on the one hand, if you look out 10 to 20 years, you have this idea that you're going to eliminate the need for these employees entirely. But right now, even as they're testing things like these kiosks and tablets, which help eliminate the need, they're also running into issues keeping the restaurant staffed. The median wage for fast-food work in this country is $8 to $9 per hour. But Wal-Mart, just two years ago -- Kline: Went to $10. Shen: -- went to $10 across the country. Across their entire network of stores, at the minimum. They're running into this competition across all of retail. Kline: And I think you're seeing a justification for the companies that invested in employees. If you look at a Starbucks, which has healthcare and the college benefits, their turnover is less. I worked in retail, I ran a store. Just teaching someone all the procedures to run the register took months before they were good at it. If you're integrating someone onto the line at Chipotle, or working the fry later and knowing the procedural manual to clean the shake machine at McDonald's, which is horrifying, my wife having worked there in college -- that's not ice cream. But there's a huge opportunity cost. If you have been paying better all along, you might have actually been able to do it with less workers. Now, you're seeing a bit of a hierarchy. If I'm a worker at Dunkin' Donuts, I might be able to get hired at Starbucks, which will treat me better. If I'm a Taco Bell worker, maybe I can go to Chipotle or Starbucks. And you're going to start seeing the bottom of the chain -- during the last time we had a boom economy, my wife and I used to joke that you would go to the Dunkin' Donuts and the people working there would just point, and you wouldn't get what you wanted, but eventually they would get to something you like, and you would just take that anyway. And you're going to start to see real differences in service. As a country, you can argue what full employment means. But on a technical basis, we're at full employment, or right close to it, meaning there's not a huge pool of people -- there might be lots of people looking for better jobs, but there's not a huge pool of people looking for entry-level jobs. So you're going to start to see more teenagers. Starbucks doesn't hire a lot of 16 year olds in most markets. But you're probably going to see people like that, younger people, get some of these jobs, which can be good, but it's also a training issue, it's a scheduling issue because they can only work so many hours, they can't work during school, they can't work late at night. This is going to be a major factor, and for successful chains, it's going to force automation. Shen: Yeah. And we've talked before about how, ultimately, labor costs for a lot of these major chains, as much as 25% to 30% of their cost structure is there. It's interesting, trying to see them commit to this balancing act that they have, of making sure that right now, where they're not at the point where they can automate everything, having their employees be trained well, making sure the service experience is positive, and keeping customers coming back. Kline: I think if you're a worker -- I'm not 15 anymore, but I have a 13 year old child, and if he told me he wanted to be a manager someday of a restaurant chain, I would tell him to look at the ones that have a commitment to people. Starbucks has endlessly said and proven that with automation, they're not looking to replace workers, they're looking to shift the labor flow into production, meaning that there's always going to be an art to building a latte. Yes, you can go to Wawa and get a latte made by a machine, but that's not the same as one built by a person. If Starbucks is saying, ""Yeah, we may not have order takers who are people, but we're absolutely going to have customer service and baristas and product experts, and we're going to put in these upscale bars, and you'll be incentivized to learn more about coffee,"" well, those are the chains that are going to attract whatever worker pool there is. And I think McDonald's is going to automate, because it's a difficult job, there's some upward mobility but it's still a hot, sweaty, unpleasant place to work, for the most part. It's all going to sort itself out, as long as the economy stays strong. Shen: OK. Any final points, Dan, before we roll up here? Kline: I'm kind of hungry. Where are we going? We're thinking Shake Shack later. [laughs] ","

IHS Markit is a firm that provides critical information, analytics, and solutions for economy-driving industries and markets. The company is headquartered in London and has branches around the world. IHS Markit will now join the S&P 500 GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) Research & Consulting Services Sub-Industry index.Suggested articlesNewsBTC to Make Splash at London Summit 2018Go to article >> NewsBTC to Make Splash at London Summit 2018Go to article >> Finance Magnates reported on the launch of IHS Markit’s Outreach360 platform designed to assist companies in complying with the new EU rules. TEGNA is in the midst of a spin-off of Cars.com, a transaction that will be completed before the open on Thursday June 1, final conditions pending. After the completion of the spin-off, TEGNA’s market capitalization will be more representative of the mid-cap market space. Time and J.C.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Police officers for the first time could be required to obtain warrants to get data on the past locations of criminal suspects based on cellphone use under a major case on privacy rights in the digital age taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. The justices agreed to hear an appeal by a man convicted in a series of armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan with the help of past cellphone location data who contends that without a warrant from a court such data amounts to an unreasonable search and seizure under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment. Cellphone location records are becoming increasingly important to police in criminal investigations, with authorities routinely requesting and receiving this information from wireless providers. Police helped establish that the man at the center of the case, Timothy Carpenter, was near the scene of the robberies at Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores by securing past “cell site location information” from his cellphone carrier that tracked which local cellphone towers relayed his calls. The case reaches the high court amid growing scrutiny of the surveillance practices of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies amid concern among lawmakers across the political spectrum about civil liberties and police evading warrant requirements. The Supreme Court has twice in recent years ruled on major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, on each occasion ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. Two years later, the court said police need a warrant to search a cellphone that is seized during an arrest. The information that law enforcement agencies can obtain from wireless carriers shows which local cellphone towers users connect to at the time they make calls. Police can use historical data to determine if a suspect was in the vicinity of a crime scene or real-time data to track a suspect. Carpenter’s bid to suppress the evidence failed and he was convicted of six robbery counts. On appeal, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his convictions, finding that no warrant was required for the cellphone information. Civil liberties lawyers have said that police need “probable cause,” and therefore a warrant, in order to avoid constitutionally unreasonable searches. “Because cellphone location records can reveal countless private details of our lives, police should only be able to access them by getting a warrant based on probable cause,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberty Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project who represents Carpenter. “The time has come for the Supreme Court to make clear that the longstanding protections of the Fourth Amendment apply with undiminished force to these kinds of sensitive digital records,” Wessler added. But, based on a provision of a 1986 federal law called the Stored Communications Act, the government said it does not need probable cause to obtain customer records. Instead, the government said, prosecutors must show only that there are “reasonable grounds” for the records and that they are “relevant and material” to an investigation. The case will be heard and decided in the court’s next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2018. The Trump administration said in court papers the government has a “compelling interest” for acquiring the records without a warrant because the information is particularly useful at the early stage of a criminal investigation. “Society has a strong interest in both promptly apprehending criminals and exonerating innocent suspects as early as possible during an investigation,” the administration said in a brief. David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, said warrants can be obtained quickly from judges but police may have problems getting the evidence needed to show probable cause. “They may not be able to get over that legal hurdle, so the court couldn’t issue the warrant,” LaBahn said. Civil liberties groups assert that the 1986 law did not anticipate the way mobile devices now contain a wealth of data on each user. Steve Vladeck, a national security and constitutional law professor at the University of Texas, said the case will have “enormous implications” over how much data the government can obtain from phone companies and other technology firms about their customers without a warrant. “Courts and commentators have tried to figure out exactly when individuals will have a continuing expectation of privacy even in data they’ve voluntarily shared with a third party,” Vladeck said. “This case squarely raises that question.” ","

Donna Fuscaldo,06082017,Investopedia,06012017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Verizon Communications (VZ) is reportedly gearing up to lay off as much as 1,000 jobs at both AOL and Yahoo as it begins the work of integrating its soon to be completed $4.5 billion acquisition of the internet company. Unnamed sources told Recode that the downsizing will likely happen across AOL and Yahoo and that if there are a thousand job cuts it would be less than 20% of the combined company. Reductions were expected given that Verizon and Yahoo have a lot over overlap, including in human resources, finance, marketing and general business administration. The acquisition, which was dragged out due to a massive cybersecurity breach of Yahoo’s user accounts, is expected to be closed next week after a shareholder meeting to approve the deal on Friday. The combined Yahoo and AOL is being rebranded as Oath: A Verizon Company. In April the wireless carrier announced the new name, which attracted plenty of ridicule across Silicon Valley and in the media, with comparisons being made to Tribune Publishing's notorious 2016 decision to rename itself Tronc. (See also: Verizon Finally Acquires Yahoo Core Operations.) According to a tweet from AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong at the time, Oath will oversee more than 20 brands and reach more than a billion consumers. Both the Yahoo and AOL brands are expected to survive, although Verizon refused to reveal any further details about the new entity until this summer. (See also: Revised Deal: Verizon to Pay $350M Less for Yahoo.) Recode’s sources claimed at the time that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, who was at the helm of the internet giant for four years, which featured a prolonged trading downturn, will not be joining Oath. Those challenges, coupled with a reputation for lavish spending and mistimed acquisitions—e.g., paying $1.1 billion for social the blogging platform Tumblr—led many to expect Mayer’s departure. Recode added that Adam Cahan, senior vice president of mobile and emerging products at Yahoo, is also likely to get the boot, while communications products head Jeff Bonforte is set to be one of the few executives to stay. Armstrong will soon make the rest of his choices on who stays and who leaves. At risk are Yahoo’s Chief Revenue Officer Lisa Utzschneider and advertising and search product boss Enrique Muñoz Torres.  ","Verizon to Lay Off 1,000 Across AOl, Yahoo: Report | Investopedia"
Michael J. Kramer,06082017,Investopedia,06012017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A hotly debated topic among tech dealmakers has been how much Yahoo Inc.'s (YHOO ) assets are worth. The new holding company for Yahoo will have its work cut for it after the company sells its search and other assets for an estimated $4.5 billion to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). If that deal is completed this month, Yahoo will shed its name and the holding company will be called Altaba Inc. How do you pronounce that new name? Al-ta-ba or Al-taba? That's a mouthful. No matter how you pronounce it, Altaba will operate as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The question every investor should ask themselves is this. Will the old Yahoo - under a new name - be good at managing the assets? YHOO Market Cap data by YCharts As of March 31, the company reported an investment in Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) of $41.3 billion and an ownership interest in Yahoo Japan of $9.3 billion.  Yahoo beneficially owns 15.4 percent of Alibaba, representing 383.5 billion ordinary shares. Alibaba has a market cap as of June 1 of $310.99 billion, which would mean that Yahoo's current stake in Alibaba is roughly $47.89 billion. Yahoo Japan has a market cap of roughly $25.4 billion. Yahoo owns a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, representing a current market value of around $9.02 billion. YHOO Long Term Deferred Tax Liabilities (Quarterly) data by YCharts It seems like a no brainer right? Yahoo's current market cap - before the Verizon deal -  is $48.10 billion, and its stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is worth $56.91 billion. So Yahoo currently trades for less than the market value of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Then throw in that Yahoo shows cash and short-term marketable securities of $6.91 billion, then add the sale from Verizon of roughly $4.5 billion, it bring Yahoo's cash value to $11.41 billion. That takes the valuation for Yahoo up to $68.32 billion. YHOO Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts As of March 31, the company reported deferred tax liabilities for its Alibaba investment of $16.7 billion; this represents nearly 40 percent of the value of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba of $41.3 billion. As of December 31, Yahoo reported deferred tax liabilities of $13.6 billion, while its investment stake was $33.6 billion, representing 40 percent of the value of the stake. With a $48.10 billion valuation on its Alibaba stake, its tax deferred liability, using the same 40 percent, would be $19.46 billion. The company lists other long-term tax liabilities at $519.95 million. Also, the company recently announced a stock buy-back program of $3 billion. So based on these liabilities, how much is Yahoo worth then? It may be less than the current valuation the market is assigning to it. There's a big ""IF"" in all of this. First, can Yahoo figure out how to avoid the tax bill from its Alibaba stake? If not, and Altbaba has to pay that bill at some point, then you can subtract $20 billion from the value of its investment stake in Alibaba. That would be a big hit. Second, an investor in Altaba is hoping that this new investment company can avoid past mistakes made by Yahoo's management. So this means investors in the new Altaba will be betting on management's ability to navigate the company through a quagmire of financial issues and create value. That's a big IF at Altaba.

The idea is simple and appealing. Deliver easily prepared meals to clients' doors. Young professionals and harried homemakers can appreciate not having to stop at stores or draw up menus. Budding cooks can try out new dishes. Customers with few restaurant options nearby can try out cool recipes.

Verizon wouldn't be interested in an outright buyout of Pandora, sources say. Instead, the telecom giant is considering a $100 million investment. The deal would only happen if Sirius XM doesn't succeed in swallowing Sirius XM whole, and that's just as well. This isn't exactly a bidding war between Sirius XM and Verizon that would ultimately reward Pandora shareholders with a higher exit price, but Pandora's remaining independent would be an interesting consolation prize. Image source: Pandora. The spike in interest in Pandora doesn't come out of the blue. Ever since Pandora announced last month that it secured $150 million in financing from private equity firm KKR -- and that it would explore strategic alternatives in the 30 days leading up to the close of infusion -- it's been the equivalent of a bartender's final call for alcohol. An investment in Pandora would be dilutive for any potential acquirer, a field that presently only include Sirius XM if it's even making a play on the former dot-com darling at all. We'll have clarity on the situation soon enough, as Thursday marks 30 days since the announcement of KKR's investment and seemingly the deadline for Pandora to have found an acquirer. It's starting to seem as if the most likely scenario is that Sirius XM stays away, and both KKR and Verizon come in as investors. Both scenarios would be positive to Pandora's prospects as an ongoing business, making it a compelling investment in the single digits. ","

Daniel B. Kline,06082017,Fool,06012017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) made a $10.54 billion bet on growth, and so far, it has not paid off. The company bought Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). That gave Frontier approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers, according to a press release. At the time the deal closed in April 2016, CEO Daniel McCarthy was excited and believed he had set his company up to succeed in the long term. ""This is a transformative acquisition for Frontier that delivers first-rate assets and important new opportunities given our dramatically expanded scale,"" he said. ""It significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" The Verizon deal did make the company bigger and it did create an economy of scale. What McCarthy did not count on is that in all four quarters since the CTF purchase closed, Frontier has lost some of the customers it paid $10.54 billion for. Frontier has seen its subscriber counts move steadily in the wrong direction. Image source: Getty Images. When Frontier reported its Q2 2016 results McCarthy explained that it had lost customers partly due to the switchover from Verizon and partly due to the suspension of marketing activities. That tune continued in Q3, before the CEO introduced a new excuse in Q4. At the end of 2016, when Frontier reported the loss of 144,000 more residential customers as well as 14,000 business customers, McCarthy had a new excuse. He blamed the drop on Frontier getting rid of former Verizon customers who had not paid their bills. ""This process is almost complete, and we expect to return to a normalized trend by the start of the second quarter,"" he said in the Q4 earnings release. ""I am pleased that underlying CTF customer trends improved in Q4 and continue to improve in Q1."" That did not happen. In Q1 Frontier lost 155,000 residential customers and 18,000 business customers. Those are bigger losses than the previous quarter, and despite the company and its CEO continually saying the trend will reverse, there is little reason to believe it will. The company needs to show it can stop customers from leaving and attract new ones. McCarthy has done a very good job managing expenses and squeezing operational efficiency out of his newly larger company. Still, even though he has delivered $1.25 billion in annualized cost synergies at the end of Q1, you can't cut your way to success. If Frontier keeps losing around 160,000 subscribers each quarter some of those cost savings gained from being bigger will start to disappear. That's a very realistic scenario because while McCarthy delivers credible excuses for the drops, he has not shown he knows how to stop them. Frontier may well be falling victim to the cord cutting impacting most of its competitors. It also appears to have lost momentum as an alternative to the established players in cable, likely because so many new options have popped up in recent months. Those may not be solvable problems. Frontier may well be a tire with a slow leak where at first it does not seem so bad, but eventually the problem leads to a blow out. ","

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is the fastest-growing postpaid wireless carrier in the United States. That said, it still has a long way to go to catch up to the massive subscriber bases of AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). But T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter said there are two major growth drivers for the company that could allow it to continue adding millions of new subscribers to its platform for years to come. First, it's still expanding its distribution footprint to catch up to its nationwide network coverage. Second, its improved network coverage will allow it to penetrate the enterprise market. T-Mobile CEO John Legere. Image source: T-Mobile Carter says the company's current store footprint only reaches about 230 million people in the United States. Meanwhile, it expects its network to cover 320 million people by the end of the year. T-Mobile is quickly expanding the number of stores it's opening. It expects to open an additional 1,000 stores by mid-year, with 500 more by the end of the year. Overall, Carter expects the stores to reach an additional 30 million to 40 million people. Importantly, T-Mobile will be able to leverage its nationwide advertising. It already has brand recognition in these areas; it just doesn't have stores to serve the customer base. As it opens stores, it could quickly ramp up its share of the market. What's more, the competition in these new areas is less intense than in the metro areas where T-Mobile currently plays. Instead of the four or more competitors traditionally present in metro areas, in these more rural markets Carter says there are only two or three. That means it'll be easier for T-Mobile to take share. In established metro areas, T-Mobile takes as much as 30% of the market. Carter sees no reason T-Mobile can't eventually reach those levels nationwide. But in a five-plus-year time horizon, he expects ""substantial inroads into the teens"" in terms of market share. That implies an addition of about 5 million customers over the next five years. More than likely, many of those customers will come from AT&T and Verizon. The two have had leading nationwide network coverage for years. But each has been bleeding subscribers to T-Mobile for awhile, and its store footprint expansion could exacerbate the problem. There are over 100 million enterprise phone customers in the United States, according to Carter. T-Mobile has less than 5% of those customers. ""Given where our network is today, there's no reason we can't have our fair share of that marketplace,"" he said. T-Mobile plans to bring the same Un-carrier initiatives that helped it succeed in its retail business to the enterprise market. Things such as including text and data in over 150 countries with its plans or more transparent pricing ought to appeal to business customers as much as they do to retail customers. AT&T's business-solutions segment continues to add new customers, mostly at the cost of its own retail customers. The company's enterprise segment now boasts over 82 million connections and over 50 million postpaid phone subscribers. That makes it likely the largest enterprise service provider in the country, putting a target on its back for T-Mobile. The enterprise opportunity is massive for T-Mobile. It ought to be able to grow its share of the market to close to its current market share for non-enterprise, which stands as high as 30% in some metro areas. Even if it just reaches the mid-teens, that's another 10 million or so subscribers who could join T-Mobile over the next few years. Combine enterprise with its expanding footprint as well as its continued execution in the territories it's already doing well in, and T-Mobile has a lot of subscriber growth left in it over the next few years.

Proprietary content can keep customers loyal. That's the logic behind Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) ill-fated go90 platform. The problem, and it's a big one, is that creating content people actually want presents major challenges. In addition, go90 launched at a time when consumers have an unprecedented amount of content to choose from. Verizon, which spent $200 million on content for the service and another $80 million marketing it in 2016, according to Business Insider, also made the mistake of entering a market already owned by YouTube. go90 was an attempt to lure millennials, a generation particularly resistant to craven marketing efforts. It was an attempt that was badly off base and failed quickly. go90 still exists, but it has been dramatically scaled back, with 155 full-time staff losing their jobs in January, Deadline reported. Verizon hoped to lure young people in with go90. Image source: Getty Images. When it blows hundreds of millions of dollars on an idea that never had any hopes of working, a company like Verizon won't admit it made a mistake. Instead, it releases a statement like this one: Our focus with go90 and our Verizon digital media efforts are to fulfill our strategy of leveraging Verizon content investments, enhancing user experience, and strengthening our advertising infrastructure. Fulfilling this strategy has resulted in some duplicative resources and has required organizational changes impacting 155 employees as we consolidate offices in Los Angeles, San Jose, and New York. That's a whole lot of corporate gobbledygook to avoid saying what a terrible idea spending so much trying to create viral videos was. Of course, shareholders and the 155 who lost their job were probably delighted to hear that ""these changes are not indicative to a change in our strategy."" The biggest mistake Verizon made with go90 was attempting to launch it based on spending big. It would have made more sense to take a slower, more grassroots approach. That's how Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Hulu, and Amazon.com entered the content game. Verizon instead had the hubris to assume that it could throw money at the problem and millennials would be easy to lure in. That would seem to be the case given the enormous volume of highly watched yet awful content on YouTube, but that platform had the advantage of being first. At best, go90 was a me-too player in an already crowded field, and in reality it was never really a player at all. In addition, breaking into episodic programming and viral videos requires both talent and luck. All of the aforementioned platforms, as well as the broadcast networks and cable channels that produce original content, sometimes fail with shows that deserve an audience. There was no reason to believe that Verizon -- even a deep-pocketed Verizon -- would have quick and easy success in the content space. It's easy to see why Verizon wants to have a draw beyond a high-priced wireless service. The advantage its network once had over lower-cost rivals Sprint and T-Mobile has shrunk, taking away what has been its key marketing pitch. Owning content that people want to watch would be that draw. The problem is that creating content that keeps people paying for a service that costs more than its rivals isn't easy. HBO, Netflix, and very few others have been able to achieve that. Maybe in time go90 would have gotten there, but it doesn't seem likely. ","

AT&T (NYSE:T) is a television and wireless juggernaut, and it's using its heft in both markets to attract new subscribers. The company's most recent move is to offer a $25 discount on video services to wireless customers subscribing to its Unlimited Choice plan. The move follows a similar offer tied to its more expensive Unlimited Plus plan. At $60 per month for a single line, AT&T's Unlimited Choice plan is already priced below similar plans from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Offering a video package for as little as $10 per month on top of that makes it an excellent value for individuals. And with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) entering the wireless market, AT&T is really stepping up its bundle promotions to remain competitive. Image source: AT&T. As mentioned, AT&T's single-line pricing is less than Verizon and T-Mobile's. Granted, AT&T imposes added restrictions on its Unlimited Choice plan to keep the price low. Subscribers that don't want those restrictions would have to pay an extra $30 per month, making the plan more expensive than comparable plans on T-Mobile and Verizon. That said, the second line pricing for AT&T is comparably very expensive. T-Mobile offers significant savings versus AT&T for family plans especially considering its recent move to include taxes and fees in its pricing. In fact, the savings on a two-line account are enough to completely offset the $25 video discount for some subscribers. That's important to note because there's an industrywide push toward more family plans. Both T-Mobile and Verizon have seen the average number of devices per account steadily climb over the past couple years. Multi-line accounts generally exhibit lower churn rates, allowing a carrier to grow faster without having to find as many gross additions. AT&T may be trying to zig while the competitors zag, specifically targeting single-line customers. Offering a substantial discount on video service should help keep churn lower than otherwise. Comcast is taking a similar approach with its wireless plan pricing, which is only really attractive if you're also subscribing to Comcast's high-end video and internet package. AT&T has lost postpaid phone subscribers for 10 straight quarters dating back to the end of 2014. Additionally, it lost 233,000 video subscribers last quarter, and DIRECTV Now isn't adding any new subscribers either. AT&T is getting desperate to add new high-value customers, but doing it one customer at a time is a lot more difficult than adding three or four lines at once. It requires a lot more marketing expenses and customer acquisition costs with a higher risk of defection just a few months later. It's already shown an inability to hold onto customers if and when its promotions end. It's experiencing significant customer losses from U-Verse video as it stops its footprint expansion and customers' promotional discounts end. DIRECTV Now lost 3,000 subscribers in February after many users signed up for a ""free Apple TV"" after committing to three months of service. Unless AT&T plans to subsidize its already low-margin DIRECTV Now business indefinitely, this bundle is just a band aid instead of a real fix to its subscriber loss problem.

Finding the best telecom stock on the market today is a matter of process of elimination. Smaller wireless providers such as Sprint and T-Mobile don't pay dividends, instead reinvesting all of their profits and excess cash flows back into their businesses. Since many telecom investors target the sector for its rich history of cash distributions, we can strike these two from the list. Without turning to international wireless stocks, we find that telecom giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) offer the same 5.1% dividend yield. So deciding between these two wireless rivals comes down to which offers the better growth prospects. The winner on that front is AT&T. Let's see why. No other telecom comes close to AT&T's credentials as a dividend stock, though Verizon deserves credit for its high yield. AT&T's track record of consistently growing its payouts stands head and shoulders above its industry counterparts. The company has increased its annual dividend per share for an impressive 32 years running, earning it the much-desired title of a Dividend Aristocrat. It already increased its annual payout for 2017, raising its quarterly cash distribution from $0.48 to $0.49 per share. Though it's grown its payouts in steady annual intervals for longer than I've been alive, the company has grown its dividends at a fairly glacial pace. As I noted in another piece, AT&T's dividend's compound average growth rate totaled a meager 3.2% over the past decade. However, the company claims its pending acquisition of Time Warner -- more on that in a moment -- will be accretive to its adjusted EPS, free cash flow, and dividend payout coverage this year, assuming the deal closes on time. Given AT&T's 95% dividend payout ratio, this news should comfort income investors. Better still, AT&T's purchase of Time Warner will provide the company with even more significant competitive advantages to shape the converging future of the telecom and media industries. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to its prominence as an income investment, AT&T has a good chance to grow faster than the industry averages in the coming years, in part thanks to the leadership position it should be able to establish in bringing cable TV services onto wireless networks. The key lies in AT&T's pending acquisition of Time Warner. The $85.4 billion cash-and-stock deal is expected to close by the end of the year as most critical regulatory hurdles have been cleared. With Time Warner added into its corporate fold, only AT&T and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) will own the requisite mix of content assets and wireless spectrum necessary to drive this trend forward. As one of the largest wireless providers in the country, AT&T has a national wireless network that's already well positioned in terms of its spectrum bandwidth ownership and cell-tower deployments. The company will need to continue to invest in faster wireless standards such as 5G, but the company is well under way in its preparations to bring 5G to mainstream deployment, starting as soon as this year. Time Warner also factors into this strategy, in terms of content rights. Along with Comcast, AT&T stands to considerably strengthen its competitive position by launching an over-the-top wireless cable service. It seems likely the company will combine a new wireless cable service with its current cellular, internet, and other services to create a highly competitive bundle that peers such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile will struggle to replicate. The advantage of having Time Warner is that it should allow AT&T to secure the over-the-top broadcast rights from other cable providers that might otherwise be leery of allowing AT&T to become so powerful. One useful example is Comcast, which provides cable subscriptions to 22.4 million consumers and owns networks such as NBC, Bravo, and USA Network. Though Comcast will probably launch its own wireless cable offering, AT&T could gain a first-mover advantage if it beats the cable giant to market. While that might give Comcast an incentive to withhold over-the-top rights from AT&T, that situation probably wouldn't last since Comcast also needs Time Warner's content assets for its current cable offerings and to eventually launch its own service and if AT&T owns them, that would forces the rivals to the negotiating table. This all involves a fair amount of speculation on my part, though it seems like a logical set of steps for the parties involved. Time Warner should allow AT&T to take a leadership position in the next era of the cable business, which should allow it to grow its earnings and dividends in the years to come. ","

"Travis Hoium, Timothy Green, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",06082017,Fool,06012017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Long-term investing is often talked about in terms of a few years in today's stock market. But at The Motley Fool, we love to find stocks we can hold for decades and make money on over the very, very long term. We asked three of our contributors which stocks they want to own for the next 50 years, and SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) made the top of their lists. Reuben Gregg Brewer (SYSCO Corporation): SYSCO Corporation is the largest food distributor in the United States, serving restaurants, schools, and hospitals, among other customers. It also operates in Canada and Mexico, and recently bought a large European food distributor to expand its reach into a new market. Food distribution is a highly fragmented industry with ample opportunity for SYSCO to do ""bolt-on"" deals, which have been its bread and butter for decades. The company has faced two notable problems, lately. The first was a failed attempt to buy US Foods, one of SYSCO's largest U.S. competitors. The hope was to achieve cost savings through that deal that would improve SYSCO's margins, which had been falling since 2010. Weak margins in an already low-margin business is the second big problem. With the deal scuttled, however, SYSCO has renewed its focus on improving its own operations. And that's led to a notable operating-margin improvement over the last year. SYY Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. SYSCO is clearly aware of the problem, is dealing with it, and achieving success. That's actually not so surprising from a company that's increased its dividend for 47 years and counting. The dividend-growth rate has slowed to about the rate of inflation over the last few years, but over the past decade, the annualized growth rate has been roughly twice that level. With a solid 2.5% yield, as well as a long history of successfully expanding via acquisition in a fragmented industry and rewarding investors along the way, SYSCO is the type of company you can own for a very long time. Tim Green (McDonald's): Restaurants, perhaps more than any other type of business, come and go. The industry is brutal, with no barrier to entry driving intense and unending competition. But McDonald's is no ordinary restaurant. The company has been around for decades, and its business model of having most of its restaurants run by franchisees is wildly profitable. McDonald's earned $4.7 billion of net income last year on $24.6 billion of revenue. Image source: McDonald's. In order to thrive for another 50 years, McDonald's will need to change with the times. McDonald's now offers delivery through the UberEATS service in some cities, and it plans to roll out mobile ordering and pickup to all of its U.S. restaurants by the end of the year. McDonald's is a laggard when it comes to digital strategy, but it's aiming to catch up quickly. If I had to bet on any restaurant chain being around in 50 years, it would be McDonald's. The company is nearly recession-proof, with its focus on low prices driving sales in even the worst of times. Revenue dipped slightly in 2009 during the financial crisis, but it quickly recovered, and the bottom line was completely unaffected. McDonald's has thrived during its first 50 years, and it will likely do the same for decades to come. Travis Hoium (Verizon): Besides food and housing, I think one thing that will be similar 50 years from now as it is today is data flowing through the air wirelessly, and then being disseminated to other people or things. Maybe it'll be phone calls, or maybe it'll be data from self-driving cars, or maybe personal drones will need to communicate with central command wirelessly. Whatever it is, I think Verizon is well positioned to be at the center of that wireless-communications future. You can see below that Verizon is essentially tied with AT&T as the most profitable U.S. telecommunications company. This gives Verizon a powerful position in a market with very few players and the cash flow needed to upgrade its network, when necessary. VZ Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Over the next few years, we'll see Verizon's strong position playing out as it rolls out a 5G network, starting with an 11-city pilot by the end of this year. Meanwhile, Sprint and T-Mobile don't plan on rolling out 5G until 2019. As more devices become connected and the Internet of Things grows, Verizon's network will become more and more valuable. Fifty years from now, this still will be a company that will likely be making tons of money for investors. And getting a 5% dividend yield in the meantime is a nice way to generate cash from a great long-term investment. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Hold for the Next 50 Years -- The Motley Fool

For those unfamiliar with the telecom titan, AT&T (NYSE:T) may not look like the best bet in telecom today. Case in point, the wireless giant's shares have dramatically underperformed the broader market averages over the past 12 months and year to date in 2017. T data by YCharts. However, its recent performance obscures two important reasons AT&T remains a compelling buy. Here's why the telecom giant's powerful combination of dividend payments and growth potential makes it my top pick in the telecom sector today. Let's start with the past and present before moving on to the future. Working within this construct, AT&T's impressive history as an income investment is particularly noteworthy. As I have cited in many prior posts, AT&T's potent mix of historical dividend growth and current yield earn it my vote for the best dividend stock in the telecom industry. Here are two important figures you should know that help support this point: That said, AT&T stock is not necessarily the embodiment of dividend perfection, either; it has some important risk factors. Namely, the company currently pays out almost all of its net income -- a 95% dividend payout ratio at most recent count -- as dividends. However, it's important to note that the cash-rich nature of AT&T's business model means its actual cash flows are far larger than its accounting income. Case in point, AT&T's cash flows from operations totaled $40.6 billion versus $12.6 billion in income attributable to common shareholders over the past 12 months, so the metaphorical well from which AT&T can pay its dividends is much deeper than a metric like payout ratio suggests. Equally important, its paltry dividend growth rate also detracts from AT&T's status as an otherwise great dividend stock. The company has only increased its cash payouts at an average annual rate of just 3.2% each year over the past decade. Of course, some growth is better than none, but this falls well short of some of the top dividend growth stocks on the market today. Fortunately, AT&T has one extremely important growth driver in place that should allow the wireless giant to continue its rich tradition of overall dividend excellence for years to come. Image source: Getty Images. Last October, AT&T struck a deal to acquire TV and movie programming giant Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) in an $85.4 billion stock-and-cash deal. The deal stands as just one of AT&T's recent mega-deals -- its $48.5 billion buyout of DirecTV in 2014 also deserves note, here -- but this buyout holds the key to AT&T's vision to bring cable broadcasts directly to mobile devices. Let's walk through the steps involved in this investing thesis since it can seem somewhat unintuitive. In a sense, the deal is all about leverage. AT&T already owns the requisite spectrum to launch its own wireless cable service in the coming years, especially as 5G networks come online toward the end of the decade. It also counts 146.8 million wireless customers and 38.7 million TV subscribers to whom it could distribute this type of product. However, AT&T will likely need to secure additional content distribution rights from major content powers like Comcast to broadcast their channels via its over-the-top service. In theory, large cable producers could simply refuse to license these new terms, essentially blocking AT&T from launching what figures to be a highly compelling offering. However, with Time Warner's cable assets like CNN, TNT, TBS, and more, AT&T can leverage its own content assets to bring other cable companies to the table. At least in this sense, Time Warner's strategic value is akin to a massive insurance policy. Expect AT&T combine this new wireless cable service with its current cellular, internet, and other product offerings. Since only Comcast should be in a position to match AT&T on this front, it certainly seems plausible that AT&T could use its wireless cable to steal wireless customers away from rivals like Verizon Communications, T-Mobile, Sprint, and more. Seen through this lens, there certainly appears to be ample evidence to remain bullish on AT&T stock in the years to come. ","
      
    Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for AT&T, Inc. -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06082017,Fool,06012017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A stock's share price all by itself isn't very meaningful. A company with 1,000 shares of stock trading for $10 and another company with 10,000 shares trading for $1 are worth the exact same amount of money. Having said that, there are certain advantages to lower-priced stocks. In addition to making it more economical to employ certain options strategies, a lower share price allows smaller, everyday investors to put more of their money to work right away. Think of it this way. Let's say you have $300 from your last paycheck to invest, and you want to buy a telecom stock. If you choose AT&T, which trades for $38.24 as I write, you can afford to buy seven shares, leaving about $32 of your money uninvested. On the other hand, if you choose Sprint, which trades for just $8.41, you can buy 35 shares and leave less than $6 on the table -- perhaps just enough to cover your trading commission (depending on your broker). The point is that you aren't leaving as much cash on the sidelines with the lower-priced stock. With that in mind, here are three stocks that look attractive right now, all of which have sub-$10 price tags. Then read on for a little bit about the potential of each one. Company Industry Recent Stock Price Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE:CLF) Mining $5.69 Sprint Corp. (NYSE:S) Telecommunications $8.87 Fitbit Inc. (NYSE:FIT) Wearable technology $5.51 Stock prices are current as of June 2, 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Iron ore miner Cliffs Natural Resources has been beaten down quite a bit in recent months. The stock trades for less than $6 per share, and just three months ago, it wouldn't have qualified for this list. However, I think Cliffs looks rather interesting after the drop. The company has done an excellent job of paying off debt and would have been profitable in the first quarter if it hadn't prudently spent money for that purpose. Debt is still a little too high for comfort, but it has fallen by almost 25% in 2017 alone. In a nutshell, Cliffs has done a good job of improving its financial condition, and recent drops in iron ore have made the stock much cheaper over the past few months. As the largest supplier of iron ore pellets to U.S. steelmakers, Cliffs stands to benefit tremendously over the next few years, especially if President Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure plan becomes a reality, given his pro-U.S. steel stance. Cliffs is still a highly speculative investment, so approach it with caution, but if the company's turnaround efforts continue to be successful, and commodity prices cooperate, investors with the patience to wait and the stomach for some volatility along the way could be handsomely rewarded. Sprint is a somewhat different investment from rival telecom giants AT&T and Verizon. Specifically, while AT&T and Verizon both have massive, high-quality wireless networks, Sprint's focus is to compete on price. The company is much smaller in scale than those other two and operates at a significantly lower profit margin. And the company's latest quarter produced a net loss of $0.07 per share, while sales fell short of analyst estimates. Even so, there are reasons to be positive on Sprint. The company added 187,000 net new subscribers during the quarter and was able to report positive free cash flow for the first time in years. Sprint has been in an ongoing effort to turn the company around, and while it remains to be seen whether it will ultimately be successful, if the company's earnings start to look impressive, there could be lots of upside potential for shareholders. Shares of wearable-technology company Fitbit have been absolutely crushed since the company's 2015 IPO. The stock has fallen 82% from its first trading day and nearly 90% from its peak. It's fair to say that the market's euphoria on Fitbit has cooled off significantly. FIT data by YCharts The recent numbers aren't too promising. In its most recent quarter, Fitbit's revenue fell 41% year over year, and the company lost $0.15 per share, down from a profit of $0.10 a year ago. And as my colleague Leo Sun pointed out recently, the company's market share plunged from 29% at the end of 2015 to 19.2% at the end of last year. Despite the numbers, Fitbit could still have some tricks up its sleeve. New products are expected to launch this fall, including a successor to the Blaze smartwatch that's rumored to have some Apple Watch-beating features. Only time will tell if consumers will embrace the next generation of Fitbit products, but if they do, there is tremendous upside potential. Of course, given its low price, the company could also be an attractive takeover target. As I mentioned, Cliffs and Fitbit are stocks that I consider to be quite speculative, so if you choose to invest, be sure you can stomach the volatility that will undoubtedly occur, and don't put in money you can't afford to lose. Having said that, I consider all three of these stocks attractive from a risk-reward perspective, and over time, all three have the potential to deliver outstanding returns in your portfolio.

    3 Top Stocks Under $10 -- The Motley Fool

With the stock market hovering near all-time highs, it can be a smart idea to think a little defensively in your portfolio. However, that doesn't mean you need to give up your growth potential if the market keeps rising. Blue chip dividend stocks have historically performed better than their non-dividend counterparts during tough times, and many have outperformed the overall market over long time periods. With that in mind, here are five of the largest dividend payers in the market, all of which pay out more than $5 billion per year to shareholders and could make excellent additions to your portfolio now. Company Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Annual Dividends Paid ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) $81.55 3.8% $12.9 billion AT&T (NYSE:T) $38.12 5.1% $12.0 billion Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $52.41 2.9% $7.6 billion Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) $87.25 3.2% $7.2 billion International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) $152.49 3.9% $5.6 billion Data source: CNBC and author's calculations. Stock prices, dividend yields, and annualized dividend rates are current as of May 29, 2017. Annual dividends paid are calculated by multiplying the current quarterly dividend rate by four, and then multiplying by the number of outstanding shares. Integrated oil giant ExxonMobil is one of the largest companies in the world, so it should be no surprise that it's also one of the biggest dividend payers. One major reason to like Exxon is for the diversification of its business. The company has operations in offshore and onshore oil drilling, chemicals, refining, and more. And while much of Exxon's revenue suffers when oil prices fall, some areas of the business actually tend to do better. For example, as my Foolish colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out, 2015 was a terrible year for Exxon's drilling operations, but the company's refining business more than doubled its profits. As far as the dividend goes, Exxon is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats index, having raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years, and pays 3.8% as of this writing. Considering the company's financial strength and profitability, the streak shouldn't be in jeopardy anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. Telecom giant AT&T is a favorite stock among dividend-seeking investors, and for good reason -- its 5.1% yield is among the best you'll find from such a stable company. And like Exxon, AT&T has a streak of consecutive dividend increases that exceeds three decades. There are a few good reasons to like AT&T over the long term. For one thing, AT&T has a pending acquisition of Time Warner. That will add all of the latter's content, helping AT&T to keep building a moat around its business, and allowing it to continue to bundle more and more services together -- potentially capturing market share from rivals such as Verizon and Sprint. Wells Fargo has significantly underperformed the rest of the banking sector over the past nine months or so, as a result of the now-infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal. This was certainly a major misstep by the bank, and the fallout from the scandal is obvious. The bank's non-interest income has fallen significantly, expenses are up, and the bank's normally strong efficiency ratio has suffered. Having said that, I believe that the effects of the scandal will be temporary. Wells Fargo remains one of the most well-run banks in the world, in terms of risk management, efficiency of operations, and profitability. The bank has consistently delivered better returns on equity and assets than its rivals, while maintaining a relatively low-risk asset portfolio. Consumer product giant Procter & Gamble's strength lies in its vast portfolio of well-known brand names, including Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Downy, just to name a few. To be clear, there certainly are some challenges facing Procter & Gamble going forward. For example, discounted and subscription-based razor competitors such as Dollar Shave Club have cost the Gillette brand market share in recent years. However, the long-term outlook is still strong for P&G shareholders. The company has proactively shed non-core brands to focus on its biggest winners, and has done an excellent job of controlling costs and boosting margins. Finally, Procter & Gamble has one of the longest streaks of consecutive dividend increases in the market at 60 years and counting. It was recently disclosed that Warren Buffett had unloaded about 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in International Business Machines, better known as IBM. Buffett said that the company was facing strong competition, and therefore he had valued its stock ""somewhat downward."" However, don't be too quick to abandon IBM -- Buffett still owns more than 50 million shares of the tech giant, and the central reasons Buffett bought IBM in the first place still apply. For one thing, IBM still has great relationships with large organizations, which not only provide stability to its revenue, but also give the company a strong base on which to grow with new product developments. The business also has ""stickiness,"" meaning that it would cost its customers a lot of money to choose a new provider for the integrated solutions (hardware, software, and services) that IBM provides.

    5 Dividend Stocks That Pay Out Over $5 Billion a Year -- The Motley Fool

Tomi Kilgore,06082017,MarketWatch,06012017,"Published: June 8, 2017 4:32 p.m. ET Alibaba’s market cap gets a $43 billion boost, adding over $6 billion to Yahoo’s coffers By Yahoo Inc. investors may be a little more forgiving about the company’s delay in spinning off its large stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., as the China-based e-commerce giant’s upbeat revenue outlook helped send Yahoo’s stock to a 17-year high and boosted its coffers by over $6 billion.

That was well above consensus expectations of 36% growth as of May 31, according to a FactSet survey of Wall Street analysts, and compares with 2017 growth of 47%. The comments sent Alibaba’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) soaring $16.70, or 13.3%, toward a record close of $142.34, adding about $43.1 billion to the company’s market capitalization. That marked the biggest one-day price and percentage gains since the ADRs made their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 19, 2014.

As of March 31, Yahoo still owned 384 million ordinary shares of Alibaba, according to recent filings, which based on Alibaba ADR prices valued that stake at $41.41 billion at that time. Don’t miss: Yahoo shelves plans to spin off Alibaba stake, to focus on spinning off core business. See also from January 2015: Yahoo announces plan to spin off alibaba stake Given that 1 ADR represents 1 ordinary share, Thursday’s rally in Alibaba’s ADRs would boost the value of Yahoo’s stake by $6.41 billion. And since Dec. 8, 2015, when Yahoo said it was shelving its plan to spin off the stake, the value of that stake has ballooned by $22.26 billion, which compares with Yahoo’s current market cap of $52.38 billion. Alibaba’s ADRs are now worth more than double the initial public offering price of $68. They have rocketed 62.1% year to date, while shares of Yahoo have rallied 44.1% and those of U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc.

Comey’s testimony is part of a litany of potentially market-moving events playing out over the next 24 hours, including an earlier decision by the European Central Bank to keep its monetary policy unchanged and a U.K. snap election. However, Wall Street investors have signaled that events don’t appear to threaten the stock market’s extended push into record territory, which has been driven by President Donald Trump’s promises of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Comey’s statement, released Wednesday, suggested he was worried Trump had sought to secure his “loyalty” and wanted him to help “lift the cloud” from the investigation into possible Russian interference in the U.S. election was casting. Comey also confirmed the president’s assertion that the director had repeatedly assured Trump that the Federal Bureau of Investigation hadn’t opened an investigation into him. He reiterated those assertions during his testimony in front of the Senate panel. Engelke, meanwhile, believes that the House passage of legislation to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill is likely to accelerate circulation of capital in the markets and boost economic activity. Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, said absent any surprises, recent events suggests that the stock market should drift higher. “Ultimately, stock markets are going to reflect earnings,” he said. Orlando said the U.S. and Europe are showing strong quarterly results that may help to support gains in stocks that some strategists and investors view as overvalued. Earlier in the day, the ECB, as expected, left interest rates unchanged but said it continued to expect interest rates “to remain at present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon” of its asset-buying program, which is set to run at least through December. In previous statements, the ECB had said it expected rates “to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.” Check out: A recap of the ECB’s Mario Draghi news conference Read: Why the ECB can take only ‘baby steps’ toward ending ultraloose monetary policy Beyond the ECB and Comey, investors also were focused on the U.K. general election, In the U.K., voters headed to the polls in an election that turned out to be much more uncertain than predicted. Opinion polls are still giving Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party the lead, but the big question is whether the party will increase its majority in parliament.

                                   may have just pulled in some new customers. The retailer announced this week it will offer its Prime membership, which gives consumers access to services including free shipping and Amazon-exclusive television shows, for $5.99 a month to consumers who are on government assistance programs. Prime usually costs $10.99 a month, or $99 per year. To qualify, customers must have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which looks like a debit card. It is the card those receiving SNAP funds or cash benefits use. Retail experts have said it seems to be an effort for Amazon to compete with Wal-Mart

                                   which already has a large percentage of consumers on government assistance among its clientele. Wal-Mart had some $13 billion in sales in 2016 from shoppers who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), accounting for 18% of the money spent on that program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Amazon will add more ways to qualify for those who participate in government programs that do not require EBT cards, a company spokeswoman said. Amazon offers a 30-day free trial period. It’s a move somewhat similar to offering senior citizens discounts, said George Barany, the director of strategic initiatives for America Saves, a division of the Consumer Federation of America, an association of nonprofit consumer organizations based in Washington, D.C. Don’t miss: 5 tech stocks for the long run This isn’t the first time Amazon has gone after customers who have lower incomes: In April, it announced a program called Amazon Cash that allows customers to add money to their Amazon account if they don’t have a debit or credit card. Some 7% of households in the U.S. do not use banking accounts at insured institutions, and this program would allow them to still shop online through Amazon.

                                   offer discounted service for people with low incomes through a government-assistance program called Lifeline. And individual cultural institutions, such as the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, sometimes offer discounts to those on government assistance as well. Lower-income households are a lucrative target market. The spending habits of people with low incomes are complicated and sometimes misunderstood. For one thing, it is hard for many low-income households to predict what their incomes will be from month to month, or even day to day, said Clinton Key, the research officer for savings and financial security at Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit based in Philadelphia. As a result, many families have developed sophisticated systems for budgeting and making sure they know where every dollar goes, he said. And that’s good news for Amazon, big-box stores and cell phone companies that charge regular monthly fees. For people with steady, reliable and sizable housing, buying in bulk can alleviate some of those worries, Key said. For those who can’t rely on transportation, online ordering helps. See also: A third of American families have ‘roller coaster’ finances But signing on for subscription services, which require a monthly payment, can also be difficult for families that budget carefully, Key said. One example: Many buy cellphone plans with prepaid minutes instead of a recurring monthly charge because of this, he said. And “one-click ordering” on Amazon isn’t necessarily smart for someone who needs to count every dollar. In fact, discounting the Prime membership has a “negligible” benefit for these consumers, he added. Retailers also know that lower-income customers like to splurge too, especially when it comes to special occasions. For example, families with lower incomes actually spend more on high school proms than those with higher incomes, according to Visa

Of course, it’s hard to get bigger when interest-rate sensitive REITs are under pressure as the Federal Reserve continues to move toward tighter monetary policy. As rates rise, increasing the cost of borrowing for this capital-intensive sector, investors continue to tread lightly, as seen by the performance of the Vanguard REIT Index Fund

,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"The completion of the acquisition marked the end of Yahoo as a stand-alone internet company, a tech pioneer once valued at more than $100 billion. Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless operator, is combining Yahoo with AOL, which it bought two years ago, to form a venture called Oath, led by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Oath’s more than 50 brands include HuffPost, TechCrunch and Tumblr. “Given the inherent changes to my role, I’ll be leaving the company,” Mayer wrote in an email to employees on Tuesday that she also posted on Tumblr. “However, I want all of you to know that I’m brimming with nostalgia, gratitude, and optimism.” Armstrong told employees in a separate note seen by Reuters that the combined company’s services “reach over a billion people each month.” He added that “accomplishing our objectives and goals will require adjustments to the company.” He said the “opportunity in front of us is not about the opinions from the pundits and it is not about the competition, it is about our ability to maniacally focus on delivering magical services to mobile enabled consumers.” The closing of the deal, announced in July, had been delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from two data breaches that Yahoo disclosed last year. Reuters reported last week that Verizon planned to cut about 2,000 jobs, or 15 percent, of the 14,000 employees at its Yahoo and AOL units. Verizon is expected to make cuts as early as Wednesday. Yahoo cut 15 percent of its workforce last year and AOL cut 500 jobs. Thomas McInerney, a Yahoo board member, will become Altaba’s chief executive officer.

,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp is offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year in an aggressive promotion launched on Tuesday, aimed at Verizon customers in an oversaturated U.S. wireless market. Customers who switch to Sprint before June 30 and bring their own devices will get free service until July 31, 2018, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier said. After that, Sprint’s regular rates for unlimited plans will kick in, at $60 per month for a single line. The promotion mainly targets Verizon Communications Inc customers through digital advertising, Sprint spokesman David Tovar said by phone. Sprint shares rose 0.6 percent to close at $8.26. Verizon fell 1.5 percent, and both T-Mobile US Inc and AT&T Inc lost about 1 percent. The S&P 500 Telecommunications Services Index was the weakest of the benchmark S&P Index’s 11 sectors after the launch, with a 1 percent decline mostly driven by Verizon and AT&T. Since the offer will be promoted digitally rather than on television, the cost of winning customers is lower than for Sprint’s other unlimited plan promotions. Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a research note on Tuesday called the offer “arguably the most aggressive promotion in the history of the U.S. wireless industry.” All four major U.S. wireless carriers have been sweetening their unlimited plan offers, prompting concerns from industry analysts about an accelerating price war. But Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said the promotion “makes a really big splash in a really small pool,” noting that it primarily applied to Verizon users because of the phones that are eligible.

,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months. Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers. Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters. “Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.” Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses. Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking. BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion. Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings. Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March. Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry. The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc. Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations. That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings. “It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.” And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business. Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar. He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books. With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty. BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020. Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it. “It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.” BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year. On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer. AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said. The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said. The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies. Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million. Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020. “The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020. “Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.

Donna Fuscaldo,06152017,Investopedia,06082017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Verizon Communications (VZ) is reportedly gearing up to lay off as much as 1,000 jobs at both AOL and Yahoo as it begins the work of integrating its soon to be completed $4.5 billion acquisition of the internet company. Unnamed sources told Recode that the downsizing will likely happen across AOL and Yahoo and that if there are a thousand job cuts it would be less than 20% of the combined company. Reductions were expected given that Verizon and Yahoo have a lot over overlap, including in human resources, finance, marketing and general business administration. The acquisition, which was dragged out due to a massive cybersecurity breach of Yahoo’s user accounts, is expected to be closed next week after a shareholder meeting to approve the deal on Friday. The combined Yahoo and AOL is being rebranded as Oath: A Verizon Company. In April the wireless carrier announced the new name, which attracted plenty of ridicule across Silicon Valley and in the media, with comparisons being made to Tribune Publishing's notorious 2016 decision to rename itself Tronc. (See also: Verizon Finally Acquires Yahoo Core Operations.) According to a tweet from AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong at the time, Oath will oversee more than 20 brands and reach more than a billion consumers. Both the Yahoo and AOL brands are expected to survive, although Verizon refused to reveal any further details about the new entity until this summer. (See also: Revised Deal: Verizon to Pay $350M Less for Yahoo.) Recode’s sources claimed at the time that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, who was at the helm of the internet giant for four years, which featured a prolonged trading downturn, will not be joining Oath. Those challenges, coupled with a reputation for lavish spending and mistimed acquisitions—e.g., paying $1.1 billion for social the blogging platform Tumblr—led many to expect Mayer’s departure. Recode added that Adam Cahan, senior vice president of mobile and emerging products at Yahoo, is also likely to get the boot, while communications products head Jeff Bonforte is set to be one of the few executives to stay. Armstrong will soon make the rest of his choices on who stays and who leaves.

Verizon wishes Mayer well in her future endeavors,” the company said in the release.  (See also: Verizon to Lay Off 1,000 Across AOl, Yahoo: Report.)

It’s been a long and winding road for Verizon to close on the deal which was once valued at $4.83 billion but was reduced in the wake of huge data breaches at Yahoo that left the acquisition up in the air for some time. With Yahoo Verizon is a step closer to realizing its vision of becoming an advertising powerhouse that rivals Facebook (FB) and Alphabet’s (GOOG) Google.

Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have long-dominated the wireless industry by touting the quality of their networks. By emphasizing the point that consumers would have a better experience with their service, the two companies built subscriber bases that were around double the size of third-place T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and fourth-place Sprint (NYSE:S). There was a time when Verizon had a real edge. Verizon has steadily topped all three of its rivals in the twice-a-year RootMetrics report on wireless networks. In recent quarters, however, that advantage has slipped, and OpenSignal, another company that tracks wireless network quality through its State of Mobile Networks Report, showed in February that T-Mobile had caught up to Verizon. ""The LTE speed race between T-Mobile and Verizon has long been a close one, but in our last U.S. report T-Mobile held the edge,"" according to OpenSignal. ""That narrow lead, however, disappeared in our latest round of testings. We measured average LTE download speed on T-Mobile at 16.7 Mbps and on Verizon at 16.9 Mbps, results close enough to produce a statistical tie."" That's bad news for Verizon which has built its wireless business on having the best network. It still may have that, but T-Mobile has clearly closed the gap. T-Mobile and Sprint have both been working feverishly to make that point to consumers. Verizon is being hurt by Sprint ads featuring its former spokesperson. Image source: Sprint. While T-Mobile has been the fastest-growing wireless company, Sprint has been leading the charge against Verizon. The No. 4 carrier has been running ads starring Paul Marcarelli, who for years worked as Verizon's ""Can You Hear Me Now?"" spokesman. In his Sprint ads, Marcarelli makes the point that all networks are good and that it's silly to pay extra for what he calls a 1% difference. T-Mobile hasn't been quiet in going after Verizon, either. CEO John Legere takes credit for forcing Verizon to offer unlimited data plans while also trying to woo its customers with a special offer. ""After desperately launching unlimited, Verizon's network choked -- while our network speeds surged. Today, T-Mobile has a whopping 23% speed advantage over Verizon,"" he said in a press release. ""So to kick off summer, we're going BIG right out of the gate and throwing a lifeline to millions of Verizon customers. Now, you can ditch Verizon, keep your phone, and we'll even pay it off for you!"" Just having to offer unlimited data plans hits Verizon in the pocketbook. The company, along with AT&T, has made billions in overages, with customers buying larger plans than they need to avoid running out of data. Unlimited data ends that. In addition, the company has the further problem that if consumers start believing it doesn't have a superior network, there's no reason for them to pay more for its service. Verizon currently charges $160 for three unlimited lines or $180 for four. That's well more than T-Mobile at $130 for three or $140 for four, and double Sprint's promotional offer of $90 for up up to five lines with unlimited data. These shifting trends explain why T-Mobile has added more than 1 million new customers every quarter for four years. Verizon lost 307,000 retail postpaid customers in Q1. These industry changes put Verizon in a position that will ultimately hurt its profits. The company can either stay the course and keep its prices high, which will lead to subscriber loss, or it can cut prices. Neither situation should warm the hearts of shareholders, who will see a company forced to make less money in its core business one way or the other. ","
      
    Here's Why the Worst Is Yet to Come for Verizon Communications Inc. -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Sprint (NYSE:S) really wants you to switch service providers. For a limited time, the fourth-place carrier is offering a free year of its unlimited data plan to customers who switch from Verizon (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), or AT&T (NYSE:T). Apparently the discounts Sprint was offering on its unlimited plan following the rollout of Verizon's similar plan weren't working well enough to grow subscribers. If Sprint can't add subscribers when it's literally giving away the service, it's got a big problem. To be sure, Sprint's decision may foretell a bad quarter. The promotion notably concludes at the end of June, which coincides with the end of the second quarter. Verizon had similar reasons for launching its unlimited plan. Image source: Sprint. The wireless industry is in the midst of a price war. The average phone plan declined 13% over the past 12 months, and consumers are able to get more data for less regardless of which service provider they use. Verizon's service revenue has come under particular pressure, and its new unlimited plan isn't helping, at least not in the short term. The company suffered a 6.1% year-over-year decline in service revenue in the first quarter, and that trend could accelerate in Q2 with a full quarter of unlimited-plan results. But Sprint's results have been just as bad as Verizon's, if not worse. It's in a race to the bottom, as it's been unable to produce a differentiating factor other than price. Well, it just won that race. While Verizon expects its service revenue to stabilize over the next couple years, Sprint's fall seems to have no end. Of course, Sprint's aggressiveness could put added pressure on Verizon and the other competitors in the market to produce promotions of their own. While it might not show up on the service-revenue line, free phones or other promotions will definitely show up on the bottom line. Sprint isn't heavily promoting its free-service promotion. If a deal is good, you'll hear about it eventually, so management argues that it's saving significant marketing dollars that it can put toward offering the free service. It's just a different way of approaching customer acquisition costs. Sprint is taking a big risk assuming that a significant percentage of customers will stick around after their free service ends. It's been unable to hold on to customers for the long term, sporting the worst churn rate in the industry. These days, wireless carriers are fighting for every last net customer addition they can get. While it's unlikely any of the carriers are as desperate as Sprint, we could see continued promotions from AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. All three have offered free devices for new customers and for those who upgrade to higher-priced plans. AT&T has an ongoing promotion for $25 off one of its various television services and free HBO for subscribers to its highest-priced plan. T-Mobile is currently offering a third line free on its unlimited plan. Verizon isn't being as aggressive, as it's apparently seeing decent results with its unlimited plan as is. All this is to say that none of the carriers are completely averse to offering promotional discounts or freebies to entice customers to its service. However, the latest move from Sprint could put further pressure on service revenue or profit margin, or both, at all the major carriers. ","
      
    Sprint Takes the Nuclear Option in the Mobile Price War -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. U.S. consumers are benefiting from a major price war among wireless carriers after T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) introduced unlimited plans late in 2016 that forced AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to follow suit earlier this year. Overall, prices are down 13% from this time last year with declines of 7% in March and another 1.7% in April, according to Labor Department data. Price declines accelerated in March, following Verizon's entry into the world of unlimited data plans. Verizon still priced its offering above the competition, but many current Verizon subscribers are able to save money each month by switching to the new plan. That move has put pressure on the entire industry. But while average pricing is down, the competition hasn't affected each carrier equally. Here's a breakdown of the postpaid phone pricing trends for each carrier. Data source: Company financial reports. *Includes connected devices as well as phones. The biggest losers over the past year were Sprint and Verizon. Both have seen average revenue per postpaid subscriber decline more than 8%. It's worth noting that Verizon's average-revenue-per-user (ARPU) numbers include connected devices such as tablets, which obfuscates the actual impact of its new phone plan. Still, the overall trend indicates that Verizon's prices are declining faster than the industry average. AT&T also felt some pain, as the average subscriber paid about 2.5% less per month year over year in the first quarter. The company is seeing a lot of subscribers migrate to their employers' lower-priced business plans while losing lower-value subscribers to T-Mobile, Sprint, and prepaid options. T-Mobile, meanwhile, managed to increase its pricing. It was, however, operating from a place of weakness. The company had by far the lowest average revenue per subscriber last year, and it only just surpassed Sprint's ARPU in the first quarter. Since the Labor Department data says the biggest drop in pricing came in March and continued in April, it's likely ARPU will fall further for most carriers in the second quarter. Verizon has said it expects its numbers to keep falling but that they should level out in the latter half of the year. The company also expects to grab a larger share of gross additions, many of which will go for its higher-priced unlimited plan versus a traditional data bucket. That trend should help offset the pain from customers that lower their bills by switching to unlimited. Image source: Verizon. Sprint, meanwhile, might see some relief after retiring its ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion and changing its unlimited family plan pricing. After Verizon went unlimited, Sprint started offering five lines for $90 per month. Its new offer is four lines for $120 per month, a significant increase but still below competitors' pricing. T-Mobile may face some pricing pressure after a move to include taxes and fees in its advertised price for its unlimited plan. It also promised not to increase customers' bills unless they change plans. But now that its new unlimited plan is the only option for new T-Mobile subscribers, the influx of gross additions should offset smaller customer bills. AT&T could continue to experience declines, but it's heavily pushing its top-tier unlimited plan with promotions such as free HBO. That's the kind of thing that can boost service revenue, but it comes at the expense of profit margin. T-Mobile is one of the biggest instigators of the current price war. It has the most to gain, as its pricing remains well below the competition. Its unlimited plan is still less expensive than those of AT&T and Verizon, but it's managing to close the gap in average pricing as the only carrier growing ARPU. At the same time, T-Mobile is adding millions of new subscribers. So not only is it making more revenue per user, but it also has more of them. Clearly, T-Mobile is a big winner. Verizon and AT&T have been the biggest donors of subscribers to T-Mobile. Both have also seen significant pricing pressure, but AT&T doesn't appear to be turning things around at all, while Verizon's unlimited plan saved it from posting an even worse first quarter than it did. What's more, the trends indicate that Verizon will post strong net additions in the second quarter, while AT&T will continue to struggle. Sprint, meanwhile, appears to only have one competitive advantage: price. It's pricing its service much lower than the competition, and then hoping customers will stick around when it raises their bill. That's an unsustainable advantage, and it will lose customers to carriers with stronger networks and better service. Let's not forget the American consumer -- another big winner in the ongoing wireless price war. ","
      
    The Cost of Wireless Service Is Plummeting as Price War Rages On -- The Motley Fool

Rich Smith,06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Ah, retirement. The golden years. This is the time to be catching up on your reading, playing with your grandkids, maybe seeing the world a bit -- but definitely not a time to be worrying about whether your stock portfolio will crash. To help you accomplish the former things, and avoid the latter, I've screened for stocks offering four attributes that should appeal to retirees -- and really, anyone looking to own a safe stock. We're looking for companies that: The following are three stocks that appear well suited for investors in retirement. Go ahead -- read on and give them a look, and see if you agree. Image source: Getty Images. Once upon a time, Gap (NYSE:GPS) was the hottest name in mall clothing -- and Old Navy was just its younger, downmarket brother. But my, how times have changed. Today, it's Old Navy that's driving growth at the company. Old Navy's same-store sales surged 8% last quarter, while sales sagged at Gap and Banana Republic. Still, Gap CEO Art Peck has high hopes to replicate his success with  Old Navy and turn around sales at Gap's other brands. Already, gross margin is on the upswing at all three of Gap's main brands. As if all this good business news weren't enough to persuade an investor to buy this brand-name stock, Gap also boasts a lot of numbers that should prove attractive to investors in retirement. It has a low beta of just 0.87, for one thing, indicating that historically, at least, its stock has been a bit less volatile than most others. Gap's 4% dividend yield also offers a nice income stream to folks on a fixed income -- and Gap has raised its dividend six times in the past seven years. Perhaps best of all, at just 13.2 times earnings, Gap stock is cheap, costing barely half the average 25.7 P/E on the S&P 500 today. Willing to pay a bit more to get an even bigger dividend? Looking for a business a bit less subject to the whims of fashion than retail clothing? Look no further than Total (NYSE:TOT). Zack's Equity Research recently highlighted Total as offering ""one of the best production growth profiles among the oil super majors,"" with oil production set to grow 4% year over year in 2017 -- plus any growth the company might expect to enjoy from rising oil prices, as OPEC tightens the tap. Perhaps the most encouraging fact for folks looking for a stock to invest in during retirement, though, is this: In MTS's last earnings report -- which showed subscribers growing and free cash flow up 11% -- MTS CEO Andrei Dubovskov named dividends as one of the three cornerstones of MTS's ""3D"" business model, saying the company is focused on delivering ""data, digital, and dividends."" With a dividend yield north of 10%, it seems to be doing a pretty good job of doing that. ","
      
    If You're Retired, Consider Buying These 3 Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to investing in dividend-paying stocks, sometimes bigger is better. Any company that can afford to spend billions on dividend payments each year must have a solid business model. Otherwise, it would never promise to share so much wealth with its shareholders. So which companies are the biggest dividend payers on the market today? Here's a closer look at eight companies that have spent at least $8 billion on dividend payments over the past year. Image source: Apple. Sporting a market cap of around $765 billion, tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has become one of the world's largest publicly traded companies. Long-term shareholders can credit the company's phenomenal run to the tremendous popularity of the iPhone, while other products such as the iPad, Apple TV, the Apple Watch, and Mac computers, have helped round out the company's ecosystem. Over the past four quarters, Apple's suite of products has cranked out more than $45 billion in total profits. With so much cash coming in, Apple's management team has made a commitment to return a huge amount of its excess capital to shareholders. Part of that plan calls for regular dividend payments, and over the past 12 months, Apple has put more than $12 billion directly into shareholders' pockets. While Apple's 1.7% yield might not seem all that high, that $12 billion makes Apple the largest dividend payer on this list. Image source: Getty Images. The enormous plunge in oil and gas prices has hit every energy company hard over the past few years. That includes energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), as the integrated oil company's financial statements are sensitive to big commodity price swings. From peak to trough, Chevron's revenue plunged nearly 50% through the downturn, while profits fell even harder. Despite the pain, Chevron remained committed to paying out its strong dividend. That's quite an accomplishment, as its total dividend payments of more than $8 billion have dwarfed the company's net income of $2.9 billion over the past four quarters. Chevron has largely relied on asset sales to help fund the difference between the two numbers. The company's recent results are starting to paint a rosier picture. Production and energy prices are climbing, while costs are on the decline. If this trend holds up, then Chevron's profitability should start to bounce back. John Flannery was recently named chairman and CEO of General Electric. Image source: General Electric. General Electric (NYSE:GE) has reinvented itself several times since its founding more than a century ago. In recent years, GE has been focused on returning to its industrial roots and has been selling off a variety of business units. Investors also recently learned that longtime CEO Jeff Immelt is stepping aside and being replaced by industry veteran John Flannery to keep the transition going. In spite of all of the changes, GE has remained committed to using its huge financial resources to reward its shareholders. Over the past 12 months, GE has spent more than $8.5 billion on dividend payments. At current prices, GE's stock yields more than 3.4%. If Flannery's changes can get the company's profit engine humming, then shareholders should be able to expect ever more dividend bumps in the years ahead. Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been an acquisition machine for decades and now counts more than 250 operating companies in its empire. Its companies sell products in three broad product categories: consumer products, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. While all three divisions churn out predictable profits, the company is counting on its pharmaceutical division to deliver revenue and profit growth over the next few years. One big benefit of selling healthcare products is that demand tends to be very stable. That has afforded Johnson & Johnson will the luxury of being able to pass along regular price increases and provide its shareholders with regular dividend bumps. In fact, J&J has grown its dividend for 54 years in a row. Over the past year, J&J has paid out more than $8.6 billion in dividends to its investors, which gives its stock a yield of more than 2.5%. That's impressive, but since its dividend payment consumes only about half of net income, there appears to be plenty of room left for dividend increases down the road. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was slow to embrace the cloud-computing revolution, but all of that changed when CEO Satya Nadella took the reins in 2014. The company has since invested aggressively to move its iconic Office suite of products into the cloud. In addition, Microsoft's Azure web-services platform is growing quickly and currently holds the second-place spot behind Amazon.com. When combined with the success of its Surface products, Mr. Softy's profits have trended in the right direction over the past few years. With a growing pile of profits, Microsoft has used its ample cash hoard to reward shareholders with regular dividend increases. Over the past year, Microsoft has spent more than $11.6 billion on its dividend payments, and that generous payout represents only about two-thirds of the company's $17.8 billion in total net income. With profits expected to increase as the company's move to the cloud continues to takes hold, investors should be able to expect more dividend bumps from here. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T (NYSE:T) has enjoyed surging demand for wireless data as consumers have raced to get their hands on the largest and greatest smartphone. However, the market now appears to be saturated, and wireless prices are falling, so the company is looking for a new avenue to drive profit growth from here. That's why the company is pushing hard to complete its $108 billion acquisition of Time Warner. If the deal goes through, the company will be far more diversified and should have an easier time retaining customers by offering more attractive packaged deals. AT&T's investors should have their fingers crossed that the deal goes through, since the company's payout ratio is getting uncomfortably high. In the past year, AT&T has spent more than $11.7 billion on dividend payments, which is awfully close to the $12.5 billion in net income the company pulled in. While AT&T's 5% dividend yield is enticing, there isn't a whole lot of wiggle room should profits take a dip. That could happen if regulators choose to block the Time Warner transaction and wireless prices continue to fall. And that could put the company's 32-year-long history of consecutive dividend increases in jeopardy. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil is another energy giant that's been a bankable long-term investment. The company has paid out a growing dividend for 35 consecutive years, which includes its recent 2.7% bump earlier this year. Exxon's enviable track record has been driven by its management team's knack for using capital effectively. The company places an emphasis on funding projects that have high returns on capital, which helped to keep its profit engine humming throughout the recent downturn. Over the past year, Exxon has churned out more than $10 billion in net income, which is impressive given the energy slump. While that wasn't enough to fully cover the $12.7 billion spent on dividends, Exxon's profits are on the upswing thanks to cost-cutting measures and stronger commodity prices. With plenty of growth projects waiting in the wings, it might not be long before ExxonMobil's earnings fully cover the 3.7% dividend yield. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is another dominant telecommunications giant that cranks out huge amounts of profits each year. While the company is also experiencing pricing pressure in the wireless space, the company's recent move to offer unlimited data is helping keep its customers loyal. Like AT&T, Verizon has gone on a spending spree as of late, as a way to drive future profit growth. The company recently bought out both AOL and Yahoo! in an effort to build out its digital advertising business. Verizon has increased its dividend each year for more than a decade and currently offers a 5% yield. Over the past year, its dividend has consumed $9.2 billion, but that's only about 75% of the $12.2 billion in net income it pulled in. If the company's big bets on digital advertising pay off, the company's streak of dividend increases shoulnd be able to continue from here. ","

Comey’s testimony is part of a litany of potentially market-moving events playing out over the next 24 hours, including an earlier decision by the European Central Bank to keep its monetary policy unchanged and a U.K. snap election. However, Wall Street investors have signaled that events don’t appear to threaten the stock market’s extended push into record territory, which has been driven by President Donald Trump’s promises of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Comey’s statement, released Wednesday, suggested he was worried Trump had sought to secure his “loyalty” and wanted him to help “lift the cloud” from the investigation into possible Russian interference in the U.S. election was casting. Comey also confirmed the president’s assertion that the director had repeatedly assured Trump that the Federal Bureau of Investigation hadn’t opened an investigation into him. He reiterated those assertions during his testimony in front of the Senate panel. Engelke, meanwhile, believes that the House passage of legislation to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill is likely to accelerate circulation of capital in the markets and boost economic activity. Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, said absent any surprises, recent events suggests that the stock market should drift higher. “Ultimately, stock markets are going to reflect earnings,” he said. Orlando said the U.S. and Europe are showing strong quarterly results that may help to support gains in stocks that some strategists and investors view as overvalued. Earlier in the day, the ECB, as expected, left interest rates unchanged but said it continued to expect interest rates “to remain at present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon” of its asset-buying program, which is set to run at least through December. In previous statements, the ECB had said it expected rates “to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.” Check out: A recap of the ECB’s Mario Draghi news conference Read: Why the ECB can take only ‘baby steps’ toward ending ultraloose monetary policy Beyond the ECB and Comey, investors also were focused on the U.K. general election, In the U.K., voters headed to the polls in an election that turned out to be much more uncertain than predicted. Opinion polls are still giving Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party the lead, but the big question is whether the party will increase its majority in parliament. Polling stations close at 10 p.m. London time, or 5 p.m. Eastern, and the first exit polls will be released soon after.

To add insult to injury, analysts at Macquarie Research downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform on Thursday. “Time’s rejection of unsolicited offers for the company in late April puts the heat on the company to even more rapidly enact a turnaround,” lead analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients. “Time will now be pruning select magazine titles to raise cash and de-risk from this large portion of their revenue base, which should enable them to launch more digital-only brands.” Don’t miss:  Time Inc. to cut 300 jobs in shift to digital Time’s declines in print circulation and advertising are accelerating, Nollen said, and at the moment the company is struggling to offset those declines with growth in online video. The company, which owns such magazine brands as namesake Time, Sports Illustrated, People and Fortune, hopes the cuts it announced will help streamline the business and allow it focus on digital and video opportunities. Time Inc. made sure to make a big display of its digital and video potential during its Newfront in May and showcased its new and upcoming projects to a ballroom full of potential advertisers. But right now print still makes up about 70% of Time’s revenue, and in the first quarter print ad revenue declined 21%. In the company’s first-quarter earnings release it said its 8% decline in overall revenue reflected the declines in print, advertising and circulation revenues. And it likely won’t get any better in the second quarter with Manga Global forecasting that magazine advertising will continue to drop as much as 25% year-over-year by 2021.

Oath’s more than 50 brands include HuffPost, TechCrunch and Tumblr. The expenses are related to severance payments, acquisition and integration costs, Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless operator, said in a regulatory filing. bit.ly/2sDnZv7 Reuters reported last week that Verizon planned to cut about 2,000 jobs or 15 percent of the 14,000 employees at its Yahoo and AOL businesses. Verizon also said it expected to save over $1 billion in operating costs through 2020 as a result of the Yahoo deal, which closed on Tuesday. The closing of the deal, announced in July, had been delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from two data breaches that Yahoo disclosed last year. ","

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. - It's been several years since I've Yahoo'd. How about you? This week Yahoo, one of the oldest Internet brands, became part of the Verizon empire, one of the companies (along with HuffPost, AOL and TechCrunch) that live within the newly created Oath unit, which hopes to compete against Google and Facebook as a bulked-up alternative for online advertisers. Good luck, Oath. And let's take a quick minute and look at the jewel of Oath, the beleaguered and ignored Yahoo.com. If any website sorely needed a fresh coat of paint and new outlook, it's Yahoo. Going to the Yahoo.com page is like going back in time to the days of MySpace and AOL, sites that were littered with gossip, celebrity news and really cheap ads for infomercial products. And what did we see on Yahoo's front page this week? Trending stories about the late singer Whitney Houston, former pop queen Britney Spears and even country icon Dolly Parton; ads for cheap credit card and mortgage rates and cruise deals, along with articles about cute pets, Apple and Samsung smartphones and Donald Trump. (The handful of concessions to current times.) ""There's just too much going on,"" Samantha Stonich, a tourist from Florida visiting Manhattan Beach, Calif. told us this week. ""I don't use Yahoo at all. It's outdated."" (Watch Stonich talking to us about Yahoo in this video here.) Yahoo, which started in 1994 as a pre-Google search engine, and morphed into a ""portal"" for reading e-mail, keeping up on news, weather and sports, has also been the victim of some bad breaks. Beyond the corporate missteps that thwarted former CEO Marissa Mayer in her efforts to revitalize the brand, there were those two nasty e-mail breaches. Yahoo said that some 1.5 billion e-mail accounts were hacked in separate attacks in 2013 and 2014. There are more than one billion reasons to have stopped using Yahoo. Yet Yahoo is still a top Internet destination-No. 3 in the United States, with 192 million visitors in April, according to comScore. Google is No. 1 with 241 million, and Facebook No. 2 with just over 200 million.  Beyond the Yahoo front page, which is still used heavily for search, the company's top portals include sites for e-mail (despite the breach), stocks and sports. ""I love my fantasy football,"" said Eric Feng, the founder of the new Unboxed.TV app, on our Thursday #TalkingTech Live episode on Facebook. ""For several months a year, I'm at Yahoo all the time."" Oath also owns AOL, which actually pre-dates Yahoo. Today's AOL looks more modern, less cluttered and less littered with bottom of the barrel ads than Yahoo. But it's a long ways from the intoxicating feel of the Facebook News Feed. That basic Yahoo formula-news you cared about and tools to communicate with friends, got updated by Facebook, which turned it into a personalized social network that is now one of the most powerful Internet companies today, worth $434 billion according to…..Yahoo! What would it take for #TalkingTech to return to Yahoo? Throwing money at faded TV stars like Katie Couric didn't do it. But as a news junkie, if I could get links to all the relevant content that interests me, with higher quality, personalized ads, there's no reason I wouldn't come back. You? Analysts say it's doubtful Yahoo can ever become what it once was-the dominant online home for news and communication, but stranger things have happened. Remember when Apple was left for almost dead before Steve Jobs returned, and revived the company with the iPod? Now it's the world's most valuable company, worth nearly $1 trillion. And that would make anyone want to say Yahoo! Our adventures with Yahoo - the #TalkingTech podcast. Click here to listen. Uber -The ride-hailing company had quite the week. CEO Travis Kalanick announced he was taking an indefinite leave, in the wake of an internal investigation into Uber's culture and governance that was sparked by claims of pervasive sexism and questionable corporate practices. Executive vice-president Emil Michael resigned, as did David Bonderman, a member of the Uber board of directors, who quit the board after making a sexist remark at the company's all-hands meeting. Uber has been suffering from management woes all year, and this week it released the results of an investigation by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, whose firm Covington & Burling was engaged by Uber in February after former engineer Susan Fowler wrote a damning blog post about the company's sexist, aggressive and biased culture. Snap - Talk about disappearing profits. The stock of Snap, Inc., the parent company of the messaging app Snapchat, fell to its initial $17 IPO price, as investors worried about Snap's business prospects. It's been a rough ride for Snap, which began the year as the biggest IPO in years, had two great initial days of trading, starting at $24 a share, only to see prices fall most days since. Google Backup- The Internet giant has a new way to keep all those files on our computers backed up, with a new automatic backup plan. The update, which will go live on June 28, will allow consumer users of Drive to back up full folders of their computer to the cloud. This means that instead of putting individual files or photos from your computer's Desktop folder into the Google Drive folder, you can automatically have Google Drive back up the entire Desktop folder and everything within it.  But consumer beware-the service isn't free. Google offers 15 GB of free space, but additional storage will cost you, starting at $99 yearly for 1 TB of space. Most desktops come with 1 TB of space, while laptops are in the 250GB to 500 GB range, so if you do more than just send e-mail and write documents, this backup will cost considerably more than the one-time purchase of a $100 TB hard drive. Amazon/Whole Foods - Even if you didn't shop there, no story was bigger this week than e-tailer giant Amazon's $13.7 billion foray into national, brick and mortar retailing, with a bid to acquire Whole Foods. The possibilities are endless. You could imagine paying for goods without going through the cash register (a concept currently being tested in Seattle), dedicated areas within the store for lounging and shopping on Amazon, home delivery as part of your Prime subscription. ""Amazon brings capacities that were not in-house for Whole Foods, such as delivery,"" Darren Seifer, an analyst with NPD Group told USA TODAY.

 ,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s apparent “indifference” toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency’s power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the “cramming” of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a “conspicuous silence” on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short, “gossamer” memo “modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.” Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury’s hands for six months. The CFPB’s role as a public watchdog “extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,” Pauley wrote. “Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,” he added. “It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.” The CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office, which handled legal filings in the case, was reviewing the decision. In court papers, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley’s decision. Pauley has criticized government agencies before, including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research. The case is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v Sprint Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09931. ","

 ,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump offered support for emerging technologies including unmanned aerial vehicles and next-generation wireless networks in a meeting on Thursday with the chiefs of AT&T Inc and General Electric Co and other business leaders. The White House brought together venture capitalists and executives from the telecommunications and drone, or unmanned aerial system, industries to discuss how the government can speed technologies to market. The meeting, which lasted more than three hours including breakout sessions, is part of Trump’s effort to tap industry experts on how to boost U.S. competitiveness in various fields and create jobs. On Monday, Trump met with the heads of 18 U.S. technology companies including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, seeking their help to make the government’s computing systems more efficient. He will meet with energy industry leaders next week. “We want them to create new companies and lots of jobs,” Trump told the executives on Thursday. “We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.” In attendance were chief executives of several drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc. Drone makers argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does not require automakers to win pre-approval of self-driving vehicle technologies. Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc also took part. Venture capital firms included Revolution LLC, headed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. Obama administration rules opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for deliveries beyond the view of an operator. Security issues would need to be addressed. The Federal Aviation Administration in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000. Last year, regulators cleared the way for next-generation 5G wireless networks, with expected speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020 but infrastructure hurdles remain. Wireless signals need to be much faster and more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or remote control of machinery. 5G networks could help to wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines.

 ,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - More than two dozen U.S. companies, including several big banks, have teamed up to establish shared principles that would allow them to better understand their cyber security ratings and to challenge them if necessary, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said on Tuesday.    Large corporations often use the ratings, the cyber equivalent of a FICO credit score, to assess how prepared the companies they work with are to withstand cyber attacks. Insurers also look at the ratings when they make underwriting decisions on cyber liability. The move comes in response to the emergence of such startups as BitSight Technologies, RiskRecon and SecurityScorecard that collect and analyze large swaths of data to rate companies on cyber security. As these startups have gained prominence and venture capital funding, the companies they rate have complained of a lack of transparency. “The challenge is that their (startups’) methodologies are proprietary and there hasn’t been transparency on how they go about creating the ratings,” JPMorgan Global Chief Information Security Officer Rohan Amin said in an interview. Ratings issued by those companies could help guide the standards being set by U.S. corporations. BitSight, for example, rates companies on a scale of 250 to 900 with a higher rating indicating better security performance. “For organizations to use your platform you have to demonstrate trustworthiness and reliability,” said Jake Olcott, BitSight’s vice president of strategic partnerships.

The company said Thursday a total of 64,514,767 shares of its stock were tendered at or below the final purchase price of $53.20 a share. Altaba said it accepted the purchase price and spent about $3.4 billion to buy back the shares.

I bought shares of Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) in April 2016, and since then the stock has gone up and come right back down. If you include dividends, I'm about even on my investment. I'm holding onto my shares, expecting a return to strong earnings growth in the long term, with a steadily rising dividend to boot. Still, there's a good bear case to be made as Verizon confronts fierce competition from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) Sprint (NYSE:S). Here are the challenges I see facing Verizon, and how they could negatively impact the company in a manner worse than I originally anticipated. Image source: Verizon. Verizon has faced pricing pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint for several years now. That pressure is getting worse as T-Mobile's network continues to improve. T-Mobile boasts that its network will soon offer coverage on par with Verizon's after it's able to deploy the low-band spectrum it won at auction earlier this year. With an unlimited plan priced below Verizon's, T-Mobile presents great value to consumers. The introduction of unlimited plans by T-Mobile and Sprint last fall prompted Verizon to launch its own unlimited plan, as it faced tons of customer losses. While the new plan has helped Verizon keep customers in place, it's also having a negative impact on its service revenue. The first switchers to come on board with unlimited are those that stand to save money by switching. Management says it expects the pressure on its service revenue to mitigate by the second half of the year. But the competition keeps launching salvos. Most recently, Sprint started offering a free year of its unlimited data plan to customers that switch from one of the other three major wireless carriers. The promotion specifically targets Verizon customers, with more eligible devices for customers switching from Verizon than AT&T or T-Mobile. This price war can't go on forever, can it? Many analysts expect Sprint and T-Mobile will either merge or one or both will get acquired. Either situation would theoretically reduce pricing pressure as the businesses start to focus on cash flow instead of customer acquisition at any cost. But Sprint's recent promotion (free service for a year) makes it hard for Sprint and T-Mobile to plead a case to the FCC that the current state of competitive intensity is unsustainable without the scale of a combined Sprint and T-Mobile. While both are reportedly in talks with one another to merge, a lack of a merger means we could see the fierce competitive environment continue on indefinitely. That would put pressure on Verizon's pricing and its ability to attract subscribers. Image source: Comcast. Both Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) are entering the wireless market with their own MVNO services. Ironically, both are relying on a pre-established agreement with Verizon to use its network wholesale. Comcast's Xfinity Mobile product indicates it's mostly looking to use mobile as a way to reduce churn of its video and internet subscribers. Charter will likely adopt a similar strategy, and it's agreed to work in partnership with Comcast to develop best practices and work on research and development. But as more people cut the cord, Comcast and Charter could become more competitive in wireless. While Verizon is in a better position than its competitors considering its network is underlying Charter's and Comcast's, it would still effectively be trading retail customers for lower-value wholesale customers. What's more, Comcast has expressed interest in launching its own wireless network, having purchased some 600 MHz spectrum at auction earlier this year. That could be the first of several moves that allows Comcast to ditch Verizon and go whole-hog in wireless down the road. My investment thesis for Verizon is that it has the brand and network strength to survive the current competitive environment. More importantly, the current competitive environment is unsustainable, as T-Mobile and Sprint will eventually feel pressure from shareholders or potential acquirers to generate meaningful cash flow. However, it seems like every month there's a new promotion that continues to escalate the pressure on Verizon. Verizon's switch to an unlimited plan is paying off for now, with improved trends in the number of subscribers it's losing to competitors. But it's coming at the cost of its average revenue per subscriber. As T-Mobile's network continues to improve, and both it and Sprint make increasingly aggressive offers to attract subscribers, it may not be long before Verizon has to take further steps or risk losing subscribers again. Either way, it's bad news for Verizon shareholders. Without a significant change in the status of the wireless industry -- an acquisition, merger, or complete financial breakdown -- Verizon could see a continuation of the current downward trend in earnings and revenue. The longer it goes on like this, the worse it gets for Verizon, and the bigger the hole it has to climb out of when competition eventually eases (if it ever does). ","
      
    Verizon Communications: The Bear Case From a Bull -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Sprint (NYSE:S) really wants you to switch service providers. For a limited time, the fourth-place carrier is offering a free year of its unlimited data plan to customers who switch from Verizon (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), or AT&T (NYSE:T). Apparently the discounts Sprint was offering on its unlimited plan following the rollout of Verizon's similar plan weren't working well enough to grow subscribers. If Sprint can't add subscribers when it's literally giving away the service, it's got a big problem. To be sure, Sprint's decision may foretell a bad quarter. The promotion notably concludes at the end of June, which coincides with the end of the second quarter. Verizon had similar reasons for launching its unlimited plan. Image source: Sprint. The wireless industry is in the midst of a price war. The average phone plan declined 13% over the past 12 months, and consumers are able to get more data for less regardless of which service provider they use. Verizon's service revenue has come under particular pressure, and its new unlimited plan isn't helping, at least not in the short term. The company suffered a 6.1% year-over-year decline in service revenue in the first quarter, and that trend could accelerate in Q2 with a full quarter of unlimited-plan results. But Sprint's results have been just as bad as Verizon's, if not worse. It's in a race to the bottom, as it's been unable to produce a differentiating factor other than price. Well, it just won that race. While Verizon expects its service revenue to stabilize over the next couple years, Sprint's fall seems to have no end. Of course, Sprint's aggressiveness could put added pressure on Verizon and the other competitors in the market to produce promotions of their own. While it might not show up on the service-revenue line, free phones or other promotions will definitely show up on the bottom line. Sprint isn't heavily promoting its free-service promotion. If a deal is good, you'll hear about it eventually, so management argues that it's saving significant marketing dollars that it can put toward offering the free service. It's just a different way of approaching customer acquisition costs. Sprint is taking a big risk assuming that a significant percentage of customers will stick around after their free service ends. It's been unable to hold on to customers for the long term, sporting the worst churn rate in the industry. These days, wireless carriers are fighting for every last net customer addition they can get. While it's unlikely any of the carriers are as desperate as Sprint, we could see continued promotions from AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. All three have offered free devices for new customers and for those who upgrade to higher-priced plans. AT&T has an ongoing promotion for $25 off one of its various television services and free HBO for subscribers to its highest-priced plan. T-Mobile is currently offering a third line free on its unlimited plan. Verizon isn't being as aggressive, as it's apparently seeing decent results with its unlimited plan as is. All this is to say that none of the carriers are completely averse to offering promotional discounts or freebies to entice customers to its service. However, the latest move from Sprint could put further pressure on service revenue or profit margin, or both, at all the major carriers. ","

Anders Bylund,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend investors are well aware that Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) offers one of the richest yields on the market today. In fact, Frontier's 12.6% dividend yield is the most generous payout among the members of the S&P 500 market index -- by a wide margin. Runner-up and fellow regional telecom CenturyLink's (NYSE:CTL) yield stops at just 8%. But bigger isn't always better. Extremely high dividend yields are often a sign of financial trouble. I'm afraid that Frontier falls in this category, and that its lofty dividend payouts are headed for an abrupt end. Image source: Getty Images. The dividend crash actually started long ago. Frontier's quarterly payouts stood at $0.25 per share between 2004 and 2010, when the dividend cuts started. At that level, the yield would have been roughly 75% today as Frontier's share prices marched downward over the years. It would also have amounted to an annual dividend budget of $1.2 billion -- more than four times last year's $265 million of free cash flows. That is not a sustainable policy by any leap of the imagination, so the company had no choice but to slow the payments down over the years. So the annual dividend payouts added up to $1 per share in early 2010, dropped to $0.75 per share for the next two years, rested at $0.40 per share until 2015, where they perked up to $0.42 per share. Last month, the quarterly check was slashed to just $0.04 per share for a forward-looking annual sum of $0.16 per share. The yield topped out at 35% in mid-May but crashed down as the effective date of the lowered dividend rolled around. So here we stand, with Frontier dividends yielding less than 13% on an annual basis. Management says that the cash is better used to pay down and refinance debt balances, so you shouldn't expect dividend boosts anytime soon. I would actually worry more about further cuts. Frontier's buyouts of landline operations from Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) have reshaped the smaller company in many ways. Network assets tripled in the 2010 transaction covering Verizon landlines in 14 states, then nearly doubled again with the deal for operations in Texas, Florida, and California in 2015-2016. But Frontier's long-term debt balances followed a very similar path and now stand at a crushing total of $17.9 billion versus cash equivalents of just $341 million. Meanwhile, Frontier's share count rose from 315 million to 1.2 billion stubs. A lot of Frontier's dividend payments are effectively going out to Verizon investors, so slashing the payments kind of lowers the long-term price of those transactions. Together, these two effects have put a serious damper on Frontier's dividend policies. But wait, there's more. The Verizon deals have indeed boosted Frontier's top-line revenue and EBITDA profits dramatically, but free cash flows have held steady. Again, higher share counts plus steady cash flows equals pressure on the company's dividend payments. Boosting the payouts under these circumstances would require more debt or additional share sales just to finance the dividend policy. Dividend cuts, on the other hand, make a ton of sense. FTR Dividend data by YCharts. Generous dividends have failed to make up for Frontier's plunging share price. Investors buying into the Verizon promise in the summer of 2010 have seen their holdings shrink by 83% in seven years. The damage is limited to 67% if dividends were reinvested along the way, but it's still a strongly negative return. If you bought Frontier shares just before the Verizon agreement in February of 2015, the damage would be 81% in plain share price terms, or 76% when accounting for dividend effects. Management keeps a stiff upper lip and is once again promising good things in the far future. I don't believe a word of that, and expect the dividend payments to keep falling in the years to come. This story does not have a happy ending. Stay away from Frontier's extreme dividend yield. You can find much better dividend stocks for the long term elsewhere.

The growing cord-cutting trend looms large over the pay-TV industry. In fact, the shift to more internet streaming services has led some major pay-TV providers such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) to meet consumers where they are with a linear TV streaming service of their own. But one cable giant has yet to enter the streaming market. It hasn't had to, as it's actually been adding subscribers over the last couple of years. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), the nation's largest cable provider, has done an excellent job holding on to its customers recently, so investors have no reason to be nervous. Image source: Comcast. Comcast lost video subscribers for years after AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) started building out their IPTV infrastructure and promoting their new video services. The heavy promotions stopped a couple of years ago as AT&T and Verizon shifted their focuses and cord-cutting started impacting results; that's when Comcast started to win back customers. Now Comcast has a new brand of competition to deal with. Over-the-top services such as Sling TV and DIRECTV NOW are able to offer their services nationwide. Unlike traditional pay-TV competitors, over-the-top services don't require any physical infrastructure. Dish and AT&T have already launched their services. Hulu has a service in beta, and YouTube TV is coming soon. Verizon says it expects to launch its own service by the end of the year, and several other television streaming services exist as well. All told, the influx of competition is at a level unlike anything Comcast has ever seen before. Nonetheless, people -- for the most part -- have been slow to switch. Sling TV reportedly has 1.3 million subscribers. Its competitors have considerably fewer, and DIRECTV NOW is already having trouble holding on to its early signups. So far, the competition hasn't had a major impact on Comcast, but that doesn't mean it couldn't. In any event, Comcast is well-positioned should it start seeing subscriber losses again. Comcast isn't interested in launching a nationwide television-streaming platform like AT&T's, Verizon's, or Dish's. Nor should it be, as long as its traditional video service continues to perform well and generate loads of revenue. That said, Comcast is in a position such that it could quickly put together a nationwide streaming service of its own, should it decide to go that route. Earlier this year, the company exercised an option to obtain the streaming rights to several cable networks. While it doesn't include every network it would need to launch a successful over-the-top service, it's a good start -- and it cost Comcast nothing. Meanwhile, Comcast is in the midst of renegotiating deals with several major media companies, and nationwide streaming rights are likely to be a point of discussion. Media companies are desperate to increase their affiliate fee per subscriber as more people cut the cord, and throwing in additional perks like on-demand and streaming rights is one way to boost revenue. While it may cost Comcast a little more to buy the extra rights, it can use additional on-demand rights in its popular X1 platform -- which it credits for its reduced churn rate lately. It's also been able to increase its rates, although at a slower pace than programming costs. Consider it insurance in case the competition starts cutting into subscriber growth again. Furthermore, now that Comcast has its own wireless service, Xfinity Mobile, through its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon, it could market a nationwide bundle of mobile phone and television service. The move wouldn't have the same economic advantages as selling Xfinity Mobile into its existing territory, but it would give the company equal footing against Verizon and AT&T. For now, Comcast continues to perform well, slowly adding back subscribers, while its competitors look for growth anywhere they can get it. It's also well-positioned for a potential nationwide expansion. Indeed, Comcast shareholders have nothing to worry about. ","

Following Verizon's acquisition of core Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO) assets, the remaining entity has changed its name to Altaba, effective June 16. That company is worth far more than the $4.5 billion Verizon paid in its deal -- as of this writing, Altaba boasts a market cap of approximately $50 billion. Last week, the company registered itself with the SEC as a ""non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."" In other words, Altaba is left overseeing the remaining patent portfolio and other investments, including stakes in Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Yahoo! Japan, and a small position in Snap, among others. Here's what investors need to know about Altaba. Alibaba is Altaba's biggest investment. Image source: Alibaba. Altaba owns a 15% stake in Alibaba, which is valued at $341 billion as of this writing, making the investment worth over $51 billion. The 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan is worth about $8.5 billion., and the company also has around $11.5 billion in cash and just $1.3 billion in debt. By comparison, the 4.6 million shares of Snap, worth another $80 million or so, are just a blip in the portfolio. Nonetheless, Snap is one of its more noteworthy investments, which really helps exemplify how ""undiversified"" Altaba is as a holding company. Regardless, Altaba is still worth less than the sum of its parts. One of the big reasons for selling off the Yahoo! assets was to help unlock the value of its strategic investments. CEO Thomas McInerny is tasked with growing the portfolio, but he has one major task to deal with in the near term. Everything is great when you invest $1 billion in a company valued at $2.5 billion, and the company proceeds to grow more than 100-fold over the next decade. The problem comes when you want to harvest your investment. In this case, Altaba estimates it would have to pay $15 billion in taxes for an outright sale of its assets. McInerny's top task will be to reduce the that tax liability through strategic divestments of its holdings. It appears most investors are pricing in the likelihood of a 36.5% tax burden on any sale proceeds. That's the estimated effective tax rate Yahoo! cited in its regulatory filings. But if McInerny can reduce the tax burden, or regulations change, Altaba could be a discount means of investing in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan, and the rest of Altaba's portfolio. Given the vast majority of Altaba's value comes from its Alibaba stake, investors may be better off just investing directly in the latter. For one, it allows you to exercise much more control, without the uncertainty surrounding Altaba. Nor do you have to worry about Yahoo! Japan and the patent portfolio. ","

Shares of Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) have taken quite the beating recently. The company's stock has steadily moved in the wrong direction since it became clear that its purchase of Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) would not unlock a smooth path to growth. That $10.54 billion acquisition more than doubled the size of the company, adding approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband customers, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers. That was supposed to give Frontier the scale it needed to operate efficiently -- and in fact, that aspect of the Verizon purchase worked out. What it hasn't given the company is further growth. Frontier has lost some of the customers it paid for in all four quarters since the CTF deal closed. CEO Daniel McCarthy has remained upbeat through the entire process. Even though his company has had to cut its dividend, and plans a reverse stock split, he has focused on the light at the end of the tunnel. He shared his thoughts on what's next for the struggling company during its Q1 earnings call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required). The biggest challenge for Frontier has been holding onto customers. Image source: Getty Images. As noted above, one of the main goals of buying the Verizon assets was to create a more cost effective operation. That has happened, and the company expects it can even exceed its goals in this regard. ""We're pleased to have met our target of realizing $1.25 billion in annualized synergies,"" said McCarthy, and the company expects to achieve another incremental $350 million in annual savings by mid-year 2018. While saving money buys the company more time, it does not address the underlying issue of subscriber cancellations. The CEO addressed that as well, noting that trends have improved in that area for the last two quarters (though they have not turned positive). ""Our focus now is on improving our customer retention, enhancing customer experience, and continuing to improve our cost structure over the coming months,"" he said. ""With these initiatives, we are on path to subscriber and revenue stability and improved EBITDA later this year."" Cutting the company's dividend may upset shareholders, but the cut from $0.105 to $0.04 per share will free up about $300 million in cash annually, a figure that will rise to $400 million in the second half of 2018, according to McCarthy. That cash will be used to pay down debt at a faster rate. ""We also intend to issue secured debt in the near term to address upcoming maturities and reduce our cash interest expense,"" the CEO said. ""As our board looked at our long-term capital allocation strategy, we believe it was prudent to reduce the dividend now, enabling us to address the larger debt towers in coming years and giving us ample runway to delever."" While Q1 was the fourth straight quarter of subscriber losses since the CTF deal closed, McCarthy has had evolving explanations for those drops. For the first two quarters, he blamed a lack of marketing efforts due to complications from moving so many customers over. For the most recent two, he has cited Frontier having to purge its rolls of non-paying former Verizon subscribers. During the Q1 call though, he cited some positive signs. ""This was the third sequential quarter of gross adds improvement in CTF,"" he said. ""This was largely driven by a full quarter of our robust marketing program. We continue to fine-tune our distribution strategies and launched an enhanced digital commerce channel at the very end of the first quarter."" ","

The Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) has produced strong returns so far in 2017, rising 8% and setting new record-high closes 20 times since the beginning of the year. Yet for those who had hoped to outperform the Dow by using a popular strategy that focuses on high-dividend Dow components, this year hasn't been the best. The Dogs of the Dow are underperforming the broader market, and they've just barely managed to gain any ground at all as the year approaches the halfway point. Investment Price Gain in 2017 Year to Date Dow Jones Industrials 8.1% Dogs of the Dow 2.4% Source: Dogs of the Dow website. For those who aren't familiar with the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it's a simple way to try to improve on the performance of the overall Dow. To use the strategy, first figure out which 10 Dow stocks had the highest dividend yields at the beginning of 2017. Then, you invest equal amounts of money in each of the 10 stocks. Hold onto the stocks throughout the year, and at the beginning of 2018, you'll take a new look to see which 10 Dow components have the highest yields at that point. You can make replacements at that time, and then carry the strategy forward another year. The Dogs of the Dow strategy has been quite successful recently. In six of the past seven years, the strategy has outperformed the returns of the Dow Jones Industrials, and it has generated greater amounts of income in the process. That makes the Dogs especially attractive to dividend investors. Image source: Getty Images. However, as the table above shows, the Dogs of the Dow are well behind the overall Dow's performance. In general, there are four major reasons for the underperformance: It's too early to count the Dogs of the Dow out entirely. This year certainly isn't the first time that the Dogs have gotten off to a slow start, only to bounce back later in the year. In particular, because the Dogs of the Dow strategy combines elements of income and value investing philosophies, they will sometimes do better during times of greater market turbulence. Choppy markets often happen later in the year, especially in the historically challenging months of September and October, and that could give the Dogs an opportunity to catch up to and surpass the overall Dow. The big question for the Dogs is whether initiatives that investors have anticipated all year will come to pass before the end of 2017. For instance, a boom in construction and infrastructure spending at the federal government level could drive heightened sales and profits at heavy equipment manufacturer and Dow Dog Caterpillar, and its stock has already risen in anticipation of favorable trends. If those programs get put in place, then the corresponding rise could help push the Dogs forward overall. Conversely, pharma stocks have suffered from concerns over plans to control drug costs. With the two pure-play Dow pharma stocks both among the Dogs, any news that favors drug companies would disproportionately help the strategy's relative performance to the overall Dow. The Dogs of the Dow aren't living up to investors' expectations, but the strategy still has some long-term advantages in terms of simplicity, volatility, and risk-adjusted return. Moreover, with more than six months left in 2017, the Dogs of the Dow have every opportunity to make up for lost time and emerge victorious this year. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is made up of 30 of the most established and mature U.S. companies, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that many of the index components pay strong dividends. In fact, all 30 Dow components pay dividends, with annual yields ranging from 0.70% to 4.94%. Here are the 10 highest-paying Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, and a look at which ones are worth an investor's consideration now. Company Stock Symbol Recent Price Dividend Yield Verizon Communication VZ $46.72 4.94% Chevron CVX $106.40 4.06% Pfizer PFE $32.77 3.91% International Business Machines IBM $154.10 3.89% ExxonMobil XOM $82.13 3.75% Cisco Systems CSCO $31.37 3.70% General Electric GE $27.94 3.44% Coca-Cola KO $45.32 3.27% Procter & Gamble PG $88.16 3.13% Intel Corporation INTC $35.71 3.05% Data Source: TD Ameritrade. Prices and dividend yields as of 6/10/17. Having said that, if you're looking for high-dividend stocks, here are three Dow components that may be worth a look right now. Telecom giant Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is perhaps my single favorite stock for investors whose top priority is income. It pays nearly 5% per year, and its dividend is backed by reliable cash flow generated from its subscribers. In fact, Verizon's dividend represents about 62% of 2017's expected earnings of $3.75 per share, so the company could even absorb a significant earnings drop and still maintain its dividend payment. Image Source: Getty Images. The stock also has a history of low volatility, so it can produce a bond-like income stream, while still allowing you to sleep soundly at night. In addition, the stock trades for just 12.4 times 2017 earnings, far below the S&P 500's average forward earnings multiple of approximately 19. Tech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), better known as IBM, hasn't exactly performed well lately. ""Big Blue"" has fallen out of favor with investors, and its share price has fallen by 16% in the past three months alone, fueled by weaker-than-expected earnings in April and a downgrade of its credit rating in May. Warren Buffett's decision to sell 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the company didn't help, either. However, picking up shares of IBM now while the price is low could be a smart idea. IBM's cloud-related business is thriving and has room to grow. In fact, IBM's software-as-a-service (SaaS) sales grew 59% over the past year, and its high-growth ""strategic imperatives"" businesses now account for 42% of revenue and are growing at a double-digit rate. Plus, at just 11 times forward earnings and a nearly 4% yield that's covered more than twice over by the company's earnings, this could turn out to be an excellent value play for patient investors. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the largest oil companies in the world, and is among the top dividend payers, as well. Not only is ExxonMobil's dividend one of the highest in the Dow, but the company has a 34-year track record of dividend increases, no matter what the economy or the price of oil was doing. To be clear, I'm a fan of both oil stocks on the list (Chevron being the other), but I think ExxonMobil's size gives it a bit of an advantage. Perhaps my favorite thing about Exxon is its diverse business, which includes oil drilling, chemicals, and refining, just to name a few. Some of these obviously do better when oil prices are high, such as the company's drilling operations. However, when oil prices fall, refining profits actually increase. In other words, ExxonMobil is set up to make money no matter what oil prices do. In addition, the company has a rock-solid balance sheet and has historically been more effective at generating returns on capital than peers, as my colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out in a recent article. Finally, while renewable energy is definitely surging in popularity, oil demand is still expected to grow going forward. So don't worry about oil ""going away"" -- it isn't happening anytime soon.

    10 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks in The Dow Jones Industrial Average -- The Motley Fool

Brian Feroldi,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to investing in dividend-paying stocks, sometimes bigger is better. Any company that can afford to spend billions on dividend payments each year must have a solid business model. Otherwise, it would never promise to share so much wealth with its shareholders. So which companies are the biggest dividend payers on the market today? Here's a closer look at eight companies that have spent at least $8 billion on dividend payments over the past year. Image source: Apple. Sporting a market cap of around $765 billion, tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has become one of the world's largest publicly traded companies. Long-term shareholders can credit the company's phenomenal run to the tremendous popularity of the iPhone, while other products such as the iPad, Apple TV, the Apple Watch, and Mac computers, have helped round out the company's ecosystem. Over the past four quarters, Apple's suite of products has cranked out more than $45 billion in total profits. With so much cash coming in, Apple's management team has made a commitment to return a huge amount of its excess capital to shareholders. Part of that plan calls for regular dividend payments, and over the past 12 months, Apple has put more than $12 billion directly into shareholders' pockets. While Apple's 1.7% yield might not seem all that high, that $12 billion makes Apple the largest dividend payer on this list. Image source: Getty Images. The enormous plunge in oil and gas prices has hit every energy company hard over the past few years. That includes energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), as the integrated oil company's financial statements are sensitive to big commodity price swings. From peak to trough, Chevron's revenue plunged nearly 50% through the downturn, while profits fell even harder. Despite the pain, Chevron remained committed to paying out its strong dividend. That's quite an accomplishment, as its total dividend payments of more than $8 billion have dwarfed the company's net income of $2.9 billion over the past four quarters. Chevron has largely relied on asset sales to help fund the difference between the two numbers. The company's recent results are starting to paint a rosier picture. Production and energy prices are climbing, while costs are on the decline. If this trend holds up, then Chevron's profitability should start to bounce back. John Flannery was recently named chairman and CEO of General Electric. Image source: General Electric. General Electric (NYSE:GE) has reinvented itself several times since its founding more than a century ago. In recent years, GE has been focused on returning to its industrial roots and has been selling off a variety of business units. Investors also recently learned that longtime CEO Jeff Immelt is stepping aside and being replaced by industry veteran John Flannery to keep the transition going. In spite of all of the changes, GE has remained committed to using its huge financial resources to reward its shareholders. Over the past 12 months, GE has spent more than $8.5 billion on dividend payments. At current prices, GE's stock yields more than 3.4%. If Flannery's changes can get the company's profit engine humming, then shareholders should be able to expect ever more dividend bumps in the years ahead. Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been an acquisition machine for decades and now counts more than 250 operating companies in its empire. Its companies sell products in three broad product categories: consumer products, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. While all three divisions churn out predictable profits, the company is counting on its pharmaceutical division to deliver revenue and profit growth over the next few years. One big benefit of selling healthcare products is that demand tends to be very stable. That has afforded Johnson & Johnson will the luxury of being able to pass along regular price increases and provide its shareholders with regular dividend bumps. In fact, J&J has grown its dividend for 54 years in a row. Over the past year, J&J has paid out more than $8.6 billion in dividends to its investors, which gives its stock a yield of more than 2.5%. That's impressive, but since its dividend payment consumes only about half of net income, there appears to be plenty of room left for dividend increases down the road. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was slow to embrace the cloud-computing revolution, but all of that changed when CEO Satya Nadella took the reins in 2014. The company has since invested aggressively to move its iconic Office suite of products into the cloud. In addition, Microsoft's Azure web-services platform is growing quickly and currently holds the second-place spot behind Amazon.com. When combined with the success of its Surface products, Mr. Softy's profits have trended in the right direction over the past few years. With a growing pile of profits, Microsoft has used its ample cash hoard to reward shareholders with regular dividend increases. Over the past year, Microsoft has spent more than $11.6 billion on its dividend payments, and that generous payout represents only about two-thirds of the company's $17.8 billion in total net income. With profits expected to increase as the company's move to the cloud continues to takes hold, investors should be able to expect more dividend bumps from here. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T (NYSE:T) has enjoyed surging demand for wireless data as consumers have raced to get their hands on the largest and greatest smartphone. However, the market now appears to be saturated, and wireless prices are falling, so the company is looking for a new avenue to drive profit growth from here. That's why the company is pushing hard to complete its $108 billion acquisition of Time Warner. If the deal goes through, the company will be far more diversified and should have an easier time retaining customers by offering more attractive packaged deals. AT&T's investors should have their fingers crossed that the deal goes through, since the company's payout ratio is getting uncomfortably high. In the past year, AT&T has spent more than $11.7 billion on dividend payments, which is awfully close to the $12.5 billion in net income the company pulled in. While AT&T's 5% dividend yield is enticing, there isn't a whole lot of wiggle room should profits take a dip. That could happen if regulators choose to block the Time Warner transaction and wireless prices continue to fall. And that could put the company's 32-year-long history of consecutive dividend increases in jeopardy. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil is another energy giant that's been a bankable long-term investment. The company has paid out a growing dividend for 35 consecutive years, which includes its recent 2.7% bump earlier this year. Exxon's enviable track record has been driven by its management team's knack for using capital effectively. The company places an emphasis on funding projects that have high returns on capital, which helped to keep its profit engine humming throughout the recent downturn. Over the past year, Exxon has churned out more than $10 billion in net income, which is impressive given the energy slump. While that wasn't enough to fully cover the $12.7 billion spent on dividends, Exxon's profits are on the upswing thanks to cost-cutting measures and stronger commodity prices. With plenty of growth projects waiting in the wings, it might not be long before ExxonMobil's earnings fully cover the 3.7% dividend yield. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is another dominant telecommunications giant that cranks out huge amounts of profits each year. While the company is also experiencing pricing pressure in the wireless space, the company's recent move to offer unlimited data is helping keep its customers loyal. Like AT&T, Verizon has gone on a spending spree as of late, as a way to drive future profit growth. The company recently bought out both AOL and Yahoo! in an effort to build out its digital advertising business. Verizon has increased its dividend each year for more than a decade and currently offers a 5% yield. Over the past year, its dividend has consumed $9.2 billion, but that's only about 75% of the $12.2 billion in net income it pulled in. If the company's big bets on digital advertising pay off, the company's streak of dividend increases shoulnd be able to continue from here. ","

                                   which owns the iShares suite of funds, couldn’t be immediately reached for a comment. “Vanguard is definitely more pure—it is focused on just growth or value, whereas the iShares approach is more about tilting towards one or the other, not being exclusionary,” Venuto said. “If you’re using them to balance each other out, that wouldn’t work. You need to be sure that the portfolio you’re constructing looks the way you want it to; just because you’re using ETFs, that doesn’t mean you’re not a stock picker still.” The overlap hasn’t meant that the value and growth funds see the same performance. The iShares growth fund is up 14.5% thus far this year, while the value fund is up 4.9%. However, the two did have a narrower gap in performance than the Vanguard products, where the value fund is up 5.4% in 2017 and the growth one is up 15.8%. Such “smart beta” funds screen an underlying index—the S&P 500 in the case of iShares—for names that meet its inclusion criteria. A value fund, for example, might look at such metrics as price-to-earnings and price-to-book and buy the names that appear undervalued on these scores. (There are 319 holdings in the growth ETF and 351 in the value fund.) That a stock appears in both funds doesn’t necessarily reflect a problem with the way the funds are constructed; companies can have attributes of both. In the case of Johnson & Johnson, “the idea that it’s both growth and value is interesting,” Venuto said. “It is a major part of the consumer space, which is growing, but at the same time it’s also an old-school established dividend play.” Apple Inc.

However, Apple’s price-to-earnings ratio is 17.12, below the P/E of the S&P 500 at around 22. That boosts the argument that it is a value play.

                                   has struggled mightily recently. Shares of the media publishing company fell more than 5% Thursday, in the wake of its announcement this week that it was cutting 300 jobs in a major restructuring. To add insult to injury, analysts at Macquarie Research downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform on Thursday. “Time’s rejection of unsolicited offers for the company in late April puts the heat on the company to even more rapidly enact a turnaround,” lead analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients. “Time will now be pruning select magazine titles to raise cash and de-risk from this large portion of their revenue base, which should enable them to launch more digital-only brands.” Don’t miss:  Time Inc. to cut 300 jobs in shift to digital Time’s declines in print circulation and advertising are accelerating, Nollen said, and at the moment the company is struggling to offset those declines with growth in online video. The company, which owns such magazine brands as namesake Time, Sports Illustrated, People and Fortune, hopes the cuts it announced will help streamline the business and allow it focus on digital and video opportunities. Time Inc. made sure to make a big display of its digital and video potential during its Newfront in May and showcased its new and upcoming projects to a ballroom full of potential advertisers. But right now print still makes up about 70% of Time’s revenue, and in the first quarter print ad revenue declined 21%. In the company’s first-quarter earnings release it said its 8% decline in overall revenue reflected the declines in print, advertising and circulation revenues. And it likely won’t get any better in the second quarter with Manga Global forecasting that magazine advertising will continue to drop as much as 25% year-over-year by 2021.

By Amazon.com is one of the biggest, and therefore most influential, stocks in the U.S. equity market, and it has surged more than 30% so far this year. Netflix is another trading favorite, up more than 20% in 2017 and nearly 60% over the past 12 months. So here’s a trivia question: how much have these iconic stocks, both of which embody the current internet age, directly contributed to the gain of the overall technology sector, itself the biggest gainer of the year, up more than 14%? Trick question—they’ve contributed nothing. That answer may come as a surprise, given that Amazon

Wall Street is riddled with such counterintuitive sector placements, and this has become more of an issue as companies expand into business lines that are outside of their primary industry. “Companies today are not old fashioned monoliths that only do one thing; they do a wide range of stuff,” said David Blitzer, who, as the chairman and a managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices helps decide which sector S&P 500 companies are assigned to. Companies with major presences in multiple sectors “is an issue that we’ve been increasingly grappling with in the past few years.” A number of companies appear in sectors that one might not expect.

However, there are only 10 select sector indexes because there aren’t enough telecom stocks to merit their own distinct index.) But Amazon is perhaps the biggest example of how difficult it has become to classify stocks within a single sector category. That it is classified as a discretionary name is certainly logical. While it is “the epitome of the tech business,” as Blitzer described it, Amazon is also one of the biggest names in retail, just of the (mostly) online sort. However, a notable part of Amazon’s revenue comes from its cloud-computing technology, a business segment that, were it spun out into its own company, would likely be considered tech, even though it could be argued it has many of the same attributes as a utility. Amazon also has begun producing its own video content, something that makes it a competitor to media companies. Further complicating the issue, consumers use Amazon to buy consumer staples, not just discretionary items, unlike the retailers that cater to more specific consumer categories. And on Friday, Amazon agreed to buy Whole Foods

                                   which, as a grocery store, falls into the consumer staples space. Companies can’t be in two sectors at once, so what keeps Amazon in discretionary? Sector assignments are dictated by the global industry classification standard, which is a joint effort between S&P Dow Jones and MSCI. To classify a company, the GICS team looks at its different revenue streams, which determine what various subindexes the company fits into. There are more than 170 such niche categories, but if more than 65% of a company’s revenue is in one subindex, the company is assigned to whatever sector that subindex fits into. In Amazon’s case, the online retail business—discretionary spending, for the most part—surpasses this threshold. “If you’re making 10% of your money from cloud computing and 90% from selling stuff, you’re selling stuff,” Blitzer said. “From our point of view, it’s a retailer.” Other companies are harder to classify, with Blitzer singling out Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

There is precedent for companies jumping from sector to sector as their business focus changes. Perhaps most notably, S&P last year decided that real-estate companies had become prominent enough on their own to merit their own separate category. As such, they were spun out from their former home, financials. Investors are increasingly looking to passive index-based funds to get broad exposure to the market, and the 10 Select Sector funds are among the most popular ways to make bets on individual sectors; the 10 SPDR ETFs have $121.6 billion in combined assets, according to FactSet data. Because of this, confusion about where companies do or should fit can cause a problem. If Amazon moves on tech news, that can have an influence on the rest of the consumer discretionary sector. Blitzer said he was aware that some people may buy a sector fund to get exposure to a particular trend and not realize the companies they want aren’t actually in it. Related: The biggest emerging-market ETF doesn’t hold some of the biggest EM stocks “It seems like no one reads the prospectus, and that no one outside our office reads the methodology of our funds,” he said. “I’d like everyone to read the documents carefully, but if they don’t, so long as our stuff is correct and available, we’ve done as much as we can.” ",Did you buy a tech ETF to cash in on Amazon?

His successor will have to manage a myriad of troubles for the company.
    USA TODAY ""The thing that made him and the company successful is now causing havoc,"" Brad Stone, author of The Upstarts, which chronicles category-altering companies such as Uber and Airbnb, says of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.(Photo: Will Oliver, USA TODAY) SAN FRANCISCO — Want to run Uber? You'd better have a steel constitution for cleaning up cultural rot and the insight to make the leaky business profitable. As the ride-hailing start-up gets set to replace co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick, who resigned late Tuesday after a group of investor firms pushed him to quit, it's on the hunt for a change agent who can revamp a company that's riddled with uncertainty and still hasn't passed one of the biggest tests of a start-up — its IPO. ""The challenges they face as a business are as substantial as the recruiting challenges,"" says Stephen Beck, founder of competitive strategy consultancy cg42. ""There is a combination of factors that will create some significant pause for any qualified manager to come in."" Among the issues: — A host of new faces in both vacant senior positions as well as on the board. On Wednesday, Uber confirmed that TPG Capital's David Bonderman, who stepped down after a sexist remark during the company's all-hands on sexism and other matters, will be replaced by TPG's David Trujillo. And Benchmark Capital confirmed that longtime Kalanick adviser turned skeptic Bill Gurley will be replaced by Benchmark's Matt Cohler. — Whether Kalanick, who remains on the board with powerful voting shares, is truly out of the picture. With this forceful personality still tinkering under Uber's hood, some candidates might balk. — How entrenched its cultural problems are. They range from a sexist work environment to strategic practices that sometimes skirt the law. Uber has many top positions to fill, including president, COO and CFO, meaning big leadership holes at a company with 12,000 employees. — And perhaps most significantly is the tenuous ride-hailing business model. It relies heavily on raised capital to keep fares artificially low. Uber and Lyft both are ploughing money into self-driving cars, but it remains to be seen when that cost-saving tech will fully come on line. CEO Travis Kalanick's decision to take an indefinite leave of absence calls Uber's IPO plans into question. (Photo: Uber Technologies) Uber's board has not made clear the extent of Kalanick's removal from day-to-day operations, nor has it clearly signaled how it will snare a CEO at this pivotal time in the company's history. Raising the urgency: its market share has slipped to rival Lyft and its brand image is tarnished with riders. ""It's surprising how incomplete the messaging is from (Uber's) board, ranging from Kalanick's exact role to who they're retained to conduct the CEO search,"" says Jason Schloetzer, a corporate governance expert and professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. ""The fact that so much wasn't said reveals the continued instability at the highest levels of Uber."" Schloetzer says that if Kalanick stays involved in key Uber decisions, that might cause CEO candidates ""to be cautious about throwing their hat in the ring."" An Uber spokesperson wouldn't elaborate on the board's statement, which framed Kalanick's departure as ""a bold decision and a sign of his devotion and love for Uber,"" while allowing the company ""to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber’s history."" Candidates for this challenging but potentially lucrative CEO post — Uber has been valued at upward of $70 billion — are at this point just rumored. They include names that were reported in past weeks as Uber searched for a chief operations officer to partner with Kalanick at the helm. A Fox Business report citing unnamed sources mentioned two potential COO candidates, Thomas Staggs, the former Walt Disney COO, and Karenann Terrell, former chief information officer of Walmart. The names of YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and former Ford CEO Alan Mulally, credited with a turnaround and winning the hearts of employees, have also been thrown into the ring, reports tech site Recode. Another buzzy Silicon Valley name is Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, whose operations acumen and cultural imprimatur could serve Uber well. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg at the 92nd Street Y in New York on April 23. (Photo: Noam Galai, WireImage) p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica}span.s1 {font-kerning: none} But Sandberg is unlikely to leave the social networking company if offered the role, according to sources close to Sandberg. Although hiring a woman for the top Uber job would send a powerful signal that its egregious treatment of women might come to a swift end, the company must deal in concrete changes and not merely symbolic ones, says Barbara Annis, founder of Gender Intelligence Group and co-author with Richard Nesbitt of Results at the Top: Using Gender Intelligence to Create Breakthrough Growth. ""You can’t put the onus on one woman to fix that problem, you need to look at the whole leadership team,"" says Annis. ""There’s a whole cultural norm at Uber, an alpha-male culture that is part of its nature. So let’s put someone in who has a value system and can create an inclusive culture with a management team aligned on that. You don’t want the 'poster woman' in there."" Then there's the cult of the founder. The tech industry in particular has a fascination with the role a founder plays in driving the innovation that distinguishes one start-up in a field with another. That belief is persuasive enough to bring some ousted leaders back. Consultant Beck cites two familiar examples of iconic brands that were saved when founders stepped back in, Apple (with Steve Jobs) and Starbucks (with Howard Schultz). ""Some say, 'founders can only take a company so far,' but there are examples when professional management isn't always the panacea you hope for."" Related: Uber hits some mammoth potholes Yes, Uber has lost ridership to Lyft during this crisis Uber's Kalanick faces crisis over 'baller' culture Can Uber really change? An Uber engineer killed himself. His widow says the workplace is to blame. In fact, before Kalanick's abrupt departure — as recently as last week, the CEO had decided to opt for an extended leave in part to grieve the death of his mother after a late May boating accident — board member Arianna Huffington had repeatedly mentioned how Kalanick was integral to Uber's disruptive nature. And new human resources chief Liane Hornsey told USA TODAY that her boss was ""extraordinarily fair"" and bent on changing the company while driving it forward on a global scale. With such testimonials, there could be a temptation to keep Kalanick involved, thereby limited the corrective powers of a new CEO. Under Levandowski, Uber's self-driving program appeared to be making good progress. His abrupt departure leaves the program's prospects in doubt. (Photo: Uber Technologies) But perhaps the biggest hurdle facing any new chief executive isn't Uber's cultural problems or its legal issues, which range from a federal investigation into its Greyball technology that fooled regulators to an ongoing lawsuit brought by Google's self-driving car company Waymo over allegedly stolen trade secrets. And that is Uber's business model. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Times New Roman'}p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px}span.s1 {font-kerning: none} Despite heavy operational losses – Uber said it lost $708 million in the first three months of this year, narrower than Q4's $991 million — the ride-hailing start-up’s market value has floated between $69 billion and $70 billion, making it the most-valued unicorn company. But its public woes are causing Uber's shares to take a hit on the secondary market among investors. Brokers told news site The Information that investors in recent months have paid 15% less for Uber stock, lowering its market value to $50 billion. At the same time, the site reported, some Uber shareholders have looked to offload their holdings. Analysts have long been nervous about how both ride-hailing companies, Uber and Lyft, are spending some of the billions in cash on keeping fares artificially low in order to drive up ridership. That model ultimately resolves itself in one of two ways if the company wants to turn to profitability, critical if Uber wants to push ahead with an initial public offering: getting consumers so reliant on the service that they don't balk when prices are inevitably raised, or using self-driving technology to replace the costly human driver. Uber's next CEO will have to both fix a range of internal issues as well as convince investors that ultimately the company will become massively profitable, says Mike Ramsey, analyst with Gartner. ""I do think there's an existential threat to this business model,"" says Ramsey. ""There are already cracks in it. Despite what analysts say about their exponential growth, there are things that need to be worked out (with the model) or this won't work.""

We have experienced the advances in our computing devices, with smartphones having greater computing power than yesterday’s supercomputers. Now, every technology with a computing base is advancing on an exponential curve — including sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics, synthetic biology and 3-D printing. And when technologies converge, they allow industries to encroach on one another.

                                   Facebook, SpaceX, and Oneweb are in a race to provide Wi-Fi internet access everywhere through drones, microsatellites and balloons. At first, they will use the telecom companies to provide their services; then they will turn them into toast. The motivation of the technology industry is, after all, to have everyone online all the time. Their business models are to monetize data rather than to charge cell, data, or access fees. They will also end up disrupting electronic entertainment — and every other industry that deals with information. The disruptions don’t happen within an industry, as business executives have been taught by gurus such as Clayton Christensen, author of management bible “The Innovator’s Dilemma”; rather, they come from where you would least expect them to. Christensen postulated that companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because these markets usually have very tight profit margins or are too small, leading competitors to start off by providing lower-end products and then scale them up, or to go for niches in a market that the incumbent is ignoring. But the competition no longer comes from the lower end of a market; it comes from other, completely different, industries. The problem for incumbents, the market leaders, is that they aren’t ready for this disruption and are often in denial. Because they have succeeded in the past, companies believe that they can succeed in the future, that old business models can support new products. Large companies are usually organized into divisions and functional silos, each with its own product development, sales, marketing, customer support and finance functions. Each division acts from self-interest and focuses on its own success; within a fortress that protects its ideas, it has its own leadership and culture. And employees focus on the problems of their own divisions or departments — not on those of the company. Too often, the divisions of a company consider their competitors to be the company’s other divisions; they can’t envisage new industries or see the threat from other industries. Read: 5 ways the Amazon–Whole Foods deal could change the way we shop This is why the majority of today’s leading companies are likely to go the way of Blockbuster, Motorola, Sears and Kodak, which were at the top of their game until their markets were disrupted, sending them toward oblivion. Companies now have to be on a war footing. They need to learn about technology advances and see themselves as a technology startup in Silicon Valley would: as a juicy target for disruption. They have to realize that the threat may arise in any industry, with any new technology. Companies need all hands on board — with all divisions working together employing bold new thinking to find ways to reinvent themselves and defend themselves from the onslaught of new competition. The choice that leaders face is to disrupt themselves — or to be disrupted.

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"The news stoked speculation about the future of the T-Mobile-Sprint tie-up, and also about other potential merger partners for T-Mobile. Analysts have said that the telecoms and cable sectors are primed for a wave of deal activity, and executives have openly talked about potential mergers. If the talks with Charter and Comcast fail, Sprint’s negotiating position could weaken if it were to restart merger talks with T-Mobile, JPMorgan analysts said. T-Mobile’s shares fell 3.3 percent on Tuesday to $61.06, while Dish shares were up 0.3 percent at $64.02. Sprint shares were last up 2.7 percent at $8.22. Analysts have speculated that Dish, a satellite TV provider that has been buying up wireless spectrum, could be an attractive acquisition target for both Verizon and T-Mobile. Sprint’s talks to provide the backbone for a wireless network for Comcast and Charter serve as a “three-way hedge” for the companies, said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “From a game theory perspective, this is a fascinating move,” Moffett wrote in an email. The two cable companies are hedging for a possible tie-up between Sprint and T-Mobile that could reduce their negotiating leverage, and the wireless deal also allows Sprint to hedge against the risk that a merger with T-Mobile never happens, Moffett said. A wireless deal with Comcast and Charter would also give Sprint more bargaining leverage if it does secure a tie-up with T-Mobile, he added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the negotiations between the companies on Monday, said Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. A minority equity investment was being discussed but that may not be part of any deal, sources told Reuters. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources said. Comcast and Charter announced a wireless partnership in May in a bid to offset customer attrition as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Comcast also already has an MVNO agreement with Sprint that stems from the cable company’s 2008 investment in Clearwire Corp. A source familiar with the matter said Comcast would seek better terms for that agreement given the highly competitive nature of the wireless business and technological changes in the past nine years. MVNOs do not own networks, and instead rent capacity from established operators to sell on to their customers, usually at low prices due to their small overheads, with cheap distribution through the internet or convenience stores. The cable companies’ agreement with Verizon restricts them to offer wireless within their own service areas, while a deal with Sprint could allow them to offer the service nationally. Verizon shares were down 1.6 percent on Tuesday at $44.97. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"WILMINGTON, Del./BOSTON (Reuters) - Sprint Corp used confidential information from its alliance with RadioShack Corp to open competing mobile phone stores, dooming the comeback by the electronics retailer and destroying jobs, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by RadioShack creditors. RadioShack emerged from bankruptcy in 2015 with a deal to co-brand about 1,400 stores with Sprint, which was meant to help the telecoms provider better compete with larger rivals AT&T Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. However, by early 2017 RadioShack, owned by General Wireless, had returned to bankruptcy and is liquidating. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court by RadioShack’s official committee of unsecured creditors says that Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint breached its contract with RadioShack, and is seeking $500 million in damages. Sprint allegedly ignored its obligations to provide inventory and staff to RadioShack stores because of its own financial troubles. Sprint spokesman David Tovar said the company was disappointed by the creditors’ committee action and Sprint expected to defend the matter vigorously. The lawsuit alleges that in 2016, Sprint used confidential information obtained from RadioShack to open 200 competing stores near RadioShack’s best locations, sinking any comeback for the electronics chain. “Sprint’s action destroyed nearly 6,000 RadioShack jobs,” said the lawsuit. The allegations stand in sharp contrast to promises made less than seven months ago by the chief executive officer of SoftBank, Sprint’s Japanese parent company, that he would create U.S. jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump made jobs the centerpiece of his election campaign. SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son was among the first foreign business leaders to meet with then-President-elect Donald Trump at his New York headquarters and praised the Republican for a raft of planned deregulations. The CEO promised to invest $50 billion with the aim of hiring 50,000 people in the United States. Trump took credit for the commitment and reported in late December that Sprint had committed to bringing 5,000 jobs to the United States. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp is in talks with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp about a partnership to boost the two U.S. cable companies’ wireless offerings, according to sources familiar with the matter. Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other’s consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added. One of the sources said that a minority equity investment was being discussed but that it may not be part of any deal. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources added. Sprint, Comcast and Charter declined to comment. An agreement with the cable providers over its network does not mean Sprint may not also seek a merger agreement with T-Mobile, which is controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG, the sources said. Sprint sees the partnership as increasing competition in the market, which should help alleviate any antitrust concerns over a merger with T-Mobile, the source added. Investors have long expected a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless service providers, anticipating cost cuts and other synergies in the range of $6 billion to $10 billion. Three years ago, Sprint ended a previous round of talks to acquire T-Mobile amid opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump offered support for emerging technologies including unmanned aerial vehicles and next-generation wireless networks in a meeting on Thursday with the chiefs of AT&T Inc and General Electric Co and other business leaders. The White House brought together venture capitalists and executives from the telecommunications and drone, or unmanned aerial system, industries to discuss how the government can speed technologies to market. The meeting, which lasted more than three hours including breakout sessions, is part of Trump’s effort to tap industry experts on how to boost U.S. competitiveness in various fields and create jobs. On Monday, Trump met with the heads of 18 U.S. technology companies including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, seeking their help to make the government’s computing systems more efficient. He will meet with energy industry leaders next week. “We want them to create new companies and lots of jobs,” Trump told the executives on Thursday. “We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.” In attendance were chief executives of several drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc. Drone makers argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does not require automakers to win pre-approval of self-driving vehicle technologies. Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc also took part. Venture capital firms included Revolution LLC, headed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. Obama administration rules opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for deliveries beyond the view of an operator. Security issues would need to be addressed. The Federal Aviation Administration in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000. Last year, regulators cleared the way for next-generation 5G wireless networks, with expected speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020 but infrastructure hurdles remain. Wireless signals need to be much faster and more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or remote control of machinery. 5G networks could help to wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines.

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to American Tower Corporation's (AMT) offering of $750 million senior unsecured notes due 2027. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to repay existing debt, including debt under its 2013 and 2014 revolving credit facilities. Proceeds may also be used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2017, pro forma outstanding borrowings on AMT's RCFs totalled approximately $2.9 billion. The pro forma amount reflects the net repayment of approximately $95 million on is 2013 credit facility subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017. AMT currently has a Fitch Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong FCF and Margins: AMT's ratings are supported by the financial flexibility provided by its strong FCF and its high EBITDA margin, which has been consistently around 60% in recent years. The tower business model translates into strong, sustainable operating performance and FCF growth, aided by the company's significant scale and the favorable demand characteristics for wireless services (particularly data). Stable Growth Model: AMT is expected to continue to post strong FCF, generate mid- to high-single-digit organic growth and maintain relatively stable margins. Tower revenues are predictable, and growth is provided by contractual escalators embodied in long-term lease contracts and there are strong prospects for additional business. The tower industry is benefiting from wireless carriers continued investment in their fourth generation (4G) networks to meet rapidly growing demand for mobile broadband services. Stable Outlook: At March 31, 2017, net leverage was 5.0x, and Fitch expects AMT's net leverage to decline slightly to under 5.0x at the end of 2017. Leverage has gradually declined following AMT's acquisitions over the last couple of years, including the acquisition of the rights to towers and outright purchases of towers from Verizon Communications Inc. in 2015. Consolidation Risk Manageable: Fitch believes U.S. wireless consolidation, if it were to occur, would not have a material effect on AMT's operations. Revenue growth from continued lease activity and contractual escalators in the U.S market would more than offset the relatively modest losses occurring over time due to consolidation. International Exposure: Similar wireless service demand trends are occurring internationally, with wireless data services at an earlier stage of development than in the U.S. Excluding pass-through revenues, the company's international operations generated approximately 34% of total property revenues in the first quarter of 2017. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --In 2017, consolidated revenue grows to approximately $6.6 billion, based on expectations for property revenue to be near the mid-point of company guidance of $6.5 billion. In 2018 and thereafter, Fitch assumes revenue grows in the 4%-5% range due to contractual escalators and new-business growth. --EBITDA margins decline slightly in 2017 due to the lower margins associated with acquired properties but increase moderately thereafter as additional tenants are added to towers. --Capital spending of approximately $850 million in 2017. --Moderate stock repurchases as net leverage under 5x is reached, with further deleveraging arising from EBITDA growth (rather than debt repayment). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: At the current 'BBB' level, Fitch does not currently anticipate near-term developments that could lead to an upgrade of the rating. Negative: A negative rating action could occur if operating performance falls short of expectations of at least mid-single-digit organic growth combined with margin pressure, or if a significant transaction, or share repurchases, results in expectations for net leverage sustained above 5x for longer than an 18-24 month period. LIQUIDITY In Fitch's opinion, AMT has a strong liquidity position supported by its FCF, cash on hand and availability on its revolving credit facilities. Operationally, cash flow generation should remain strong. For 2016, FCF (cash provided by operating activities less capital spending and dividends) was approximately $1 billion. As of March 31, 2017, cash approximated $713 million and unused revolver capacity was approximately $1.77 billion. Of the cash balance, approximately $564 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. AMT has two revolving credit facilities: a $2 billion, multi-currency facility due in January 2022 (the 2014 RCF) and a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility due in June 2020 (the 2013 RCF). The principal financial covenants limited total debt/adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) to no more than 6.0x (up to 7.0x for specified time periods following a qualified acquisition). The covenants limit senior secured debt/adjusted EBITDA to 3.0x for the company and its subsidiaries. If debt ratings are below a specified level at the end of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense must be no less than 2.5x for as long as the ratings are below the specified level. There are no material maturities in 2017, and approximately $1.5 billion matures in 2018. Contact: Primary Analyst John C. Culver, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3216 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

(AABA) holds the balance of the remaining Yahoo assets, including 15.4% of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), following Verizon Communications Inc.'s (VZ) partial acquisition. The newly minted $52 billion market cap seems pricey, but no one really knows the value of this corporate hodgepodge or how it's going to grow in the coming years. Technically speaking, the stock is well positioned for gains through the rest of 2017 because the new entity has adopted Yahoo's long-term chart, yielding a timely breakout above the 2014 high at $52.62. While it's easy to second guess this glued-together reporting, consider that other big caps including United States Steel Corporation (X) and AT&T Inc. (T) have also sewn together bits and pieces of newly acquired operations or divestitures into multi-decade price charts. (See also: What Is Altaba Anyway?) AABA Long-Term Chart (1996 – 2017) The former company came public at $1.49 (after adjustment for five stock splits) in April 1996 and fell into a downtrend that found support near 65 cents. It then entered a powerful trend advance driven by the awakening of the net bubble, rising to an all-time high at $125.03 in March 2000. The subsequent downtrend relinquished the majority of the prior decade's dramatic gains, dropping the stock more than 97% to $4.01 at the end of 2002. The subsequent uptrend topped out at $43.66 in January 2006, highlighting severe technical damage because the rally failed to reach the .386 Fibonacci bear market retracement level. A pullback into 2008 accelerated during the economic collapse, dropping the stock back into the single digits for the second time in six years. It underperformed badly after hitting a bottom in November 2008, stuck in a narrow trading range bounded by resistance in the upper teens. The stock took off in the strongest buying impulse so far this decade in the second half of 2012, breaking out above the 2006 high in October 2014 before topping out in the low $50s a few weeks later. It then entered a steep correction that found support in the upper $20s in early 2016, ahead of an equally strong bounce that reached within a few points of the prior high in May 2017, just a few weeks before this month's post-acquisition breakout. (For more, see: Verizon Officially Now Owns Yahoo, Mayer Resigns.) AABA Short-Term Chart (2015 – 2017) The sell-off into 2016 unfolded through an Elliott five-wave decline, perfectly aligned with bearish action throughout the tech universe during that period. The stock tested the September 2015 low at $27.20 in February 2016, broke down and then rallied strongly, setting off a 2B buy signal that denotes the failure of bears to hold new resistance. Rumors about a company sale or divestiture generated speculative buying interest into September, when it disclosed high-profile hacking incidents that raised questions about the company's valuation. (For more, see: Yahoo Confirms Massive Data Breach.) On-balance volume (OBV) topped out in 2014 and entered a persistent distribution wave that ended four months before the price bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016. This bullish divergence contributed to steady buying interest that reached a new high ahead of the Verizon sale. The transaction triggered high-volume price bars and a sharp indicator downturn to a nine-month low, signaling aggressive profit taking as well as new purchases. The OBV downturn tells us that the stock needs to rebuild previously loyal sponsorship to continue the 16-month uptrend. However, the price remains in breakout mode, and it makes sense to ignore recent signals because they're unfolding right at the interface between the two corporate identities. In other words, this seemingly bearish activity could reflect the natural rotation from one set of shareholder hands to another. (See also: On-Balance Volume: The Way to Smart Money.) Altaba came to life after Yahoo sold key assets to Verizon, with the new entity using the parent's long-term chart. The split has triggered a major breakout undermined by a bearish volume signal, but we'll ignore that red flag for now, given broad tech strength and confusion about the new entity's legitimate supply and demand.

(AABA), the remnant of Yahoo after the core internet assets were sold to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), announced the final results of its modified Dutch auction to purchase up to $3 billion of shares with the company spending $3.4 billion. The company said Thursday a total of 64,514,767 shares of its stock were tendered at or below the final purchase price of $53.20 a share. Altaba said it accepted the purchase price and spent about $3.4 billion to buy back the shares. The $3.4 billion excludes fees and expenses related to the tender offer and represents around 6.7% of the shares outstanding as of June 20. (See also: Revised Deal: Verizon to Pay $350M Less for Yahoo.) In May, Yahoo announced the Dutch auction, saying then the price would not be less than $37 a share and that its directors and executive officers will not tender any shares in the buyback. The company started trading this week under the name Altaba, which is a play on the world ""alternative"" and Alibaba (BABA), in which it has a 15% stake, valued at around $341 billion. Recently, shares of Altaba were trading up 0.53%, or $0.28 to $55.34. The stock has been gaining all week as investors view it as a cheaper way to get a piece of Alibaba Group, the Chinese ecommerce giant. While the former Yahoo basically looks like a holding company for a stake in the Chinese retailer, Yahoo warned in a regulatory filing last year that Alibaba could get hit with a massive tax bill of as much as 36.5% if it tried to buy back the shares. Investors also get access to a stake in Yahoo Japan valued at $7.7 billion by owning shares of Altaba. The company also has $12 billion in cash and marketable debts, $130 million in minority investments including in Snap Inc. (SNAP) and a $740 million stake in Excalibur, which is a unit of the new company that holds patents of Yahoo that were not sold to Verizon. Leading the new company is Yahoo board member Thomas McInerney, formerly the chief financial officer for IAC/InterActiveCorp. (which owns Investopedia), who has been on the board since 2012 and sat on the independent board committee charged with selling Yahoo’s core internet assets.

Leo Sun,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Telecom stocks are popular with income investors because they offer high yields and steady growth and their moats are tough for new competitors to cross. But with so many telco stocks on the market, it can be hard to identify the best plays. Let's take a closer look at three of my personal favorites -- AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and BCE (NYSE:BCE). AT&T pays a forward dividend yield of 5.2%, and it's hiked that dividend annually for over three decades. It spent 95% of its earnings and 70% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months -- so it can easily keep raising its dividend for the foreseeable future. Image source: Pixabay. AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. after Verizon, and it's the largest pay TV provider in the country, thanks to its purchase of DirecTV in 2015. If its proposed takeover of Time Warner clears regulatory hurdles, it will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world. AT&T is bundling these services together in lucrative packages to lock in customers. Its wireless customers, for example, can stream content from DirecTV and its ""sponsored data"" partners without the usage counting toward their data plans. It also recently bundled Time Warner's HBO channels with its unlimited wireless plans. Analysts expect AT&T's revenue to fall 2% this year and for its earnings to rise 2%. Those are lackluster growth figures, but the stock trades at just 19 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 22 for telecom companies. Verizon also pays a forward yield of 5.2%, and it's hiked that dividend for 10 straight years. It spent 76% of its earnings on those dividends over the past 12 months. However, Verizon's free cash flow also dipped into the red over the past year -- partly due to its buyout of Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless in 2014 and its subsequent purchases of AOL and Yahoo's internet business. Data source: YCharts. Verizon merged those two aging businesses into a new company called Oath, led by former AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Armstrong recently claimed that the new media platform would attract over 10 million creators for 2 billion customers and generate between $10 billion to $20 billion in annual revenues -- which would represent 12% of Verizon's 2016 revenue at the midpoint. Verizon plans to bundle all of these internet and media properties into its own wireless and wireline ecosystem. Like AT&T, it's using sponsored data to lock in customers with data-free streaming -- a strategy that both telcos hope will offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless customers. Analysts see Verizon's revenue and earnings both slipping 3% this year on the slowdown of its core wireless business and its increased investments in its ecosystem. However, both figures are expected to turn positive next year, and the stock remains cheaper than AT&T at 15 times earnings. BCE, formerly known as Bell Canada Enterprises, is the largest telecom company in Canada. It generates most of its revenue from internet, phone, and TV packages, but also generates additional revenue from investments in media outlets, real estate holdings, and professional sport teams. BCE pays a forward dividend yield of 4.8%, and it's hiked that dividend on an annualized basis for two straight years. It spent 83% of its earnings and 87% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months -- so its payout looks very sustainable. Unlike AT&T and Verizon, BCE is posting steady growth in wireless postpaid subscribers, which is only partly offset by its weaker prepaid growth. Its wireline business also continues growing, thanks to the strength of its internet and TV businesses. Analysts expect BCE's revenue to rise 4% this year, but its earnings are expected to slip 1% -- partly due to its recent takeover of Manitoba Telecom Services. But above all, BCE isn't copying AT&T's and Verizon's strategies of expanding their media ecosystems or divesting their wireline businesses. So if you're looking for a simpler telco with fewer moving parts, BCE -- which trades at a reasonable 18 times earnings -- might fit the bill. ","
      
    The 3 Best Dividend Stocks in Telecommunications -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Comparing American telecom players Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) to one another is like comparing the Major Leagues to Triple-A. They technically play the same sport, but they operate at entirely different scales. Thankfully, in the investing world, stocks of all shapes and sizes can make for potential buys; we're equal-opportunity investors here at the Fool. So keeping that in mind, let's look at CenturyLink and Verizon across three important categories to determine which company looks like the more appealing investment today. As a baseline, investors need to first understand the financial stability of any prospective investment before digging into its broader growth and valuation narratives. To guide this analysis, let's look at four metrics to get a sense of how Verizon and CenturyLink stack up in terms of liquidity and solvency. Company Cash & Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio CenturyLink $214 million $19.6 billion $4.2 billion 0.9 Verizon $4.3 billion $116.8 billion $16.9 billion 1.0 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The aforementioned difference in scale between the two comes into sharper contrast here. However, it should also jump out that, though they differ quite dramatically in absolute size, CenturyLink and Verizon share fairly similar capital structure and cash flow generation profiles. The two companies share virtually identical current ratios. Beyond that, CenturyLink carries just 1.1% of its total debt load in cash and investments, whereas Verizon holds 2.6% of its borrowings in liquid assets -- not much difference there. Alternatively, CenturyLink's 12-month cash flow from operations represents 21.4% of its total debt, whereas Verizon's cash flows only account for 10.1% of its $116.8 billion in debt. Granted, Verizon enjoys an investment-grade credit rating versus CenturyLink's non-investment-grade rating, so Verizon's cost of borrowing is likely lower. However, since the two share so much in common in terms of their financial footprint, it seems fairest to call this section a tie and move on. Image Source: Getty Images. Here's where the differences between the two start to really hit home. As the largest wireless provider in the U.S., Verizon's business model is largely predicated on providing wireless services to consumers and businesses -- $89 billion of its $125 billion in fiscal 2016 revenue came from wireless. Though the U.S. wireless market is no longer growing as fast as it once was, the space is generally stable. Alongside the other U.S. wireless monolith AT&T, Verizon's massive financial resources should allow it to effectively compete against continued competition from T-Mobile and Sprint. Moreover, the company is attempting to align itself with the broader trends in the wireless industry, most notably by buying its way into mobile advertising via its AOL and Yahoo acquisitions. For the record, I like AT&T's growth strategy more, but there's little reason to fret over Verizon's long-term place as a central player in this space. CenturyLink, on the other hand, finds itself in a slightly more precarious situation. In fact, $7.6 billion of the company's $17.4 billion in 2016 sales come from what CenturyLink calls its legacy services segment, which mostly consists of landline phone services for companies and consumers. As the company itself notes, this business is expected to remain in secular decline as the use of landline phones continues to dwindle. The remaining majority of CenturyLink's revenue comes from providing broadband and other data connectivity services to companies and individuals, which isn't necessarily a growth market either. The company hopes to shore up its competitive position via its pending merger with Level 3 Communications. The $34 billion deal should help expand CenturyLink's presence in the broadband service market and provide considerable cost savings. To be clear, this move is undoubtedly a smart one. However, it doesn't change the company's fundamental problem that it is largely tied to competitive markets that seem likely to decline over time. Looking to the final section of our analysis, let's start by reviewing three popular valuation metrics for Verizon and CenturyLink. Company P/E Forward P/E P/Cash Flow CenturyLink 15.6 12.2 12.3 Verizon 25.2 12.5 11.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar. Chart by author. Let's also tie in analysts' consensus growth estimates here to provide a bit more context about each company's valuation. Wall Street expects Verizon's sales to decline 2.7% this year and grow 0.5% next year. For CenturyLink, the analyst community sees its sales falling 5.4% this year and 1.8% next year. In this light, Verizon's higher current P/E starts to appear more favorable, and its forward multiples seem more enticing. Lastly, any discussion of these two telecom names would be remiss without looking at their dividends, one of the hallmarks of telecom investing. Verizon currently pays out a comparatively lower 4.9% dividend, and its dividend payout ratio stands at 76% of net income. CenturyLink pays out an 8.5% dividend with a 211% dividend yield, which seems rather aggressive. Ultimately, a safer dividend can be better than a higher yield. Verizon wins this final portion of our analysis. Apologies to the CenturyLink fans in the crowd, but Verizon is simply a higher quality business in terms of its current strategy, its size within the space, its growth outlook, and the sustainability of its dividend. To be sure, CenturyLink's Level 3 buyout should help the company improve the efficiency of its operations. However, in thinking about which company you see thriving over the long term, Verizon is the clear winner in this matchup of telecom industry powers. ","

There are some stocks you couldn't persuade me to buy if they were the last tickers on the market. They are headed toward extinction-level events and are hardly worth the electrons their digital stock certificates are printed on. For me, that list includes fading retailer Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ), near-forgotten smartphone veteran BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and regional telecom Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). Your list of blackball stocks may be different; read on to see why I'm staying away from these tickers. Image source: Getty Images. Frontier Communications has a habit of picking up the landline and FiOS operations that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) doesn't want to deal with anymore. Two large Verizon deals in 2010 and 2016 have more than quintupled Frontier's annual sales in seven years, yet they didn't help Frontier's earnings or free cash flows at all. Furthermore, the company's debt balances rose from $4.8 billion to $17.9 billion and annual interest expenses quadrupled to $1.5 billion. Lacking the large cash flows you'd expect from a mature telecom company, Frontier is cutting its dividend to help finance the debt-servicing costs. And management has not shown much concern for long-term shareholders, either -- the Verizon deals involved both new debt and a massive load of new Frontier shares going into the hands of Verizon's owners. Share prices have reacted as one might expect under this campaign of creative value destruction: FTR data by YCharts This is not a turnaround story just waiting to be told. It's a long, slow death march under the yoke of expensive and unprofitable wireline operations. I suppose the FiOS portion of Frontier's Verizon transactions could have worked out, since high-speed internet connections have worked wonders for other cable and telecom operators in recent years. But even there, Frontier is losing customers quarter by quarter and data service revenue keeps falling. I don't see a happy ending to Frontier's gloomy story. Not now, not in 10 years, not until the company completely shakes up its business model to come up with something that works. Failing that, this stock is going to zero in the long run. Once upon a time, BlackBerry was synonymous with ""smartphones."" High-quality physical keyboards made the company's devices a joy to use for secure text messaging and basic web browsing. Then Apple and the Android gang showed up with their sleek touchscreens and massive app stores. The smartphone game changed overnight, and BlackBerry never managed to find a foothold in the new market. This chart speaks volumes of BlackBerry's fading fortunes: BBRY data by YCharts BlackBerry CEO John Chen is turning the former smartphone giant into a very different business. The Canadian company is now all about secure messaging apps and data security tools. Best of luck, but BlackBerry burned a ton of credibility years ago. Any success the company finds at this point must be built from scratch, not resurrected from the glory days. This turnaround effort is a risky proposition, and it's easy enough to find better investments elsewhere. BlackBerry simply doesn't belong in my portfolio. Finally, I can't think of a single company more obviously headed to the scrap heap of history than Sears Holdings. The mall-based store chain started circling the drain long before Frontier or BlackBerry, and there's no going back: SHLD data by YCharts Kmart and Sears stores are closing their doors by the hundreds, the company is selling off real estate assets and household-name product brands to stay afloat, and billionaire CEO Eddie Lampert was forced to prop the balance sheet up with cash from his own pockets, since banks are no longer interested in doing business with Sears. I don't even have to aim my laser pointer at Sears to see it crumble. This company is falling apart on its own, and I don't want anything to do with it.

    3 Stocks I'd Hate to Buy -- The Motley Fool

Matthew Cochrane,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) is a company firing on all cylinders. In its 2017 first quarter results, all five of its business segments saw year-over-year revenue growth. Four of the five divisions-Display Technologies, Optical Communications, Specialty Materials, and Life Sciences-realized double-digit earnings increases over the previous year's results. Investors in the company have been rewarded for its performance as shares are up 47% over the past year. Yet, while the rally in Corning's shares has been fueled by a broad-based rise in the company's various business segments, it is the fast growth of two, in particular, that might have investors most excited. These divisions, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials, just scored major deals that highlight the opportunities of the industries they each compete in and the large macro trends that might drive further growth for years to come. GLW data by YCharts In the company's most recently reported quarter, its Optical Communications division saw sales of $818 million, a 34% year-over-year increase, and core earnings of $93 million, a whopping 258% year-over-year increase. This division supplies optical fiber to major telecom companies and internet service providers. With the need to upgrade their networks to meet the requirements of 5G soon, the demand for optical fiber isn't going away. Verizon agreed to purchase more than $1 billion of optical fiber from Corning over the next three years. Image source: Corning Incorporated. That's why it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Corning landed such a huge deal with Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) mere days before the company reported its first-quarter earnings. The deal committed Verizon to purchase more than $1 billion in ""optical solutions"" over the next three years which translates to about 20 million kilometers of optical fiber that Corning will supply Verizon annually for the duration of the contract. Corning's CEO Wendell Weeks said the company could sell even more fiber to companies if it had additional manufacturing capacity. As Weeks succinctly put it in the company's first quarter conference call, ""If we had more, we could sell more."" For this reason, Corning is investing in additional optical fiber capacity, which is factored into the company's four-year plan of capital expenditure spending of $6-7 billion. Because of the company's ability to expand its capacity for manufacturing optical fiber, Weeks said he expects the company to grow ""significantly faster than the optical markets we serve."" If all goes according to plan, Corning's shareholders should expect to see further success in this segment. During the conference call, Weeks sounded especially optimistic when he stated: Stepping back, all of our customers have the opportunity to benefit from our unique set of capabilities in Optical Communications. We are engaged in deep dialogue with major telecom players across the globe as they anticipate transformations in communications, education, healthcare, transportation, and ultimately, the way that we all live. Corning's Optical Communications market access platform, essential to realizing their vision, because of our ability to economically expand capacity and deliver innovative solutions. In early May, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook announced the inception of his company's one billion dollar Advanced Manufacturing Fund to spur innovation among American manufacturers. Just weeks later, Apple announced Corning would receive $200 million as the fund's first recipient. The money will go to Corning's Harrodsburg, KY facility where it manufactures Gorilla Glass. Corning scientists produce Gorilla Glass, the glass that is used for iPhones and iPads. Image source: Corning Incorporated. Gorilla Glass is Corning's proprietary state-of-the-art glass that covers most of the world's smartphones and tablets, including every iPhone and iPad ever made. In the first quarter, the business segment saw sales of $300 million and core earnings of $48 million, respective 32% and 50% year-over-year increases. Gorilla Glass 5, the latest and greatest iteration of the specialty glass, has seen a more rapid adoption than previous generations of Gorilla Glass which has translated into gains in price premiums and market share for Corning. With more and more major smartphone manufacturers using glass on the front and backs of their products, it's little surprise that Apple would take such an interest in the glass manufacturing process just before a major product release of its own. Neither optical fiber, which is the backbone of the world's connectivity, or Gorilla Glass, the medium we touch to connect to the rest of the world, are going away anytime soon. The recent deal with Verizon and investment by Apple highlight the many opportunities ahead for Corning in these two growth segments. ","

IBM (NYSE:IBM) has disappointed plenty of investors, including Warren Buffett, with 20 straight quarters of annual revenue declines and a 20% haircut in its market value over the past five years. But as I discussed in previous articles, Big Blue's low valuation and high dividend should limit the stock's downside potential. IBM pays a forward yield of 3.9%, which is almost double the S&P 500's average yield of 2%. That dividend is supported by a low payout ratio of 46%, which gives it plenty of room to continue its 22 straight years of annual dividend hikes. Source: Getty. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, pays a slightly higher forward yield of 4%. That dividend is supported by a payout ratio of 71%, and Qualcomm has raised its dividend annually for 13 straight years. Source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm initially seems to have worse growth prospects than IBM, with analysts expecting its revenue and earnings to respectively fall 3% and 4% this year. Those declines are attributed to its loss of market share in mobile chipsets to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from bigger smartphone makers, and an OEM revolt against its high-margin wireless licensing fees. It's also dealing with a series of antitrust probes and lawsuits -- which claim that it leveraged its wireless patent portfolio to push competitors out of the market and secure exclusive deals. But looking ahead, Qualcomm is also expected to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors in the near future, which would diversify its business away from the troubled mobile market, grow its addressable markets by 40% by 2020, and make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world. The deal is also expected to be ""significantly accretive"" to its non-GAAP earnings once it closes. I believe that's a better turnaround strategy than waiting around for IBM's ""strategic imperatives"" growth to finally pay off. Investors who think Qualcomm looks too risky should consider buying telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T), which pays a forward yield of 5.1% and has hiked its dividend annually for over three decades -- making it a ""dividend aristocrat,"" a company that has hiked its payout for over 25 straight years. That dividend is supported by a payout ratio of 95%. AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. after Verizon, and it's also the biggest pay TV provider in the country, thanks to its acquisition of DirecTV in 2015. It will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world after its proposed acquisition of Time Warner clears regulatory hurdles. AT&T's flagship store in San Francisco. Source: AT&T. Analysts expect AT&T's revenue to fall 2% this year, and for its earnings to rise 2%. However, those estimates don't include the Time Warner deal, which could become accretive to AT&T's earnings and free cash flow within the first year, and generate $1 billion in annual run rate cost synergies within the first three years. In addition to offering higher yields and more exciting long-term growth prospects than IBM, Qualcomm and AT&T are also fundamentally cheap. Qualcomm trades at 19 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 25 for semiconductor companies. AT&T trades at 19 times earnings, versus the industry average of 22 for telecom companies. So before you buy IBM for its dividend, take a closer look at Qualcomm and AT&T to see if they better suit your income investing needs. I personally own both stocks as long-term income plays, and I'm not losing any sleep over either one. ","
      
    2 Stocks With Better Dividends than IBM -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. That's an old saying, but it's one that most people keep in mind when they evaluate the latest offer from a cable company, internet service provider (ISP), or a wireless carrier. Even a company like T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS), which built its rep on giving customers what they want, got greeted with skepticism earlier this year when it announced plans to drop all taxes and fees. In that case, the deal turned out to be exactly what was promised. That's not really true, however, when you look at Sprint's (NYSE:S) offer to cut your phone bill in half made to Verizon and AT&T customers. That promotion, while a good deal, only applied to the service portion of the bill, meaning people who accept the offer won't actually see their wireless bill cut in half. The same logic applies to many cable and ISP promotions where a short-term low price deal comes with a contract for future years that are more expensive. Pay television companies are notorious for offering prices that don't reflect the mandatory fees and surcharges customers have to pay. Because of that, news that Virgin Mobile (which is operated in the United States by Sprint) would be offering a year of unlimited talk, text, and data to customers who sign up by July 31 for $1 certainly caused consumers to raise an eyebrow. It seems like a phenomenal deal, but is it too good to be true? The Virgin Mobile deal requires buying an iPhone. Image source: Apple. The company is giving away a year of unlimited service (with high-speed data capped at 23GB a month) for $1, plus applicable taxes. That deal is not made up, it's not a bait-and-switch offer, but it's also not the whole story. To get a year of unlimited talk, text, and data for $1, the customer must purchase an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone and transfer his or her number to Virgin's Inner Circle plan, which costs $50 a month once the promotion ends. Virgin sells all currently offered iPhone models, including offering the entry-level iPhone SE for $279.99 for the 32GB version, which Apple sells for $399. The only thing approaching a catch here is one that's easy to avoid. To get the deal you need to buy an iPhone. If you buy one from Virgin, it will be locked, which locks you into its service after the promotion expires. To get around that, all you have to do is buy the phone directly from Apple. In that case, it will be unlocked, and you will be free to move to another provider at the end of the $1 promotion (or at any time, because Virgin does not lock people in with contracts). Aside from that, the only catch is that you have to pay taxes, which vary by market, but Virgin has not hidden that fact. This is actually a good deal that sets a new bar in the wireless industry. It's a bold move by Sprint, which is banking on the idea that after a year customers won't leave. That may not be true, but that's something shareholders, not consumers, should worry about.

    Top-Performing Tech Stocks of 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Selena Maranjian,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Here's the bad news: The average monthly Social Security retirement benefit was recently $1,365 per month, or about $16,000 per year, with the maximum benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age recently at $2,687 per month -- or about $32,000 annually. Clearly, Social Security isn't going to give any of us a luxurious retirement. There's good news, though: There are many ways you can generate retirement income. It's smart to spend a little time figuring out how much money you'll need in retirement, and then planning how you can produce your needed cash flow. Here are a dozen strategies to consider. Image source: Getty Images. This one won't win a popularity contest, but it can be very effective. If you can work two or three more years than you originally planned to, your nest egg can grow while you put off starting to tap it. You might enjoy your employer-sponsored health insurance for a few more years, too, perhaps also while collecting a few more years' worth of matching funds in your 401(k). Here's what a difference this can make in your investing: Imagine that you sock away $10,000 per year for 20 years and it grows by an annual average of 8%, growing to about $494,000. If you can keep going for another three years, still averaging 8%, you'll end up with more than $657,000! That's more than $160,000 extra just for delaying retiring for a few years. Next, consider easing into full retirement instead of jumping in feet first. If you're willing and able to work a little in your first few years of retirement, you can generate some helpful income. Working just 12 hours per week at $10 per hour will generate about $500 per month. Better still, a part-time job can also give your days more structure and regular opportunities for socializing. Many retirees find themselves restless and a bit lonely in retirement, and a low-stress job on the side can be quite helpful. Here are some ideas of ways you might work in retirement: You could be a cashier at a local retailer or deliver newspapers. You might do some freelance writing or editing or graphic design work. You might tutor kids in subjects you know well, or perhaps give adults or kids music or language lessons. You might do some consulting -- perhaps even for your former employer. You could babysit, walk dogs, or take on some handy-person jobs. These days the Internet offers even more options. You might make jewelry, soaps, or sweaters, and sell them online. You might even just work part-time for your current employer. Image source: Getty Images. Think twice before entering retirement with a lot of credit card debt or other high-interest debt. When you're living on a reduced income, it will be extra hard to pay that off, and those payments can hurt your ability to make other necessary payments. It's a good idea to enter retirement mortgage-free, too, if you can, so that you don't have to make any mortgage payments and will only have to deal with insurance, taxes, and maintenance. This great retirement income strategy is only great at certain times -- when interest rates are meaningful. Right now if you park $100,000 in certificates of deposit paying 1.5% in interest, you'll collect $1,500 per year, hardly a helpful sum. Back in 1984, though, rates for five-year, one-year, and six-month CDs were in the double digits. If you could get 10% on a $100,000 investment, you'd enjoy $10,000 per year, equivalent to about $830 per month. Low interest rates not only deliver little income, but they also don't keep up with inflation. Bonds are another interest-paying option, but the safest ones (from the U.S. government) tend to pay modest interest rates, especially in low-interest-rate environments. Still, if you have a lot of money, you might make this strategy work by buying a variety of bonds that will mature at different times, generating income over many years. The more you contribute to tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, the more money you'll have in retirement. There are two main kinds of IRA -- the Roth IRA and the traditional IRA -- and for both in 2017, the contribution limit is $5,500 for most people and $6,500 for those 50 and older. (Limits are occasionally increased, to keep up with inflation.) That might not seem like a lot of money, but it's quite powerful if it can grow for many years. The following table shows how much money you can accumulate with annual $5,500 contributions at different average annual rates of growth: $5,500 Invested Annually For: Growing at 6% Growing at 8% Growing at 10% 15 years $135,699 $161,284 $199,224 20 years $214460 $271,826 $346,514 25 years $319,860 $434,249 $595,000 30 years $460,909 $672,902 $995,189 Data source: Calculations by author. A 401(k) has much more generous contribution limits -- for 2017 it's $18,000 for most people and $24,000 for those 50 or older. Give particular consideration to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s, which are increasingly available, as they let you withdraw money in retirement tax-free! While some annuities, such as variable annuities and indexed annuities, can be quite problematic, often charging steep fees and sporting restrictive terms, fixed annuities are well worth considering. They're much simpler instruments, and they can start paying you immediately or on a deferred basis. Following are examples of the kind of income that various people might be able to secure in the form of an immediate fixed annuity in the current economic environment. (You'll generally be offered higher payments in times of higher prevailing interest rates.) Person/People Cost Monthly Income Annual Income Equivalent 65-year-old man $100,000 $545 $6,540 70-year-old man $100,000 $623 $7,476 70-year-old woman $100,000 $586 $7,032 65-year-old couple $200,000 $937 $11,244 70-year-old couple $200,000 $1,029 $12,348 75-year-old couple $200,000 $1,178 $14,136 Data source: immediateannuities.com. Annuities can provide much peace of mind, removing stock market moves and the economy's current condition from your worries. A deferred annuity can also be smart, starting to pay you at a future point, such as when you turn a certain age. A 60-year-old man, for example, might spend $100,000 for an annuity that will start paying him $962 per month for the rest of his life beginning at age 70. That can remove any worries about running out of money late in life. You can generate income in retirement by selling off shares of stock from your stock portfolio over time -- but with dividend-paying stocks, you can collect income without having to sell any shares! A $300,000 portfolio, for example, that sports an overall average yield of 4% will generate about $12,000 per year -- a solid $1,000 per month. Dividend income isn't guaranteed, but if you spread your money across a bunch of healthy and growing companies, you'll probably receive regular -- and growing -- payments. Here are a few well-regarded stocks with significant dividend yields: Stock Recent Dividend Yield Ford Motor Company 5.4% Verizon Communications 5% Chevron 4.1% Pfizer 3.8% Cisco Systems 3.6% Data source: Yahoo! Financial. A dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) can be a fine option, too, offering instant diversification. The iShares Select Dividend ETF, for example, recently yielded about 3%. Preferred stock is another way to go. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF recently yielded 5.6%. Image source: Getty Images. Next, you might consider a reverse mortgage. It's essentially a loan secured by your home. A lender will provide (often tax-free) income during your retirement, and the loan doesn't have to be paid back until you no longer live in your home -- perhaps because you moved into a nursing home or died. It has some drawbacks, though, such as requiring your heirs to sell your home unless they can afford to pay off the loan, but if you're really pinched for funds and no one is counting on inheriting your home, it can be a solid solution. Another home-related retirement-income option is relocating. If you downsize and move to a smaller home -- or you move to a region with lower taxes or a lower cost of living -- you can end up spending less on taxes, insurance, home maintenance, utilities, landscaping, and so on. The median home value in California, for example, was recently about $386,000, but it was only $248,000 in Colorado and only $140,000 in South Carolina. Borrowing against your life insurance is another option. If you have a life insurance policy that no one is depending on -- such as if the children you meant to protect with it are now grown and independent -- you might consider borrowing against it. This can work if you've bought ""permanent"" insurance such as whole life or universal life, and not term life insurance, that generally only lasts as long as you're paying for it. You'll be reducing or wiping out the value of the policy with your withdrawal(s), but if no one really needs the ultimate payout, it can make sense. Plus, the income is typically tax-free. Image source: Getty Images. A little creative thinking can pay off well when it comes to retirement income, too. You may be able to come up with some ways to spend less and/or bring in more money. For example, you could spend less by quitting cable TV and just streaming your video entertainment -- that might save $50 you per month or $600 per year. If you're not using the gym much but are paying $40 monthly for it, that's another $500 or so in potential annual savings. Believe it or not, you might save hundreds of dollars just by spending an hour on the phone calling insurance companies to get the best current deal on your home insurance and car insurance. Eating out less and having friends over to play games or watch movies can save on dining and entertainment expenses. If you smoke, you can probably save thousands of dollars per year by quitting -- and you might lengthen your life, too! To bring more moola in, you might rent out a room now and then via Airbnb, or even take in a boarder for a year or two. If you're not already using cash-back or rewards credit cards, look into them. If you charge about $1,200 per month on credit cards and earn 2% back, on average, you're looking at close to $300 in cash back per year. Clear out your basement, attic, and/or garage by selling things online or via a yard sale and you might net hundreds of dollars. Or take an easier route and donate clothes and household items to charity, reaping tax deductions. You could make things to sell online, too, such as soaps, furniture, or jewelry. Reducing your household's automotive fleet by one vehicle can save a lot in insurance and upkeep, too. Finally, learn more about Social Security strategies. Just as there are many ways to boost your retirement income, there are a bunch of ways to boost your Social Security income, as well. You can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you can make some smart moves by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. If you and your spouse have very different earnings records, for example, you might start collecting the benefits of the spouse with the lower lifetime earnings record on time or early, while delaying starting to collect the benefits of the higher-earning spouse. That way, you both get to enjoy some income earlier, and when the higher earner hits 70, you can collect their extra-large checks. Also, should that higher-earning spouse die first, the spouse with the smaller earnings history can collect those bigger benefit checks. ","
      
    12 Ways You Can Get More Money in Retirement  -- The Motley Fool

Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","

24/7 Wall St.,06292017,MarketWatch,06222017,"Published: June 27, 2017 7:15 a.m. ET By Investors love dividends. Whether the market is up or down, many investors need those dividends to help pay income in retirement. Dividends also account for up to half of all shareholder returns through time. While high dividends are desirable for investors, savvy investors know that not all dividends are created equal. 24/7 Wall St. has conducted a review of the top dividends from America’s largest companies. Almost all the companies should be recognizable to most Americans. It turns out that there were 25 large companies paying a yield of 3.5% or more — and some much higher. The reason that the 3.5% dividend yield matters so much to equity investors is that this is 1% higher than the average yields of the S&amp;P and Dow. This was also more than 100 basis points higher than the average yield of the 10-year to 30-year Treasury. The volatile dividends for real estate investment trusts (REITs) were excluded, while the safer dividends from utilities and other sectors were included. Much of the retail segment’s high dividend yields may have a similar set of caveats, and they may feel driven by lower and lower share prices. As of the last week of June 2017, the average S&amp;P 500 Index yield was 2.37% and the average yield of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks was 2.43%. The huge difference between the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 is that all Dow stocks currently pay dividends — while there were close to 80 non–dividend payers in the S&amp;P 500, and the index includes the higher-yielding REITs. The yield of the 10-year Treasury note was last seen at just 2.13% and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was just 2.70%. The difference between the Treasury yields and equity yields is that the former are locked. Many of these major dividend paying companies should grow their revenue and earnings in the years ahead, and investors assume dividend and earnings growth in future years also will translate to higher share prices. 24/7 Wall St. used data from Thomson Reuters on financials and on target prices, and some extra color and commentary on what has driven these high yields also has been provided. The consensus analyst share price targets from Thomson Reuters have been used to show whether Wall Street thinks each company’s stock has room to appreciate or if they think there is already a fair value. Here are 25 great American companies paying dividends that 3.5% yield or greater. Macy's &gt; Yield: 6.78% &gt; Price: $22.46 &gt; Mean price target: $25.79 &gt; 52-week range: $21.51 to $45.41 &gt; Market cap: $6.8 billion Macy’s Inc. (NYSE: M) has the highest dividend yield of major retailers at this time. Its stock also has been brutalized by the growth of Amazon, and Macy’s has been unable to turn its own omni-channel up enough to offset in-store sale erosion. Its yield was already high a year ago, but the big dividend yield growth for new investors has been due to the pain of a falling stock price for existing shareholders. Macy’s is also pursuing more store closures to focus on the most profitable locations. At the start of 2017, Macy’s had almost 150,000 employees and operated about 830 stores under the Macys, Bloomingdales, Bloomingdales The Outlet, Macys Backstage and Bluemercury banners. Kohl's &gt; Yield: 5.94% &gt; Price: $37.38 &gt; Mean price target: $40.52 &gt; 52-week range: $35.16 to $59.67 &gt; Market cap: $6.4 billion Kohl’s Corp. (NYSE: KSS) has faced many of the same issues as Macy’s, including the rise of Amazon and e-commerce. As of January 28, 2017, Kohl’s operated 1,154 department stores, 12 FILA outlets and another three Off-Aisle clearance centers. Seagate Technology &gt; Yield: 5.91% &gt; Price: $42.39 &gt; Mean price target: $46.23 &gt; 52-week range: $20.77 to $50.96 &gt; Market cap: $12.6 billion Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ: STX) is best known for its storage devices, and it is currently one of the dividend kings of the technology sector. It operates globally and dominates in storage devices, with a focus on hard drives, solid state drives and portable drives. Ford &gt; Yield: 5.43% &gt; Price: $11.10 &gt; Mean price target: $12.80 &gt; 52-week range: $10.67 to $14.04 &gt; Market cap: $44.2 billion Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) has a better dividend than a stock performance of late. It has struggled to find direction in the post-Mulally years and is soon to have a new chief executive. At the same time, Ford has been experiencing a peak-auto trend in the United States as it seems hard to imagine the 2016 sales cycle being as robust in the year and years ahead. Staples &gt; Yield: 5.17% &gt; Price: $9.19 &gt; Mean price target: $9.80 &gt; 52-week range: $7.24 to $10.25 &gt; Market cap: $6.0 billion Staples Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLS) is the king of all independent retailers of office supplies. That being said, it is under a relatively new leadership now that its acquisition of rival Office Depot failed to get approved. Staples has been a rumored buyout candidate of its own, but it also faces the Amazon and small e-commerce impact that has been a challenge to much of the retail landscape. AT&amp;T &gt; Yield: 5.16% &gt; Price: $38.13 &gt; Mean price target: $39.68 &gt; 52-week range: $36.10 to $43.89 &gt; Market cap: $234.4 billion AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE: T) is still the king of major telecom dividends, but its lead over Verizon has come in. AT&amp;T has already diversified with its acquisition of DirecTV, and it is further trying to diversify with the pending acquisition of Time Warner to further spread into cable, telecom and content. AT&amp;T’s revenue was almost $164 billion in 2016. Verizon &gt; Yield: 5.09% &gt; Price: $45.81 &gt; Mean price target: $50.05 &gt; 52-week range: $44.46 to $56.95 &gt; Market cap: $186.9 billion Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) has the highest yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company has so far been less of an acquirer than rival AT&amp;T, but it has now acquired AOL and Yahoo and plans to grow its video and ad platforms. Its revenue was $126 billion in 2016. Occidental Petroleum &gt; Yield: 5.06% &gt; Price: $60.24 &gt; Mean price target: $71.44 &gt; 52-week range: $57.20 to $78.48 &gt; Market cap: $46.1 billion Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) is not the largest of the oil companies in raw market value, but it is the largest oil and gas dividend of the integrated players. Some of that dividend boost is because its shares are way down from the highs, and a weak oil market might be a continued risk to Occidental and all oil and gas players. Occidental’s 2016 revenue of $10 billion was almost half of the revenues just two years earlier. FirstEnergy &gt; Yield: 4.98% &gt; Price: $30.04 &gt; Mean price target: $33.53 &gt; 52-week range: $27.93 to $36.60 &gt; Market cap: $13.3 billion FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) is an electricity utility and generator via coal-fired, nuclear, hydroelectric, oil and natural gas, wind and solar power generating facilities. The company serves approximately 6 million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Target &gt; Yield: 4.89% &gt; Price: $51.45 &gt; Mean price target: $58.12 &gt; 52-week range: $48.56 to $79.33 &gt; Market cap: $28.4 billion Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) is in the middle of a tight retail market, wedged somewhere between the cross-hairs of Walmart and Amazon. The drop in Target’s shares has been far worse than rival Walmart, and that has helped to drive up the dividend. Despite having revenue of $69.5 billion in 2016, that is down from almost $74 billion the prior year. Southern Company &gt; Yield: 4.65% &gt; Price: $50.17 &gt; Mean price target: $51.16 &gt; 52-week range: $46.20 to $54.64 &gt; Market cap: $49.9 billion Southern Co. (NYSE: SO) is another electric utility and has power generation assets, sells wholesale electricity and distributes natural gas. Southern is based in Atlanta and claims roughly 9 million customers spread over electric and natural gas. Its 11 regulated utility markets are in Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and several more states. General Motors &gt; Yield: 4.44% &gt; Price: $34.29 &gt; Mean price target: $39.50 &gt; 52-week range: $27.34 to $38.55 &gt; Market cap: $51.8 billion General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) might be its own company again since its notorious bankruptcy and re-emergence as a public company. The stock also has been pretty much a nothing-burger since that IPO, and just like rival Ford, GM faces tough comparisons for a peak U.S. auto trend. Still, GM has been unwinding some money-losing and less profitable efforts in Europe. Entergy &gt; Yield: 4.41% &gt; Price: $79.60 &gt; Mean price target: $78.69 &gt; 52-week range: $66.71 to $82.09 &gt; Market cap: $14.3 billion Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) is an electric utility based in New Orleans. It serves portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans. It distributes natural gas and delivers electricity to 2.9 million utility customers. Overall Entergy is one of the big players among utilities in the deep south. Although it operates through several different subsidiaries, it has over 14,000 employees. The stock has made steady gains over the past few years, and it is actually closing in on an all-time high — with a dividend like this, that says something. Valero Energy &gt; Yield: 4.24% &gt; Price: $66.28 &gt; Mean price target: $73.89 &gt; 52-week range: $46.88 to $71.40 &gt; Market cap: $29.6 billion Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO) is a top petroleum refiner and ethanol producer in the country, and its stock can be volatile around the swings in oil pricing and also around how the refining sector’s margins grow and contract. Its revenue of more than $75 billion in 2016 is down handily from prior years, but much of that is price-driven by commodity prices rather than its raw profitability. Unlike traditional oil companies, refining companies do not thrive as well under high oil prices as the margins are tougher. As of December 31, 2016, the company owned 15 petroleum refineries with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.1 million barrels per day, and it owned and operated 11 ethanol plants with a combined capacity of approximately 1.4 billion gallons per year. Gap &gt; Yield: 4.19% &gt; Price: $22.27 &gt; Mean price target: $25.53 &gt; 52-week range: $19.33 to $30.74 &gt; Market cap: $8.8 billion Gap Inc. (GPS) has become a post-growth retailer after prior decades of expansion, and it is facing many of the same Amazon-related and e-commerce pressure of other retailers. The company has consolidated many stores under the namesake Gap brand, and it has Old Navy and Banana Republic brands. Gap also owns Athleta and Intermix. As of March 14, 2017, the company operated 3,200 company-operated stores and 450 franchise stores. Gap’s revenue of $15.5 billion in 2016 was the third straight year of decline and its pretax net income of $1.12 billion in 2016 was down from over $2 billion in 2014 and 2013. Williams Companies &gt; Yield: 4.17% &gt; Price: $28.81 &gt; Mean price target: $33.37 &gt; 52-week range: $19.60 to $32.69 &gt; Market cap: $23.8 billion Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE: WMB) is an energy infrastructure company that operates oil and gas pipelines. Its primary natural gas pipeline system extends from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the offshore Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the New York City metropolitan area. Other pipelines cover parts of the central and western states. The Tulsa-based company dates back to 1908. Chevron &gt; Yield: 4.11% &gt; Price: $104.42 &gt; Mean price target: $122.48 &gt; 52-week range: $97.53 to $119.00 &gt; Market cap: $197.8 billion Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) may not be the size in market cap of rival Exxon Mobil, but it outyields its larger rival. Chevron has seen its ups and downs with the price of oil, but it has pledged to not disrupt its dividend unless it simply faces no other serious alternatives. Revenues of $110 billion in 2016 were down from $200 billion just two years earlier. PPL &gt; Yield: 4.07% &gt; Price: $39.34 &gt; Mean price target: $38.96 &gt; 52-week range: $32.08 to $40.20 &gt; Market cap: $26.9 billion PPL Corp. (NYSE: PPL) is an electric utility based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and its three operating units are U.K. Regulated, Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated. The company dates back to 1920, and it claims to have more than 10 million utility customers in the United States and United Kingdom. Qualcomm &gt; Yield: 4.01% &gt; Price: $56.51 &gt; Mean price target: $61.55 &gt; 52-week range: $50.84 to $71.62 &gt; Market cap: $83.5 billion Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) has been the king of processors in the mobile phone and tablet arena. Its growth recently ran into some headwinds as customers such as Apple have chosen to in-house or go to cheaper rivals, and the company also has had royalty disputes. Now Qualcomm is hoping to bolster its growth and diversify its revenues away from just expensive microprocessors with the acquisition of a much more diversified NXP Semiconductors in a deal valued at close to $40 billion. Duke Energy &gt; Yield: 3.98% &gt; Price: $86.80 &gt; Mean price target: $84.75 &gt; 52-week range: $72.34 to $87.75 &gt; Market cap: $60.8 billion Duke Energy Corp. (NYSE: DUK) is easily one of the largest utility providers with a portfolio that covers the east coast through the Midwest. This company is more or less the gold standard when it comes to utility stocks, and many of the stocks within the industry take their bearings from it. Although utilities are known for trading on their dividends, Duke has made a noteworthy run so far this year. IBM &gt; Yield: 3.89% &gt; Price: $155.16 &gt; Mean price target: $165.07 &gt; 52-week range: $142.50 to $182.79 &gt; Market cap: $145.8 billion International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) has been a large buyback and dividend payer for years, but the company had to abandon part of its artificial earnings per share growth efforts. IBM has been growing in its emerging opportunities in cloud, Watson and other efforts, but its legacy IT-consulting operations have been bleeding off faster than IBM can grow its emerging tech businesses. The company still has around 380,000 employees. A slew of earnings disappointments has been a thorn in its side, and IBM may need new leadership quite soon if it cannot get that turnaround underway. Its revenue was almost $80 billion in 2016 and was down each year consecutively since at least 2012. Exxon Mobil &gt; Yield: 3.77% &gt; Price: $81.33 &gt; Mean price target: $87.13 &gt; 52-week range: $79.26 to $95.55 &gt; Market cap: $344.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) shares have suffered with the fate of oil prices, and its massive $31 billion acquisition of XTO Energy for natural gas was done at a time that the economics of today’s energy prices haven’t been so great. Exxon’s 2016 revenues of over $218 billion were down from $394 billion in 2014 and were half of the $451 billion in 2012. At least Exxon gets to claim that its former CEO became Secretary of State. Pfizer &gt; Yield: 3.75% &gt; Price: $34.07 &gt; Mean price target: $37.35 &gt; 52-week range: $29.83 to $37.93 &gt; Market cap: $203.3 billion Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) has struggled to find growth for years. Its drugs have faced the same patent cliff of much of Big Pharma rivals. Still, its dividend is deemed safe by investors, and 2016 revenues of $52.8 billion bumped up from the average of the prior three years. Cisco Systems &gt; Yield: 3.61% &gt; Price: $32.31 &gt; Mean price target: $35.43 &gt; 52-week range: $27.13 to $34.60 &gt; Market cap: $161.5 billion Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) has been one of the top technology companies in networking. It has made hundreds of small bolt-on acquisitions around future technology, and Cisco hopes that security integration can help bolster its sales ahead. Long-time CEO John Chambers has turned the helm over to Chuck Robbins, and Cisco has been in the midst of two large restructurings in the past five years in an effort to ""right-size"" its headcount and unit structure. Cisco’s revenue was $37 billion in 2016, and it has been stable but choppy over the past five years, but without any real growth. Cisco shares also remain well down from the tech bubble days back in 1999 to 2000. Exelon &gt; Yield: 3.59% &gt; Price: $37.34 &gt; Mean price target: $39.47 &gt; 52-week range: $29.82 to $37.70 &gt; Market cap: $34.6 billion Exelon Corp. (NYSE: EXC) is a Chicago-based utility targeting electric and natural gas customers. Its operations in electricity are in parts of Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. Its natural gas markets are in the same and adjacent markets, and it also provides manpower services for the utility industry in America. Exelon claims to have one of the cleanest and lowest-cost power generation fleets going, and it also represents some 10 million customers.
