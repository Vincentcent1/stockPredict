The sale represents Verizon’s efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. Verizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. Reuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. The company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. For Equinix, the world’s biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. “We’ve been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,” Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts. The acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix’s total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. Citi and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. Shares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two of Asia’s biggest technology companies said they were looking to expand investment in the United States, as President-elect Donald Trump pushes to bring manufacturing and jobs back home. Son said on Tuesday, after meeting Trump, his investment would create 50,000 new jobs, a move the U.S. President-elect claimed was a direct result of his election win. The lack of details on the investment timetable also prompted doubts on whether the promise of money and jobs will be met, as Sprint is slashing staff numbers to cut more than $2 billion in costs this fiscal year. Trump’s moves since the election to engage with individual companies, while turning his back on broader, years-in-the-works trade deals, show that he is leaning on the deal-making skills he honed in the boardroom. Trump campaigned against the over-regulation of business and is expected to be more open to mergers than President Barack Obama. The $50 billion investment, announced jointly by Trump and Son in the lobby of the Trump Tower in Manhattan, would come from the $100 billion tech investment fund the head of SoftBank is setting up with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa from SoftBank of Japan, and he’s just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs,” Trump said. “He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!” Trump later Tweeted. Son, who wore a red tie and red sweater under his suit jacket, told reporters his company, a $68 billion telecommunications and tech investment behemoth, would create the jobs by investing in startup companies. He also said he expected a lot of “deregulation” under a Trump administration. Trump and Son did not give a timeline for the investment. Trump’s four-year term will begin after his Jan. 20 inauguration. The page also showed an additional $7 billion investment and creation of a further 50,000 jobs. (cnb.cx/2he38VQ) “While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials,” the Foxconn statement said. Son and Foxconn founder Terry Gou are considered close and have several business ventures together, including launching humanoid Pepper - which is manufactured by Foxconn - into several markets, and investing jointly in India. Foxconn has manufacturing facilities in the U.S. states of Virginia and Indiana, according to its website (here). Its 2015 annual report also listed logistics services in California and Texas. In October, prior to the election, SoftBank said Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) would be the lead partner in the $100 billion tech fund and could invest up to $45 billion over the next five years. SoftBank expects to put in at least $25 billion. Shares in SoftBank jumped 6.2 percent on Wednesday in Tokyo to their highest since August last year. “Now the market sees SoftBank as a Trump-related stock and that’s because it reacted favorably to their meeting,” said Fumio Matsumoto, a fund manager at Dalton Capital in Japan. Shares of Sprint briefly reached their highest level in 2-1/2 years, soon after Son’s comments. They closed up 1.5 percent, while shares of T-Mobile US rose 1.8 percent. It was not immediately clear how much of SoftBank’s investment had been disclosed before. SoftBank said on Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. election, it planned to make future large-scale investments via the $100 billion fund, rather than on its own, to avoid growing already-bloated debt. Whether or not Trump’s election led to SoftBank’s planned investment, the billionaire’s victory has been a boon to stock investors. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at another record level on Tuesday, its 11th new high since the Nov. 8 vote. Should the SoftBank fund grow as large as $100 billion, it would be one of the world’s largest private equity investors and a potential kingpin in the technology sector. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Back in 2011, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) seemed like a fading player in the wireless subscription business. The duopoly of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) owned 65% of the market, while T-Mobile came in a distant fourth place, with just 11% of the market. Times, however, have changed. Revitalized by CEO John Legere's ""Uncarrier"" plan that has expanded to include a wide number of initiatives, the company has grown to capture almost 17% of the market. While Verizon remains the top dog, with 35% of wireless subscriptions nationwide, such a drastic improvement leads to a simple question: Is T-Mobile's stock a better buy at today's prices? There's no definitive way to answer that, but there are three different lenses through which we can answer the question. Cash in the bank is awfully boring. But it's incredibly important. That's because every business -- at some point in time -- will run into rough patches. Whether they be company-specific or macro in nature, those with lots of cash on hand will be rewarded with optionality. Those with lots of debt, on the other hand, won't be so lucky. They will have to narrow their focus to just making ends meet to stay out of bankruptcy. The telecom industry requires heavy debt levels to maintain the enormous infrastructure required to meet our data demands, but we can still investigate where breathing room may exist. Here's how Verizon and T-Mobile stack up in terms of financial fortitude. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $7.6 billion $103 billion $14 billion $11.5 billion T-Mobile $6.2 billion $21.8 billion $1.4 billion $1.5 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes long and short-term investments. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. It's important to point out that Verizon is valued at roughly four-and-a-half times the size of T-Mobile. Given that, I can't help but give the nod here to T-Mobile. In terms of a cash-to-debt position, T-Mobile clearly has the upper hand -- with a somewhat comparable level of cash but only one-fifth the debt level. Of course, much of the debt that Verizon has is because the company bought out the stake that Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD) had in Verizon Wireless -- a critically important piece of Verizon's overall empire. But we'll get to the benefits that this bestows on shareholders in the next section. Often referred to as a ""moat"" in investing circles, a company's sustainable competitive advantages are perhaps the most important metric for any investor to consider. Evaluating a moat is part art, part science. In essence, the moat is the special sauce that makes a company what it is -- and differentiates it from all of the other players in the industry. Both T-Mobile and Verizon are beneficiaries of high barriers to entrance. In short, we don't see a lot of start-ups popping up to vie for your mobile subscription dollars. That's because it's prohibitively expensive to build out data networks. Verizon's moat is provided by the company's top spot within the industry. With 35% of all wireless subscriptions, and a fairly low churn rate, the company is able to rake in tons of free cash flow every month. It has also expanded beyond wireless service to become an Internet provider (FiOS), and it owns AOL's properties -- and will soon own Yahoo!'s operating business. It's yet to be seen exactly how these acquisitions will play out. T-Mobile, on the other hand, has the advantage of being a first-mover in the no-contract plans among the country's biggest players. Legere, in effect, is doubling down on convenience and customer service, saying, ""We're so much better than the others, we'll give our customers the choice to leave, and they still won't."" Of course, Legere has come up with other ways to keep customers around -- equipment installment plans or promotions tied to monthly bill credits -- but the bottom line is that the strategy has served as an important differentiator. The strategy has paid off thus far, but it's worth stating that Verizon and AT&T have already started offering much the same deal, and it may erode T-Mobile's advantage over time. In addition, we are already seeing Verizon move beyond simply being a wireless carrier and into a fully fledged media and content company -- via the aforementioned Yahoo and AOL tie-ups. That's something that T-Mobile simply can't compete with at this point -- from a cash, cash flow, or acquisition standpoint. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF P/S PEG Ratio Verizon 13 18 1.6 4.2 T-Mobile 35 29 1.3 0.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, Morningstar. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Normally, that would make me give the nod to T-Mobile. However, there's one extra variable to consider: the dividend. Verizon has a healthy and sustainable 4.5% yield, while T-Mobile has none to speak of. Given that, I'm siding with Verizon, here. So, there you have it. If I had to boil this down to one sentence, it would be this: T-Mobile has better growth prospects, but Verizon is the safer bet and offers a dividend. Truth be told, both are probably worthy of your consideration, but for those seeking income via dividends, Verizon is the obvious choice. ","

Image source: Getty Images. For those looking to pad their retirement accounts with solid dividend payers, the sight of Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) dividend seems too good to be true. A 4.5% yield from an industry leader trading for a 50% discount to the broader market? Yes, please! But as you'll see below, it's worth digging in to see if all that glitters really is gold before putting your hard-earned cash behind the company. For dividend investors, the most important thing to continually evaluate is a company's free cash flow (FCF) statement. This represents the amount of cash an organization can put in its pocket by running its business, minus any capital expenditures. At the end of the day, it is from FCF that healthy companies pay their dividends -- and as the FCF trends change, so too do a company's dividend policies. This is where I ran into something somewhat concerning. Over the past 12 months, Verizon has brought in $11.5 billion in FCF. There's nothing wrong with that. But in order to pay its dividend, the company used 80% of FCF. While that's technically sustainable, it raises two red flags: (1) If the company meets tough times, maintaining the dividend may be difficult, and (2) even if it doesn't encounter difficulties, Verizon may not be able to grow its dividend substantially moving forward. But by digging deeper, we can see this might be a bit more of an anomaly than a trend. In June of this year, Verizon ratified its collective bargaining agreement with employees. Because of that, Verizon ""recorded ... charges of approximately $3.6 billion."" That's a huge one-time charge, and it showed up in the company's bottom line and on the FCF statement. While it's definitely important to note such a big charge, it's also worth asking if this is something that long-term investors should really be worried about. To get a better idea of the trends at Verizon, I suggest investors back up and look at the company's history of FCF and dividend payments over the past decade. When we do that, here's what we see: Data source: SEC filings. Viewed through this lens, there are a couple of things that stand out. First, while the trend is certainly not linear, FCF has undoubtedly trended upwards over the past decade -- increasing an average of 12% per year. Second, the dividend is historically very safe, with 2005 being the only year where the payout ratio from FCF eclipsed even 65%. The bottom line: Verizon's dividend is pretty safe. Before giving my full-fledged support to Verizon, there are a few other caveats worth considering. First and foremost, while the company is the largest mobile provider in America, the telecom landscape is not what it used to be. Verizon, sensing that disruption and innovation are rampant in today's technological setting, has branched out into other lines of business. That's evident through the company's acquisition of AOL and the announced plan to buy Yahoo!'s core operating business. I wouldn't be surprised to see the company continue to trend toward other strategic initiatives. What investors need to watch is whether or not those moves materially affect Verizon's cash flow statement. If they do, then there may be cause for concern regarding the company's dividend. If not, however, I have no problem endorsing Verizon's fat 4.5% payout as a safe and sustainable one. ","

Image source: Netflix. Donald Trump's election has been kind to the stock market so far, with major indexes having reached record highs in the days following his victory. However, at least one popular stock pick could be jeopardized by the incoming administration. The president-elect named two advisors last week who are notable opponents of net neutrality, the concept that all data traffic should be treated equally by internet service providers. This is a particularly sensitive issue for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which takes up more web traffic than any other company but owns none of the pipes that bring it into homes. Netflix has repeatedly highlighted this issue in its earnings reports. In a recent one, the company said, ""We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at interconnection points."" Netflix had been mostly pleased with progress on the issue under the Obama administration, but Trump's selections, who come directly from the telecom industry, threaten to undo that. The two men, Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, have previously spoken against net neutrality standards, each having served as a lobbyist for the telecom industry -- Eisenach once called it a form of ""crony capitalism."" Though net neutrality is a global issue, the U.S remains by far Netflix's biggest market, accounting for more than half of its subscriber base. Obama's Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Tom Wheeler, has been seen as proactive against monopolistic abuses among cable companies and telecoms, creating net neutrality standards and breaking up the set-top box monopoly that has inflated prices for cable boxes. In February of 2015, the commission issued a set of rules to ""preserve the internet as a platform for innovation, free expression, and economic growth.  The Open Internet platform above all prohibits blocking access to websites, throttling traffic, or accepting payment to favor one content source over another. Telecoms like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have fought the regulations in the past, and an appeals court struck down portions of a former net neutrality bill in 2014. If Trump's FCC rolls back net neutrality, it could have a number of consequences for Netflix, other streamers like Hulu and Amazon Prime, and small, independent content providers that may be unable to afford higher fees that ISPs could charge for better service. The most likely outcome of the unraveling of net neutrality is that prices for consumers will go up as ISPs could charge extra fees to carry streams from bandwidth hogs like Netflix. Stricter data caps could also apply to mobile devices, making it harder to use such services away from home. The biggest threat to Netflix, however, could be cable providers giving so-called ""fast lane"" treatment to their own services, as Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could do for its Stream service. The end of net neutrality would also give additional leverage to a combined AT&T (NYSE:T)-Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), as AT&T could use its Pay TV services like DirecTV and U-Verse to give preferential treatment to HBO and the Turner cable networks owned by Time Warner. While rolling back net neutrality would be a challenge for content providers like Netflix, it would be a boon for cable and internet service providers, whose stocks have gained since the election. NFLX data by YCharts. The net neutrality development comes at a time when communities are already toying with the idea of a ""Netflix tax"" or a surcharge on streaming services that treats them like a utility. Between local taxes and the end of net neutrality, Netflix could soon become more expensive for the average American. Expect CEO Reed Hasting to address this issue in the next earnings report, if not sooner, as Netflix has long been one of the biggest proponents of net neutrality. ","

Image source: Getty. Buying telecom stocks probably seems like a fairly straightforward exercise. Due to the industry's relative stability, some investors regard telecommunications companies as similar to utilities, a sleepy and staid industry if ever there was one. In reality, though, investing in telecom stocks isn't nearly as clear-cut as it might seem. In this two-part article, we will examine a host of key business and financial metrics that investors need to consider before actually investing in any telecom stock. Image source: Author. If you read through any telecom company's annual report, you're guaranteed to come across the commonly used metric ""churn rate."" The term simply refers to the number of subscribers that leave their service over a given period of time, as a percentage of total subscribers. The number isn't unique to the telecom industry, though; churn rates are often measured in sectors that use subscription-based business models, like the cable-TV industry. The lower the churn rate, the better, since customer defections act as a headwind to revenue growth and profit margins. Telecom companies disclose their churn rates in their SEC filings. For example, AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Sprint (NYSE:S) have each maintained churn rates of between 1% and 2% over the past year. As the U.S. smartphone market matures, telecom companies are increasingly attempting to grow by courting one another's customers. This has led to a minor rise in churn rates in recent quarters, though they are unlikely to spike appreciably beyond their current range. Investors researching telecom stocks will certainly want to closely monitor this crucial metric. Perhaps the second most commonly discussed performance metric in the telecom industry is average revenue per user, or ARPU. Just as it sounds, this measures the typical revenue garnered from one customer. Telecom companies closely monitor this metric to help shape their near-term and long-term growth strategies. Growing ARPU can prove particularly lucrative for telecom companies, since applying new revenue-growth strategies to current users flows directly to the bottom lines. The general ARPU trend among U.S. telecom carriers has largely been downward over the past several years, the result of continued price competition among the four main industry leaders. Sprint and T-Mobile have aggressively slashed prices and added other incentives to court customers away from AT&T and Verizon. However, in response, AT&T and Verizon have both expanded the breadth of their product offerings -- AT&T bought DIRECTV, and Verizon acquired AOL and Yahoo! -- to further monetize their customer bases. Telecom companies also track subscriber metrics including Average Billings Per User, Average Revenue Per Account, and Average Billings Per Account, which generally attempt to provide the same kind of user-level insight into a company's revenue-generation capabilities. Either way, anyone considering investing in a telecom stock should review the company's ARPU and its general direction to gain a better sense of the business's overall health. As you can see, each of the four major U.S. telecom operations offers a reasonably strong network, with AT&T and Sprint suffering from relatively slower upload speeds. This picture changes from region to region, and from urban to rural environments. Furthermore, with each telecom already testing 5G -- the next evolution for wireless standards -- their differences in network quality are certain to change throughout the latter half of the decade. Telecom companies have historically been strong dividend stocks. As just one example, the sector's 4.2% average dividend yield is more than double the S&P 500's 2% payout. Though the sector overall has a high average yield, there are divergences between companies in the sector. Here's how the four largest telecom stocks vary by dividend policy: Company Name Dividend Yield No. Consecutive Annual Dividend Increases AT&T 5.3% 31 Verizon Communications 4.9% 9 Sprint N/A N/A T-Mobile US N/A N/A Data sources: Dividend.com and Google Finance. As you'll see in future sections, a telecom company's dividend policy often reflects its current financing circumstances. For example, Frontier Communications' 13.2% dividend yield reflects the heightened long-term risk that comes with its legacy landline strategy, which many investors expect to gradually erode in the coming years. On the other end of the spectrum, Sprint and T-Mobile intentionally avoid paying dividends in favor of investing all their excess cash into improving their wireless networks, in hopes of stealing subscribers from AT&T and Verizon. Taking the time to understand the reasons a telecom firm pursues its dividend policy can absolutely save you from a costly investment mistake. The telecom industry is notably capital-intensive. In order to provide a competitive network, telecommunications companies have to invest extensively in a wide range of fixed assets. As such, telecom operators often tap debt markets to fund a large part of their operations. The industry's subscription model -- in which cash flows tend to be fairly consistent -- also supports the use of leverage. As such, investors need to dig into a telecom company's balance sheet as part of their due diligence. A number of common balance-sheet ratios can prove extremely useful here. Investors can look at a company's debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio, net cash, and debt as a percentage of invested capital. Used together, these and other balance-sheet ratios can give you a view into a company's long-term financial viability. Think you're getting the hang of analyzing telecom stocks?

    A 10-Point Checklist for Investing in Telecom Stocks (Part 1) -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. In Part 1 of this article series on honing your abilities to analyze telecom stocks, we discussed the first five points investors need to understand as part of their research process. To recap, investors should understand important industry metrics such as churn and ARPU, examine the network quality of the company and its relevant competitors, research the dividend policy, and review its capital structure -- all before buying a telecom stock. Now let's consider five additional items for investors to consider. Image source: author. Spectrum rights are the lifeblood of modern mobile networks. Similar to how radio stations own the rights to broadcast over a certain frequency and geography, telecom companies own the rights to similar frequencies of radio waves that we simply refer to as spectrum. So it only makes sense that a telecom investor should have a basic understanding of a wireless provider's spectrum holdings. The good news is, that's fairly easy to do. Telecom operators provide information about their spectrum holdings and lease arrangements in their annual reports. If you're interested in a certain geographic area, the Federal Communications Commission maintains a website detailing which wireless companies own the rights to various spectrum frequencies. Telecom companies throw off gobs of cash, thanks to their relatively stable, subscription-based business models. As discussed in this article's companion piece, building and maintaining a competitive wireless network requires substantial capital expenditures, which can erode those free cash flows. The differences between providers on these matters can be eye-opening. For example, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) enjoy subscriber bases roughly twice the size of Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and the tremendous difference shines through in terms their cash flow generation. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash flow from operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital expenditures $19.2 billion $17.7 billion $7.0 billion $4.7 billion Free cash flow from operations $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending March 31, 2016. Though much has been made of T-Mobile's and Sprint's recent challenges to AT&T and Verizon, this chart reveals the extent of the financial differences among U.S. wireless providers. This sizable difference in cash flow generation gives AT&T and Verizon far more flexibility to invest in future growth drivers (see below). They can more easily spend more on marketing, promotional pricing, and other measures to fend off their resurgent competitors. In fact, I maintain that this chart provides one of most useful ways to frame the competitive landscape in the U.S. telecom market. Any investor looking at this market needs to examine the stock in question in a similar manner before buying. As many smartphone markets in developed countries mature, revenue growth strategies are evolving at most telecoms in ways investors need to understand. For example, T-Mobile and Sprint remain the underdogs in the U.S. wireless market. To try to close that cash flow generation gap, both parties remain focused on growing their 4G wireless subscribers through a mix of marketing and price competition; T-Mobile's ""Un-carrier"" campaign is perhaps the best example. Image source: T-Mobile. However, in terms of their free cash flow advantages, AT&T and Verizon have instead pursued M&A strategies that should allow them to grow ARPU, albeit in different ways. Verizon has made a bet on building out its mobile advertising business by spending roughly $9 billion to acquire content and ad-tech powers AOL and Yahoo! over the past two years. AT&T, on the other hand, is moving to fashion itself into a one-stop shop for mobile connectivity and video programming through its purchase of DIRECTV and its proposed Time Warner buyout. Since it takes money to make money, investors need to understand a company's upcoming investment plans before buying. As was the case with their spectrum holdings, wireless providers typically offer some information on their near-term investment plans in their SEC filings. For example, AT&T's annual report states, ""We expect our 2016 capital investment, which includes our capital expenditures plus vendor financing payments related to our Mexico network, for our existing businesses to be in the $22,000 range, and we expect our capital investment to be in the 15 percent range of service revenues or lower from 2016 through 2018."" Finding this information doesn't have to take a lot of time -- I found it from a quick search. As with all good investing, it's critical to understand the cast of characters at the helm of a company. In fact, finding companies run by strong managers is one of the bedrocks of the Fool's primer on how to buy stocks. Among U.S. wireless providers, this is a fairly easy process, as the four largest wireless providers in the country are run by a well-known set of executives: Randall Stephenson  at AT&T, Lowell McAdam at Verizon, John Legere at T-Mobile, and Marcelo Claure at Sprint. A quick search can reveal the background information for the executive team and board of directors of a company that interests you. Furthermore, companies are required to publish their executive compensation plans in their annual proxy filings, which you can find on the investor-relations page of a company's website. Successfully buying telecom stocks requires quite a bit of analysis and familiarity with industry-specific metrics. However, with a little practice, anyone can get the hang of it. Equally important, using this checklist can help reveal some important risk factors that might not leap out at first glance. Getting to that point might require some additional upfront effort on your part, but the rewards will be worth it. ","

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

Trump took credit for the investment, saying his November victory spurred SoftBank’s decision. Son told reporters he planned to “invest into the new startup companies in the United States.” It would be difficult to create 50,000 jobs entirely by investing in startups, which generally employ few workers. Sprint employs about 30,000 people and has cut jobs to combat losses. In an interview, Son said the money will be coming from a $100 billion investment fund that he began setting up earlier this year with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners.

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed. The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday. Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record. It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The company added that some of its partners were affected. One such partner, Europe’s Sky Plc SKYB.L, said Yahoo provides email services to its 2.1 million Sky.com email account holders, but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected. The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement. Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.” ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"The end of negotiations was not a complete surprise. Les Moonves, the longtime chief executive of CBS, said last week talks were still stuck in the early stages, more than two months after the Redstones asked the boards of both companies to explore a tie-up. The two sides never entered talks on pricing and were far apart on Viacom’s value, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Shares of Viacom were down 7.9 percent at $39.10 in afternoon trading. In afternoon trading, CBS shares were down 0.4 percent at $62.12. National Amusements, the privately held movie company through which Shari Redstone and her 93-year-old father control 80 percent of the voting shares of CBS and Viacom, said in a letter they stopped pushing for a deal on the expectation of a turnaround at Viacom under new leadership. Viacom named Bob Bakish, head of its international business, acting chief executive officer at the end of October, and made that position permanent on Monday afternoon as it announced the end of merger explorations. Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV, has been struggling to turn around declining ad revenue and ratings while CBS is home to top-rated shows such “The Big Bang Theory” and “Thursday Night Football.” Mario Gabelli, whose firm is the second-largest owner of voting shares of Viacom and CBS, said he was not disappointed with the failure of merger plans and that he still believes that ultimately the two might merge. “Viacom needs to be fixed,” he said. One sticking point in negotiations was that CBS’s Moonves wanted autonomy over the merged company. National Amusements was willing to compromise on this issue, but in the end decided to let Bakish retain control of Viacom, according to the sources, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Bakish already has started taking action after just a few weeks as acting CEO. Last month,  the company announced it was buying Argentine broadcaster Television Federal SA from telecom carrier Telefonica SA for $345 million. He is also looking to improve relations with affiliates and is working on a plan to turn around MTV, a top priority for him, he told Reuters in November. Last week, he replaced Viacom’s head of distribution, Denise Denson, a longtime executive who worked closely with former CEO Philippe Dauman. In September, National Amusements called on Viacom and CBS to consider recombining, 10 years after Viacom was spun off from CBS. Shari Redstone had been in favor of recombining the two under Moonves, sources have previously told Reuters. Industry speculation that the two might rejoin increased this year after the Redstones prevailed in a power struggle that resulted in Dauman’s departure. A Viacom spokesman confirmed it had received the letter from National Amusements, which was first reported by CNBC. A CBS spokesman declined to comment. National Amusement’s letter also said: “CBS continues to perform exceptionally well under Les Moonves.” Relations between Moonves and Shari Redstone continue to be good, the source said. This week, the two plan to go to Boston for the premiere of the film “Patriots Day,” produced by CBS Films. ","

The company stock was down 2.25% in pre-market trading. In a press release late Wednesday, Yahoo said it believes an “unauthorized third party” stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August of 2013. That’s in addition to the half a million customers whose data was hacked in another incident which Yahoo disclosed in September. The company believes the August 2013 hack is “likely distinct” from the other incident. In November, Yahoo disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that law enforcement provided it with data files that a hacker claimed was Yahoo user data. Upon analyzing it with the help of outside forensic experts, Yahoo has said it turned out to be the company’s data. (Read more: Yahoo Discloses New Potential Breach.) For Verizon the latest disclosure may be the nail in the coffin that ends its hope of acquiring Yahoo to add to its purchase of AOL, which it made last year. After all, this data breach is double the size of the other one which has delayed the closing of the deal. In a statement to the media, Verizon said, “As we've said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions."" Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead. Armstrong said Verizon and Yahoo will start planning what a combined company will look like. By the first quarter of 2017, Armstrong said there will be more clarity for the organization.  (Read more: AOL CEO Optimistic on Verizon-Yahoo Deal.)

Siegel is a longtime proponent of investing in equities, and recently was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying that “There’s no bubble today. There hasn’t been in years.” He also opined “the Trump rally has a way to run.” In a post-election interview, Siegel even raised the prospect of Dow 25,000 in a few years.

Many strategists, including those at Strategas, believe it's the one reason why this rally is showing no signs of slowing down into year end. Clifton has a great piece of advice for those waiting to sell in 2017: ""In 2003, when Congress cut the capital gains tax, the provision was made retroactive to the first committee hearing in March.

Equinix agreed to pay $3.6 billion in cash to acquire 24 data center sites and their operations. All told, the sites contain 29 buildings, located in 15 metropolitan areas. Most of these are in the U.S.; two are located in South America, specifically Bogota, Colombia, and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Equinix will also obtain 900 customers that currently use the facilities. Equinix expects the transaction to close by the middle of next year. Adding the Verizon assets to the REIT's current portfolio gives it 175 data centers in 43 localities, utilizing around 17 million gross square feet of space. Equinix believes the Verizon assets will be ""immediately accretive"" to its results. Specifically, the company estimates that it will add $450 million in revenue and $270 million in EBITDA in the 12 months after the deal closes. Verizon doesn't particularly want to be in the data center business, while Equinix is eager to expand. So this is an appropriate and opportunistic transaction for both parties. In its press release, the REIT quoted CEO Steve Smith as saying -- accurately, in my view -- that ""the new assets will bring hundreds of new customers to Platform Equinix while establishing a presence in new markets and expanding our footprint in existing key metros."" It's a good time to be in the data center business, as enterprises rely more and more on the services such facilities provide. Equinix has been doing well lately, with revenue and the bottom line in its most recently reported quarter both beating analyst estimates (although adjusted funds from operations -- the most important profitability metric for REITs -- slipped a little). With the Verizon buy, it's making hay while the sun shines, to quote a corny phrase, and investors should be pleased with the portfolio-expanding move. ","

Coverage map. Image source: Verizon Communications. There has been much hype this year about the next-generation 5G wireless network. However, investors looking to bet on the new network should forget about big wireless providers Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). For two main reasons, smaller, behind-the-scenes companies that are helping develop the new technology look like a more promising option. The country's two largest telecom businesses are working hard to bring the faster, more reliable network to market. Both have begun running technical trials and are planning real-world pilot programs beginning next year. A new wireless network will bring a flood of new sales of devices that are 5G-compatible. And a new round of fighting over wireless subscribers among the country's handful of carriers will no doubt ensue as well. But AT&T and Verizon aren't betting the farm on it, as made evident by each company's recent activity. For AT&T, it started with last year's DirecTV purchase, followed up by last month's proposed acquisition of Time Warner. Verizon has taken a slightly different path with its AOL and proposed Yahoo! acquisitions, as well as a slew of smaller tech and media company purchases. The goal in both instances are the same, though. The wireless carriers are transforming themselves into multimedia conglomerates rather than wireless network pure plays. A new 5G network will certainly play a part in both businesses, but it won't be leveraged in the same way as older networks were. Past wireless networks were all about increasing speed and reliability, and the next-gen network also won't disappoint. Initial testing is toting 5G as anywhere from 10 to 100 times faster than the current 4G network. But download speeds are only part of the discussion. The 5G network will move beyond the world of cellphones and will encompass the entire universe of technology, what has been dubbed the Internet of Things. The needs of the new network will include being able to support billions of connected devices, everything from wearable tech like smartwatches to autonomous cars to sensors on industrial equipment. Much more than just a newer and faster network for telecommunications, 5G is really a new medium of data transmission that paves the way for new technology that will shape our world in the decades ahead. With that in mind, let's take a look at two stocks that could be good ways to play the latest tech revolution. With 5G set to encompass much more than just your smartphone, the companies that are helping develop the network and devices that will use it are a more appealing investment than the telecoms. Here are two companies much smaller than Verizon and AT&T that are at the forefront of this research. Image source: InterDigital. InterDigital (NASDAQ:IDCC), which helped develop past wireless network technology, is also involved with engineering the latest 5G network. The company makes its money by developing solutions and earning patent fees and royalties for their use. Currently, InterDigital revenue comes from a combination of past technology royalties and new technology solutions income. It has been a good year as the top line has expanded with a large royalty sale of a past patent during the last quarter. In tandem with increasing sales has been an increasing bottom line as well, as the company has been looking for ways to keep costs down. IDCC Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Much work remains for the development of the 5G network platform, and InterDigital's engineers have been tasked with solving some critical issues. On the work docket is developing ways to address the need for reliability of ultra-sensitive data transmission for autonomous driving and remote healthcare, and the need for traffic prioritization for billions of interconnected machine communications. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a designer and maker of wireless-connectivity-enabling semiconductors. The company's technology has been powering smartphones for some time, but as a new wave of devices come to market requiring connectivity, Skyworks has been there to answer the call as well. The company saw top-line sales slow dramatically this year, taking a breather after revenue more than doubled in the last five years. Profits also initially slid, but ended up finishing the fiscal year on a high note and notched a 26% year-over-year increase on decreasing expenses. SWKS Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Global smartphone growth has slowed since 2015, but the Internet of Things movement is just getting under way. When 5G begins to roll out in the next few years, new chips enabling connection to it will need to be developed and sold. Skyworks is in a good position to benefit when that happens. ","

Four huge companies that control 70% of the digital communications sector have been using their market power to overcharge the typical household about $45 a month ($540 per year), according to a new report (link opens in PDF) from the non-profit Consumer Federation of America (CFA). AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) form what the researchers call a ""tight oligopoly on steroids."" These four companies, according to the report, have protected their control over prices by not competing head-to-head to ""a remarkable extent,"" leading to more than $60 billion in annual overcharges. This is good for the companies and their shareholders. By not competing in three consumer-facing businesses -- wireless, broadband internet access, and multichannel video programming service (cable) as well as the behind-the-scenes data services -- these companies have been able to consistently keep prices moving up (while costs have fallen). ""Stockholders love the astronomical rate of return, but consumers hate it,"" said Dr. Mark Cooper, CFA's director of research and the author of the report, in a press release, ""which is reflected in the very low ratings that these products get in consumer satisfaction surveys."" The federation released its report while testifying against the AT&T/Time Warner merger. Comcast is one of the companies on the hot seat in this report. Image source: The Motley Fool. AT&T, Comcast, Charter, and Verizon have generally avoided competing with each other, keeping largely to territorial boundaries dating back to before the Telecommunications Act of 1996 when they enjoyed actual monopolies. The report noted that AT&T and Verizon were slow to go into the video business (though both are in it now) while the major cable companies still have chosen to not offer wireless services to compete directly with telecommunications companies. ""Instead of competing vigorously on a head-to-head basis, they preferred to buy each other out,"" the federation wrote. ""This not only eliminated the most likely potential competitors, but it also gave them huge fortress regions. Lax antitrust and regulatory policy for the first 15 years of the implementation of the 1996 Act allowed this to come about."" In the press release, Cooper was quoted as saying: ""All of the negative aspects of the tight oligopoly on steroids come into play in the ATT-TWX mergers.  In many respects ATT is the dominant player in the tight oligopoly, with a strong position in wireless, business data services, and video distribution. Allowing it to acquire a major content producer would give it much stronger incentives and an enhanced ability to leverage its market power to harm consumers and competition."" Competition lowers prices. In much of the country, when it comes to cable and internet service, AT&T (which owns DirecTV as well as the U-verse video service), Charter, and Comcast do not face comparable direct competition. Consumers might be able to opt for DISH Network to meet their television needs, but they still, in much of the country, would need AT&T, Charter, Comcast, or Verizon for broadband service. All four of these companies to different extents have pricing power based on many Americans simply not having any other realistic choice. The CFA did note that T-Mobile's ""aggressive competition strategy is definitely putting downward pressure on prices and excess profits, saving consumers $5-$10 per month."" Despite that, it found that the a typical household, which has two cellphones, one landline, and a video-internet bundle, that uses AT&T or Verizon still pays an extra $10 per line. ""To estimate the total overcharges, we applied the $10 [monthly] overcharge figure only to the subscribers of the dominant carriers [AT&T and Verizon],"" the federation wrote, working that out to total annual overcharges of more than $40 billion. ""This equals to just over a quarter of the revenues of the firms with overcharges,"" the federation said. The study found similar results in broadband and video bundles. It used an overcharge number of $25 per household per month, despite writing that ""there are reasons to believe that this estimate is low."" Since between 70 million and 90 million homes have bundled broadband and cable, Cooper used 80 million as the base to estimate aggregate overcharges. ""The total would be $24 billion,"" the report says, again about a quarter of the revenue in these segments for the firms with overcharges. The federation wrote that competition could ultimately force prices lower, stating that all four of these companies would be thriving even without the overcharges. ""We find that the companies have been throwing off cash at the rate of $80 billion per year for mergers and acquisitions, increased liquid assets (retained earnings and stock repurchases), excess dividends and high prices paid for auctioned spectrum to keep spectrum out of the hands of potential competitors,"" the report says. ""Thus, excess returns to shareholders easily account for the excess profits and cost-reducing competitive effects would add to total consumer savings."" Whether that competition comes depends on a number of things. Disruptive technology could, for example, offer more people a broadband alternative that could hurt these companies' ability to keep consumers in cable/internet bundles. That is already happening in the wireless space, but Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter have been very successful when it comes to keeping competition from gaining a toehold. It could happen, but deals like AT&T buying Time Warner make it even less likely. ","

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

Image source: Getty Images. The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the growing network of connected sensors and devices, and the increasing connectivity is already having significant impacts at the consumer, enterprise, and public levels. Research firm Gartner expects the number of IoT devices to grow from 6.4 billion in 2016 to nearly 21 billion in 2020, and estimates that more than half of new business systems and processes will utilize the Internet of Things by the end of that period. Growth in device connectivity and machine-to-machine communication is creating an explosion of new data, and this information is being sorted and analyzed to produce insights that can improve efficiency and drive substantial economic value. Brian Feroldi (Verizon): There's no doubt that the Internet of Things trend offers tremendous growth opportunities for all kinds of tech companies. However, I personally do not think that buying an electronic hardware manufacturer is the right way to play the trend. The reason? Huge growth potential will attract a lot of competition. Over time, that competition will erode away profit margins, leaving investors with poor returns. For that reason, I think it is a far smarter idea to buy shares of a cellular network provider like Verizon Communications instead. After all, those billions of devices that are expected to come online will need access to a mobile network in order to work. That provides Verizon with a great new avenue for growth in the years ahead. You might not be aware of it, but Verizon is already benefiting from the IoT trend. Last quarter, Verizon's IoT revenue grew by 24% to $217 million, making it one of the company's fastest-growing divisions. Sure, that's still just a drop in the bucket when compared with the company's wireless and wireline revenue, but over time IoT revenue holds promise to grow like wildfire. That could help propel the company's long-term revenue and profit growth. Verizon certainly believes that the IoT represents a huge opportunity, which is why it is investing accordingly. Earlier this year, Verizon bought Telogis and Sensity Systems, both of which will add to the company's IoT product offering. Over time I think investors should expect even more bolt-on acquisitions to ensure that it maintains a strong foothold in this important and growing market. Throw in a dividend yield that tops 4.6% and I think Verizon is a great way for conservative investors to get their IoT exposure. Keith Noonan (Cisco): Overcoming security and standardization issues that arise from moving data between disparate devices and networks is one of the main obstacles to the evolution of connectivity, and no company is better suited to deal with it than Cisco. The company's Internet of Things and Applications Group vice president, Rowan Trollope, recently said that the company can deliver many of the connectivity and security needs brought on by IoT because ""it owns the network."" There's some simplification involved in that statement, but Cisco's leading position in networking means that the company is going to have a formative impact on the progression of IoT. The company is in the process of giving device makers tools and applications-programming interfaces to help with standardization and to cut down on security threats that could limit the progression of the tech. Cisco is taking these steps to get the big players on board with its network and certification process in order to facilitate its transition to a more subscription-based business model. This year, the company purchased Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion in order to bolster its service offerings and fast-track its position in IoT connectivity and analytics platforms. The big connectivity push also presents opportunities that could lift Cisco's hardware businesses. The networking giant has partnered with Ericsson, Intel, and Verizon for the development of a 5G mobile router, and could benefit from demand for routers and switches that are tailored for customers' IoT needs. Priced at just 12.5 times forward earnings estimates, with roughly $40 billion in cash and short-term investments on the books, and a 3.5% dividend yield, Cisco stock offers an inexpensive valuation, hefty returned income, and a forefront position in the Internet of Things.

Image source: Google. When Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unveiled its fancy new Pixel phone in October, which overall looks like a strong smartphone, there was one bizarre anachronism associated with the device: it was launching as a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exclusive. Well, at least in terms of distribution, as Big Red was the only U.S. carrier that would sell the Pixel at its retail store, even though technically the device is supported on all four major carriers. Android Police reported earlier this week that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is planning on rolling out Pixel displays at its retail locations. But here's the rub: The Un-carrier will only be displaying the Pixel, and won't be actively selling the device. What gives? T-Mobile sales reps will reportedly encourage interested customers to purchase the device directly from Google's online store. T-Mobile has been offering a Pixel promotion for a couple months, giving $325 to anyone that brings a Pixel to T-Mobile's network. The promotion value is spread out over two years via monthly bill credits, which is T-Mobile's way of making sure customers stick around. ""Verizon is spending millions to convince people that Google's Pixel is 'only on Verizon' and it is just not true,"" a T-Mobile spokesperson told FierceWireless. ""The Pixel works great on T-Mobile with unlimited high-speed data and a faster, more advanced LTE network. Buy one from Google or buy one from Verizon and bring it on over."" It goes without saying that this is an inconvenient solution for T-Mobile customers, who would much rather just buy the device directly from T-Mobile in a seamless transaction. Instead, customers have to buy the device from somewhere else, and then jump through all the hoops to get the promotion. T-Mobile is obviously interested in carrying the Pixel, but its hands are probably tied for the time being due to Verizon's exclusivity. Scoring an exclusive means exactly that. Verizon is the only carrier allowed to distribute Pixel for now, so the real question is how long the exclusivity window lasts. Once the exclusivity expires, I would imagine more carriers will look to sign on with Google to sell the Pixel at its retail stores, which is easily the most important distribution channel in the smartphone market -- as well as potentially the biggest limiting factor for Pixel. Considering the broader shift away from carrier exclusives, it's hard to imagine Verizon's exclusivity window lasting more than three to six months, which importantly should cover the busy holiday shopping season. T-Mobile's push to display the Pixel but not to officially sell the Pixel likely skirts the exclusivity, which Verizon probably doesn't take too kindly. In any event, there's a very good chance that the Pixel sees wider carrier availability once Verizon's exclusivity has ended, which will probably be in early to mid-2017. ","

Stu Woo,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 10, 2016 2:01 p.m. ET By LONDON -- Telecommunications giant Vodafone Group PLC has a mantra: Be No. 1. Or No. 2. U.K.-based Vodafone, the world's second-biggest mobile carrier by subscribers, is trying to keep that position by having the most -- or second-most -- customers in each of its 26 countries. ""It's not really about being the leader,"" Chief Executive Vittorio Colao told analysts last month. Vodafone believes the top two players in telecom markets -- and it doesn't matter if they are first or second -- are able to differentiate themselves through superior networks and services. By focusing investments in these two areas, the leading operators can justify higher prices. ""The gap versus No. 3s is not only stable, but even increasing,"" Mr. Colao said, adding ""it's about really creating a two-tier market."" Even after a $130 billion windfall from the 2014 sale of its Verizon Wireless stake, Vodafone has so far eschewed big, global expansion. Under Mr. Colao, a 55-year-old Italian reserve military officer who took over as CEO in 2008, the company left the consumer U.S. market and has plowed investment into Europe and the developing world instead. Vodafone's biggest competitors are typically formerly state-owned fixed-line giants still catching up in the mobile age. It earned GBP41 billion ($50 billion) in revenue for the last full fiscal year and ranks below only China Mobile Ltd. in terms of global subscribers. Over two years, Mr. Colao spent about $24 billion across his empire, which is concentrated in Europe, Africa and India, to expand high-speed mobile networks, the pillar of its marketing campaigns. Vodafone also spent about $20 billion in 2013 and 2014 to buy major cable operators in Germany and Spain, and it is expanding its wired cable and internet network so it can sell the telecom industry's Holy Grail: a ""quad-play"" package that offers mobile, landline telephone, cable and internet services on one bill. The results so far are mixed: Vodafone said last month that its plan was paying off in parts of Europe, but proving much more expensive than anticipated in India. Overall, Vodafone's organic revenue, which excludes foreign-exchange movement, grew 2.2% in the third quarter of 2016, outperforming the average 1.6% growth of major Europe-based telecom firms, according to Raymond James analyst Stephane Beyazian. Leading the way over the past six months was Germany, with 2.3% organic growth, and Italy, at 1.7%. But Vodafone's organic revenue declined 2.7% in its home market of the U.K. -- where it is the No. 3 mobile operator behind BT Group PLC, which operates the EE brand, and Telefónica SA's O2. Mr. Colao blames the shortfall partly on billing problems and customer-service complaints related to a new computer system. Even more costly has been defending its No. 2 status in India. New mobile carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., funded by India's richest man, has offered free service for at least a month to get new customers. Vodafone wrote down the value of its India business by EUR5 billion ($5.3 billion) earlier this month, citing the competition. ""It is very hard to compete with someone who gives stuff for free,"" Mr. Colao said. Vodafone was formed in Newbury, England, in 1984 and spun off from military and electronics conglomerate Racal Electronics Group in 1991. It was one of the world's first mobile-focused telecom companies, and obtained licenses in a hodgepodge of countries early in the cellphone era and via two big deals. It merged with AirTouch Communications, a San Francisco-based mobile carrier with world-wide holdings, in 1999. The next year, it acquired Mannesmann AG, a German telecommunications business with European operations. In 1999, Vodafone merged its U.S. mobile operations with those of Bell Atlantic Corp., with the latter renaming itself Verizon Communications Inc. They called their joint venture Verizon Wireless, with Verizon owning 55% and Vodafone the other 45%. Verizon Communications had long tried to buy out Vodafone's shares, but the two didn't reach an agreement until 2013. The sale closed in 2014. Vodafone gave back $84 billion from the sale to shareholders -- the largest single return in modern corporate history. A chunk of the remainder went to pay taxes and reduce debt. The rest of those funds helped bankroll Vodafone's two-year network-improvement program. The project, which mostly wrapped up this past spring, focused on expanding Vodafone's fourth-generation mobile network, or 4G, in Europe and both its fourth- and third-generation networks in emerging markets such as India. For years, Vodafone and John Malone's Liberty Global PLC have publicly flirted with the idea of a combination. The two companies expect to complete a merger of their operations in the Netherlands later this year, creating a 50-50 joint venture. Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference last month, Mr. Colao and Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said the Dutch tie-up wasn't necessarily indicative of future deals. But Mr. Colao kept the door open. ""We see the world the same way,"" Mr. Colao told investors, describing Mr. Fries. ""Is this the first trial of something bigger? Not necessarily....But of course it helps to know each other.""

                                    in jeopardy. To make security great again, we must augment the best preventive security with detection capabilities that can catch an attacker red-handed at an early stage, before damage can occur. This is a departure from the conventional “Cold War” security mindset that is concerned with keeping attackers out by building taller and thicker walls. It involves assuming that attackers will break into the network and become active — the most common breach scenario of 2016 — and shifting strategy, tools and staffing as a result. Today, the industry average time for finding an active attacker is about five months, reflecting the colossal failure of conventional security. The state of the union for federal security is that few if any non-defense agencies can find an active attacker on their network. Most cannot find a network intruder or a malicious insider, such as a rogue employee or contractor, working to steal or damage information or assets. Consider that the National Security Agency, the Office of Personnel Management and the FBI were breached along top security vendors and agencies. If government agencies with some of the top security talent were no match for cybercriminals, how can an enterprise stand up to the same threats? Since most organizations, public or private, lack the ability to find active network attackers, there is no telling if an intruder is lurking and what they have been able to accomplish. Only in the relatively straightforward “breaking and entering” cybercrimes of stolen personal information or financial details does it become clear at some point that a breach has transpired and damage has been done. With other forms of attack, you may never know. While defensive security is essential, it is no longer sufficient to protect networks. Security leaders in business and government need to admit to today’s reality and focus efforts on detecting active attackers. They need to shift from the traditional model of first encountering a threat and then developing a way to identify and block it. Instead, they need to find attackers by their operational activities that may blend in with normal network events. Such detection is difficult, but it can be done. It requires security based on behavioral profiling to find exceptional attack activities, rather than just trying to prevent the installation of malware. Preventive security is actually quite good and can deflect the vast majority of external threats. The trouble is that it can’t prevent every one. There are far too many ways for an attacker to get into a network, often just through compromising an employee’s or contractor’s computer or account through phishing or malicious software that loads on an unsuspecting user from a legitimate website. Now, in addition to a strong defense, companies need to expect that attackers will be able make their way on to the network. They need to spot them by their operational activities—the step-by-step processes that attackers must perform to gain control of valuable network assets. Instead of trying to find aspects of “known bad,” security professionals need a model of “known good” so that attacker activities can stand out from normal network events. That, for example, would understand that no one in the marketing department has ever used a tool like PowerShell, which is for network administrators, and to flag it as an anomaly when one does. One of the most important questions Donald Trump should be asking after he takes office in January is: “Do we have the ability to know if there is an active attacker on our networks?” That should be followed up with: “If so, how?” or “What is our level of confidence?” C-suite executives should be asking the same questions. What’s needed in both the public and private sectors is a new impetus for protecting vital assets and entrusted information based on admitting that an attacker will get in. Continuing with today’s approach will only yield more devastating loss and damage and becomes an illustration of insanity. Security must be modernized to meet the modern challenges and make it great again. Kasey Cross is director of product management at LightCyber, a leading provider of behavioral attack detection.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed. The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday. Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record. It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The company added that some of its partners were affected. One such partner, Europe’s Sky Plc SKYB.L, said Yahoo provides email services to its 2.1 million Sky.com email account holders, but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected. The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement. Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.” ","
                Yahoo under scrutiny after latest hack, Verizon seeks new deal terms | Reuters"
,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the summer of 2013, Yahoo Inc launched a project to better secure the passwords of its customers, abandoning the use of a discredited technology for encrypting data known as MD5. It was too late. In August of that year, hackers got hold of more than a billion Yahoo accounts, stealing the poorly encrypted passwords and other information in the biggest data breach on record. Yahoo only recently uncovered the hack and disclosed it last week. The timing of the attack might seem like bad luck, but the weakness of MD5 had been known by hackers and security experts for more than a decade. MD5 can be cracked more easily than other so-called “hashing” algorithms, which are mathematical functions that convert data into seemingly random character strings. In 2008, five years before Yahoo took action, Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute issued a public warning to security professionals through a U.S. government-funded vulnerability alert system: MD5 “should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.” Yahoo’s failure to move away from MD5 in a timely fashion was an example of problems in Yahoo’s security operations as it grappled with business challenges, according to five former employees and some outside security experts. Stronger hashing technology would have made it more difficult for the hackers to get into customer accounts after breaching Yahoo’s network, making the attack far less damaging, they said. “MD5 was considered dead long before 2013,” said David Kennedy, chief executive of cyber firm TrustedSec LLC. “Most companies were using more secure hashing algorithms by then.” He did not name specific firms. Yahoo, which has confirmed it was still using MD5 at the time of the attack, disputed the notion that the company had skimped on security. “Over the course of our more than 20-year history, Yahoo has focused on and invested in security programs and talent to protect our users,” Yahoo said in a statement to Reuters. “We have invested more than $250 million in security initiatives across the company since 2012.” The former Yahoo security staffers, however, told Reuters the security team was at times turned down when it requested new tools and features such as strengthened cryptography protections, on the grounds that the requests would cost too much money, were too complicated, or were simply too low a priority. Partly, that reflected the internet pioneer’s long-running financial struggles: Yahoo’s revenues and profits have fallen steadily since their 2008 peak while Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook Inc and others have come to dominate the consumer internet business. “When business is good, it’s easy to do things like security,” said Jeremiah Grossman, who worked on Yahoo’s security team from 1999 to 2001. “When business is bad, you expect to see security get cut.” To be sure, no system is completely hack-proof. Hackers have managed to break into passwords that were encrypted using more advanced technologies than MD5. Other Internet companies, such as LinkedIn and AOL, have also suffered security breaches, though none nearly as large as Yahoo’s. “This could happen to any large corporation,” said Tom Kellermann, a former World Bank security manager and security industry executive. Kellermann, now CEO of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures, said he was not surprised that it had taken Yahoo several years to identify the massive attacks. “Hackers often have a capacity to burrow deeper than we thought into a system and remain for years,” he said. Reuters could not determine how many companies besides Yahoo were using MD5 in 2013. Google, Facebook and Microsoft Corp did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to another former security veteran at Yahoo, even when the company was growing quickly, security sometimes took a back seat as the company focused on system performance to keep up with the growth. Then, when growth stalled, senior security staff left for other companies and the chances of getting approval for expensive upgrades dropped further, the person said. “Any changes to the user database took forever because they were understaffed, and it’s an ultra-critical system - everything depends on it,” said the former Yahoo employee. Yahoo declined to comment on details of its security practices, but said it routinely conducted drills to test and improve its cyber defenses and highlighted campaigns such as a “bug bounty” program in which it pays hackers to find security flaws and report them to the company. Last September, Yahoo disclosed a 2014 cyber attack that affected at least 500 million customer accounts, the biggest known data breach at the time. Following last week’s news of the even bigger 2013 breach, U.S. federal investigators and lawmakers said they are scrutinizing Yahoo’s security practices, and Verizon Communications Inc is seeking to renegotiate a July deal to buy Yahoo’s internet business for $4.8 billion. The former Yahoo employees said the company’s security problems began before the arrival of Chief Executive Marissa Mayer in 2012 and continued under her tenure. Yahoo had suffered attacks by Russian hackers for years, two of the former staffers said. In 2014, Yahoo hired a new security chief, Alex Stamos, and one of the security crews he led - known internally as ‘The Paranoids’ - thought they were making headway against the hackers, former employees said. In 2015, when the security crew discovered a hidden program attached to Yahoo’s email servers that was monitoring all incoming messages, their first thought was that the Russian hackers had come back. It turned out that the program had been installed by Yahoo’s email engineers to comply with a secret surveillance order requested by a U.S. intelligence agency, as Reuters previously reported. Stamos and some of his staff left Yahoo soon after that, creating further disruptions to security operations. This week, in addition to disclosing the 2013 hack, Yahoo said someone had accessed its proprietary computer code to learn how to forge “cookies,” which would allow hackers to access an account without passwords. Yahoo said it connected some cookie-forging activity to the same state-sponsored actor it believed was responsible for the 2014 data theft. “They burrowed in and got access to everything,” said Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security firm Trail of Bits. On Thursday, Germany’s cyber security authority criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt adequate encryption techniques and advised German consumers to switch to other email providers. Yahoo told Reuters it was committed to keeping users secure by staying ahead of new threats. “Today’s security landscape is complex and ever-evolving, but, at Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure.” ","

We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions."" Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead. Armstrong said Verizon and Yahoo will start planning what a combined company will look like. By the first quarter of 2017, Armstrong said there will be more clarity for the organization.  (Read more: AOL CEO Optimistic on Verizon-Yahoo Deal.)

(CHTR) shares have been gaining in recent days, up more than 4.5% so far this week on continued speculation Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) could buy the cable operator. According to media reports, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam told Wall Street analysts at a meeting earlier this week that buying Charter would make “industrial sense.” McAdam didn’t say Verizon was readying a move or considering a deal, nor was Charter Communications expressing interest. The New York Post, citing sources that were present at the meeting, said Verizon would have to raise its level of debt to acquire Charter Communications, which could make a deal a non-starter. What’s more, the same people told the paper it’s not clear if the Trump Administration would support a deal between the two. Charter, which in May purchased Time Warner Cable for $71 billion, has a market capitalization of $78.8 billion. Ever since AT&T Inc.’s move to acquire Time Warner Inc. and launch its own streaming video content service, DirecTV Now, speculation has been swirling about other M&A in the telecom industry. While some industry watchers said Charter could go after a content company, CEO Tom Rutledge poured cold water on that at a recent investor conference. The executive said Charter is happy where it’s at and doesn’t need to buy a content company. But he didn’t rule out making cable acquisitions, pointing out that the incoming Trump Administration appears more open to consolidation. (See also: Comcast Is Launching Netflix on Set-Top Boxes.) While Charter may be shrugging off any deals outside its realm, one investor, TCI, the hedge fund founded by Chris Hohn, is preparing for it to buy more shares and eventually get a buyout offer from Verizon. Speaking during the Sohn Conference in London last week, Hohn, who owns shares of Charter, said he thinks the company will be a takeover target given the consolidation going on in the U.S. market, naming Verizon as a bidder. Hohn’s comments echo a similar assessment by RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin, who recently initiated coverage of Charter with an outperform rating and $325 price target.

If you want to skip the details on the moving parts and just get to examples of the biggest beneficiaries, then go to the “ big potential winners” section below. Otherwise, here’s a little background on what’s at work. (Also read: How S&P 500 companies would save $87.1 billion if Trump passes his tax plan.) You can think of a deferred tax liability as a store of value on the balance sheet that gets released on to the income statement over time for accounting purposes. Companies use this account to make up for differences in how they keep their two sets of books — one for the tax collector and the other for investors. Companies typically expense certain costs — the price of big-ticket items like equipment and plants, for example — more quickly for the IRS than they can in the books prepared for investors. This lowers their taxes in the near term. But then they go up in later years, all things being equal. To make up for the timing differences, companies set aside deferred tax liabilities. Here’s where things get interesting for investors. Companies calculate the amount to set aside using the prevailing tax rate, currently 35%. But if Trump and Republicans in Congress reduce the tax rate, companies will suddenly have to set aside far less money for deferred tax liabilities, providing an immediate boost to earnings. Suppose the tax rate gets cut to 20%, a likely compromise scenario in Washington. (Trump wants 15%, but many Congressional leaders don’t want to go quite that far.) This would mean a company’s new deferred tax liability would be 57% (or 20%/35%) of the old one. Deferred tax liabilities would decline by 43%, in other words. That money would go straight to the income statement as “earnings” and, theoretically at least, boost the value of a company’s market value. “It’s a gift from the government. It’s like debt forgiveness,” says Bastiat Capital founder Albert Meyer, an accounting expert whose stock picks are up an annualized 7.9% since April 2006 versus 5% for the benchmark S&P 500 Index. “If they lower the tax rate, the deferred tax liability has to be restated, and that provides a onetime credit in the income statement.” True, this is a “non cash” event. There is no money that magically appears out of nowhere. But it will affect reported earnings and thus influence investor sentiment on a stock. The big potential winners To find some of the biggest potential winners, I asked S&P Global Market Intelligence to screen for the companies with the largest deferred tax liabilities. The two companies with the biggest are Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

                                   at $31.7 billion. Those companies could see their market values rise 7% to 10% from the effect of the tax reduction. To see why, let’s walk through an example, with AT&T. If the tax rate drops to 20%, AT&T’s deferred tax liability would decline to $34 billion from $59.6 billion, a reduction of $25.5 billion. Hence, there would be a $25.5 billion credit adjustment in the income statement, effectively boosting earnings by $25.5 billion in the year of the restatement, says Meyer. Since the company has a $245 billion market value, that $25.5 billion gain theoretically represents a 10.45% increase in market value, he says. That is just an estimate, not a hard-and-fast rule. But it’s a good gauge of the potential impact the change may have on how investors think about valuing the company. Now, consider Pfizer. The tax cut reduction to 20% would take down its deferred tax liability of $31.7 billion to $18.1 billion, for a “savings” of $13.6 billion. That could represent a 7% increase in its $186 billion market value. Utilities While the six companies above have the biggest absolute deferred tax liabilities, the biggest potential impact to stock prices may lie elsewhere — among the companies that have the largest liabilities relative to their market values. Since utilities spend a lot on plants and equipment, they have some of the biggest depreciation expenses for tax purposes. So they have some of the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value. Utilities also happen to be out of favor among investors right now, which makes them an interesting contrarian play. Investors are fleeing bond-like stocks that pay high dividends, such as utilities, on fears that Federal Reserve interest-rate increases will be bad for those stocks. The theory is that the shares of bond-like stocks (and bond prices) can fall as interest rates go up, since the price moves “adjust up” their yields to match yields set higher in the markets because of Fed rate hikes. This widespread aversion to utilities is one reason Larry McDonald of the Bear Traps Report likes utilities as a contrarian buy right now. An added plus for utilities is that they typically have big deferred tax liabilities. Thus, they stand to gain a lot if Washington cuts the corporate tax rate. According to my calculations using data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, the six utilities with the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value are: Entergy

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P continues to digest the December breakout. From current levels, the 2,263 area remains an inflection point, and is followed by the S&P’s all-time high of 2,277.5. (The S&P’s record closing high rests at 2,271.72, and has been challenged early Tuesday.) Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average

                                   is holding the range top. Consider that before Tuesday, the Dow’s all-time closing, and absolute peaks held at 19,911.21, and 19,966.43, respectively. Both areas remain under siege. Conversely, the range bottom matches last week’s low of 19,748. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains technical. As illustrated, the index bottomed twice last week at 5,426, precisely matching first support. Conversely, the Nasdaq’s all-time closing, and intraday peaks, rest at 5,463.83, and 5,486.75 respectively. Separately, the index has staged alternating tests of the range across five straight sessions. Technical price action within an uptrend is bullish. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has sustained the December breakout. First support closely matches the 5,400 mark, and is followed by the 5,340 breakout point. More broadly, the prevailing upturn builds on the steep July rally. An intermediate-term target projects to the 5,570 area. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has taken flight, thus far topping 34 points under the 20,000 mark. Though still near-term extended — and due to consolidate at some point — the prevailing bull flag is a continuation pattern, technically positioning the index for incremental gains. Near-term support matches last week’s close of 19,843, illustrated on the hourly chart, and is followed by a deeper floor around 19,750. Similarly, the S&P 500 has established a flag pattern, digesting the December spike. Recall that S&P 2,252 marks near-term support, illustrated on the hourly chart, and is followed by a more significant floor at 2,214. Broadly speaking, each major U.S. benchmark has established an orderly five-session range, consolidating slightly under record territory. The muted selling pressure, even after the Federal Reserve’s rate hike last week (and hawkishly revised outlook), is technically constructive. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. Recall that the IWM bottomed last week at 134.81 — slightly above the November peak — an area that pivots to support. Conversely, the all-time closing, and absolute peaks — 138.31, and 138.82, respectively — remain within striking distance. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has staged a flattish pullback from record territory. First support matches last week’s low, fractionally under 303, and is followed by the November peak of 298.77. Conversely, resistance matches the MDY’s all-time highs, technically spanning from 309.09 to 309.59. Widening considerably, to the S&P 500’s three-year view, adds perspective. Each bar on the chart above represents one week. As illustrated, the index has staged two directionally sharp 2016 spikes to uncharted territory. The prevailing late-year rally builds on the initial July Brexit-fueled breakout. The intervening downturn was comparably flat, punctuated by a brief pre-election violation of the 2,131 floor, and the more important 2,117 support. Fast forward to the present, and first support rests at S&P 2,252, an area pinned to price action, and a percentage downturn, detailed last week. This is followed by more significant support at the 2,214 breakout point, and the 2,190 mark, closely matching the December closing low. (Recall that the current leg higher originates from the Dec. 1 close of 2,191, effectively matching major support.) The S&P 500’s intermediate- to longer-term technical bias points higher barring a violation. Also see: Bull trend confirmed: Charting the approach of Dow 20,000 ahead of the Fed.

Image source: Getty Images. At first glance, Sprint (NYSE:S) vs. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) looks like a very simple, natural rivalry. Two of the four nationwide wireless networks, set up in a steel cage, do battle over traditional telecom metrics and issues, and a single survivor leaves the ring victorious. That's actually not how this rivalry works at all. Let's get complicated. First, let me give you a sense of the two companies' relative scale: Metric Verizon Sprint How Much Bigger Is Verizon's Number? Trailing revenue $128 billion $32.4 billion 4 times Net income $14 billion ($1.8 billion) N/A Trailing free cash flow $11.7 billion $2.4 billion 5 times Enterprise value $319 billion $65 billion 5 times Data source: Yahoo! Finance. In short, Sprint can't hold a candle to Verizon's hugeness. In an industry where economies of scale play a deciding role, this is a massive business advantage for Big Red. The company can strike billion-dollar deals without breaking a sweat, take large business risks without betting the farm, and negotiate from a position of cash-backed strength. Meanwhile, Sprint nurses negative earnings and returns on equity under a crushing debt load. The company depends on capital injections from majority owner SoftBank just to keep its network upgrades and other business plans alive. And for the income investors out there, Verizon sports a generous 4.3% dividend yield while Sprint can't afford to spend any cash at all on dividend checks. Knockout in round one, right? Verizon must be the only reasonable choice, thanks to a dominant financial performance. Well, not quite. Sprint investors have enjoyed a thrilling 138% return in 2016. Verizon shareholders had to settle for 16%, or 21% if you include reinvested dividend payments along the way. Market momentum is clearly on Sprint's side, and there are certainly plenty of buyers out there who see value in Sprint shares. Yes, more value than they see in Verizon's stock. In many ways, Sprint is a turnaround gamble. From the end of 2013 to the start of 2016, share prices had fallen a bloodcurdling 66%. The company is in the habit of reporting weak subscriber counts and even weaker bottom-line profits, and that hurts in the long run. This year's bounce rests on a firmer top line and smaller cash losses -- plus the tantalizing possibility of Sprint joining forces with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) to create a third megatelecom. Reports would have it that Sprint wants to buy T-Mobile in a deal financed by SoftBank cash. The Japanese company keeps inviting these rumors only to swat them away once the wild and woolly tales get going. In the latest round of this action, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son promised President-elect Donald Trump to invest $50 billion in the American market, raising the ghost of T-Mobile combination plans again. But the cash is reportedly meant for investment in smaller start-up businesses, not big-ticket buyouts. But that report's boost never faded from Sprint's stock chart, even after dismissing the direct buyout conclusion. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts.

    Stock Face-Off: Verizon Communications Inc. vs. Sprint Corp. -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Though it might seem simple and straightforward, investing in top telecom stocks is far more complex than it initially seems. As we learned in an earlier two-part blueprint for investing in telecom companies, providers of wireless and landline services operate in a multifaceted, highly regulated industry. If you really want to gain an in-depth sense of the industry, I suggest the above two articles as a great starting place. However, as a quick primer, we'll review three of the most important high-level takeaways that anyone considering buying telecom stocks absolutely must consider. When it comes to winning in the telecom space, history shows time and again that size matters. The telecom industry's massive fixed costs -- and the voluminous cash flows they can eventually produce -- allow the companies with the financial resources to invest in their wireless or wireline infrastructure to maintain their competitive positions. Moreover, closing the gap between market leaders and potential challengers requires massive capital expenditures on the insurgents' parts, which can strain companies' balance sheets along the way. Here's a quick example of how this dynamic plays out among U.S. wireless providers, where AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are the entrenched incumbents, and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) desperately want to steal market share from the former. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash Flow from Operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital Expenditures -$19.2 billion -$17.7 billion -$7.0 billion -$4.7 billion) Free Cash Flow $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending 3/31/16. To me, this is one of the most important charts in explaining the current competitive stance of the U.S. wireless market. Verizon (143 million) and AT&T (133 million) enjoy a roughly 2-to-1 wireless subscriber advantage over T-Mobile (69 million) and Sprint (59 million). As you can see, this larger scale translates into AT&T and Verizon needing to invest a far smaller percentage of their cash from operations into their networks than Sprint or T-Mobile. All of that extra free cash flow gives Verizon and AT&T the ability to invest in opportunities like Verizon's acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!, or AT&T's DIRECTV and Time Warner buyouts. When it comes to the telecom business, it pays to be one of the top dogs over the long term. With well-known names like AT&T and Verizon sporting dividend yields more than double the market average, the telecom industry can be a paradise for income investors. However, chasing yield in this sector can be the siren song of a money-losing investment. Here, a company like rural wireline provider Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) serves as a useful cautionary tale. WIN data by YCharts. In case you've never heard of it, Windstream provides landline telephone, broadband, digital TV, and security services to 1.4 million subscribers across the rural areas of 18 states. Spun out from the now-defunct Alltel in 2006, Windstream's strategy has been to roll up as many rural fiber assets and subscribers as possible to essentially become the biggest fish in an area of the telecom industry that's in structural decline. This ""growth via merger"" model works well on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but it ultimately lies on the losing side of history. The company continues to push forward, recently announcing an all-stock merger with the similar EarthLink. However, with demand for its services declining as our digital world evolves, Windstream's core business strategy appears unsustainable over the long term. What likely first pops out when looking at Windstream is its 8% dividend yield. However, as you saw in the above chart, Windstream's temptingly high dividend yield should more appropriately be viewed as a proxy for its risk. There's a long list to support this truism -- see Alaska Communications Systems or Frontier Communications -- but chasing yield in the telecom space is a quick way for investors to lose their shirts, which segues nicely into the final point on telecom investing. The final telecom investing tip might seem obvious, but given the industry's sneakily diverse mix of companies, investors must understand in detail the business model and strategy of a given company prior to buying. Are they in a growing segment of the industry? Wireless providers and the companies that supply their infrastructure are growing, while older technologies are fading. What does their competitive positioning in that market look like? As we saw with wireless providers, AT&T and Verizon remain far stronger than T-Mobile and Sprint. Despite the wireless space's overall favorable growth characteristics, the benefits of that growth are rarely distributed evenly. At the end of the day, this harkens back to Warren Buffett's concept of a circle of competence. Investors make unintended mistakes when they don't take the time to fully understand any potential investment. The seeming simplicity and sleepiness of the telecom industry can mask the underlying complexity of the sector, much to an investors' detriment. Taking the time to dig into a company's competitive position, its dividend details (if applicable), and its business model and outlook are critical steps that can save investors from making costly missteps or, better still, help identify stocks that can earn investors thousands.

    3 Telecom Investing Tips That Could Earn You Thousands -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image Source: Sprint. About two years ago, Sprint's (NYSE:S) marketing team started breaking out chainsaws and other power tools to promote the wireless carrier's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" offer. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) customers could bring their wireless bills to Sprint, and it would give them a service plan with nearly identical data allotments for half the price they paid at the two larger carriers. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) customers didn't get to join in on the overzealous chainsaw-bill-demolishing fun until last year. But those earliest takers of Sprint's bill-shredding offer are now facing the fact that the promotional pricing is limited to two years. Sprint faces the challenge of moving those customers to its regular pricing without losing them to competitors. Even Sprint knows that pricing is its only differentiating factor. Its newest advertising campaign featuring ""Paul from Verizon"" touts how its network is almost as good as Verizon's and its service costs half the price. When the thousands of Sprint customers who switched over for the Cut Your Bill in Half promotion see their bills increase, they're going to have a hard time rationalizing sticking with Sprint. It will also mark the end of any two-year installment or leasing plans they signed when joining Sprint, providing an optimal time to switch carriers. T-Mobile is trying to move away from being viewed as a low-cost service provider like Sprint to a best-value service provider. It's made a few significant price increases over the last few years with the shift to T-Mobile One -- its unlimited data plan -- being the most noticeable. Still, it's hard to argue that T-Mobile doesn't provide one of the best values in wireless service if it has good coverage in your market. And its coverage is improving significantly with the deployment of its recently acquired 700 MHz spectrum -- which provides better signal strength inside buildings. During T-Mobile's third-quarter earnings call, CEO John Legere noted that it's seeing improved porting ratios with Sprint in the early fourth quarter -- i.e., more Sprint customers are coming to T-Mobile for every customer that's leaving it for Sprint. The other carriers' porting ratios remain stable, indicating the results are largely due to customers leaving Sprint specifically, not anything T-Mobile is doing differently. During the first quarter that Sprint ran its Cut Your Bill in Half promotion, it saw a 20% increase in gross postpaid phone additions year over year. It saw strong double-digit percentage growth in postpaid phone gross additions for the next few quarters, although management would often obscure exact details in their earnings releases. The point is, the promotion worked in that it attracted a lot of new customers to Sprint. The problem currently is that those customers are now about to experience a rate hike -- if they haven't already. BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk expects Sprint's postpaid phone gross additions growth will decline to just 1.7% in the fourth quarter from 18.7% last year. He also sees subscriber churn increasing to 1.53% from 1.37% last quarter. As such, Sprint can expect to see continued declines in average revenue per user and slowing postpaid subscriber growth. The result is a likely return to net revenue declines after just breaking out of a two-year slide last quarter. ","
      
    1 Big Reason Sprint Subscribers Might Start Leaving -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Investors have likely heard a lot about the Internet of Things (IoT). The term refers to the connection of formerly unconnected things to the Internet, so that they can collect data or automate processes. A smartwatch is an IoT device, and so is an Internet-connected tractor that knows how many seeds have been planted, and where. The IoT's broad applications have made it a favorite among some investors, and there are plenty of companies to choose from in the space. But is now a good time to invest? To help answer that question, let's take a look at a few key developments happening in the IoT space right now. Japanese telecom giant SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF) recently purchased the British chipmaker ARM Holdings for nearly $32 billion, mostly based on ARM's position in the IoT. SoftBank's billionaire CEO, Masayoshi Son, had this to say about the importance of IoT in the acquisition: ""First there was the internet, then the mobile internet and next there will be the internet of things, which is going to be the biggest paradigm shift in human history. I'm making this investment at the very beginning of this shift."" SoftBank's purchase of ARM was the company's largest acquisition, the biggest Japanese acquisition in Europe, and one of the largest acquisitions of 2016. The company is betting that ARM's IoT chip designs will be just as popular as ARM's tech has been in smartphones. But SoftBank isn't the only telecom betting on the IoT. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is already making inroads in the IoT space in the U.S. with its Hum automotive telematics service and its upcoming 5G network. The former allows drivers to add an internet-enabled device to their car's onboard diagnostics connection and pair it with an app that tracks how fast the car is going, monitors if it leaves a specified boundary, and provides maintenance reminders. But the real opportunity is in Verizon bringing an IoT-specific network online, to allow the billions future IoT devices to come online. Verizon's vice president of technology planning, Adam Koeppe, said in an interview earlier in 2016 that the ""IoT will be about tens of billions of devices connected to the network. When you think of truly connected societies -- traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters and everything within a city connected and interacting with itself -- that's where 5G comes into play."" The company says that 5G will be the ""foundation for creating more internet-connected devices"" and will bring part of the 5G network online sometime in 2017, with more expansion after that. Companies have been building out IoT platforms for developers for a few years now, but the number of platforms is increasing and their capabilities are expanding. Take Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for example. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been around for a while now, but the company is continually releasing new IoT platforms that help developers connect to it. Amazon's latest IoT platform, called Greengrass, debuted earlier this month and allows developers to set a single hub device to receive data from multiple low-energy devices and transmit the data to the cloud for those devices. All of this allows small IoT devices to conserve energy yet still collect data to be analyzed. That's just one small part of Amazon's broad-based IoT focus, but it's another example of the company building IoT platforms that tie directly into its AWS. That's good news for the company as it expands its AWS revenue, which was $3.2 billion in the third quarter. Amazon isn't the only one going down this path, of course. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has built out several iterations of IoT platforms, and just released its newest one, called Android Things. This version allows developers to build on Android APIs and connect with the company's new Google Assistant. Google has already released several different IoT plaforms (Android@Home and Brillo), but Android Things is already starting to gain traction, with Belkin, WeMo, and Honeywell already signing up. The benefit for Google is the same as with Amazon's IoT platform: If Google can get more developers to use its protocol when building IoT applications, then it might be able to host those devices on its cloud services as well. Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) strong position in the mobile space is undeniable, but as sales of smartphones slow down, even this mobile juggernaut is looking to the IoT for new opportunities. The company made a $37 billion bid for chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) in October and expects the purchase to boost its IoT prospects. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf commented on the acquisition's potential during a conference call: ""Our priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being transformed by mobile technologies. Our proposed acquisition of NXP and our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in these segments."" Qualcomm will use the NXP purchase to enter the growing semi-autonomous car market, while benefiting from NXP's IoT position in the near-field communication and radio-frequency identification spaces as well. Qualcomm says that after the deal closes on NXP, the company will earn about 30% of its total revenue from the Internet of Things and automotive segments, up from about 8% right now. ","
      
    Why 2017 Is the Year to Invest in IoT Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Selena Maranjian,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With fewer and fewer of us able to enjoy traditional pension income, it's more important than ever that we plan for our future financial security and set ourselves up to receive sufficient income when we're no longer working. Here are 10 ways you can boost your retirement income. Image source: Getty Images. You can accumulate a lot of money in tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. Traditional (not Roth) IRAs and 401(k)s receive pre-tax contributions. So, if you have taxable income of $75,000 and you contribute $5,000, you get to subtract that from your taxable income and avoid paying taxes on it now (you will ultimately be taxed on it upon withdrawal in retirement, when your tax rate may be lower). If you're in the 25% tax bracket and contribute $10,000 to these accounts, you'll cut your tax bill by $2,500! Roth varieties of these accounts offer no upfront tax break, but if you follow the rules, you can withdraw from them in retirement tax-free. Here's how much you might be able to accumulate over time: Growing at 8% for $5,000 Invested Annually $10,000 Invested Annually $15,000 Invested Annually 15 years $146,621 $293,243 $439,864 20 years $247,115 $494,229 $741,344 25 years $394,772 $789,544 $1.2 million 30 years $611,729 $1.2 million $1.8 million Calculations by author. A good way to have more income in retirement is to have no mortgage payments due every month. It's smart to pay off your mortgage before retiring, if you can. If you're still some years away from retiring, consider making extra payments in order to reduce your balance. It could even make sense to refinance to a 15-year loan if that will help you pay the house off sooner. Image source: Pixabay. Another option, though one with some significant drawbacks, is a reverse mortgage. With a reverse mortgage, you essentially borrow money based on your home equity and you don't have to pay it back until you die or stop living in your home. It can deliver a welcome income stream -- and a tax-free one at that, generally -- but it can mean your heirs don't get to inherit your home. Learn more about reverse mortgages if you're interested. You have to qualify for one, you may not get as much income as you'd hoped, and you'll face closing costs, but it's still a good solution for some people. Buying an annuity is a lot like buying yourself a pension. Stick with fixed annuities (that pay immediately or later), and think twice about variable or indexed annuities -- as those can have steep fees and restrictive terms and limits on growth. For $200,000, a 70-year-old couple might get an immediate fixed annuity that pays around $1,000 per month for as long as at least one of them is alive. A 70-year-old woman who spends $100,000 may get about $577 per month (that's around $6,900 per year), vs. $641 for a 70-year-old man (about $7,700 per year). Women will usually receive less because they tend to live longer than men. A fixed annuity can provide peace of mind, removing stock market moves and the economy's current condition from your worries. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to your health insurance, spend some time reading up on the topic so you can get the most bang for your buck. Once you're 65, you qualify for Medicare -- and in order to avoid paying a penalty premium every year, you need to not be late signing up. Know that you can choose between original Medicare (Part A and Part B, often with Part D and/or supplemental plans) and Medicare Advantage plans. There are pros and cons to each. For example, original Medicare is accepted across the country by thousands of doctors, whereas Medicare Advantage plans tend to be based in a region, offering access to a certain network of doctors. Medicare Advantage premiums can be lower, plus the plans feature out-of-pocket spending caps. Image source: Getty Images. Investing in stocks and bonds -- and staying invested throughout retirement -- can generate interest and dividend income for you. Remember that even at age 70, you might have another 20 years ahead of you, so it's not crazy to have some of your nest egg in stocks. A $300,000 portfolio of dividend-paying stocks with an average yield of 4% can deliver $12,000 in annual income -- plus the payouts are likely to increase over time as long as the companies remain healthy and growing. Here are some recent yields to give you an idea of what's out there: Stock Recent Dividend Yield AT&T 4.7% Verizon Communications 4.4% General Motors 4.2% Pfizer 3.9% Chevron 3.6% IBM 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Johnson & Johnson 2.8% Microsoft 2.5% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Image source: Getty Images. Another good way to increase your income in retirement is to stay at your job for a few more years than you originally planned. That lets you keep adding to your retirement accounts -- and a fatter nest egg can generate more income. It can also keep you on your employer's health insurance plan a bit longer, possibly saving you some money for a few years, and it delays your starting to withdraw funds from your savings to live off of. If you don't want to keep working full time for a few more years, you might start your retirement by only partially withdrawing from the work force. A part-time job, for example, can keep some money flowing in during your early retirement years, boosting your income. It can also be a good way to transition into full retirement, which can be jarring for some people, with the lack of routines and the big drop-off in socializing. Even working 12 hours per week at $10 per hour can generate $120 per week -- $6,240 per year -- in extra retirement income. There are lots of other ways to boost your retirement income, some of which might not occur to many people. For example, you might rent out a room to a boarder, or just take in occasional guests as an Airbnb host. You might become an online tutor in any subjects you know well, or you might turn a hobby into a profit center, perhaps selling soaps, jewelry, sweaters, or furniture you make. You might move to a smaller, less expensive home, or perhaps even to a less expensive part of the country. If you and your spouse each have a vehicle, consider downsizing to just one, if you can swing it. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, remember that the income many of us are counting on in retirement -- Social Security -- is something you can control, to some degree. The average Social Security retirement benefit was recently $1,350 per month, or about $16,000 per year, with the maximum benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age recently at $2,639 per month -- or about $32,000 annually. You can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you can make some smart moves by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. (For example, you could start collecting the lower-earner's benefits first while letting the higher-earner's benefits grow larger.) Putting just a few of the strategies above into use can significantly boost your retirement income. ","

Sara Sjolin,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 28, 2016 6:24 a.m. ET Benefiting from Trump’s policies is a major theme for next year By Ready to play the new commodity cycle? Or maybe buy into Trump’s defense-spending plans? Or even bet on one of Europe’s most hated airlines? According to a group of top fund managers, those plays are likely to offer you some of the best returns for the next year. Speaking at the Sohn Conference in London earlier in December, 14 fund managers from the U.S. and Europe each unveiled their top investment calls for the next year to a group of around 450 investors. How to benefit from president-elect Donald Trump’s expected fiscal policies was a major topic at the conference, but continued optimism over the commodity sector also featured highly among fund-manager favorites. Here’s a list of some of the most interesting calls from the annual conference: Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC

Croxson points to two key factors behind his Ryanair call: 1) The company’s cost structure is significantly lower than other airlines, including rival easyJet PLC

Ryanair is already Europe’s largest airline with a market share pf around 15%, but with an expanded route network to more popular airports coupled with continued low prices, Croxson expects the airline to control 25% of the European market in coming years.

                                   , Karlsson said. Takata was recently forced to recall millions of air bags after a number of product failures that were linked to deaths and injuries.

See: Lockheed’s stock drops after Trump tweets about ‘out of control’ jet costs What makes Leonardo stand out in the industry, she said, is its rise from the ashes under new CEO Mauro Moretti that has succeeded with a much-needed restructuring program. She estimates the stock has potential to rally to €24.30 in coming years, a more than 80% upside from the €13.49 it currently trades at. “If you’re looking for a deep-value cyclical, which has been penalized for being Italian — although only 15% of its revenue comes from Italy — which benefits from the secular trend of increased spending in defense, which will also benefit from a cyclical upturn in the helicopter market, a fantastic management team and [huge] upside, I suggest you take a look at Leonardo,” she said.

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

(TMUS) and Sprint Corporation (S) may be the third- and fourth-place U.S. wireless carriers, but they are chipping away at the dominance AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), and more of that is expected to come in 2017 whether or not the two ending up merging. Pacific Crest Securities, which recently raised its fourth-quarter subscriber numbers for both T-Mobile and Sprint, expects more market-share gains, pointing to recent promotions and a focus on unlimited data plans as ways to grab business from the likes of AT&T and Verizon. “Unlimited data is what consumers desire. It is becoming a differentiating factor, with Verizon the only carrier not offering unlimited data, and AT&T only offering it in limited fashion,” wrote Pacific Crest analysts Michael Bowen and Brandon Nispel said in a research note published by Barron’s. “Consumers are tired of being hit with overages and fees from using their data plan. Our survey has found a sharp increase in the amount of unlimited data customers, which we expect will continue to trend higher.” Recognizing a movement to unlimited and a frustration with fees, T-Mobile announced during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month that it was getting rid of fees and taxes on its unlimited plans, which will eventually force the other carriers to respond. Sprint had its own news during the annual technology confab, announcing it will let customers put more than one number on a single device and is working with cloud-based platform Movius to provide the service. The wireless carrier also announced a promotion last week in which it will give families up to $800 in gift cards when they switch to a unlimited data, talk and text plan. (See also: Sprint Offers $800 Sign-Up Bonus for Certain Plans.) According to the Pacific Crest Securities analysts, in 2017 the big carriers are going to have a tough time gaining or keeping subscribers with Verizon having a better go of it than AT&T. The analysts said there is a chance Verizon will post a slight upside to its estimates for postpaid-phone net additions in the fourth quarter, but it could still be disappointing to investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is projected to lose 330,000 postpaid phones subscribers. “Net losses at AT&T and the struggles at Verizon indicate T-Mobile and Sprint should take share; 2017 brings a new year, but competition will persist,” said the analysts noting that Sprint should see the most gains while T-Mobile will still be “market share taker” during the year.

Mark Hulbert,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 17, 2017 10:20 a.m. ET Low-volatility shares, such as the six listed here, beat the broader market in the long run By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — The two-plus months since Donald Trump’s election has been exciting for stock market investors. Still, they need to be reminded that boredom has its virtues too. That’s because excitement works both ways: The stocks that perform best when the market is rising tend to fall the most when the market heads south. We tend to forget that after the market has mounted an impressive rally. So, with anxiety about the Trump rally stalling, now is an especially good time to remember that low-volatility stocks are the opposite of exciting: Though they lag behind during rallies, they usually beat the market when it’s falling. They therefore hold their own over an entire market cycle, if not come out well ahead. A column on this subject would not have been necessary as recently as this past summer and fall. That’s because low-volatility approaches at that time were riding a crest of popularity; exchange traded funds that employ such approaches were amassing huge sums. No fewer than six such ETFs, for example, each had over $2 billion in assets under management. The period since the election in early November has taken some of the wind out of those ETFs’ sails. Since Nov. 8, the S&P 500 Index

                                   has gained an impressive 6.3% and the Nasdaq Composite 7.3%. The lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500, in contrast, have gained only 2.8%. Read: How I lost money in the Trump rally Yet this market-lagging performance is precisely what history teaches us would happen, as you can see from the accompanying chart. On average during the last three bull markets (as identified by Ned Davis Research), the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has risen 58.9% versus 71.8% for the S&P 500. It’s during bear markets, of course, that low-volatility approaches tend to shine. On average during the past three bear markets, the S&P Low Volatility Index has fallen 15.2%, compared with 29.5% for the S&P 500. Due to the magic of compounding, these smaller losses more than make up for the market-trailing returns during bull markets. Over the past decade, for example, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has beaten the S&P 500 by an annualized margin of 8.5% to 7% (on a dividend-adjusted basis). Beating the market by 1.5 percentage points a year would be reason enough to consider such stocks. But there’s an added bonus as well: They’re also less volatile. That’s very much a winning combination. To pursue a low-volatility stock strategy, however, you must be willing to give up the potential for some upside excitement. With the market at all-time highs, that’s something you should seriously consider. Think of it this way: A low-volatile-stock strategy, in effect, allows you to take some chips off the table without giving up on the stock market as a whole. Probably the easiest way to pursue such a strategy is via an ETF, since it’s important to be well-diversified. The two largest such ETFs are the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 15, 2017 7:49 a.m. ET Overseas blue-chip dividend stocks are better buys now, says Michael Binger of Gradient Investments By Back in May, Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager with Gradient Investments LLC, told MarketWatch about six of his favorite dividend stocks at that time. Binger’s outlook has changed a bit since then, and he thinks dividend stocks as a group are looking pricey. He’s now looking beyond the U.S. for attractively valued dividend stocks. The change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. Here’s how his “Gradient 50” strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by Orion Advisor Services: In this table, “total return” for the “Gradient 50” strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. Binger said his firm’s clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. As cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends. Gradient Investments is a registered investment adviser based in Arden Hills, Minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. The Gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies Binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark S&P 500

                                   by selecting stocks of what they consider “high quality” U.S. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. They will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market. The aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 2.07%, according to FactSet. Gradient generally selects stocks with yields of at least 2.5% for the Gradient 50 strategy, and the portfolio’s dividend yield now is roughly 3.5%. The 50 stocks held within that portfolio are rebalanced each quarter, so each stock tends to amount to about 2% of the assets. This chart shows how high the S&P 500 is trading relative to the past 12 months’ earnings. By this measure, the index hasn’t traded this high since January 2004: Asked if there were alarming signs for stock valuations, Binger replied: “Sure there are. At the current time, I would say the dividend-paying group, as a whole, is subjectively overvalued. If I have a group of 50 dividend paying stocks and the portfolio was up 20% while the market was up 12% [in 2016], what does that tell you?” This is why Binger said it was a “pefect time” for his firm to roll out a new strategy, which it calls the “Gradient 40 International.” The portfolio includes 40 stocks, and Binger said each “needs to be a blue-chip company domiciled outside the U.S.” They also need to be publicly traded in the U.S., or have American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) traded on U.S. exchanges. Rather than shifting the holdings of the domestic G50 strategy, Binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about U.S. stock valuations reduce exposure to the G50 and consider investing in the G40-I, because he believes “global markets are a little bit cheaper than their U.S. counterparts. Binger named 10 stocks held in the new G40-I portfolio. Here they are, sorted by dividend yield: When MarketWatch spoke with Binger in May, he had just sold the G50’s holdings of AT&T Inc.

That’s a dividend payout ratio of just 38%. “This makes me feel comfortable that the [4.85%] dividend yield isn’t in any danger at all,” Binger said.

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:50 a.m. ET A deep dive yields generous income-producing stocks coupled with some downside protection By Income-hungry investors continue to flock to stocks over bonds, where yields, while rising, remain relatively low. But how to find attractive investments? Last year’s “flight to yield” pushed many stock valuations to relatively high levels, making some dividend stocks appear to be risky short-term investments. For long-term growth investors, there are plenty of solid arguments against dividend stocks, including these from Meb Faber. But dividend stocks still appeal to investors who need income now and to those who think it’s only fair for companies to reward their owners with a good portion of the profits. And if a high dividend-payer’s sales and profits are also increasing, so much the better. Meanwhile, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds range from 75 to 150 basis points over 10-year U.S. Treasury notes

Even at the top range of that range, a yield of 3.90% isn’t very attractive, especially if rates continue to rise, pushing down prices and creating the potential for losses for those who don’t hold bonds to maturity.

This left us with 164 stocks. We then excluded any stock trading above the aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio (based on consensus 2018 earnings estimates) for its sector or for the entire S&P 1500, whichever was lower. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and its 11 sectors: That last cut left us with 50 stocks. Here are the 20 with the highest dividend yields, as of the market close on Jan. 9: This group of dividend stocks is certainly not universally loved by Wall Street analysts, as the following summary shows. Then again, the analysts’ ratings are built on one-year price targets, rather than current income and the hope of long-term capital growth to sweeten the pot. Note that while only three of these stocks have “buy” ratings from 50% of the analysts and just one does better than that, only three are expected by analysts to show price declines over the next 12 months. Those expected price decline, however, are small, and shareholders are being paid to wait through the dividends. No method of screening stocks can save you from doing the important research that will help you form an opinion about a company’s likelihood of long-term success with its business strategy. So that’s your next step, hopefully with the help of your broker or investment adviser, if you seen any names you like here.

Philip van Doorn,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:51 a.m. ET Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings values and high rates of earnings growth By In a recent interview, Erick Ormsby, the founder of Alcosta Capital Management, looked ahead by a year and based several stock picks on companies expected to post double-digit earnings growth in 2018. The companies were also trading at relatively low price-to-forward earnings valuations. So we decided to follow up by applying similar criteria to the entire S&P 500 Index 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    SPX, -0.16% It may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. Banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. So long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations. Don’t miss: Twitter must change course, and this tech executive has some tips The method Beginning with the S&P 500, we isolated companies with forward price-to-earnings ratios for 2018 that were lower than the aggregate P/E ratio for their sector or for the entire index, which ever was lower. The P/E ratios were rounded to the nearest tenth. A positive P/E ratio assumes that a company will be profitable in 2018. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and all of its sectors, except the new real estate sector, which S&P Dow Jones Indices carved out of the financial sector in September, and for which an aggregate price-to-earnings ratio isn’t yet available: The energy sector was trading highest to consensus 2018 earnings estimates at the market close Jan.6. This reflects expectations that oil prices will at least remain stable, and analysts’ expectations that 2018 earnings will still be relatively low. But we’ve made a rather severe cut, only listing energy companies that trade at a discount to the entire S&P 500. We then excluded any company whose revenue is not expected by analysts to increase in 2018 from 2017. Also see: If you bought the Trump rumor, now it’s time to sell the news Here are the three remaining companies in each sector expected to post the greatest increase in earnings per share in 2018, except for the telecommunications sector, which is quite small to begin with, and for which only one company made the cut: Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings ratios and high rates of expected EPS growth. But you must consider why those companies may be deemed undervalued by other investors. If you see any names of interest here, do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or financial adviser. Put simply: You need to form an opinion about how likely a company is to succeed with its business strategy over the next five years at least.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P is traversing its range. The 2,277 resistance matches the December peak and the S&P’s all-time closing high, established Jan. 6. Conversely, the 2,263 area matches a near-term floor, and is followed by firmer support around 2,252. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound. Notable resistance matches the range top, technically spanning from 19,987 to 19,999. The Dow’s record close rests slightly lower, at 19,974.62. Separately, consider that last week’s close of 19,885 matched a near-term inflection point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains stronger. The index has rallied to yet another all-time high, punctuating a successful test of support, better illustrated below. From current levels, the 5,464 breakout point pivots to first support. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended the January rally, rising last week from a successful test of the breakout point. Notable support broadly spans from 5,487 to the December peak of 5,512, an area closely matching the ascending 20-day moving average. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has virtually flatlined just under record territory. Consider that last week’s low of 19,770 held just eight points above the 2016 close. This area remains an inflection point, matching support more broadly spanning from 19,718 to 19,770. Separately, the Dow’s tight five-week range is a continuation pattern, currently capped by the 20,000 mark. Similarly, the S&P 500 has maintained first support — the 2,252 area — bottoming last week at 2,254. More broadly, the S&P’s recent backdrop resembles the late-July/August post-Brexit price action. Its formerly overbought posture is working off via time, rather than price. (The S&P has flatlined, without pulling in materially.) As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend is intact. The Nasdaq Composite has notched another all-time high — confirming its uptrend — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials remain range-bound, but firmly within view of record territory. In fact, the S&P mised an all-time closing high last week by less than three points. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, it’s maintained support matching the 2016 close (134.85), surviving a strong-volume retest last week. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains slightly stronger. Consider that the MDY has maintained a posture firmly atop first support, closing last week within striking distance of record territory. Resistance technically spans from 309.09 to 309.59. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500

                                   has also flatlined just under record highs. Recall that last week’s low of 224.96 closely matched first support around the 225 mark. The successful retest, amid the orderly January range, is technically constructive. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained first support at 2,252, bottoming last week two points higher. The rally from support marked a bullish single-day reversal, and was punctuated by last week’s close, missing a record by less than three points. From current levels, the S&P’s all-time closing high rests at 2,276.98 — and remains within view — while the absolute record peak holds at 2,282.10. Both levels were established Jan. 6. The S&P 500’s persistence near the range top signals muted selling pressure, improving the chances of an eventual leg higher. More broadly, significant support spans from 2,190 to 2,214, an area matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,222. The S&P’s intermediate-term backdrop supports a bullish view barring a violation.

                                   remains well positioned. Technically, the shares continue to challenge two inflection points. With Tuesday’s strong start, the shares have gapped atop the breakdown point — the 115 area — though, as always, it’s the close that matters. A close higher would neutralize the November breakdown, more firmly signaling a trend shift. Meanwhile, the GLD’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered another six-month high, improving the chances of incremental follow-through. Tactically, the 50-day offers an area from which to work, and a rally attempt is in play barring a violation. An intermediate-term target matches trendline resistance, and the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Conversely, the U.S. dollar — also detailed last week — has extended its downturn amid gold’s resurgence, and a related safe-haven trade. (As always, gold and the U.S. dollar are inversely correlated.)

A sustained break higher opens the path to major resistance, circa 104.90, an area matching the bottom of the November gap.
