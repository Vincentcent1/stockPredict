(MSFT) and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG) Google chipping away at Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN) dominance in the cloud computing market, the second- and third-place players are in a race to create the smartest possible cloud offering by using advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. Take Google: At the company’s annual developers' conference this spring, it unveiled the latest iteration of its tensor processing chips, which were developed for machine learning technologies and are making their way into the Google cloud, reported Forbes. The chips can provide more than 180 teraflops of processing power and, according to Forbes, are a dozen or more times more powerful than other chips on the market for cloud computing. It can also enable machine learning that will make it easier for customers to do all sorts of things on the cloud. Meanwhile, Forbes reported that Microsoft already has 20 different intelligent services built into its Azure cloud offering such as image recognition and the ability to comprehend languages. It also recently launched Project Brainwave, which uses a series of chipsets to enable real-time AI in its data centers, noted Forbes. The idea behind Project Brainwave is to get machine learning applications to run more efficiently. (See also: Amazon Among First With Cloud Service AI.) The move on the part of the two companies comes as they are making inroads against Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the marketplace. In June, Pacific Crest Securities predicted Microsoft will surpass Amazon to become the leading cloud service provider, with it having more revenue from that business in the second quarter than its first-place rival. Analyst Brent Bracelin said Microsoft becoming the biggest cloud provider for the first time in 10 years would transition the company from a “cloud laggard to a cloud leader.” By incorporating more advanced technologies into the offering, both the Redmond, Wash., software giant and Google are hoping they can lure even more customers their way. Still, Amazon doesn’t see itself as a laggard when it comes to AI in the cloud. In a recent interview with Barron’s, Matt Wood, general manager for deep learning and AI at AWS, said the company's cloud division has more machine learning running on its platform than any other company. (See also: What Is Amazon Web Services and Why Is It So Successful?) While it is difficult to independently evaluate Wood's claim, it may not be entirely without substance. AI is a collection of technologies that enables machines to mimic human intelligence capabilities. However, machines require troves of data to learn from human actions. As the largest e-commerce​ player, Amazon already has massive amounts of data about its customers' habits and preferences. In addition, its AWS cloud division hosts data for clients from multiple different industries. ",Microsoft Vs. Google: Who's Got the Smartest Cloud? | Investopedia
Donna Fuscaldo,09142017,Investopedia,09072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is talking mergers and acquisitions, which had the effect of boosting shares of Snap Inc. (SNAP), the beleaguered social media company. During the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Media Communications Conference in New York this week, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told investors and analysts that its recent M&A activity will continue as the company aims to enhance its digital presence and take on the competition, which increasingly includes the likes of Facebook Inc. (FB) and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG) Google. Those comments sparked speculation with some investors betting one of the targets will be the maker of the disappearing-message app Snapchat, reported Markets Insider. Shares of Snap ended Thursday’s trading session up 10% and was recently trading an additional 2.4% higher to $15.52. The stock is still under its initial public offering price of $17 a share from back in March. (See also: Snap Founders Lose Net Worth on Stock Decline.) For months now, some on Wall Street have been calling on the Burbank, Calif.-based entertainment company to engage in some game-changing buys. In May, longtime Disney analyst Richard Greenfield argued management at the company should be using its strong balance sheet and free cash flow to “strategically reposition” it for future growth. In order to do that, he thinks the company should stop repurchasing shares and instead use the money for acquisitions. “Buying back stock appears to be a very short-term decision that shows management’s lack of urgency to reposition Disney,” wrote BTIG media and tech analyst Greenfield at the time. (See also: Disney Should Buy Twitter or Spotify: BTIG) “Given the strength of Disney’s earnings and free cash flow, especially if buybacks​ stopped, we believe they have tremendous firepower to make a series of acquisitions over the coming 12-24 months.” Back then, the analyst pointed to micro blogging website operator Twitter Inc. (TWTR) as a target. Snap and Twitter share similar characteristics that could make the latter attractive to Disney. Both have stocks that are under pressure, with Snap at historic lows, and while they aren’t making money, they have huge user bases that Disney can tap to offer them a suite of products, services and content. And it's not like others haven’t been interested in the maker of Snapchat. In August, Business Insider reported that Google bid at least $30 billion in 2016 for the company. The offer, which was rejected by Snap, remained on the table after it went public. It’s not clear if Google is still interested in acquiring the company. Facebook also made an offer for Snap a few years ago, and that, too, was rejected. (See also: Snap Turned Down a $30B Offer From Google: Report.)

Mark Kolakowski,09142017,Investopedia,09072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Global stock indexes in the U.S., Asia and Europe are poised to rise more in the coming months due to several promising trends, according to a report in Bloomberg. Four big reasons are: reflation in China, rising commodities prices, loose liquidity and subsiding investor fears. Forecasts of annualized real GDP growth for 2017 and 2018 are, per the OECD: the U.S., 2.1% and 2.4%; China, 6.6% and 6.4%; Germany, 2.0% and 2.0%; France, 1.3% and 1.5%; the U.K., 1.6% and 1.0%; Japan, 1.4% and 1.0%; the OECD total, 2.1% and 2.1%. First, producer prices are increasing in China, and this normally is a harbinger of stronger economic conditions in Europe and the U.S., Bloomberg says. This, in turn, should add impetus to the global rally. Second, the prices of key commodities such as oil, iron ore and copper have risen by 20% or more since their second quarter lows. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) cited by Bloomberg take this as a bullish indicator for the global economy as a whole, and for energy and materials companies in particular. Moreover, if commodities prices stabilize at current levels, companies in the U.S. and Europe may see sales increase by about 5% in the third quarter, versus the same period in 2016, also according to JPMorgan, as reported by Bloomberg. Source: Bloomberg Third, loose liquidity conditions are bolstering global growth. Persistent low interest rates, and a relatively flat yield curve, are encouraging investors in the $14.1 trillion market for U.S. Treasury securities, are compelling investors to seek riskier assets, such as junk bonds and emerging market debt. The weak U.S. dollar, Bloomberg indicates, is one manifestation of these loose credit conditions. The weak dollar, meanwhile, boosts the value of overseas profits earned by U.S. corporations, as the Wall Street Journal points out. (For more, see also: Global Trade Outlook Clouded by Policy Uncertainty.) Fourth, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have passed, and while they proved to be destructive, they now longer represent fears of the unknown. Additionally, worries about military threats from North Korea seem to be diminishing, Bloomberg adds. (For more, see also: How Stocks, Economy Will Suffer From Irma, Harvey.) The S&P Index (SPX) is up 11.5% for the year-to-date through September 12, and up 2.8% since the close on June 12.

He and his clients own shares of VZ and NFLX.) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) may have a strategic interest in acquiring Netflix Inc. (NFLX), and the window of opportunity could be closing. T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) made a smart move by offering free Netflix services on its T-Mobile One family plans. It is a clever move, and one that could help lure subscribers away from Verizon and AT&T Inc. (T). But in AT&T's corner is the pending Time Warner deal, which could Verizon left behind. (See also: Time Warner CEO: AT&T Deal Was About Competing With Facebook, Google.) If Verizon bought Netflix, it would be able to solve a number of its long-term legacy issues, revive growth, and bring in content, thereby positioning itself as a leader in content delivery. Verizon shares have struggled over the past three years, falling by nearly 3 percent, while the S&P 500 has gained nearly 26 percent. And T-Mobile surging by nearly 102 percent. A Verizon/Netflix deal could revive the missing growth component and bolster Verizon's struggling stock. VZ data by YCharts The recent T-Mobile announcement shows why Verizon needs to act fast in its content acquisition quest and why it could be strategically important. It would establish Verizon as a major player in content creation and content delivery. Should Verizon attempt to acquire Netflix, it would bring much-needed content to its existing portfolio while working Netflix into a bundle package offering the service to its wireless and FiOS subscribers. The potential acquisition could also help to revive top-line revenue growth that has slipped away from Verizon in recent years. Indirectly, it would also allow Verizon to get in front of T-Mobile customers since T-Mobile users would now also be using Netflix. According to the website Statisa, by the year 2020, there will be nearly 180 million users in the U.S. using their phones to watch video content. Moreover, Statisa estimates there will be approximately 124.2 million users in the U.S. watching video from their tablets. The opportunities in video via a device has a clear growth trajectory, and Verizon would be able to offer a service plan with Netflix as part of the bundle for its wireless and FiOS customers. Statista also estimates that smartphone video penetration is expected to reach 74 percent by the year 2020. The trend toward watching video and content on a streaming device is heating up. 5G also holds promise to help push video viewership higher, because of the increased speed the next generation of wireless technology is set to offer. With a market cap of roughly $80 billion and an enterprise value of nearly $82 billion, Netflix would not be a cheap acquisition for Verizon. Verizon already has long-term debt of nearly $120 billion, but with a market cap of $193 billion, Verizon could use its equity as currency and do a cash-and-equity deal for Netflix, giving investors Verizon stock and cash in exchange for Netflix. Verizon would likely to have issue debt to get the cash component because currently its cash, short- and long-term investments only amount to $5.5 billion. VZ Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts Strategically, a move by Verizon to acquire Netflix would solve a lot of problems for Verizon. First, it would address the company's growth issues, with revenue that has been struggling to grow on a year-over-year basis for many years. Second, it would solve Verizon's race to acquire content, where it has been slowly falling behind AT&T. Finally, it could potentially bring more subscribers to Verizon, and give it an international footprint. Such a deal would be a big move for Verizon to make, but it would solve many of its legacy growth problems. It would also elevate Verizon into another arena, and would really stick it to T-Mobile.

Currently, Amazon offers a card that is co-branded with JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and offers another two cards that are issued by Synchrony Bank. Further, the online retail giant gives customers the ability to make payments through their bank accounts, the Barron's article noted. Following its purchase of Whole Foods, Amazon could potentially use its new chain of stores to promote these payment methods, a development that could potentially eat into Mastercard's share of the market. The authors of the Barron's article noted that during its second quarter earnings call, Mastercard left its 2017 non-GAAP guidance—which predicted expenses growing faster that revenue—unchanged.

Aaron Hankin,09142017,Investopedia,09072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The race to be the first $1 trillion company has Apple Inc. (AAPL) as heavy favorite. With a current market cap of $834 billion, and nearly $200 billion more valuable than second place Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), parent company of Google, it's hard to see anyone catching the California-based tech giant. However, Stamford-based MKM Partners believes if Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is willing to continue its spending spree and take on more risk it has the potential to grow to astronomical levels. ""Our detailed scenario analysis implies that AMZN could exceed a $1.6 trillion valuation over the next 7-8 years,"" Rob Sanderson of MKM said in a note to clients. MKM has a price target of $1275 for Amazon, which is at the higher end of the $1155 average price target of 37 analysts, according to FactSet data. That is a 17 percent increase from the September 12 closing price of $982 a share. A bold call, yes. But maybe not a bad one. Amazon has been on a tear of late, and the Jeff Bezos train is showing no signs of slowing down. Year-to-date shares of Amazon are higher by 28.8 percent, and after a string of new ventures and acquisitions, the question is: what can stop Amazon? The first hiccup could come with an overall market correction or sustained sell-off. As equity markets continue to make all-time highs, this seems unlikely, but the number of skeptics is growing. Citing geopolitical tension, the failing Trump trade, or a pure valuation argument, the cases run from a 10 percent correction to a 20 percent bear market. John P. Hussman argues the S&P 500 could fall 60 percent in the coming years. (See also: S&P 500 Could Fall 60%: Hussman.) Could Amazon be broken up for fear of anti-competitive behavior soon after it reaches $1 trillion in market cap? NYU Professor Scott Galloway who correctly predicted Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, recently laid out why he believes Amazon will be the first trillion dollar company. He notes that through a growing streaming business, and its dominance in cloud services, Amazon is positioned to be the biggest company in the world. ""By 2020 Amazon will be our first trillion dollar market cap company,"" Galloway said. But this is where it ends Galloway says; officials will come down on the e-commerce giant when they realize Amazon is ""destroying jobs faster than we can recreate them."" All that being said, government intervention is unlikely, but if any company is on the public sector's radar, it's Amazon. Finally, while Amazon is stepping all over its competitors, it may have to look in its rearview mirror in the coming years. China's e-commerce giant Alibaba, often referred to as the ""Amazon of China,"" has yet to push its services into the U.S. market. While there are hurdles, both logistically and politically, a move into the U.S. by the Jack Ma led conglomerate will no doubt give Amazon a reason to think twice. (See also: Alibaba Makes Inroads Into Mexico.) Firstly the math. With a current market cap just under $500 billion and 480 million in outstanding shares, all things being the same, Amazon's share price would need to trade above $3300 a share. However, share buybacks, acquisitions, stock splits and much more dictate that the valuation won't be that simple. The question is, what does Amazon have to do to get to $1.6 trillion, or even $1 trillion. In addition to its streaming and cloud services growth, Galloway believes that Amazon will eventually take over Apple as the leader in the hardware industry, saying the Amazon Alexa was the most innovative product of 2016-2017, beating out the Apple Watch. In addition, the market could be under estimating the importance of Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. As the biggest consumer sector, Amazon's seamless entry into grocery, coupled with its established brand, customer base, and storage facilities makes it a natural leader of the sector's tech disruption. In fact, the results are already showing. In early September, just months after the acquisition, Whole Foods slashed prices, which saw customer traffic rise by 25 percent, according to Foursquare Labs. The price cuts were predominantly in the organic produce sector, which is often criticized as being over-priced. All this being said, the meteoric rise of Amazon is one of the great 21st-century success stories. But even as it continues to step all over competing industries it is going to take more than a couple of acquisitions and a continuing stock market rally to push it above the $1 trillion mark, let alone be the first there. And if Amazon does reach $1 trillion, Jeff Bezos will no doubt stand alone at the top of the world's rich list.  ",How Amazon Will Be Worth $1.6 Trillion in Less Than a Decade | Investopedia
Robert Milburn,09142017,Investopedia,09072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs [OPINION: The views expressed by Investopedia columnists are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the website.] In a battle between the world’s brightest investors, the big Tech behemoths have captured both love and disdain. How could they not? With companies like Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG) – the FANG stocks – trouncing the S&P 500 in 2017, it’s no surprise industry titans like Jeff Gundlach say it’s all a bubble. We don’t think it’s a bubble. Throughout 2017, we’ve recommended investors buy every dip in the Tech (XLK). It’s been a winning strategy as the ETF is up almost 22% year-to-date. Our study of market history suggests that the current market environment is best aligned for tech’s continual outperformance (more on that below). But with the sector’s trailing 12 month price-to-earnings at 24 times, surely a bit of caution is in order. Well, sort of. It’s a common misconception that tech stock valuations are expensive. The chart below graphs the S&P 500 tech sub-sector’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio over the last 30 years. As you can see, the black line (current tech valuation relative to the S&P 500) is below the green line (the 30-year average of tech’s relative valuation). Based on market history, tech shares are the third cheapest S&P 500 sub-sector among the ten other sub-sectors. Tech trails only healthcare and telecom in terms of relative cheapness and only in the 64th percentile of all readings over the last 30 years. This compares to extremely expensive energy shares (in the 96th percentile of all readings over the last three decades) despite the sector’s -13.6% year-to-date tumble! (See also: Valuation is not a Catalyst!) History suggests that U.S. growth and inflation are the most causal factors for modelling future market returns. That’s a simple two-factor framework that gets you four possible outcomes. Each outcome is assigned a “quadrant” in our Growth, Inflation, Policy (GIP) model: Our GIP model currently suggests we’re in QUAD 1 (growth accelerating, inflation slowing) and should remain there through the first quarter of 2018. Historically, this has been the best environment for domestic equities (particularly tech). The top-performing S&P 500 sectors in QUAD 1 are Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY). Over the past 20 years of quarterly observations, consumer discretionary and tech have positive expected values of +4.4% and +4%, respectively, in Quad 1. To be clear, we were definitely less bullish on the NASDAQ at July’s all-time highs and are less excited about tech today. In addition to modeling the U.S. economy, we use a quantitative model which suggests immediate-term risk ranges for any asset class by measuring its price, volume and volatility. At its most basic level, it indicates where investors should buy low and sell high. The NASDAQ is currently in a bullish trend, but at the top end of our risk ranges it’s wise to sell some. As we said back in July, the all-time highs for tech stocks were probably a good spot to book some gains. In other words, our model, which dynamically adjusts throughout the day, suggests there is currently -2.0% downside and less than 0.6% upside. Not exactly the best risk-reward set-up, especially with the index within spitting distance (0.4% to be exact) of July’s all-time highs. Simply put, if you’re looking for an entry point, wait for the low end of the range to buy tech. Summing it all up, tech shares are not expensive based on an appraisal of market history. In fact, the current market environment (U.S. growth ↑, inflation ↓ … remember: Quad 1) has historically been the best time to own tech shares. But be careful. Entry points matter.

For investors looking for exposure to the tech sector but weary that all of the smart money and some have already piled into the FAANGs—Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google’s parent company Alphabet—ASML Holding (ASML), a Dutch chip-making equipment provider, and SAP (SAP), the German software giant, both look promising, according to Barron’s. (To read more, see: FANG Stocks’ Downside Risk Jumps as Tech Bets Rise.) Benjamin Segal, portfolio manager for the Neuberger Berman International Equity fund, in discussing European tech companies on par with America’s FAANGs, told Barron’s that both ASML and SAP are “are pacesetters with room to run.” Two European chipmakers, Austria’s AMS and Switzerland’s STMicroelectronics (STM), are also well positioned as the rising trend of the Internet of Things will support the demand for microchips for the foreseeable future. While there are some other big European tech names like Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s LM Ericsson, Segal argues that both these companies are large suppliers to the telecom industry and that industry has not been inclined to spend big recently. These companies also face more intense competition from Chinese rivals, which have strong backing from the Chinese government and face lower costs of capital. One of the factors making ASML stand out is its innovative extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology that could allow the company to offer chip-making equipment that produces microchips that are both faster and cheaper than the technology currently in use. Of course, the Dutch chip producer is also riding the whole Internet of Things trend mentioned earlier. ASML shares have already seen a year to date gain of 40% and are trading around 26 times the company’s forecasted forward-year earnings. Yet despite the seemingly high price, Segal argues that the company has yet to ramp-up deliver for its EUV systems. When that happens, earnings will start catching up with the price. The appeal of SAP, according to Segal, is the range of its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and the fact that it has joined the cloud, making it easier for smaller companies to use its products. These factors are helping SAP to expand its market share in a market that is itself, growing. (To read more, see: Enterprise Resource Planning.) While SAP shares are trading at 20 times forecasted forward-year earnings, above rival Oracle’s price to earnings (P/E) ratio, Segal argues that it is a “more than reasonable” valuation considering the business is one that is “growing organically and sustainably at close to 10% in a low-growth world.” The company’s profit margins are still expected to pick up. If that does not happen then one should start to worry. ",Europe's Techs Poised to De-FAANG U.S. Tech Stocks | Investopedia

(NVDA) have been selling stock over the last three months raising the question, is insider selling a bad sign for investors? Nvidia, which primarily designs graphic processing units for the gaming industry has been one of the hot stocks of 2017, rising by 55 percent since January. In June, Nvidia Director Robert Burgess sold 50,000 shares at an average price of $158.08, for a total value of $7.9 million, according to a SEC filing. More recently, Director A Brooke Seawell sold 30,000 shares at an average share price of $170.19, a total value of just over $5 million. Burgess and Seawell now own a combined total of 30,857 shares.

According to FactSet data, insiders make up 4.86 percent of company ownership, which has been on the decline in recent months. The string of insider selling is following an overall trend of outflows. On Thursday, the company recorded net outflows of $39.78 million according to online publication Dispatch Tribunal. (See also: How Broadcom Will Beat Nvidia.) For stock owners, news that insiders are selling can be frightening. Why are they selling? What do they know? In 2010, holders of the second biggest company in the U.S., Google Inc.

(See also: How To Sell Stock In Your Company) Situations where investors should not be alarmed are when insiders announce they plan to sell a number of shares over a longer period, such as the Page and Brin example. In addition, if the stock has had a significant rally an inside investor may think it's prudent to take some profit. Finally, if it is just one insider that is selling, investors should not be too concerned. (See also: Insider Selling Isn't Always A Bad Sign) On the contrary, if multiple insiders are selling stock at the same it may be a sign that they know something. Additionally, if owners have a history of selling before the stock falls it may also be a red flag. While owning shares in a company where insiders are selling their stake may put investors in a precarious position, in general, this is not a time to panic.

The report claims that the deal could be closed by the end of the year. However, I think investors should take this rumor with a grain of salt since it doesn't make much sense after Google's disastrous acquisition of Motorola's handset business. HTC's U11 flagship phone. Source: HTC. Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2012. At the time, Motorola faced the same problem as HTC today -- its brand was fading amid tough competition from other Android OEMs and Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone. Google claimed that it was more interested in Motorola's patents, but those patents proved weak after they failed to block U.S. sales of iPhones. Google kept selling Motorola handsets -- losing hundreds of millions per quarter in the process -- until it finally gave up and sold the unit to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion in 2014. After that painful lesson, Google decided to license its designs and brands (like Nexus and Pixel) to OEMs, which would handle the manufacturing. That low-risk approach worked out fairly well, giving Google flagship devices which showcase the latest versions of Android without third-party skins. Abruptly deciding to buy HTC's handset business would clearly contradict that strategy. There might be some logic to the idea. First, HTC has a market cap of just 54 billion NTD ($1.8 billion), and it's likely eager to sell its core business after the stock's 75% decline over the past five years. Google had a free cash flow of $25.2 billion over the past 12 months, so the acquisition would be a small one. Google's Pixel phone. Source: Google. HTC already manufactures Google's Pixel and Pixel 2 devices. Buying the handset unit would allow Google to control both the software and hardware for its flagship devices, ensuring that Pixel owners experience the newest Android features as intended. It could also complement Google's in-house chip design efforts -- which could eventually mirror Apple's A series chips, Huawei's Kirin chips, and Samsung's Exynos chips. Buying HTC might also bolster Google's renewed Android One push, which consists of lower-end devices that meet Google's hardware specifications and run stock Android. That initiative got off to a slow start, but Google recently introduced a new Android One device with Xiaomi, the Mi A1, and plans to launch additional devices with Lenovo's Motorola division. Therefore, Google could buy HTC to launch other Android One phones. Unfortunately, those ideas would only make sense if HTC's handset business were stable. Its share of the global smartphone market dropped from about 11% in 2011 to less than 1% today. It recently reported a 54% year-over-year drop in revenues in August, marking its lowest monthly revenue in nearly 13 years. HTC's bottom line remains deep in the red, and analysts don't see it returning to profitability anytime soon. Sales of its latest high-end device, the U11, reportedly peaked in July and could be crushed by newer devices like Samsung's Note 8 and Apple's new iPhones. As for the Pixel partnership, it's arguably one of HTC's last lifeboats. This gives Google tremendous leverage in negotiating favorable rates -- so it seems unnecessary for Google to acquire the entire business and shoulder the overhead costs. Therefore, these recent rumors about Google could also fizzle out, leaving HTC stuck in a downward spiral. If that happens, Google investors should breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that they dodged another Motorola-like bullet. ","
      
    After the Moto Mess, Why Would Google Buy HTC? -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google recently unveiled new augmented reality (AR) software kits to help developers create better AR apps. Apple's play is ARKit, which will launch with iOS 11 later this month. Google's play is ARCore, which will initially launch on the Pixel and Galaxy S8 devices running on Android 7.0 and above. ARCore will also replace the older Tango AR platform, which was introduced three years ago. Source: Getty Images. These moves indicate that Apple and Google are eager to follow Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) move into the desktop AR space with HoloLens, which hasn't been commercially launched yet. As for the mobile AR market, which company is better equipped to build a bigger ecosystem -- Apple or Google? Microsoft's HoloLens. Source: Microsoft. The magic of AR is created by motion sensors, which detect a user's movements, and computer vision chips and 3D cameras, which ""see"" surfaces in three dimensions. Developers create software that places objects onto those surfaces, which ""augments"" their reality. The AR market is generally considered to be a bigger growth market than virtual reality (VR) since AR apps have more real-world applications than VR software, which obstructs a user's vision and is mostly geared toward gaming and entertainment. Digi-Capital estimates that the AR market will be worth $83 billion by 2021, compared to a $25 billion value for the VR market. Google spotted the potential of AR years ago. That's why it launched the Google Glass in 2013. Unfortunately, the device's awkward appearance and privacy concerns resulted in its discontinuation in 2015. However, Google recently reintroduced a new version for enterprise users. Source: Google. Google also bought a stake in Taiwanese chipmaker Himax (NASDAQ:HIMX), which supplies the LCOS (liquid crystal on display) chips that power Google Glass. It invested in Magic Leap, a secretive maker of AR headsets, but the start-up reportedly lags far behind Microsoft in AR technologies. Google dabbled with Project Tango, but the framework only made it to two unpopular phones -- Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro and Asus' Zenfone AR. Therefore, ARCore is widely seen as Google's attempt to reset and refocus its AR efforts on high-end devices like the Pixel and S8. This means that lower-end and mid-range Android phones will likely remain out of the loop at first, similar to the way Google Daydream only brought VR features to premium devices. Apple's next iPhone will reportedly sport a depth-sensing camera and a 3D-sensing computer vision chip. Over the past two years, Apple acquired a number of AR/VR firms, including Metaio, Faceshift, Emotient, Flyby Media, and computer vision firm SensoMotoric Instruments. It filed mysterious patents that illustrate an AR headset for the iPhone, assembled a ""secret"" AR/VR team, and hired Virginia Tech professor Doug Bowman, one of the top VR experts in the country, to lead those efforts. All these moves, along with the recent introduction of ARKit, indicate that Apple could introduce an AR headset with the iPhone 8 (or next year's iPhone), which will become the company's answer to HoloLens. CEO Tim Cook has declared that the AR market is ""big and profound"", so making it easier for developers to create depth-sensing AR apps for iOS 11 could truly represent a huge leap forward for mobile apps. It's too early to predict a victor in the upcoming mobile AR fight, but I believe that Apple has an early advantage with its unified hardware and OS. Apple has much less trouble than Google in keeping its users on the same page, which makes it easier to introduce new technologies like the Apple Watch, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and AR apps. Google will likely struggle with fragmentation, since just 13.5% of all Android devices have been upgraded to Android 7.0 and 7.1. So even though Android controls a much larger percentage of smartphones than iOS, the initial versions of ARCore and ARKit might actually reach a comparable number of devices. Early developers would likely favor ARKit over ARCore because they would only need to test their apps for the latest iPhones instead of several premium Android devices with different hardware configurations. As a result, popular AR apps might appear first on iOS before being ported to Android -- which is precisely what happened in the earlier days of smartphone apps. ","
      
    Apple vs. Google: Who Will Win the Mobile AR Wars? -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands unequivocally as one of the most successful tech companies of all-time. The business formerly known as Google rose from a two-person start-up operating out of a friend's garage to become one of the largest companies in the world, and it has been one of the best growth stocks to own since its 2004 IPO. GOOGL data by YCharts Today though, a small subset of analysts and tech industry experts sees increased risks facing Alphabet shares. To be clear, this is a minority opinion: 38 of the 45 analysts  covering the company rate it a buy or a strong buy. Now, it does pay to understand all aspects of an investment thesis before buying. But while one can find some valid negatives about it, my advice it to ignore these two specific reasons to sell Alphabet stock. Stocks, particularly large cap stocks like Alphabet, are upgraded and downgraded frequently, and for a whole host of reasons. Let's take as an example the downgrade of Alphabet stock from earlier this summer by boutique bank Cannacord Genuity. In the downgrade note he released in mid-June, Cannacord analyst Michael Graham voiced concerns over Alphabet's ability to continue to grow its advertising revenues in line with their historic rates. By his reckoning, Alphabet cannot continue to increase its per-ad rates, so it will need to find new sources of ""ad inventory"" -- industry parlance for places to show ads. He also noted that some investors had shown concerns over the valuation of so-called FANG stocks , an acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet). This could be the case, but it also overlooks the broader fundamentals. Good things take time. In any given year, there have been plenty of reasons to avoid owning stock in companies like Amazon, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and countless other examples. However, focusing on near-term headwinds obscures the broader narratives that have made these companies some of the best-performing stocks over the long term. And focusing on short-term analyst downgrades is a great way to miss the forest for the trees, much to your portfolio's detriment. Image Source: Alphabet Maintaining success is a challenge in any business, but it's especially difficult to stay at the top of the food chain in the tech industry, where the pace of innovation has only accelerated in recent years.  To hold onto its position, Alphabet will need to be both a powerful incumbent and an agile innovator, a difficult and sometimes contradictory pair of tasks. The company's co-founders reorganized Google into  Alphabet in 2015  to help manage those two inherently conflicting agendas. In effect, Alphabet's Google division -- run by Sundar Pinchai -- serves as the cash cow that supports and funds Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" segment, which consists of a series of ambitious start-ups management hopes will grow into game changers in their own right over time. Such generational changes can be a double-edged sword, and that's certainly the case when it comes to Alphabet's personality shift from quirky upstart to global power. However, the fact that Alphabet is being managed more professionally doesn't mean it has lost (or will lose) either its innovative spirit or its ability to attract top talent. The company remains a staple on annual ""best places to work"" lists.  It also offers its employees the opportunity to work on some of the most popular tech products in the world, as well as the chance to invent entirely new technologies. No company is perfect, but Alphabet's track record a publicly traded operation is darn close. So while minor reasons to sell will always exist for even the best companies, long-term tech investors will be better served by remaining on focused on the big-picture narrative for Alphabet.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage these days. The headlines are ripe with stories of self-driving cars, virtual assistants, smart speakers, and the revolution begun by deep learning, all of which have their foundations in AI. Companies are awakening to the transformative power of the technology and are seeking new and innovative ways to use it to gain competitive business advantages. One such area is in the realm of digital advertising, where even the slightest incremental increases in accuracy or efficiency can result in additional revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Numerous companies are enlisting AI and its ability to process reams of data in order to draw conclusions not apparent to its human counterparts. Recent scientific research papers published by Google, a division of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reveal that these technology companies are keenly aware of the profit potential, and are looking to capitalize on it in a big way. Small gains in the accuracy of digital advertising can produce big gains. Image source: Getty Images. Digital advertising is on course to eclipse television ads this year for the first time in history, and the online realm is an area of intense competition. Advertising dollars are being divided up by an ever-smaller pool of competitors, and those that most accurately connect consumers with the appropriate ads dominate the market. Google and Facebook already form a virtual duopoly that controls the majority of new online advertising. Some estimates conclude that the two tech titans accounted for 89% of online ad growth in 2016, and captured 77% of all digital ad spending. Microsoft doesn't report its ad revenue seperately, but has cited strong growth in ad revenue for its Bing search and increasing average-revenue-per-search going back five quarters. Each of these players is looking to AI to provide an edge. Engineers at Google published a research paper detailing an AI system designed to more accurately predict the click-through rate, noting that only ""a small improvement"" could produce substantial revenue gains when working with a large user base. The paper revealed that a newly developed system produced significant improvement and beat previous systems ""by a large amount."" A team of from Microsoft investigating advertising applications stated that ""even a 0.1 percent accuracy improvement in our production would yield hundreds of millions of dollars in additional earnings,"" and claimed to have achieved a 0.9% increase by one measure. Facebook researchers detailed their attempts to improve click prediction, and developed a combined model capable of ""outperforming either of these [previous] methods on its own by over 3%. This improvement has significant impact to the overall system performance."" Advertising revenue plays a significant role in the financial success of these companies. Advertising revenue accounted for 98% of Facebook's revenue, while Google's ad revenue contributed of 87% of parent Alphabet's top line. The findings of these research papers offer insight into how these companies are applying artificial intelligence to the challenges of digital advertising. Even incremental improvements can move the needle in a big way, resulting in ""hundreds of millions of dollars in additional earnings."" ","
      
    3 Tech Giants Using AI to Increase Ad Revenue -- The Motley Fool

"Steve Symington, Timothy Green, and Anders Bylund",09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With shares of Google -- or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), rather, following its restructuring in late 2015 -- up more than 1,600% since its initial public offering just over 13 years ago, there's no denying the internet search giant has delivered incredible gains for patient investors. And that shouldn't be a big surprise considering that earlier this year, Gmail became Google's seventh product to hit one billion active users, joining Google Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, Google Play, and YouTube. That's not to mention the promise of Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car initiative, or its ""Other Bets"" segment housing multiple high-potential businesses that are still mostly in their pre-revenue stages. But this also raises the question: Where can we find stocks today that offer similar return potential? We asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a stock they believe fits that mold. Read on to learn why they chose Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) (NASDAQ:Z), NeoPhotonics (NYSE:NPTN), and Skechers USA (NYSE:SKX). IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Steve Symington (Zillow Group): Shares of Zillow Group are up 20% so far in 2017, helped by its strong first-quarter report in May. But the stock would have been a whole lot more expensive had you bought just before its second-quarter report last month; shares plunged 10% in a single day, even after Zillow set new company records for revenue and site traffic. Last quarter, over 178 million monthly unique users hit Zillow's apps and consumer-facing sites -- which include not only its namesake site, but also Trulia, HotPads, StreetEasy, and Naked Apartments -- including a record 182 million in the month of May. And that scale is paying off, with revenue up 28.1% during the quarter to $266.9 million, primarily driven by nearly 30% growth in marketplace revenue to $248.6 million. Within the latter, Zillow saw revenue from its ""Premier Agents"" program climb 29%, and the number of agents who spent over $5,000 per month more than doubled from the same year-ago period. Even so, Zillow still has a long runway for growth here, considering agents spend an estimated $12 billion on advertising their listings each year. Zillow also enjoyed strong 45% growth in revenue, to almost $38 million, from its ""other"" real estate segment; this includes items like agent services, sales from dotloop (which it acquired in 2015), and the rentals business. And revenue from its smaller mortgages segment climbed a respectable 13.8% to just under $21 million. Both of these segments represent significant incremental growth opportunities for Zillow over the long term. But why did the stock decline last month? From an investor's perspective, there was nothing not to like about its second quarter, which easily exceeded Zillow's latest financial guidance. Looking forward, however, Zillow offered a slightly lower-than-expected revenue outlook for its current third quarter, then followed by ""only"" increasing the lower ends of its existing full-year guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Putting aside its habit of underpromising and overdelivering, with shares already up big before that report, it was evident the market wanted more. In the end, though, we're still early in the real estate market's migration to digital. And Zillow stock is arguably the best way for investors to take advantage of that move. I think those willing to take advantage of Zillow's recent decline stand to be handsomely rewarded. Anders Bylund (NeoPhotonics): It's almost impossible to match Alphabet's outsized potential for long-term growth, but I can level the playing field by cheating a little. Meet NeoPhotonics, a maker of optoelectronic components that connect fiber-optic networks to other network types. The company builds transceivers, laser amplifiers, and lasers, and now focuses exclusively on high-speed components after selling off most of its slower legacy products to a sector peer in China. NeoPhotonics collects nearly 80% of its annual revenues from four world-class builders of fiber-optic networking equipment. When Huawei Technologies or Cisco Systems designs a new high-speed optical router or switch, NeoPhotonics sits high on the lists of preferred component providers. This is a healthy business with strong long-term prospects. At the start of 2017, NeoPhotonics had doubled its sales in five years and sported solid cash profits on a quarterly basis. But the company ran into manufacturing issues near the end of 2016, leaving NeoPhotonics unable to fill some of its pending orders. When the production-yield problem was cured, high-speed transceiver demand from Chinese customers hit a lull. Taken together, these short-term troubles did a number on NeoPhotonics' share prices. Share prices have tumbled 43% lower in 2017. The stock is on fire sale, even though the one-two punch of production yield issues and soft Chinese demand are old news now. NeoPhotonics' management expects order volumes to pick up in the second half, and it shouldn't take long to replace the lost sales of recent quarters with fresh high-speed component orders. So you're getting a high-quality growth stock at a massive discount. Fiber-optic networking will only grow more important over the next several years, and NeoPhotonics should be able to ride that macro trend into the long-term sunset. That's the cheat that could help my pick keep up with mighty Alphabet: Start with a small-cap stock under heavy pressure, making the inevitable bounce all the more elastic. Tim Green (Skechers): Footwear designer and retailer Skechers is not an exciting company. But a combination of international growth potential and a beaten-down stock price has created the possibility of stellar returns. Shares of Skechers plummeted in late 2015 as the company's rapid-fire growth began to slow; the stock is still down 50% from its all-time high. But a few quarters of lackluster growth, mainly driven by a sluggish U.S. wholesale business, has now been replaced by a return to double-digit growth. During the second quarter of this year, revenue soared 17.3% year over year, driven by a decent performance from the U.S. wholesale business and double-digit international growth. SKX data by YCharts. The bottom line is taking a hit as Sketchers invests in growing its international business, but the stock looks like a good deal given the company's growth potential. Analysts expect Skechers to produce $1.57 in per-share earnings this year, putting the price-to-earnings ratio at about 16.5. Back out the $680 million of net cash on the balance sheet, and the P/E falls to just 13.7. Skechers stock offers an uncommon combination of growth and value. Growth could slow down as it did last year, but a low valuation gives the company some room for error. If Skechers continues to grow at a healthy pace and the bottom line eventually catches up, the stock could be a big winner over the next few years. ","
      
    3 Stocks With Alphabet-Like Return Potential -- The Motley Fool

The world of voice-activated virtual assistants is becoming a crowded place. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gave us Siri, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) provided the Google Assistant, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) authored Alexa, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) contributed Cortana, and there are many other smaller examples. So far, none has been crowned king or queen in the space, though there have been plenty of assertions made about which is best. That's why a recent announcement about an alliance between two of the biggest players came as such a surprise. In a move that turned more than a few heads, tech titans and fierce cloud-computing rivals Amazon and Microsoft announced a partnership to integrate the two companies' digital assistants. The move may not make sense at first glance, but a deeper look reveals the motivation behind the unlikely partnership. Seems every tech company has its own virtual digital assistant. Image source: Getty Images. Beginning later this year, users of Amazon's Alexa, found in the Echo family of speakers, will be able to use the digital darling to access Microsoft's Cortana by asking ""Alexa, open Cortana."" Likewise, users of Cortana, present on the Windows 10 operating system can gain access to Alexa by asking ""Hey Cortana, open Alexa."" A move like this is almost unheard of, as each of the tech giants has been working to ensure that its assistant would be a hit with consumers. The companies have spent untold amounts in research and development, each system being an island unto itself, and the proprietary nature and competitive advantages would seem to discourage such a collaboration. In the end, though, the reasoning may be quite simple. Part of the reason may be differing capabilities. The market for virtual assistants is still quite fragmented, largely because each has its strengths and weaknesses, and none has yet become a ""killer app."" Cortana is tightly incorporated into Microsoft Outlook, the company's email program that is part of its Office suite of products. Amazon would find it difficult to achieve that level of integration with any competitor's product, though it has made a massive push to provide thousands of useful commands since the introduction of its Echo family of smart speakers. Alexa can order a pizza or a ride-hailing service, control your smart-home devices, and get exclusive Prime deals. The biggest reason, however, may simply be one of reach. Some estimates place Siri on over 1 billion devices worldwide, and that number will likely increase with the release of Apple's HomePod smart speaker. Google Assistant is estimated to be on 150 million devices, with more on the way with the release of the Home speaker and upgraded versions of its latest Android operating system. By contrast, Cortana has only 145 million monthly active users, and though it doesn't report the number, Amazon is estimated to have an Alexa/Echo device in more than 10.7 million U.S. homes. Without the smartphone user base of their competitors, the combined reach of Amazon and Microsoft simply pales by comparison. Though it may have initially seemed that Amazon made its tech rival blink, this deal is likely something of a necessity for both companies. The two have struggled with smartphones, an area that is dominated by Google's Android and Apple's iPhone. Cortana has been mostly shackled to computers using the Windows 10 operating system. Amazon has been working to integrate Alexa into every conceivable device, from appliances, smart-home products, to vehicles, in an attempt to compensate for its lack of a phone, but its range is still limited. This collaboration with Microsoft increases that base by 145 million devices. Both companies are seeking to integrate their assistant on as many devices as possible, but they will need to reach far more, however, if they hope to catch up with Siri. ","

The autonomous driving market is poised to grow to $77 billion by 2035, and automakers and tech companies alike are already expanding quickly into this market through semi-autonomous vehicles. Investors looking to benefit from driverless cars would be wise to consider Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford (NYSE:F), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). None of the companies is a pure play in the driverless-car market, but each has significant exposure and is poised to benefit from its inevitable growth. Tesla is best known for its sleek electric vehicles, but the company is also making huge investments in hardware and software to make its vehicles semi-autonomous, with the goal of reaching full autonomy soon. Image source: Tesla. The company most recently partnered with NVIDIA to bring the graphics-processor maker's Drive PX supercomputer into Tesla's vehicles. Drive PX is a supercomputer that processes image information in real time, giving vehicles a type of situational awareness. What's notable about Tesla's self-driving car plans is that it's already building all of its vehicles with the necessary hardware to make them fully autonomous. Tesla is slowly rolling out software updates to bring new semi-autonomous features online, but the hardware is a clear indication of the company's plans. CEO Elon Musk says that the company will display its vehicles' driverless capabilities later this year, when it'll allow one of its vehicles to drive across the country on its own. Tesla made about 82% of its $2.8 billion first-quarter 2017 revenue from its automotive business (the remainder came from its solar-power company and battery sales), so investors can expect any success in driverless cars to trickle down to the company's bottom line. That may not happen for a while, but Tesla is certainly positioning itself well, aside from the driverless-car hardware installed in its vehicles. The company has plans to allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous vehicles when they're not using them. And it is developing a driverless semi-truck that's expected to debut next month. Ford may not be the first company many investors think of when considering a driverless-car investment, but the automotive giant is a current leader in the driverless space and will likely further its position in the coming years. Ford invested $1 billion earlier this year in an artificial-intelligence company called Argo AI, which will supply the brains behind Ford's self-driving car technologies. Ford is currently testing 30 self-driving cars -- which will triple to 90 by next year -- and says that it plans to release a fully autonomous vehicle in 2021. Ford has also wisely purchased a ride-sharing service called Chariot, which could eventually be used to rent out driverless cars to customers. Chariot already operates in nine cities, and Ford's current driverless-car technologies could eventually be paired with it to create new autonomous-driving services. Finally, Ford is also investing $700 million to renovate part of its Flat Rock plant so that some of the assembly lines there will be able to make autonomous vehicles. Ford's management thinks that driverless cars could account for 20% of annual vehicle sales for the entire auto industry by 2030, and the company's positioning itself well to cash in when that day comes. I've already mentioned how NVIDIA's Drive PX supercomputer is helping to power Tesla's driverless-car plans, but the company's technology is also being used by Toyota, Audi, Baidu, and Volvo Cars. This is notable because as more tech companies and automakers look to bring driverless cars to their customers, NVIDIA is consistently one of the go-to companies that they choose. Among the reasons for this are the company's superior graphics processors, the brains behind most driverless vehicles. NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are able to process massive amounts of image information very quickly, and the company's artificial-intelligence software allows computers in these vehicles to understand what they're seeing and make critical driving decisions. NVIDIA only earned 6% of its total revenue from its automotive business in its fiscal second-quarter 2018, but investors should know that the company anticipates that its total addressable market for driverless cars will be about $8 billion by 2025. With several key driverless-car partnerships already solidified, and more than 225 automakers, Tier 1 suppliers, and researchers testing Drive PX, NVIDIA is on a clear path to benefiting from the driverless-car market. Remember that we're still in the beginning stages of the driverless-car market, and there are plenty of technological and regulatory hurdles yet to overcome. Fully autonomous cars will take the streets slowly, and only after automakers build in more semi-autonomous features. This means that Tesla, Ford, and NVIDIA may have to wait a while before driverless cars start significantly contributing to their revenues. But each company is poised to benefit, and investors should take notice of these driverless-car leaders right now. ","

The 1960s cartoon presented some progressive, futuristic ideas. George Jetson teleconference-called his boss from the comfort of his home, while humanoid robotic assistants (""Rosie"") autonomously took care of the household chores. Amazingly, we've reached the point where technology is allowing for those fictional inventions to come to life. Wireless internet connectivity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence are introducing a new wave of robotics into the consumer market. iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) is one company poised to sweep up those industry profits. Let's take a closer look at three reasons why. Image source: iRobot. For years, the prime customers for robots were industrial manufacturers. Robotic systems were placed on assembly lines to improve throughput, reduce costs, and maximize productivity. Managers would base decisions on economics: If the savings per unit multiplied by the volume of output covered the upfront capital costs in a reasonable payback period, they typically moved forward. But with the price points falling significantly in recent years, robots are now becoming mass-market affordable. The Boston Consulting Group recently noted that the consumer market for robots is growing faster than expected, and is estimated to reach $23 billion globally by 2025. Three years ago, BCG analysts estimated that figure would reach $9 billion by 2025 -- this 156% upward revision indicates that they think the growing consumer market is kind of a big deal. You don't need to travel far to see why. iRobot's Roomba vacuums now line the shelves of home improvement retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot. No longer just a novelty, consumer robots have become incredibly efficient at doing household daily chores and are receiving rave customer reviews. But there's more to iRobot's story than just rising consumer demand. After all, the smart home is a lucrative market -- and we should expect competitors to begin battling it out to grab their piece of the pie. But iRobot remains a technological step ahead. The 27 year-old company's spacial awareness and navigation technology was originally used by the Department of Defense for bomb detection. The company's scientists have optimized it since then and later realized it could also be used to navigate through the doors and around the furniture of homes. Today, the Roomba has become America's best-selling vacuum. Software will be the key for the company's expansion. Following the success of the Roomba, iRobot incorporated the spatial awareness and navigation technology into several more neat new products. The Mirra was introduced in 2013 to clean swimming pools and the Braava in 2016 to mop kitchen floors. The list of applications is growing longer, which introduces more revenue streams that can finance further research and development. Lastly, iRobot's software itself is also getting smarter. Deep learning and neural networks are new artificial intelligence advancements that allow robots to make sense of the world around them. Image source: Getty Images. As a comparison, think of Alphabet's self-driving cars. Each of them contains sensors to ""see"" stop signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles on the road. The cars beam up the video feeds taken by the sensors, neural networks make sense of and interpret the information, and the cars do what they should to react. It's essentially the same decision-making process humans brains were taught to go through during driver's education class ... but with a lot more data points to analyze! iRobot's home-cleaning robots will soon be doing essentially the same thing. Machine vision sensors will allow them to instantaneously spot spills as soon as they occur, and neural networks will train them to know what a ""clean"" floor should look like. How much would you pay to never again need to clean up after your messy toddler or pet? Price points are generally between $200 and $900 for iRobot products, which led nearly three million consumers last year to agree to put the company to work on managing their daily chores. As an interested investor, I expect those three million annual unit shipments to scale up significantly. Overall revenue grew just 7% in fiscal 2016, but management has already guided for 25% growth in 2017. New customers are buying in, and the company is introducing new models and expanding the concept overseas. I'll be keeping an eye on whether iRobot can maintain its accelerated growth rate. If consumer robotics is truly at the inflection point that BCG believes, analyst expectations are likely too low -- which could make for big future returns for the company's investors. ","
      
    3 Reasons iRobot Stock Could Sweep In Huge Returns -- The Motley Fool

"Tyler Crowe, Brian Stoffel, and John Rosevear",09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investing with an extremely long time horizon can be challenging for a number of reasons, not least of which is that monumental changes in society  can happen over such extended periods. Case in point: There's only one company that was in the Dow Jones Industrial Average 100 years ago that's still a component today -- General Electric. Back then, the index was dominated by companies focused on steel, rubber, and railroads. Still, recognizing that it's an incredible challenge to predict what companies will be thriving a century in the future, we asked three of our contributing investors to give it their best shots. Their picks: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), American Water Works (NYSE:AWK), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Below, they explain why. Image source: Getty Images. John Rosevear (Amazon.com): A century is an awfully long time -- far too long to make truly accurate predictions. But if I had to pick one company that looks set not just to survive, but to grow significantly for decades to come, I'd go with Amazon. The e-commerce giant's stock has already had a run for the ages over the last 20 years, of course. But the thing that gets my attention is this: It's still, 20 years later, chasing (and finding) major revenue growth. Consider: Amazon's revenue was up 25% last quarter, to a hefty $38 billion, on strong retail sales and a good result for the Amazon Web Services cloud-infrastructure business. That's not a fluke -- in fact, it fell short of Wall Street expectations, believe it or not. We've become accustomed to big revenue growth from Amazon, and there's more to come. Between Amazon's expansion into new retail categories (like groceries and autos), its fast-growing artificial-intelligence expertise, and that cloud infrastructure business, there are new revenue doors opening all the time. Of course, profits are hit-or-miss with Amazon, as it tends to plow most of its cash back into new opportunities. The thinking is that at some point this will pay off big for shareholders, of course. It could be a bumpy ride between here and there -- Amazon's stock is no bargain at current valuations, and it could take a hit if the market gets choppy -- but over the very long haul, I like its chances to deliver outsize returns to patient investors. Tyler Crowe (American Water Works): We as investors are bad at two things. We overestimate how much can get done in a year or less, and underestimate what we can get done over multiyear time horizons. The pace of change in technology, health, energy, and consumer behavior makes it hard for us to even conceptualize what our world will look like several decades from now. For all the changes we will likely see, though, there are some constants in life. We are still living creatures who need to sustain ourselves, and that means that companies which provide essentials like food and water are the kinds of investments you want if you are looking at a holding period of a century or more. With that in mind, American Water Works is worth considering. The two things that make American Water Works specifically compelling are the company's footprint and the regulated nature of its business. It is one of the nation's largest providers of municipal drinking water and wastewater treatment. Its large, multistate asset portfolio gives it both the financial fortitude and the operational base to either acquire smaller private water treatment operators or take over public operations from municipalities. Also, thanks to the regulated nature of the business, American Water is guaranteed a rate of return on new investments that ensures steadily growing earnings. It's impossible to make guarantees in investing, but I can guarantee you that 100 years from now, humans will still need water. And chances are, the way we get that water won't change much, either. That makes American Water Works a great bet for a long time horizon. Brian Stoffel (Alphabet): Outside of Facebook, there's no company that's even close to having as much data on hand as Alphabet, parent company to Google. In a world of artificial intelligence and deep learning, the company with the most data will have an undeniable edge over the competition. For well over a decade, Google has been the default search engine for the world outside of China. Throw in all the data collected by Google's other six products with over one billion active users -- Play Store, Maps, GMail, YouTube, Android, and Chrome -- and Alphabet's sitting on the digital equivalent of gold mine. But here's the real thing that makes me think I could own this stock for as long as I possibly can: multiple futures. Right now, advertising accounts for 89%  of the company's revenue. I don't expect that to change anytime soon. The company's ""Other Bets"" -- which include self-driving car unit Waymo, life science company Verily, and a host of other startups -- represent low-risk, high-reward opportunities to meaningfully drive the company's bottom and top lines. While most of these bets will end in failure, all it will take is one or two ""hits"" to make a huge difference. Given a 100-year time frame, I'm willing to bet that at least one of these ventures will succeed -- and reward shareholders handsomely. ","

Rick Munarriz,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It will be a quiet week on the earnings front, but one name worth watching is Cracker Barrel (NASDAQ:CBRL). The unique concept that combines a restaurant specializing in southern comfort foods with a throwback country store will be posting its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. Analysts aren't holding out for much. They see flattish revenue growth, rising a mere 0.5% to $749.6 million. Earnings per share are expected to clock in at $2.19, just ahead of the $2.12 it rang up a year earlier. The stock is trading closer to its 52-week low than its 52-week high, seemingly making Cracker Barrel yet another casualty in what some are calling a ""restaurant recession"" in the casual-dining industry. It's tempting to call this a dog stock but hush, puppy. Image source: Cracker Barrel. Cracker Barrel is coming off of a rough fiscal third quarter. Its profit of $1.95 a share may have beaten Wall Street's target of $1.85 a share, but revenue of $700.4 million fell well short of the $713.1 million that analysts were modeling. Comps declined during the quarter, something that hadn't happened in nearly three years. The end of the 11-quarter streak of positive comparable sales came at the hands of a 0.4% unit-level dip on the restaurant front -- as a 2.1% slide in traffic wasn't overcome by a 1.7% uptick in average check size -- and a brutal 4.7% hit in comps at its attached country stores. The guidance that Cracker Barrel offered in May was mixed. It increased its earnings-per-share outlook for all of fiscal 2017 to between $8.25 and $8.35, up from its earlier range of $8.10 to $8.25. Unfortunately its top-line goal of $2.95 billion for the entire fiscal year was just shy of where the stock's analysts were waiting. Investors often applaud bottom-line growth and margin expansion over revenue spurts, but the concern here is that the concept's popularity is going through a rough patch. Cracker Barrel isn't standing still. It's opening more stores, and it's also building out its Holler & Dash sibling concept that gives gourmet biscuit sandwiches a fast-casual spin. The restaurateur also boosted its dividend in May, a move that pushes its current yield to 3.9%. The chain has also sprinkled some hefty special dividends into the mix. Its springtime guidance finds analysts taking a cautious stance as we approach Wednesday's report, but Cracker Barrel has managed to beat analyst earnings estimates handily for three consecutive quarters. If it wants to become a rare market darling in the casual-dining space space again, it will have to make sure that it can offer an upbeat top-line outlook for fiscal 2018, too. ","

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"The all-cash deal will see Google gain 2,000 HTC employees,   roughly equivalent to one fifth of the Taiwanese firm’s total workforce. It will also acquire a non-exclusive license for HTC’s intellectual property and the two firms agreed to look at other areas of collaboration in the future. “Google has found it necessary to have its own hardware team to help bring innovations to Android devices, making them competitive versus the iPhone series,” said Mia Huang, analyst at research firm TrendForce. The move is part of a broader and still nascent push into hardware that saw Google hire Rick Osterloh, a former Motorola executive, to run its hardware division last year. It also comes ahead of new product launches on Oct. 4 that are expected to include two Pixel phones and a Chromebook. Pixel smartphones, only launched a year ago, have less than 1 percent market share globally with an estimated 2.8 million shipments, according to research firm IDC. This time around, however, the deal price tag is much smaller and the lack of manufacturing facilities also minimizes risk. Google’s strategy of licensing Android for free and profiting from embedded services such as search and maps has made Android the dominant mobile operating system with some 89 percent of the global market, according to IDC. But it has long been frustrated by the emergence of many variations of Android and the inconsistent experience that has produced. Pushing its own hardware will likely complicate its relationship with Android licensees, analysts said. “HTC is past its prime in terms of being a leading hardware design house, mainly because of how much it has had to scale back over the years because of declining revenues,” said Ryan Reith, an analyst at IDC. “Unless Google really wants to control hardware for its other businesses like Home and Chromebooks in addition to smartphones, then I don’t see this as being a bet that pays off.” For HTC, the deal will allow it to concentrate more on its virtual reality headsets while also reducing development costs. “This will be a sizeable reduction in our R&D expenses. Overall it should be in the ballpark of a 30-40 percent  reduction in operating expenses,” HTC Chief Financial Officer Peter Shen told a news conference in Taipei. The Taiwanese firm will continue to run its remaining smartphone business but the sharp downsizing of its mainstay operations has cast some doubt over its longer term future. “HTC can design and produce innovative products but it lacks the deep pockets of the likes of Samsung for marketing promotions and saturation advertising,” said Jake Saunders, an analyst at ABI Research in Singapore. “Competitors in the form of Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi and ZTE are snapping at HTC’s heels.” HTC’s worldwide smartphone market share declined to 0.9 percent last year from a peak of 8.8 percent in 2011, according to IDC. HTC shares were on a trading halt on Thursday. The stock has fallen around 94 percent from a peak in 2011, giving the company a market value of around $1.9 billion. Evercore served as financial advisor to HTC while Lazard was Google’s financial advisor. ","

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"(Reuters) - Three female former employees of Alphabet Inc’s Google filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing the tech company of discriminating against women in pay and promotions. The proposed class action lawsuit, filed in California state court in San Francisco, comes as Google faces an  investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor into sex bias in pay practices. The lawsuit appears to be the first to make class action sex bias claims against Google, but is only the latest instance of a major tech company being accused of discriminating against women. The Department of Labor sued Oracle America Inc in January, claiming it paid white men more than women and minorities with similar jobs. Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc are facing sex bias lawsuits, and Qualcomm Inc last year settled claims for $19.5 million. Meanwhile, Uber Technologies Inc in June said it would make a series of changes after a former engineer in a blog post accused the ride-hailing service of condoning rampant sexism. The plaintiffs in Thursday’s lawsuit are a former Google software engineer, a former communications specialist and a former manager who worked in various roles at the Mountain View, California-based company. They say Google pays women in California less than men who perform similar work, and assigns female workers jobs that are less likely to lead to promotions. “While Google has been an industry-leading tech innovator, its treatment of female employees has not entered the 21st century,” Kelly Dermody, a lawyer for the women, said in a statement. Google spokeswoman Gina Scigliano denied the claims in a statement. She said employment decisions are made by hiring and promotion committees, and are vetted “to make sure there is no gender bias.” “If we ever see individual discrepancies or problems, we work to fix them, because Google has always sought to be a great employer, for every one of our employees,” she said. The plaintiffs say Google violated California laws requiring equal pay for similar work and prohibiting unfair and unlawful business practices. They are seeking to represent a class of women who worked at Google in California over the last four years. The Labor Department investigation stems from a 2015 audit in which the department says it discovered sex-based wage gaps among Google workers. The department last month appealed an administrative judge’s July decision that rejected its request for contact information for more than 20,000 Google employees. ","

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google on Monday launched a localized payments app for India as it tries to gain a foothold in the country’s rapidly-growing digital payments space. India’s crowded digital payments market, expected to grow ten-fold to $500 billion by 2020, received a shot in the arm after Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned old high-value notes last year, forcing people to use e-wallets and card payments. A state-backed payments system, Unified Payment Interface (UPI), has also helped banks enter the fray, forcing wallet players to actively partner with lenders or adopt the platform in the world’s fastest growing internet services market. Google’s payments app named Tez, meaning fast in Hindi, uses UPI and allows users to connect their bank accounts to the service. Google has partnered with State Bank of India, the country’s biggest lender, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank for the service. Tez will compete, among others, with Paytm which is backed by SoftBank and Alibaba. Paytm is the country’s largest e-wallet with more than 225 million users. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley who launched Tez in New Delhi said Google was keen on joining India’s transformation into a digital economy, especially after the demonetization. “The Google team was extremely keen because they saw a great potential, both in the economy and the businesses in India.” Google has increasingly stepped up its efforts to reach deeper into the Indian market. It provides free wifi at several railways stations across the country and launched a version of its video platform YouTube that runs on a slower network. Bharti Enterprises-backed Hike launched a UPI-linked wallet within its messaging platform earlier this year, while Facebook’s popular WhatsApp instant messaging service is also mulling foraying into digital payment services in India, its biggest market and home to 200 million of its billion-plus users.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google has offered to display rival comparison shopping sites via an auction, as it aims to stave off further EU antitrust fines, four people familiar with the matter said. Google is under pressure to come up with a big initiative to level the playing field in comparison shopping, but its proposal was roundly criticised by competitors as inadequate, the sources said. EU enforcers see the antitrust case as a benchmark for investigations of other areas dominated by the U.S. search giant, such as travel and online mapping. Google has already been fined a record 2.4 billion euros ($2.9 bln) by the European Commission for favouring its own service, and could face millions of euros in fresh fines if it fails to treat rivals and its own service equally. In its proposal submitted to the European Commission on Aug. 29, the company said it would allow competitors to bid for any spot in its shopping section known as Product Listing Ads, the sources said. EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said it was too early to say if the offer would be accepted. “It is at this point in time of course impossible to say what will happen but obviously market reactions will be one of the things that we’ll be taking under consideration,” she told reporters in Washington on Monday. Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc, sought feedback from four to five competitors and it was overwhelmingly negative, the sources said. The adverse reaction could undermine Google’s efforts to win over EU antitrust regulators. Three years ago, the world’s most popular internet search engine made a similar offer in an attempt to settle a long-running investigation by the Commission and avoid a fine. That was ultimately rejected following criticism from rivals and discord within the EU executive. Under that proposal, Google would reserve the first two places for its own ads. The new offer would also see Google set a floor price with its own bids minus operating costs. The offer does not address the issues set out by EU competition regulators, the sources said. “This is worse than the commitments,” one of the people said, who requested anonymity. The European Commission said the onus was on Google to comply with its cease and desist order. “It is Google’s sole responsibility to ensure compliance with the Commission antitrust decision, and it is for Google to explain how it intends to do so,” spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said. Google did not respond to a request for comment. UK price comparison site Foundem, whose complaint triggered the EU investigation in 2010, dismissed the auction proposal. “Unless Google is volunteering to break up its general-and specialised-search businesses, the inclusion of Google’s comparison shopping competitors into a new or existing pay-for-placement auction would simply create an additional anti-competitive barrier,” the company said. Google has until Sept. 28 to stop its anti-competitive practices or Alphabet could be fined up to 5 percent of its average daily worldwide turnover, or around $12 million a day, based on Alphabet’s 2016 turnover of $90.3 billion.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google said it had disabled a “majority” of the offensive keywords that BuzzFeed found could be used by advertisers to target people searching for racist and anti-Semitic topics.

The news comes a day after Facebook Inc said it was temporarily disabling the ability of advertisers to target based on people’s self-reported education and job information after a report that those features allowed targeting based on anti-Semitic topics.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Removing extremist content from the internet within a few hours of it appearing poses “an enormous technological and scientific challenge”, Google’s general counsel will say later on Wednesday to European leaders who want it taken down quicker. Kent Walker, general counsel for Alphabet Inc’s Google, will speak on behalf of technology companies Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube at an event on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations. The leaders of France, Britain and Italy want to push social media companies to remove “terrorist content” from the internet within one to two hours of it appearing because they say that is the period when most material is spread. “We are making significant progress, but removing all of this content within a few hours - or indeed stopping it from appearing on the internet in the first place - poses an enormous technological and scientific challenge,” Walker will say in a speech on behalf of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a working group formed by the four companies to combine their efforts to remove extremist content. Tech firms have come under increasing pressure from governments in the United States and Europe to do more to keep extremist content off their platforms after a spate of militant attacks, and the European Union is mulling legislation on the issue. “There is no silver bullet when it comes to finding and removing this content, but we’re getting much better,” Walker will say. “Of course finding problematic material in the first place often requires not just thousands of human hours but, more fundamentally, continuing advances in engineering and computer science research. The haystacks are unimaginably large and the needles are both very small and constantly changing.” Walker will say the companies need human reviewers to help distinguish legitimate material such as news coverage from the problematic material and train machine-learning tools against “ever-changing examples.” The companies last year decided to set up a joint database to share unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos of extremist content, known as “hashes”, to help each other detect and remove similar content. Facebook used a hash that contained a link to bomb-making instructions to find and remove almost 100 copies of that content. Twitter said on Tuesday that it had removed 299,649 accounts in the first half of this year for the “promotion of terrorism”, while Facebook has ramped up its use of artificial intelligence to map out pages and posts with terrorist material.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Thursday it may seek to implement tax reform to raise more revenue from online giants without the backing of the United States and other rich nations, in a move that could spark a new transatlantic dispute. To prevent some smaller EU economies such as Ireland or Luxembourg, which host many foreign online businesses, from blocking the move, the commission is also raising the prospect of using little-known EU rules that would prevent states from vetoing decisions on tax matters. Usually the EU decides on tax issues only with the unanimous support of its 28 members. The commission on Thursday outlined three options for taxes aimed at internet companies that could be agreed upon relatively quickly at the EU level or by a smaller group of EU nations. One was for a tax on the turnover rather than the profits of digital firms, another would put a levy on online ads, and a third would impose a withholding tax on payments to internet firms. In the longer term the EU wants to change existing taxation rights to make sure digital firms with large operations but no physical presence in a given country pay taxes there instead of being allowed to reroute their profits to low-tax jurisdictions. The EU’s preferred option would be for an agreement on this at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes the United States and Japan. But “the EU must prepare to act in the absence of adequate global progress,” Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference in Brussels, saying that a legislative proposal may come next spring. Such a move is likely to upset Washington and other rich nations that are home to many global tech giants. In the report, the commission emphasized that unilateral initiatives taken in the EU would need to be carefully assessed to ensure they are compatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. “We would urge caution against EU-only measures that could run the risk of creating double taxation,” Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), a group representing accountants worldwide, said. The EU will first have to reach a compromise agreement among its 28 members by December. Some states have already voiced their opposition to new taxes on digital firms, especially if decided on without a global deal in place. To overcome this, the commission said there was a debate on whether to strip EU countries of their veto rights on tax issues, based on an article in the EU treaties that allows such exceptional action in the event of market distortions. “There is a broader discussion whether we should move to decision-making based on majority also in the area of taxation,” Dombrovskis told reporters. But he added: “Currently we are basing our proposal on current rules which foresee unanimity.” Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week evoked another special procedure to move to majority-based rather than unanimous decisions in matters of taxation.

 ,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Leaders of France, Italy and the United Kingdom urged social media companies on Wednesday to more swiftly remove “terrorist content” from the internet, with the aim of stopping it from being uploaded in the first place. “The tech companies have made significant progress on this issue, but we need to go further and faster to reduce the time it takes to remove terrorist content online,” British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly of world leaders in New York. She said there was a need “to increase significantly the efforts to stop (extremist content) being uploaded in the first place.” French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni later pushed in a separate event hosted by May for such content to be removed swiftly. “This is what must be done. In one hour the content must be identified, analyzed and withdrawn to avoid it being broadcast widely. Experience shows that this is possible,” said Macron, speaking through an interpreter. “We have a real battlefield for hearts and minds and (it) is the web,” Gentiloni said. He said economic and privacy issues were a hurdle in this process, “but we also have to know, if we are aware of the fact that this battlefield is so relevant, that we can’t reduce our ambition because of the difficulties.” Several websites across the internet list ingredients for making bombs or instructions on how to use vehicles to attack pedestrians. Online retailer Amazon.com said on Wednesday it was reviewing its website after an investigation found it could help users buy the ingredients to make a bomb using its “Frequently bought together” and “Customers who bought this also bought” features. The European Union has threatened legislation if internet companies do not better police what is available on the web. “Removing all of this content within a few hours - or indeed stopping it from appearing on the internet in the first place - poses an enormous technological and scientific challenge,” said Kent Walker, general counsel for Alphabet Inc’s Google. “The haystacks here are unimaginably large and the needles are both very small and constantly changing.” Walker spoke on behalf of Facebook Inc, Microsoft Corp, Google subsidiary YouTube and Twitter Inc, all members of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism created in June under pressure from governments in Europe and the United States after a spate of militant attacks. Its aim is to share technical solutions for removing extremist content and work more closely with counter-terrorism experts.

If at first you don't succeed, make another acquisition? The Taiwan Stock Exchange has announced that shares of beleaguered Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC will halt trading tomorrow, Sept. 21, pending ""the release of material information."" Once said information is released, shares will resume trading. The announcement comes as speculation has intensified that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google could be interested in scooping up the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) remaining assets. Once a prominent smartphone brand, HTC has fallen out of favor in recent years, which is reflected in its financial results. HTC posted an operating loss of 2.2 billion New Taiwan dollars ($73.1 million) last quarter for an operating margin of negative 13.6%, revenue was down 15% year over year, and HTC's cash position is dwindling. Media reports from Taiwan have suggested an acquisition is imminent, which Bloomberg corroborated this morning. The search giant may reportedly acquire HTC's phone design team for $330 million, which would include the HTC brand and approximately 100 engineers. HTC manufactures the first-generation Pixel. Image source: Google. Meanwhile, Google is preparing to unveil its Pixel 2 phones on Oct. 4, while HTC currently serves as the contract manufacturer for the first-generation Pixel. For Alphabet investors, the reports likely bring back unwelcome memories of the last time that Google acquired a smartphone maker: Motorola. That deal was predicated largely on intellectual property and Motorola's massive patent portfolio, but still ended up costing Google billions in operating losses and resulted in meaningful margin dilution throughout the duration of its ownership. Google ended up selling off basically everything but those patents. There's also the long-standing challenge of getting third-party OEMs onboard with Google's vision for the future of Android. It's safe to say that we're on the cusp of a renaissance with augmented reality (AR), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has quickly taken the initial lead with iOS 11, ARKit, and iPhone X. By integrating AR features into its flagship, which tens of millions of users will purchase in the quarters to come, Apple hopes to single-handedly catalyze mainstream consumer adoption, which subsequently attracts AR developers. Image source: Google. Android's biggest weakness has always been fragmentation (in more ways than one). While Google recently released ARCore in response to ARKit, adoption within Android will lag compared to iOS for several reasons. ARCore is available on supported devices running Android 7.0 Nougat or later. Nougat was released over a year ago in August 2016, and is only installed on 16% of official Android devices. Then there's the issue of hardware fragmentation. Google launched Project Tango in 2014, and Tango phones use sensors that are similar to what Apple is using in its new TrueDepth camera system to similarly enable 3D sensing and environmental mapping capabilities. As of now, three years later, there are only two Tango-supported phones, and neither are flagship devices that will sell in large volumes. For a fundamentally fragmented platform like Android, pushing forward with AR requires concerted effort and immense collaboration between Google, OEMs, and developers in order to convince consumers to buy in. OEMs won't invest in developing the necessary specialized hardware unless they believe consumer demand exists, even if the underlying software support from Google is there. The risk is that AR on Android is relegated to a niche feature, while AR on iOS becomes a mainstream standard. This could be Google's angle. In order to push third-party OEMs that will always drive the platform's unit volumes, it needs to drag them along more forcefully before it's too late by offering more ""Made by Google"" products as it increasingly expands its hardware ambitions. Motorola was never really about vertical integration, even if it appeared to be. If an HTC deal is about vertical integration in pursuit of AR and greater control over Android's future, all while costing just a few hundred million, it could end up being well worth it. ","

Hardware is one of Google's ""three most promising bets,"" right alongside YouTube and Cloud, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. And now Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google is taking its investment in its 2016-launched Made by Google products even further. Google is acquiring part of smartphone-maker HTC in a $1.1 billion deal to ""fuel further innovation and future product development in consumer hardware,"" Google said in a press release on Wednesday. The deal has big implications for Alphabet. Namely, it reinforces the company's growing efforts to ramp-up its Google-branded hardware efforts, proving Alphabet is taking the opportunity as seriously as it says it is. The Google Pixel smartphone. Image source: Google. Under Alphabet's $1.1 billion cash deal to purchase part of HTC's business, a team from HTC's hardware business will join Google's hardware organization. Many of these employees were already working with Google to develop Pixel smartphones, Google said. As part of the purchase, Google will also obtain a non-exclusive license for HTC intellectual property. Before this acquisition, Google had contracted out engineering talent at HTC to help Google bring to market its first Pixel smartphone last fall. Now Google can insource every aspect of designing its Pixel smartphones and only outsource manufacturing. Though HTC will be losing about 2,000 of its employees to Google, HTC believes its branded smartphone strategy will continue to be supported by what's left of its business. The deal enables ""a more streamlined product portfolio, greater operational efficiency and financial flexibility,"" read HTC's press release. HTC asserts that it still has ""best-in-class engineering talent"" to work on its next flagship phone. Further, HTC plans to continue building its Vive virtual reality headset. Though HTC CEO and Chairwoman Cher Wang admitted that the talent it lost to Google will ""supercharge"" Alphabet's hardware business. Last fall, Google upped the ante in hardware with a new Made by Google hardware division, launching its new Pixel smartphone, its Google Home smart speaker, a streaming TV device, and more. Google Home. Image source: Google. The success of Google-branded hardware is evident by its impact on Alphabet's fast-growing ""other"" segment, which accounts for about 12% of Alphabet's revenue. In Alphabet's second quarter, the segment's revenue soared 42% year over year. Management cited Google-branded hardware, the Android app store, and cloud services as the primary drivers for the growth. In Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call, management said growth in Hardware was ""substantial."" Alphabet also said the Pixel phone ""continues to be really popular...."" Alphabet's purchase of part of HTC's business comes just weeks before Alphabet's launch of its next-generation Pixel phone. Alphabet is holding an event on Oct. 4, exactly one year after it unveiled its Made by Google products last year, to announce its latest Google-branded hardware. Investors should expect hardware to become even more integral to Alphabet. ""We're excited about the 2017 lineup, but even more inspired by what's in store over the next five, 10, even 20 years,"" Google Senior Vice President of Hardware Rick Osterloh said in a blog post after the HTC purchase. ""Creating beautiful products that people rely on every single day is a journey, and we are investing for the long run."" ","

Sometimes, being first to enter a market lets a company take over a space before any of its rivals can react. That's what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has done with its Echo family of hands-free, voice-controlled speakers. The devices, which have the Alexa artificial intelligence (AI) built in, were the first of their kind, and they created what has become a growing category. Seemingly every major company has plans to enter this space. Apple has its HomePod with Siri (which goes on sale in December), a number of companies plan to offer smart speakers using Microsoft's Cortana, and even Samsung plans to try to compete. It's a market, however, where the battle may already be down to two contestants: Amazon with its dominant Echo line and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with Google Home. Amazon dominates the smart speaker space. Image source: Amazon. If this were a road race, Amazon would be winning handily, while Google would be well behind. Everyone else would have pulled a hamstring just past the starting line or forgotten what day the race was. Echo was on the market for nearly two years before its first major competitor -- Google Home -- even launched. That allowed Amazon to perfect Echo, first selling it only to select Prime members at half of its initial $199 selling price -- then slowly rolling it out to the masses. That let the company work out many of the kinks, while also expanding the line to offer the lower-priced Dot and the mid-priced Tap. Amazon Echo has sold 15 million units while Google Home has sold 5 million, according to a just-released study done by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). That report had a relatively small sample size of 300, but its findings were backed up by a larger study from NPR and Edison Research released in August that showed 76% of U.S. homes with a smart speaker having Echo devices, while 16% were Google only, and 8% had both. The NPR/Edison report, which surveyed 1,620 Americans, also estimated the total smart-speaker market in the U.S. to be about 20 million homes. Other contenders may rise, but they are starting at a considerable disadvantage. Apple has shown that it can take at least niche market share with a higher-priced, high-end product. That suggests HomePod could become a small player in the way that Apple TV and the Mac have built an audience in the streaming and computer markets. It's also too early to count out Microsoft because while it struggled with Windows Phone, it has succeeded -- at least on a limited level -- with its Surface tablets and laptops. The challenge for any new player is that Amazon offers high-functioning, elegantly designed products at affordable price points. Alexa works really well and its lead in installed user base has led to third-party developers being eager to develop apps, or what Amazon calls ""skills"" for the platform. Whether it's Google Home, Apple's HomePod, a Cortana-powered device, or any other player in this space, you have to wonder if any company can give consumers a clear reason to buy their device over Amazon's.

"Steve Symington, Timothy Green, and Anders Bylund",09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With shares of Google -- or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), rather, following its restructuring in late 2015 -- up more than 1,600% since its initial public offering just over 13 years ago, there's no denying the internet search giant has delivered incredible gains for patient investors. And that shouldn't be a big surprise considering that earlier this year, Gmail became Google's seventh product to hit one billion active users, joining Google Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, Google Play, and YouTube. That's not to mention the promise of Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car initiative, or its ""Other Bets"" segment housing multiple high-potential businesses that are still mostly in their pre-revenue stages. But this also raises the question: Where can we find stocks today that offer similar return potential? We asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a stock they believe fits that mold. Read on to learn why they chose Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) (NASDAQ:Z), NeoPhotonics (NYSE:NPTN), and Skechers USA (NYSE:SKX). IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Steve Symington (Zillow Group): Shares of Zillow Group are up 20% so far in 2017, helped by its strong first-quarter report in May. But the stock would have been a whole lot more expensive had you bought just before its second-quarter report last month; shares plunged 10% in a single day, even after Zillow set new company records for revenue and site traffic. Last quarter, over 178 million monthly unique users hit Zillow's apps and consumer-facing sites -- which include not only its namesake site, but also Trulia, HotPads, StreetEasy, and Naked Apartments -- including a record 182 million in the month of May. And that scale is paying off, with revenue up 28.1% during the quarter to $266.9 million, primarily driven by nearly 30% growth in marketplace revenue to $248.6 million. Within the latter, Zillow saw revenue from its ""Premier Agents"" program climb 29%, and the number of agents who spent over $5,000 per month more than doubled from the same year-ago period. Even so, Zillow still has a long runway for growth here, considering agents spend an estimated $12 billion on advertising their listings each year. Zillow also enjoyed strong 45% growth in revenue, to almost $38 million, from its ""other"" real estate segment; this includes items like agent services, sales from dotloop (which it acquired in 2015), and the rentals business. And revenue from its smaller mortgages segment climbed a respectable 13.8% to just under $21 million. Both of these segments represent significant incremental growth opportunities for Zillow over the long term. But why did the stock decline last month? From an investor's perspective, there was nothing not to like about its second quarter, which easily exceeded Zillow's latest financial guidance. Looking forward, however, Zillow offered a slightly lower-than-expected revenue outlook for its current third quarter, then followed by ""only"" increasing the lower ends of its existing full-year guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Putting aside its habit of underpromising and overdelivering, with shares already up big before that report, it was evident the market wanted more. In the end, though, we're still early in the real estate market's migration to digital. And Zillow stock is arguably the best way for investors to take advantage of that move. I think those willing to take advantage of Zillow's recent decline stand to be handsomely rewarded. Anders Bylund (NeoPhotonics): It's almost impossible to match Alphabet's outsized potential for long-term growth, but I can level the playing field by cheating a little. Meet NeoPhotonics, a maker of optoelectronic components that connect fiber-optic networks to other network types. The company builds transceivers, laser amplifiers, and lasers, and now focuses exclusively on high-speed components after selling off most of its slower legacy products to a sector peer in China. NeoPhotonics collects nearly 80% of its annual revenues from four world-class builders of fiber-optic networking equipment. When Huawei Technologies or Cisco Systems designs a new high-speed optical router or switch, NeoPhotonics sits high on the lists of preferred component providers. This is a healthy business with strong long-term prospects. At the start of 2017, NeoPhotonics had doubled its sales in five years and sported solid cash profits on a quarterly basis. But the company ran into manufacturing issues near the end of 2016, leaving NeoPhotonics unable to fill some of its pending orders. When the production-yield problem was cured, high-speed transceiver demand from Chinese customers hit a lull. Taken together, these short-term troubles did a number on NeoPhotonics' share prices. Share prices have tumbled 43% lower in 2017. The stock is on fire sale, even though the one-two punch of production yield issues and soft Chinese demand are old news now. NeoPhotonics' management expects order volumes to pick up in the second half, and it shouldn't take long to replace the lost sales of recent quarters with fresh high-speed component orders. So you're getting a high-quality growth stock at a massive discount. Fiber-optic networking will only grow more important over the next several years, and NeoPhotonics should be able to ride that macro trend into the long-term sunset. That's the cheat that could help my pick keep up with mighty Alphabet: Start with a small-cap stock under heavy pressure, making the inevitable bounce all the more elastic. Tim Green (Skechers): Footwear designer and retailer Skechers is not an exciting company. But a combination of international growth potential and a beaten-down stock price has created the possibility of stellar returns. Shares of Skechers plummeted in late 2015 as the company's rapid-fire growth began to slow; the stock is still down 50% from its all-time high. But a few quarters of lackluster growth, mainly driven by a sluggish U.S. wholesale business, has now been replaced by a return to double-digit growth. During the second quarter of this year, revenue soared 17.3% year over year, driven by a decent performance from the U.S. wholesale business and double-digit international growth. SKX data by YCharts. The bottom line is taking a hit as Sketchers invests in growing its international business, but the stock looks like a good deal given the company's growth potential. Analysts expect Skechers to produce $1.57 in per-share earnings this year, putting the price-to-earnings ratio at about 16.5. Back out the $680 million of net cash on the balance sheet, and the P/E falls to just 13.7. Skechers stock offers an uncommon combination of growth and value. Growth could slow down as it did last year, but a low valuation gives the company some room for error. If Skechers continues to grow at a healthy pace and the bottom line eventually catches up, the stock could be a big winner over the next few years. ","

Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are turning science fiction into science fact -- and deep learning is at the heart of these advances. These AI systems have the ability to sift through scores of data, recognize patterns, and detect differences that might be imperceptible to humans. Some applications are already achieving remarkable results. One of the more promising areas of research seeking to tap these capabilities is medicine. Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are using the predictive power of AI to provide doctors with additional tools to fight disease. Artificial intelligence is giving physicians new tools to save lives. Image source: Getty Images. Two-year-old start-up Gritstone Oncology has attracted both attention and investment from Alphabet Inc.'s Google Ventures. The biotech company has been studying the use of deep learning to develop highly targeted immunotherapies, which recruit the body's immune system to fight cancer. Immunotherapy has produced significant positive results in about 20% of cancer patients but has been unsuccessful for the remainder. Gritstone is using AI to analyze tumors at the molecular level and narrow the list of immunotherapies to match them with specific patients. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is collaborating with IBM's Watson cognitive AI supercomputer to discover new drugs and approaches for immunotherapy. Watson's consumed 25 million Medline abstracts, over a million articles from medical journals, records from 4 million patients, as well as every drug patent since 1861. The system is regularly updated with the latest available medical research data. What began as a pilot program became a full-fledged partnership when Watson suggested a novel treatment that had recently been recommended by Pfizer's team of researchers, and that therapy is currently undergoing trials. One of the major causes of blindness is damage to the retina resulting from diabetes. Known as diabetic retinopathy (DR), the condition occurs in more than 40% of U.S. patients with the disease. There may be no symptoms in the initial stages, so early detection is critical. Unfortunately, there is currently a shortage of ophthalmologists qualified to diagnose the condition. Verily, a subsidiary of Alphabet's Google, was able to use images of the retina to detect new signals of heart disease risk. Using data from nearly 300,000 patients, the AI system was able to detect indicators in retinal images of age, gender, blood pressure, and blood sugar, and use that information to estimate the risk of heart failure. The researchers published a paper claiming to have achieved accuracy levels equivalent to the results obtained using blood tests, though that paper has not yet been subjected to peer review. HeartFlow is medical technology company that is using graphics processors from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and deep learning to create 3D mapping used to provide early detection of heart disease. Current methods to diagnose the condition involve a costly and invasive medical procedure. HeartFlow's alternative uses CT scans and deep learning to create a 3D model of the heart that can provide detailed representations of blood flow and blockages. Providing a more accurate diagnosis while eliminating the necessity of a costly procedure can reduce the associated healthcare costs by 25%. These recent developments provide insight into the future of AI-assisted medicine. AI is still in its infancy, and researchers have only scratched the surface in terms of the ways that AI will revolutionize medical care. ","
      
    3 Ways AI Is Changing Medicine -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When most tech investors think of the technology that's powering driverless vehicle platforms, they think of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). There's good reason for that, as its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) set the standard for the deep learning/image processing required for autonomous cars to sense and respond to the world around them. But Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) surely stole some of NVIDIA's thunder this week when it revealed that its chips are powering some of the most advanced driverless car technology for Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo subsidiary. ""Waymo's newest vehicles, the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans, feature Intel-based technologies for sensor processing, general compute and connectivity, enabling real-time decisions for full autonomy in city conditions,"" said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in a press release. Image source: Intel. In short, Waymo -- formerly known as the driverless car division of Google -- uses Intel to power all the image processing from sensors, all the data processing for self-driving tasks, and even uses its connectivity chips. This revelation is big news for investors considering that the autonomous car market is expected to reach $77 billion annually by 2035, and Intel is keen on grabbing as much of that market as possible. Waymo currently has about 600 Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the road right now and is already publicly testing its self-driving vans in Phoenix. But it isn't making any money yet, nor has it rolled out its service nationwide. So why is this partnership a good thing for Intel right now? Because having Intel's chips in some of the most advanced driverless platforms on the planet proves the company can pursue new and emerging markets with its processors and still lead with its chip technology. Intel believes that driverless cars will create a $7 trillion a year passenger economy -- a forecast that factors in everything, from driverless vehicle sales and technology spending to the entirely new services that will be built up around the autonomous car ecosystem. Intel's most aggressive push into this area came via its recent $15 billion purchase of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) company Mobileye. ADAS systems control the key semi-autonomous safety features in many new cars -- think automatic braking and lane-keeping -- and they're the foundations upon which fully autonomous driving systems are being built. Mobileye holds more than 60% of the ADAS market, and by purchasing it,  Intel instantly boosted its relevance in the space. Mobileye will not only help Intel expand its own technology offerings but also allow Intel to showcase how well its chips can work within ADAS systems. Buying the company was a smart move on its own, but in light of the latest Waymo news, it looks even smarter. If automakers and tech companies had been questioning whether Intel's chips could handle the heavy requirements of driverless car platforms, that question has certainly been answered. Driverless cars offer a massive opportunity to Intel, but it will still take a while before the company can truly benefit. Mobileye only made $358 million revenue last year, compared to Intel's $59.4 billion, so don't expect any meaningful impact from that purchase right now. And as I mentioned before, Waymo is still in the early stages too, which means that Intel won't be seeing a massive uptick in sales of processors or chips to the Alphabet unit anytime soon either. Intel's Internet of Things Group (IOTG) -- which includes the company's chips sales for transportation -- only contributed 5% of total revenue in 2016. But investors should remain patient. Not many companies are making significant revenue from the driverless car market right now, and it's not expected to fully mature until around 2050.  In the meantime, stay confident that Intel will be in the mix for the long term: It's already powering some of the most advanced autonomous vehicle systems on the road. ","

Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT), a biotech focused on liver diseases, fell 21% as of 3:26 p.m. EDT Thursday. The fall is traceable to a safety announcement released by the FDA that warns of an increased risk of ""serious liver injury and death"" when Intercept's liver disease drug Ocaliva is dosed incorrectly. The announcement was made in response to 19 patient deaths that have been reported by users of the Ocaliva since the drug was first approved for sale in May 2016. In addition, 11 other cases of serious liver injury have also been reported. This announcement follows a letter that was sent out by Intercept's Chief Medical Officer last week that urged providers to stick to the drug's approved dosing scheduled. Given the renewed concerns surrounding Ocaliva -- which is Intercept's only marketed drug -- it is easy to understand why shares are being slammed on Thursday. Image source: Getty Images. Intercept's management team did its best to calm investor's nerves last week at an important investor conference following the release of their own letter, but Thursday's update certainly raises new concerns about Ocaliva's safety profile. In response, it is possible that providers might be much more tepid with their use of the drug moving forward, which, if true, could put a dent in Intercept's growth trajectory. It's a possibility that Thursday's move will prove to be an overreaction, but given the high number of patient deaths and liver injuries, I think the smart play is to watch this story unfold from the safety of the sidelines.

Jeremy Bowman,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is no friend to brick-and-mortar retailers. The e-commerce giant's breakneck growth and speedy delivery has put dozens of traditional retailers out of business and is squeezing even more. Amazon is the biggest reason for the ""retail apocalypse"" that is causing nearly 10,000 stores across the country to close this year, a new record. That's why it was surprising when department store chain Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) said it would start carrying Amazon products in 10 of its stores earlier this month. Kohl's said it would launch a new ""Amazon smart home"" experience at 10 of its locations in Los Angeles and Chicago areas where customers can learn about and test devices like the Amazon Echo and Fire TV. The store-in-store spaces will also be staffed by Amazon sales associates. Shares rose 5% the day the news came out. The partnership between the two retailers strengthened this week when Kohl's said it would accept returns on Amazon products in 82 of its stores, again in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas, a move that investors again cheered sending the stock up 2% at time of writing. Image source: Kohl's. Kohl's said it would pack and ship all Amazon returns at no charge to customers, essentially accepting them as if they were Kohl's items. It's unclear if Amazon is paying Kohl's for this service, or what Kohl's strategic incentive is here as it's extremely unusual for a retailer to accept a competitor's returns. Richard Schepp, Kohl's chief administrative officer, said, ""This is a great example of how Kohl's and Amazon are leveraging each other's strengths -- the power of Kohl's store portfolio and omnichannel capabilities combined with the power of Amazon's reach and loyal customer base."" Kohl's shares appear to be rising as some suspect that Amazon will make a play to acquire it, but unless that's the retailer's goal, these moves seem incredibly odd, especially as there's no strength of Amazon's that Kohl's is benefiting from by allowing its returns. Plenty of retailers in the past have teamed up with Amazon only to regret it later. Toys R Us declared bankruptcy this week, putting its 1,600 stores and 64,000 employees. While some see a debt hangover from a 2005 leveraged buyout is the primary reason for the company's misfortune, a deal with Amazon in 2000 may have sealed its fate. The toy giant signed a 10-year agreement with Amazon that year, stocking its goods on Amazon and becoming Amazon's exclusive toy seller. Toys R Us also agreed to give up its own website, as ToysRUs.com redirected to Amazon. Toys R Us sued Amazon in 2004 after Amazon began hosting other toy sellers. Toys R Us won and eventually got $51 million from Amazon and the right to terminate the deal, but it had lost valuable time in building its own online business by then. Similarly, Borders, which declared bankruptcy in 2011, made the foolish decision to give its online business over to Amazon, and Target (NYSE:TGT) has feuded with Amazon repeatedly over the years after making the mistake of putting Amazon in charge of its e-commerce site for a decade until 2011. In 2012, Target said it would stop selling Amazon's products like Kindles, and just weeks ago said it would move away from Amazon Web Services after Amazon took over Whole Foods. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) never teamed up with Amazon in any capacity, but the world's largest retailer is doing everything to slow its rival's momentum. It's partnered with Google Express on deliveries, NVIDIA on AI, and called on its tech suppliers to ditch AWS. If even Wal-Mart is sounding the alarm on Amazon, it seems like all of brick-and-mortar retail should be doing the same. Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ) made a similar decision to Kohl's this summer when it said it would begin selling its Kenmore appliances on Amazon, but that was widely seen as a desperate move. Fresh off its acquisition of Whole Foods, it would be surprising for Amazon to make another blockbuster retail buyout so soon. However, Amazon has a history of moving quickly on new opportunities, and has shown increasing interest in brick-and-mortar with its expansion of its Amazon Books stores, in addition to the Whole Foods deal. Still, Kohl's is not Whole Foods, which gave Amazon several things it badly wanted. Most importantly, Amazon gained a significant presence and a profitable piece of the $800 billion grocery industry that it had been unable to gain itself after a decade of trying. Amazon also got a well-respected brand in organic food and 450 supermarkets across the country, many of which are in high-income neighborhoods where Amazon's best customers live. Kohl's offers none of those things. Instead, its 1,100 stores sell mostly the type of merchandise that is already available on Amazon. So an all-out acquisition would make little sense for Amazon, but a strategic partnership that allows it to sell its gadgets and for customers to make returns would be in its interest. For Kohl's, questions remain about why it would give up its own retail space to its fiercest and fastest-growing competitor. Investors may be cheering the move now, but as the examples above illustrate, they may eventually regret sleeping with the enemy. ","

Harsh Chauhan,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) confirmed that its turnaround is on track with a solid fourth-quarter report on Aug. 31. The cloud computing specialist delivered outstanding revenue growth thanks to a spike in customer additions and transaction size, posting a lower-than-expected net loss. The company's current-quarter revenue guidance also turned out to be better than expected, allaying investors' worries regarding potential market-share concession to the likes of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Cisco. So what led to Nutanix's terrific growth last quarter, and is it capable of sustaining its momentum? To find out, let's take a look at three key points from Nutanix management. Image Source: Getty Images Nutanix added 875 new customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, ending the year with 7,051 clients, up from 3,768 customers at the end of the prior year. That's an 87% increase. What's important to note is that the company is getting more and more repeat orders from its existing clients. In fact, 70% of Nutanix's bookings last quarter were from existing customers as compared to 64% in the year-ago quarter. And the company has been focusing on larger deals. For instance, a quarter of Nutanix's billings in the fourth quarter came from its top 25 customers, with the number of $1 million-plus deals increasing 39% year over year. Additionally, there are over 166 customers who have made purchases of more than $2 million from Nutanix. This is good news for Nutanix investors as higher repeat orders reduce the amount spent by the company on customer acquisition. This was clearly evident last quarter as it spent 58.6% of its revenue on sales and marketing, down from 62.9% in the year-ago quarter. Looking ahead, Nutanix believes that it can get more business from its large clients. CEO Dheeraj Pandey said, ""... we feel very good about our large customers becoming even larger, and many of them are now interested in software agreements with us in fiscal 2018."" Nutanix's software-related bookings jumped 96% year over year last quarter. The company generated 17% of its $289.2 million worth of bookings from the software side of the business. The growth in this segment has allowed Nutanix to make up for the margin erosion that it has witnessed due to an increase in DRAM prices. Nutanix anticipates its gross margin to remain flat this quarter despite a 10% projected increase in DRAM costs, thanks to a higher mix of software sales. The company believes that its recently launched multi-cloud management software -- Nutanix Calm -- will play a key role in pushing stronger sales. Nutanix Calm targets the hyper-converged cloud environment where enterprises can run applications on both public and private cloud infrastructures. The platform will allow enterprise customers to separate cloud application management from the related infrastructure, enabling hyper-convergence. The company has already made some progress in this space by partnering with the Google Cloud Platform, allowing users to manage applications in a hyper-converged environment. This could be a big deal for Nutanix as the hyper-converged cloud infrastructure market could be worth an estimated $8.5 billion in 2020. Nutanix's focus on increasing software sales and getting more business from existing customers should ideally have a positive impact on its margins, but this hasn't been the case so far due to higher DRAM prices. In fact, the company's gross margin fell 300 basis points year over year in the fourth quarter to 58.3%. In all, Nutanix's gross margin was impacted by 600 basis points in fiscal year 2017 because of higher DRAM pricing. But the company has now decided to lock in DRAM prices, so it believes that it can hold its gross margin steady at 58% in the new fiscal year. While Nutanix management is witnessing a slowdown in the growth rate of DRAM prices, it might not get quick relief on this front as DRAM supply is still constrained. However, research firm Gartner believes that DRAM pricing will plummet in 2019, as increased demand will force suppliers to increase capacity. Nutanix will have to execute impressive cost management until then to ward off the negative implications of higher pricing. Nutanix has a lot going for it right now as it is pulling the right strings to take advantage of the potential growth in the hyper-converged cloud market. Of course, there is a headwind in the form of higher DRAM prices, but investors should be pleased with the company's strategy of pushing high-margin sales as it should help it counter that weakness and position itself for long-term growth.

    3 Things Nutanix Management Wants You to Know -- The Motley Fool

"Tyler Crowe, Brian Stoffel, and John Rosevear",09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investing with an extremely long time horizon can be challenging for a number of reasons, not least of which is that monumental changes in society  can happen over such extended periods. Case in point: There's only one company that was in the Dow Jones Industrial Average 100 years ago that's still a component today -- General Electric. Back then, the index was dominated by companies focused on steel, rubber, and railroads. Still, recognizing that it's an incredible challenge to predict what companies will be thriving a century in the future, we asked three of our contributing investors to give it their best shots. Their picks: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), American Water Works (NYSE:AWK), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Below, they explain why. Image source: Getty Images. John Rosevear (Amazon.com): A century is an awfully long time -- far too long to make truly accurate predictions. But if I had to pick one company that looks set not just to survive, but to grow significantly for decades to come, I'd go with Amazon. The e-commerce giant's stock has already had a run for the ages over the last 20 years, of course. But the thing that gets my attention is this: It's still, 20 years later, chasing (and finding) major revenue growth. Consider: Amazon's revenue was up 25% last quarter, to a hefty $38 billion, on strong retail sales and a good result for the Amazon Web Services cloud-infrastructure business. That's not a fluke -- in fact, it fell short of Wall Street expectations, believe it or not. We've become accustomed to big revenue growth from Amazon, and there's more to come. Between Amazon's expansion into new retail categories (like groceries and autos), its fast-growing artificial-intelligence expertise, and that cloud infrastructure business, there are new revenue doors opening all the time. Of course, profits are hit-or-miss with Amazon, as it tends to plow most of its cash back into new opportunities. The thinking is that at some point this will pay off big for shareholders, of course. It could be a bumpy ride between here and there -- Amazon's stock is no bargain at current valuations, and it could take a hit if the market gets choppy -- but over the very long haul, I like its chances to deliver outsize returns to patient investors. Tyler Crowe (American Water Works): We as investors are bad at two things. We overestimate how much can get done in a year or less, and underestimate what we can get done over multiyear time horizons. The pace of change in technology, health, energy, and consumer behavior makes it hard for us to even conceptualize what our world will look like several decades from now. For all the changes we will likely see, though, there are some constants in life. We are still living creatures who need to sustain ourselves, and that means that companies which provide essentials like food and water are the kinds of investments you want if you are looking at a holding period of a century or more. With that in mind, American Water Works is worth considering. The two things that make American Water Works specifically compelling are the company's footprint and the regulated nature of its business. It is one of the nation's largest providers of municipal drinking water and wastewater treatment. Its large, multistate asset portfolio gives it both the financial fortitude and the operational base to either acquire smaller private water treatment operators or take over public operations from municipalities. Also, thanks to the regulated nature of the business, American Water is guaranteed a rate of return on new investments that ensures steadily growing earnings. It's impossible to make guarantees in investing, but I can guarantee you that 100 years from now, humans will still need water. And chances are, the way we get that water won't change much, either. That makes American Water Works a great bet for a long time horizon. Brian Stoffel (Alphabet): Outside of Facebook, there's no company that's even close to having as much data on hand as Alphabet, parent company to Google. In a world of artificial intelligence and deep learning, the company with the most data will have an undeniable edge over the competition. For well over a decade, Google has been the default search engine for the world outside of China. Throw in all the data collected by Google's other six products with over one billion active users -- Play Store, Maps, GMail, YouTube, Android, and Chrome -- and Alphabet's sitting on the digital equivalent of gold mine. But here's the real thing that makes me think I could own this stock for as long as I possibly can: multiple futures. Right now, advertising accounts for 89%  of the company's revenue. I don't expect that to change anytime soon. The company's ""Other Bets"" -- which include self-driving car unit Waymo, life science company Verily, and a host of other startups -- represent low-risk, high-reward opportunities to meaningfully drive the company's bottom and top lines. While most of these bets will end in failure, all it will take is one or two ""hits"" to make a huge difference. Given a 100-year time frame, I'm willing to bet that at least one of these ventures will succeed -- and reward shareholders handsomely. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for 100 Years -- The Motley Fool

Mike Murphy,09212017,MarketWatch,09142017,"Published: Sept 21, 2017 4:52 a.m. ET Google bolsters hardware offerings; tech giants had teamed up on Pixel By Google and HTC Corp. announced a $1.1 billion cooperation agreement Wednesday night, as the U.S. tech giant moved to bolster its hardware offerings. The agreement had been expected, and HTC’s stock had been halted on the Taiwan exchange pending the announcement. Alphabet Inc.’s Google and HTC already work together to produce the Pixel smartphone. HTC will receive $1.1. billion in cash, and in exchange, a number of HTC employees — many of whom work on Pixel production already — will join Google, the companies said in a joint statement. Separately, Google will receive HTC intellectual property through a non-exclusive licensing agreement. “We’re excited and can’t wait to welcome members of the HTC team who will be joining Google to fuel further innovation and future product development in consumer hardware,” Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of hardware at Google, said in a statement. HTC once owned about 9% of the global smartphone market, but has fallen behind in recent years to Apple Inc.

lawsuit accusing former Uber executive Anthony Levandowski of stealing self-driving car tech trundles toward its Oct. 10 trial date. Before an Uber lawyer disclosed the figure Wednesday, the damage claim had been redacted from public court filings and is tied to one of the nine trade secrets Waymo says Uber copied. Read: Google vs. Uber: Silicon Valley battle looks set for juicy public trial In the lawsuit, Waymo has accused Levandowski of downloading 14,000 proprietary files before quitting to start his own self-driving vehicle company that Uber soon acquired. Uber has vigorously denied that it has used Waymo’s trade secrets in developing its own system for autonomous driving. Though jury selection is currently set for Oct. 10, Waymo tried to convince Judge William Alsup to push the trial date to December after it recently received a cache of documents from Uber. Alsup said he would rule Oct. 3 on moving the date, but he advised Waymo’s lawyers to make a “good college try” to be ready for the current trial date. During the hearing, Waymo’s attorneys alleged that Levandowski had taken “thousands of photographs” of company documents displayed on a personal computer to avoid detection while duplicating the materials. At one point, a Waymo lawyer suggested that Uber’s attorneys had 64,000 Levandowski photos in their possession, though Uber said some of those are personal. Read: Why the Waymo-Uber trade secret theft case is not over While inspecting several sample documents provided by Waymo attorneys, Judge Alsup noted that the photos looked like they have been taken with an iPhone, and said “anthony@google.com” in the upper right corner. Waymo’s lawyers said that they believed the samples were related to one of the trade secrets involved in the litigation because, among other things, the color scheme matched internal Waymo documents. At several points during the proceedings Alsup expressed frustration with the attorneys and repeatedly admonished both sides for filing so many documents under seal and away from public scrutiny. “This court belongs to the public, not to you lawyers,” Alsup said. Judge Alsup just did a very beautiful PIcard face palm impersonation after waiting ""fifteen minutes"" for Uber to answer his question Alphabet has a tangled relationship with Uber, including owning a stake in the mobile ride-hailing company since a venture-capital subsidiary made an investment in Uber in 2013.

By It’s no surprise that economic juggernauts China and Japan keep swapping places at the top of the list of biggest U.S. creditors. What might strike observers as odd, however, is that tiny Ireland has been lurking at No. 3 for more than a year. The country holds more than $310 billion in U.S. government paper, according to the Treasury International Capital, or TIC, report released on Monday. But Ireland’s ranking is puzzling given that economic heavyweights with deeper financial markets, including the United Kingdom and Germany, keep less Treasurys on their books than an arguably peripheral member of the eurozone. Ireland does not have Japan’s massive pension fund and life insurance companies that need to buy long-dated government debt to match their lengthy liabilities. Nor does it have China’s exporters, whose rapid growth has enabled the country to accumulate its hoard of foreign-exchange reserves. See: Why China has been gobbling up U.S. government paper Investors and analysts suspect Ireland appears as one of the U.S.’s largest creditors on paper because Google parent Alphabet and other American corporations like to hold their overseas profits in highly liquid Treasurys. These cash-rich firms want to avoid the 35% repatriation tax, but they don’t want to let the foreign-earned cash sit idly by. “There might be some correlation because U.S. corporations with European subsidiaries tend to hold most of their offshore corporate cash in Ireland and Luxembourg. Those are the two main places where they have their offshore cash,” said Lance Pan, director of investment research at Capital Advisors Group, which manages money for American firms. As a country that offers a combination of low corporate taxes and an English-speaking workforce, it’s little surprise Ireland is now the country of choice for many U.S. companies looking for a launching pad for European operations. It currently hosts the European headquarters of Google

                                   , which has located its main office in Luxembourg, hold more than $200 billion worth of government paper, according to their corporate filings. Microsoft and Apple alone added more than $80 billion of U.S. government paper in the past five years, doubling the previous amount. At the same time, Ireland’s holdings have grown at a similar pace, rising $200 billion since 2012. Most of the sovereign paper in the country is placed in so-called custodial accounts. But the Treasury Department does not differentiate the composition and identity of the actual owners, and simply categorizes by nationality—in other words, central banks are lumped with private money managers. This can lead to some curiosities in the data. Belgium’s well-documented hoard of U.S. debt, just shy of Ireland’s number, was partly due to the holdings of Brussels-based Euroclear, which facilitates trading for bonds and securities, and sometimes holds assets on the behalf of others. Some have speculated China used this very channel as a conduit for its purchases of government paper. But to chalk up Ireland’s U.S. bond holdings as only reflecting its tax-haven status appears shortsighted. Though Ireland is a financial center akin to Belgium, it “is a complicated case ... it is not simply a reflection of its activity in financial intermediation,” said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Plenty of hedge funds are based in Ireland, many of which might make sizable bets on the Treasury market. In fact, close to 2,500 hedge funds, private equity firms and real estate funds are based in the country, data from a trade body for local money managers show. Until the U.S. introduces a tax holiday, if it does, Ireland will most likely keep its lofty place in the Treasury Department’s ranking, analysts believe. As for the impact on the broader market, analysts are mixed. Some market participants have flagged concerns that corporate treasurers might act like flighty portfolio managers during market turmoil. In other words, when the bond market sells off, the likes of Apple and Microsoft could head for the exit door instead of holding tight, stoking the fire sale. But Setser says treasurers don’t act like free-wheeling traders and their behavior is more akin to central banks. They’ll behave more like “reserve managers. They have more cash than they know what to do with,” he said. What’s more, corporate treasurers tend to search for shorter-maturity debt with higher credit ratings, which are highly liquid, said Richard Piccirillo, a portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income. These treasurers are typically “keeping it conservative, you do not want to realize losses on your security holdings ...you have cash, you aren’t trying to earn a large return,” he said. And as much financial heft as U.S. corporations carry, they pale against the punch of sovereign nations, which themselves have been unable to make a dent on the Treasurys market. Even after China and Japan sold $211 billion of U.S. government paper over a 12-month period from February 2016, the 10-year Treasury note

                                   surging more than 9% Wednesday. That’s because as part of the Apple TV product refresh, the company said it was going to include “Dolby Vision” among the technologies it licenses to improve video quality. In fact, Apple executives name-checked Dolby’s tech specifically during the event at its under-construction Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. Opinion: Dolby Laboratories is a stock to watch after Apple’s new iPhone launch The iPhone is easily Apple’s most valuable product by sales volume, with iPhone revenue accounting for more than 60% of the company’s sales. A Wednesday note from RBC Capital Markets said the company may ship as many as 46.4 million iPhones in the fourth quarter, and the analysts expect double-digit percentage growth in fiscal year 2018. But RBC analysts didn’t have much to add on the potential for suppliers, at least until a full accounting of the components inside the phone. More: iPhone X launch date pressures Apple stock as well as those of its suppliers “We would expect to have more visibility on content and allocation when products are released and teardowns are available,” the analysts wrote. As investors and analysts await the late-September iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus launch, and the November iPhone X launch, here are some companies worth watching: Dolby Originally known for its audio products, the $6 billion San Francisco company develops a range of tech for entertainment on the large and small screen. Not only will the tech licensed by Apple benefit the Apple TV, it will also be used in other new Apple products, including the iPhone X. Don’t miss: Apple and Fitbit expected to boost sales of smartwatches and other wearable tech For this year’s fourth quarter, the company is expected to haul in $243 million in revenue — mostly from licensing — with adjusted earnings of 25 cents a share, according to FactSet, though it is unclear how much of Dolby’s revenue will come from its new licensing agreement with Apple. It’s also unclear exactly how well Apple TV has sold in the past because Apple wraps those sales into its “other products” category, which was worth a total of about $11 billion in 2016. Jabil The Florida-based outfit is decidedly not a household name, but it is worth $5.5 billion in market capitalization. The electronics-manufacturing company makes iPhone and iPad casings through its Greenpoint operations, a segment that is worth about 24% of the company’s overall sales, or about $4 billion of $18.35 billion in revenue expected for 2017, according to FactSet. Apple announced Tuesday that all of the new iPhone models would feature glass surfaces on the top and bottom, in part to facilitate wireless charging. That’s a pretty significant change that could have ramifications for Jabil. Intel Corp. The world’s largest chip maker may be poised to cash in on the new iPhone series.

Sam Schechner,09212017,MarketWatch,09142017,"Published: Sept 21, 2017 6:17 a.m. ET By The European Union's executive arm said Thursday that it is ready to propose new tax taxes on digital companies like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google by next spring if there isn't ""adequate global progress"" toward a rewrite of corporate tax rules at an international level. The bloc's executive arm, the European Commission, floated several options that it said could be rolled out in the short term to raise tax revenue on digital companies, which it contends declare too little profit in the region. While the commission said a global solution would be preferable, it added that it ""stands ready"" to propose legislation if major countries, including the U.S., can't make headway on new rules. The threat of new tax legislation comes amid pressure from big EU countries including France and Germany, which have recently increased their push to change corporate tax rules at any level to capture what they say are billions of euros in lost revenue. Finance ministers for EU countries expressed support over the weekend for renewing efforts to change international rules to better reflect digital profits rules via the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a forum of wealthy countries that includes the EU, U.S. and Japan. European officials argue that companies are taking advantage of outdated tax rules that were designed on the basis of physical assets and where the companies operate, rather than virtual businesses like online advertising and data mining. ""It's a question of fairness: Digital companies use European networks and infrastructure, and often their content and data are created by Europeans. Like all taxpayers, they must pay their fair share of tax,"" said EU finance chief Pierre Moscovici, adding that the current system allows for ""a big loss in tax revenues for the budgets of EU member states."" Failing any progress at the OECD level, the commission said its preferred route would be to amend previously proposed rules to reform the corporate tax base in Europe. The initiative--known as the common consolidated corporate-tax base--is designed to create a common set of rules spelling out how profits should be taxed across the bloc. But any changes could further delay the legislative process as that proposal has already been held up in negotiations with member states who differ over how to proceed. The other options that the European Commission floated Thursday as short-term and supplementary measures include an ""equalization tax"" on digital revenue--as opposed to profit--that has been promoted by France and garnered the support from at least 10 EU nations last weekend. It would impose a new tax on companies that have very high digital revenue but pay little in corporate income tax, according to officials in the French finance ministry. The commission also mentioned a potential withholding tax on digital transactions that would be levied on online providers of goods and services that aren't resident in the EU, and a levy on digital services that would hit transactions made between in-country customers of a nonresident company--such as if a company sold online ads to people in France without a taxable presence there. The commission acknowledged in its paper Thursday that these taxes have ""pros and cons"" including potential conflicts with tax treaties aimed at avoiding double taxation, as well as with state aid rules and free-trade agreements. Any tax legislation would also require debate that could stretch for months, and would typically under current rules require unanimous approval by EU member states. ""Yet something has to be done,"" the commission added.

Sara Sjolin,09212017,MarketWatch,09142017,"Published: Sept 20, 2017 4:57 p.m. ET Dollar jumps to 2-week high as Federal Reserve says it will start asset reduction next month By U.S. stock benchmarks ended a volatile session mostly in the green, with the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 carving out fresh all-time highs, as the Federal Reserve announced that, for the first time in nine years, it would start reducing the size of its $4.5 trillion asset portfolio commencing in October. The U.S. central bank kept interest rates unchanged, as widely expected, but said it would start to shrink its balance sheet by $10 billion a month. The Fed also signaled a December rate increase remains on the table as the central bank embarks on an unprecedented unwind of crisis-era asset purchases that had helped to buoy markets over the past decade. During a news conference to detail its policy plans, Yellen said the unwind would be conducted “gradually and predictably.” Check out: A live blog of the Fed’s news conference “Even though this is a slow and deliberate and thoughtful unwind plan, it is not without its potential to rattle markets,” said Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco.

Read: Why stock market investors shouldn’t sweat a shrinking Fed balance sheet The Fed kept its targeted federal-funds rate between 1% to 1.25%, and said the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma isn’t likely to materially alter the course of the economy over the medium term, underscoring the central bank’s determination to normalize interest-rate policy. The Fed’s interest-rate projections, known as the so-called dot plot, implies a rate hike in December and three more in 2018. Some industry participants have been describing the asset reduction as the “great unwind” and worrying that it might roil markets. “It is the start of something unknown, it is going to start jitters. It is going to make us tremble,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. However, the Fed is aiming to offer as little disruption as possible, he noted. “I’ll admit that it feels a little surreal that this Federal Reserve with its addiction to manipulating markets is actually trying to kick the habit. The unwinding of the balance sheet will dominate markets for at least the next two years and cements our outlook for higher rates,” said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at SIT Investments, which manages some $7 billion. Yellen emphasized, during the news conference, that the central bank was monitoring stubbornly low inflation closely, with an eye to seeing it return to its 2% annual target. Inflation has been kept in check, despite an otherwise healthy labor market, which should theoretically lift prices and inflation. The Fed chief said policy makers are aware of the risk of prices suddenly jolting higher: “We want to be careful not to allow the economy to overheat to somewhere later on to have to have tighten monetary policy rapidly and…cause a recession.” Several central-bank officials already wanted to start winding down the Fed’s portfolio of government securities in July, but the majority wanted to hold until a later date. In other economic news on Wednesday, a reading on existing-home sales for August showed that sales dropped for the fourth time in five months as real-estate agents continue to blame a lack of available homes to buy. The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.35 million. See: MarketWatch’s economic calendar.

Jeff Reeves,09212017,MarketWatch,09142017,"Published: Sept 18, 2017 9:12 a.m. ET The era of cooperation among tech giants is coming to an end By Silicon Valley is undergoing a seismic shift. And for perhaps the first time, it’s not because of a new product “disrupting” things, or a sassy new unicorn that just arrived on the scene. This time, dangerous pressures are being brought to bear by good, old-fashioned competition. The latest example: Oracle Corp.

Raise your hand if you think they are going to simply divide the pie 50-50 and part as friends. Nobody? Ok. Then you get it. Because now that even $200 billion corporations like Oracle have trouble delivering when they are competing with the FAANG quintet, life is going to get very interesting in the tech sector.

And, yes, some discerning Facebookers are starting to wonder what the heck is behind what they are “liking,” after Mark Zuckerberg & Co. unwittingly played a role in publishing Russia-linked content meant to sway the presidential election. But let’s get real. Collectively, those five tech darlings command over $3 trillion in market capitalization — roughly 13% of the entire S&P 500

                                   And they’re not going anywhere. Still, you have to wonder: How big can these companies get before the only option is to find growth in a business dominated by one of the others? Just look at hardware, which has long been the sole territory of Apple. There was much anticipation before the iPhone X event, but after we got the actual device there seemed to be a lot of investors and consumers who were let down. And at the same time, Amazon’s power play on next-gen hardware — the Echo Show — just started shipping in June to rave reviews. This innovative gadget has all the power of voice assistant Alexa, married with video calling and a mainline into the Amazon.com e-commerce ecosystem. Go ahead, wander around outside and ask 100 people on the street which device they were more excited about in the past two years — the Alexa-powered Echo line or the last few iterations of the iPhone. Then tell me which device most consumers think is more impressive, and has more long-term potential. This is quite a coup in itself, but even more substantial when you consider Amazon also shipped 2.4 million devices in the Kindle family during the second quarter, cementing itself as the No. 4 tablet producer on the planet. And it doesn’t stop there. Amazon isn’t just taking a shot at consumer-electronics hardware with its strategy, but also gunning to snag share from Google search results. After all, it’s easier to ask “What is Pokemon Go?” to Alexa than to tappity-tap on your mobile device, isn’t it? Looking beyond Alexa, what is the Fire tablet with Amazon Instant Video if not a way to get people off Netflix and iTunes, and on to the Amazon content platform instead? Those are the stakes in Silicon Valley right now. It’s tempting to laugh off competitive attempts in Big Tech after so many false starts. Yes, BlackBerry Ltd. 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    US:BBRY

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                   has fallen on its face. And, yes, Microsoft has been largely been laughed out of the room with its also-ran Bing search engine and its all-but-extinct Windows Phone efforts. But right now, in 2017 and looking ahead to 2018, the other FAANG companies would be stupid to not see Amazon as a serious threat to their business models and future profitability. The most amazing thing of all is that it has taken us the better part of two decades to arrive at a moment when tech companies actually see themselves as competitors. For many years the big names of Silicon Valley were partners in crime. Just wrap your head around the fact that Eric Schmidt was on Apple’s board until 2009, a little over two years after the original iPhone hit the market and four years after Google acquired the company that would be the foundation for its world-dominating Android OS. To investors and traditional capitalists, that kind of access used to be the premise of corporate espionage cases. But until recently, it was just the way techies did business! Many Silicon Valley fanboys chalk that up to bonhomie, some kind of dot-com fraternity that prevented these mega-companies from separating hard-fought friendships from billion-dollar businesses. But personally, I think it’s more hubris than anything else. After all, in the famous words of Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, competition is for losers and monopolies should be every entrepreneur’s goal — not just for profits, but for all mankind! “Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world,” he wrote. “Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for making it better.” Deep down, I honestly think Apple, Google, Amazon and the rest thought they could take over the world on their own, and without consequences. The problem is that, at best, each of the FAANG stocks is only 20% of the way there. So what are you going to do if you’re Amazon, after you’re done gobbling up the lowbrow retailers and traditional booksellers of the world? Put it in neutral and pay a dividend? Abandon revenue growth and instead rely on layoffs, buybacks and price increases to drive the bottom line? Or are you going to hunger for more, and turn on your friends? History may record 2000 as the year that tech companies were catapulted to another level, thanks to the convergence of internet technologies and a new generation of innovative tech personalities. But there’s a good chance that 2017 and 2018 will go down in history as the period when the tech sector turned on itself, with previously untouchable internet giants knocked down a peg or two by one another. Or maybe regulators will crash the party. There’s a small, but serious, chance that somebody in Washington wakes up and channels the attitudes of trust-busting regulators who split up the likes of AT&T

The initial iPhone in 2007 was a 2G-only device in a world where 3G products had been available for two years. The same occurred with the first-generation of LTE: Apple held back support from the iPhone 4S and, instead, only upgraded the iPhone 5 in September 2012, a full 18 months after other smartphones were using it. Gigabit LTE can fundamentally change how users interact with their devices and how network carriers, including Verizon Communications Inc.

                                    plan for future upgrades. As the name implies, Gigabit LTE is rated at a theoretical peak bandwidth of 1,000 Mbps, compared with 600 Mbps for the iPhone 8 and X. This gives Gigabit LTE-enabled phones the ability to download applications more quickly, stream higher-quality video and take advantage of upcoming features like streaming apps, which are downloaded on demand when needed, rather than being pre-installed. Maybe more important for consumers today is that even if the network in your area hasn’t upgraded the infrastructure to support Gigabit LTE speeds, the integration of the technology on your phone gives it significant advantages on those older networks. That includes better signal reliability when you are further from a cell tower or inside a building and a better likelihood of maximizing the bandwidth of that network. T-Mobile shut out If you are a T-Mobile user or have followed the company’s announcements about its 600 MHz network upgrade, keep in mind that the iPhone 8 and X lack the ability to connect to it. T-Mobile customers have a good reason to look for other devices. Considering Apple calls both the iPhone 8 and X flagship products, and that the iPhone X was “the future of the smartphone,” the lack of support for Gigabit LTE is a glaring hole in the feature set. Apple vs. Qualcomm The reasons behind the omission are perhaps even more interesting. The only modem to support Gigabit LTE currently on the market is the Qualcomm Snapdragon X16 LTE.

Joe Tenebruso,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) versus Google. These tech titans have battled against each other for over a decade, all the while rewarding their shareholders with the spoils of war. But which is the better buy today? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. Google -- which reorganized itself as a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in 2015 -- dominates the worldwide internet search market. Its share of U.S. search ad revenue will grow to 80% in 2018, according to eMarketer, up from nearly 76% in 2016. On a global basis, Google's commands an even higher share, with StatCounter placing it at more than 90%. Apple's iPhone consistently receives high marks in build quality, performance, and aesthetics. The same is true of Macs and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the iPad. But while Google is the unquestioned leader in search, Apple often holds a minority share of the markets in which it competes. In fact, despite the popularity of the iPhone, Apple is estimated to have only about a 15% share of the global smartphone operating system market, according to market intelligence company IDC, compared to 85% for Google's Android. It's true that Apple's products are typically far more profitable than Android devices, and Apple therefore holds a much larger portion of the industry's profits. Yet it also remains true that Apple faces significantly more formidable competition in its core markets than Google does in search. So, in terms of the strength of their competitive moats in their core businesses, Google has the edge over Apple. Advantage: Alphabet Both Apple and Alphabet are incredibly profitable businesses. Over the past 12 months, Apple and generated more than $46 billion in net income, while Alphabet earned over $19 billion. Their cash production is similarly impressive. Apple delivered a staggering $51 billion in free cash flow over the past year, compared to $25 billion for Alphabet. Yet while both companies excel in these areas, Apple's profitability and cash generation are simply unparalleled. Advantage: Apple Over the past half-decade, Google (now Alphabet) has generated about 30% more growth in earnings per share than Apple. AAPL EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YCharts. This trend is likely to continue, with analysts forecasting that Alphabet will grow its EPS at more than 19% annually over the next five years, compared to slightly more than 12% for Apple. So, in terms of growth -- both recent past and future -- Alphabet is the clear leader. Advantage: Alphabet No better buy discussion should take place without a look at valuation. Let's check out some key value metrics for Apple and Alphabet, including price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios. Metric Apple Alphabet (Class A Shares) Trailing P/E ratio 17.37 34.92 Forward P/E ratio 13.89 24.08 P/FCF 15.35 26.22 Data source: Yahoo! Finance and Morningstar. On all three metrics, Apple's shares are considerably less expensive than Alphabet's. Even if we factor in Alphabet's higher expected growth rates, Apple's stock is still more attractively priced based on its price-to-earnings-to-growth, or PEG, ratio of 1.42, compared to 1.65 for Alphabet. So, valuation-wise, Apple is the better bargain. Advantage: Apple With this better buy battle all tied up after four rounds, let's look at some additional aspects of these tech titans' businesses to help you decide what's best for your portfolio. Income-seeking investors will likely appreciate Apple's 1.7% dividend yield. Apple has increased its quarterly cash dividend payment by more than 10% annually over the last three years, and with an earnings payout ratio of less than 30%,  shareholders should expect that trend to continue. On the other hand, growth investors may appreciate Alphabet's ""moonshots."" The company is investing aggressively in high-risk yet potentially ultrahigh-reward projects like those being tackled by its Verily Life Sciences unit. Verily is trying to ""radically transform"" healthcare, with Sci-Fi like projects such as glucose-monitoring contact lenses for diabetics, bioelectronics medicine, and advanced surgical robots, just to name a few. Although many of these programs may fail, the ones that do succeed can boost shareholder returns -- and potentially even benefit the human race as a whole. Advantage: You decide Ultimately, you'll have to decide which of these factors is more important to you. If you're a value-focused dividend lover, then Apple is the way to go. If a wide competitive moat and exciting growth opportunities are more your speed, then Alphabet is the better choice. Either way, you'll be buying an outstanding business. ","

Hardware is one of Google's ""three most promising bets,"" right alongside YouTube and Cloud, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. And now Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google is taking its investment in its 2016-launched Made by Google products even further. Google is acquiring part of smartphone-maker HTC in a $1.1 billion deal to ""fuel further innovation and future product development in consumer hardware,"" Google said in a press release on Wednesday. The deal has big implications for Alphabet. Namely, it reinforces the company's growing efforts to ramp-up its Google-branded hardware efforts, proving Alphabet is taking the opportunity as seriously as it says it is. The Google Pixel smartphone. Image source: Google. Under Alphabet's $1.1 billion cash deal to purchase part of HTC's business, a team from HTC's hardware business will join Google's hardware organization. Many of these employees were already working with Google to develop Pixel smartphones, Google said. As part of the purchase, Google will also obtain a non-exclusive license for HTC intellectual property. Before this acquisition, Google had contracted out engineering talent at HTC to help Google bring to market its first Pixel smartphone last fall. Now Google can insource every aspect of designing its Pixel smartphones and only outsource manufacturing. Though HTC will be losing about 2,000 of its employees to Google, HTC believes its branded smartphone strategy will continue to be supported by what's left of its business. The deal enables ""a more streamlined product portfolio, greater operational efficiency and financial flexibility,"" read HTC's press release. HTC asserts that it still has ""best-in-class engineering talent"" to work on its next flagship phone. Further, HTC plans to continue building its Vive virtual reality headset. Though HTC CEO and Chairwoman Cher Wang admitted that the talent it lost to Google will ""supercharge"" Alphabet's hardware business. Last fall, Google upped the ante in hardware with a new Made by Google hardware division, launching its new Pixel smartphone, its Google Home smart speaker, a streaming TV device, and more. Google Home. Image source: Google. The success of Google-branded hardware is evident by its impact on Alphabet's fast-growing ""other"" segment, which accounts for about 12% of Alphabet's revenue. In Alphabet's second quarter, the segment's revenue soared 42% year over year. Management cited Google-branded hardware, the Android app store, and cloud services as the primary drivers for the growth. In Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call, management said growth in Hardware was ""substantial."" Alphabet also said the Pixel phone ""continues to be really popular...."" Alphabet's purchase of part of HTC's business comes just weeks before Alphabet's launch of its next-generation Pixel phone. Alphabet is holding an event on Oct. 4, exactly one year after it unveiled its Made by Google products last year, to announce its latest Google-branded hardware. Investors should expect hardware to become even more integral to Alphabet. ""We're excited about the 2017 lineup, but even more inspired by what's in store over the next five, 10, even 20 years,"" Google Senior Vice President of Hardware Rick Osterloh said in a blog post after the HTC purchase. ""Creating beautiful products that people rely on every single day is a journey, and we are investing for the long run."" ","

In recent years, the number of various online services that enterprises have to tap into has proliferated, which has created a market for cloud-based enterprise identity management to help manage, coordinate, and integrate all of those services with a single sign-on (SSO). There's even yet another ""-aaS"" acronym in use: identity as a service (IDaaS). Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google just made a big move in IDaaS with its purchase of Bitium, which was announced yesterday. The deal will bolster Google's existing Cloud Identity service, which will offer enterprise customers identity and access management (IAM) and SSO. Bitium, a IDaaS start-up that was founded five years ago, supports a plethora of third-party app integrations including Google Apps, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office 365, customer relationship management (CRM) platforms like salesforce.com, and more, while maintaining security. Image source: Getty Images. Expanding Google Cloud Identity's support to a greater number of third-party services will broaden its appeal and make it more competitive with rival offerings like Microsoft's Azure Active Directory and Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM service. No financial details were disclosed. Bitium co-founders Scott Kriz and Erik Gustavson vowed to continue supporting all current customers as Bitium transitions into the Google Cloud team. It's also something of a double-edged sword for Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), which announced an expanded partnership with Google last year that named Okta a ""preferred partner"" for large-scale enterprise deployments of Google Apps. The company subsequently went public earlier this year. On one hand, Google scooping up Bitium serves as validation of how important the IDaaS market is becoming, but on the other, it suggests that Google may be more interested in competing with Okta. Okta is three years older than Bitium, founded in 2009 by former Salesforce.com exec Todd McKinnon. For what it's worth, Google says it will ""continue to work closely"" with its broader ecosystem of identity partners in order to offer choices for enterprise customers. Okta is a top dog in the IDaaS space, the only vendor that Gartner has named a leader in its Magic Quadrant for IDaaS for three years running. It's possible that Okta was a candidate on Google's shopping list, but the price tag would have been hard to justify. Okta currently has a market cap of $2.8 billion before factoring in any acquisition premium, and Google just spent $1.1 billion on acquiring HTC's Pixel team. It's already been a pretty expensive month for the search giant. ","

Adam Levy,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The shift to mobile was a major challenge for Google. Many investors worried that lower average ad prices, compared to desktop ads, would put a major damper on revenue growth for the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary. But Google has met that challenge, and now mobile is one of the company's biggest strengths. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reinforced that strength when it switched the search engine behind Siri and Spotlight to Google in order ""to have a consistent web search experience with the default in Safari,"" according to a statement from Apple. Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing had powered Siri since 2013. The move is less about the potential revenue shift from the change in Siri (which is not that significant for Google) than it is about establishing Google as the king of mobile search: Apple is endorsing Google as a better user experience than Bing. Image source: Apple. Microsoft's Bing has managed to grow its share of U.S. desktop searches to about 23% this year. That compares to a 2% share on mobile. Perhaps the biggest reason for Microsoft's relative success on desktop is that around 20% of U.S. web users still use its desktop web browser -- the default browser in Windows. Considering those users never bothered to find another web browser, it's no surprise they didn't bother changing their default search engine. (Of course, some users may just prefer Microsoft's products.) That's one reason that Apple switching Siri's default to Google is noteworthy. Most people are lazy, and if the default works well enough, they'll use it. That's also why Google is willing to pay Apple loads of money to be the default search engine in Safari. Those deals are immensely profitable for both parties: Apple gets billions in revenue, practically all of which falls to the bottom line; Google gets billions of search queries, which feed its giant ad-sales machine. Considering that Google is the default search engine both for Safari and for its own web browser, Chrome, which combined take a market share of over 90% of U.S. mobile browsers, it's no surprise that Google commands around 94% of mobile searches in the U.S. The mobile search market is quickly overtaking the desktop search market (if it hasn't already). Research company eMarketer estimates that Google will generate more than half of its U.S. ad revenue from mobile this year, and says its global ad revenue has already surpassed that milestone. By next year, nearly 75% of Google's global ad revenue could come from mobile; the gap is only going to grow wider. The prevalence of mobile devices and mobile internet throughout the world creates a lot more opportunities for people to search the web for information. Google is the ultimate fact-checker and argument settler. It's one of the best price-checking and product-review tools. And it can find the menus for the restaurants you and your friends are considering for dinner. The number of Google search queries on mobile surpassed desktop queries more than two years ago. Combine the growing number of search queries with improved transaction capabilities on mobile, and the average ad price ought to grow faster than on desktop. One big concern for mobile ads is that they don't convert as well, since people don't like to buy things on their smartphones. However, not only are there an increasing number of options that ease the friction of buying things on mobile, but Google has also taken advantage of mobile marketplaces like app stores -- which don't work at all on desktop. Siri's switch to Google cements the search leader's position on mobile. Even if it cedes a small bit of ground to Microsoft on desktop, it's dominating the faster-growing and more valuable market in search. ","

Leo Sun,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google recently launched Tez, a mobile wallet app for the Indian market. The app links to a user's bank account and enables peer-to-peer transfers with Audio QR (AQR), which uses ultrasonic sounds to ""talk"" to other phones without the need for NFC (near-field communications) chips. Tez supports India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a government-backed standard aimed at unifying the fragmented banking market on a single platform. The app is now available on iOS and Android, and new devices from Micromax, Lava, Nokia, and Panasonic will ship with Tez pre-installed. It's certainly logical for Google to launch a mobile wallet for India's 300 million smartphone users. But it also might seem odd to introduce Tez instead of Android Pay, which already has footholds in Asia in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. Image source: Google Play. During a Q&A session following Tez's introduction, Google senior executive Caesar Sengupta said there weren't immediate plans to launch Android Pay in India. Sengupta cited the low availability of NFC-equipped smartphones and compatible point-of-sales terminals across India as the key deciding factor. India also has a very low credit card penetration rate, with fewer than 25 million credit cards circulating amid a population of 1.3 billion. This makes it very tough for credit card-linked payment apps like Android Pay and Apple Pay to gain traction among mainstream consumers. Many more consumers (reportedly nearly half the Indian population) use debit cards, since they double as ATM cards, while many businesses still only accept cash. That's why Google linked Tez to bank accounts and introduced the AQR tech for P2P payments. Tez can be linked to major banks that support UPI and the app limits users to 20 transfers or 100,000 rupees ($1,560) across all UPI-linked apps every day. Tez has already attracted a growing list of online payment partners, including Domino's, RedBus, and Jet Airways. Google lets these businesses communicate with customers via business-to-consumer chat channels, which enable streamlined payments. In addition to English and Hindi, Tez also supports six other regional languages. Google and BCG estimate that over half of India's internet users will use digital payments by 2020, boosting the size of the country's entire digital payments industry to $500 billion -- or 15% of total GDP. But Google isn't the only company making big moves into the market. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) both applied for mobile wallet licenses in India. Amazon was granted a license in March, and it's leveraging the strength of its e-commerce ecosystem to promote its payments platform. In July, Amazon offered Indian shoppers a 10% cashback promotional offer to convince shoppers to use its mobile wallet. PayPal hasn't received a license yet, and it could struggle if it arrives too late. The Indian market is also filled with other mobile wallet players like Alibaba's Paytm and Flipkart's PhonePe. Apple might even bring Apple Pay to India by the end of the year, but it doesn't plan to abandon or modify its NFC tech. Instead, it plans to work with merchants and banks to install NFC terminals, which could limit its overall appeal. It's unclear how Tez generates revenue, since transfers through the UPI system are free. But like many other projects, Google is likely trying to build an ecosystem first before fretting over revenue growth. If Tez establishes a foothold in the Indian market, Google could potentially charge retail partners for additional features -- like promoted offers through its main app or tiered rates based on the number of channel-connected customers. But to reach that stage, Google needs to stand out in an increasingly saturated market with other tech giants breathing down its neck. ","

When Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) scored a deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make its Bing search engine the default provider for Siri way back in 2013 with iOS 7, it was a pretty big deal. It was validation for Microsoft's beleaguered search engine, at a time when Microsoft was desperately hoping to turn Bing into a verb. A year later, Apple would integrate Bing search results directly into Spotlight, the search function in macOS. Those were both blows to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google, although fairly minor in the grand scheme of things since Siri and Spotlight searches probably aren't used as much as the far more important spot of being the default search in Safari (a privilege that Google pays handsomely for). With iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra released this month, Apple is ditching Bing and cozying back up to Google. Image source: Apple. TechCrunch first reported the change. Siri and Spotlight will now use Google for web searches, although Bing will still power image searches. In a statement to the outlet, Apple said it was in pursuit of consistency: ""Switching to Google as the web search provider for Siri, Search within iOS and Spotlight on Mac will allow these services to have a consistent web search experience with the default in Safari. We have strong relationships with Google and Microsoft and remain committed to delivering the best user experience possible."" Search Engine Market Share Desktop Mobile and Tablet Google 81.6% 97.1% Bing 7% 0.7% Data source: NetMarketShare. Switching for the sake of consistency is a good thing, especially since it's clear that the vast majority of users prefer Google. Apple may collect an estimated $3 billion from Google this year for enjoying the default search spot in Safari in the form of traffic acquisition costs. Google is presumably paying Apple for the Siri and Spotlight placements as well, but likely much less (commensurate with usage). The financial impacts to both companies will be negligible, but users will probably appreciate the change. ","

Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are turning science fiction into science fact -- and deep learning is at the heart of these advances. These AI systems have the ability to sift through scores of data, recognize patterns, and detect differences that might be imperceptible to humans. Some applications are already achieving remarkable results. One of the more promising areas of research seeking to tap these capabilities is medicine. Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are using the predictive power of AI to provide doctors with additional tools to fight disease. Artificial intelligence is giving physicians new tools to save lives. Image source: Getty Images. Two-year-old start-up Gritstone Oncology has attracted both attention and investment from Alphabet Inc.'s Google Ventures. The biotech company has been studying the use of deep learning to develop highly targeted immunotherapies, which recruit the body's immune system to fight cancer. Immunotherapy has produced significant positive results in about 20% of cancer patients but has been unsuccessful for the remainder. Gritstone is using AI to analyze tumors at the molecular level and narrow the list of immunotherapies to match them with specific patients. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is collaborating with IBM's Watson cognitive AI supercomputer to discover new drugs and approaches for immunotherapy. Watson's consumed 25 million Medline abstracts, over a million articles from medical journals, records from 4 million patients, as well as every drug patent since 1861. The system is regularly updated with the latest available medical research data. What began as a pilot program became a full-fledged partnership when Watson suggested a novel treatment that had recently been recommended by Pfizer's team of researchers, and that therapy is currently undergoing trials. One of the major causes of blindness is damage to the retina resulting from diabetes. Known as diabetic retinopathy (DR), the condition occurs in more than 40% of U.S. patients with the disease. There may be no symptoms in the initial stages, so early detection is critical. Unfortunately, there is currently a shortage of ophthalmologists qualified to diagnose the condition. Verily, a subsidiary of Alphabet's Google, was able to use images of the retina to detect new signals of heart disease risk. Using data from nearly 300,000 patients, the AI system was able to detect indicators in retinal images of age, gender, blood pressure, and blood sugar, and use that information to estimate the risk of heart failure. The researchers published a paper claiming to have achieved accuracy levels equivalent to the results obtained using blood tests, though that paper has not yet been subjected to peer review. HeartFlow is medical technology company that is using graphics processors from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and deep learning to create 3D mapping used to provide early detection of heart disease. Current methods to diagnose the condition involve a costly and invasive medical procedure. HeartFlow's alternative uses CT scans and deep learning to create a 3D model of the heart that can provide detailed representations of blood flow and blockages. Providing a more accurate diagnosis while eliminating the necessity of a costly procedure can reduce the associated healthcare costs by 25%. These recent developments provide insight into the future of AI-assisted medicine. AI is still in its infancy, and researchers have only scratched the surface in terms of the ways that AI will revolutionize medical care. ","

Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) launch of its first smart speaker three years ago took the world by surprise. Since its launch, Amazon's Echo family of smart-speaker devices has quickly risen in popularity. And now the e-commerce giant is taking its investment in its Echo lineup even further. Coming to market just before the holidays and amid an Amazon-triggered smart-speaker boom that has tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) vying for share, Amazon's new Echo products speak volumes about the growing importance of this nascent product category. New Amazon Echo. Image source: Amazon.com. On Wednesday, Amazon announced a range of new Echo family devices, including an ""all-new"" Amazon Echo with improved sound and better performance, an Echo Plus with a built-in smart-home hub, and a new Echo Spot with a display and camera. With updates to its first-generation Amazon Echo and the introduction of new devices, it could be easy for consumers to get confused about Amazon's overall Echo lineup. Here's a quick overview of each device in the family: Echo: This is the second generation of Amazon's original Echo speaker. It boasts improved sound compared to the first-generation Echo and includes a new interchangeable fabric finish. Like the original Echo, it features Amazon's smart assistant, Alexa, for playing music, setting timers and alarms, executing ""Skills"" (Amazon's name for smart-speaker apps), and more. The updated Echo is priced at $99.99. Echo Dot: The Echo Dot is a much more compact version of Echo, priced at $49.99. Echo Plus: The Echo Plus has slightly better sound than the new Echo and includes a built-in hub for simplifying setup of smart-home devices. It is priced at $149.99. Echo Spot: Amazon describes its new Echo Spot as a ""stylish and compact Echo with a screen."" It also has a front-facing camera for video calls. Amazon's Echo Spot is priced at $129.99. Echo Spot. Image source: Amazon.com. Echo Show: Amazon's Echo Show, which was launched in May, remains the most expensive offering in the Echo family. It starts at $229.99 and has a 7-inch screen and dual 2-inch stereo speakers. This compares to the Echo Spot's 2.5-inch screen and 1.4-inch speaker. Amazon also announced a new $34.99 Echo Connect, made to enable hands-free inbound and outbound calling for landlines or VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), and Echo Buttons that enable users to interact with Echo devices in new gaming experiences like trivia. The Echo Buttons are $19.99 for a pack of two. The updated Echo and new Echo Plus are available for pre-order this week and will begin shipping next month. The Echo Spot, Echo Connect, and Echo Buttons will be available later this year. If Amazon wasn't already all-in on Echo, it is now. Amazon isn't alone in the space the way it was when it first launched Amazon Echo in 2014. Formidable competition is rising. Apple and Alphabet's Google haven't overlooked consumers' appetite for these smart speakers. Google announced its first smart speaker, called Google Home, before the holidays last year and may unveil an updated smart speaker at its product event on Oct. 4. Apple teased its first smart speaker, called HomePod, this summer. The HomePod will be available in December. Both speakers feature voice assistants. HomePod. Image source: Apple. It's no surprise that Alphabet and Apple wanted in on this new product segment. Amazon's Echo products have stolen the show on Amazon.com during major shopping weekends like Black Friday and Prime Day. On Prime Day, for instance, the most popular purchase across all of Amazon globally was the Amazon Echo Dot. Furthermore, year-over-year growth in Echo Device sales on Amazon's July 11 Prime Day was astounding. Echo device sales were seven times higher on Prime Day 2017 than on Prime Day 2016. Smart speakers are here to stay. Amazon's comprehensive lineup of new Echo Devices shows it isn't ready to lose ground to new entrants like Alphabet and Apple. ","

The market for augmented reality (AR) devices, which project digital objects onto real world surfaces, could generate a lot of revenue over the next few years. Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital claims that the fledgling market could become an $83 billion one by 2021. Bullish estimates like that sent many investors scrambling for AR-related investments, and chipmaker STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) is often mentioned as a potential AR play thanks to its production of motion sensors and computer vision chips. While STMicro is a decent investment, I think that investors looking for a more aggressive play on the AR market should consider Taiwanese chipmaker Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) instead. Image source: Getty Images. Himax mainly sells display driver ICs (integrated circuits) for smartphones, tablets, and monitors. Sales of those components accounted for 80% of its top line last quarter, but demand is highly cyclical. To diversify its business away from those components, Himax developed non-driver components for AR, VR, and 3D-sensing technologies, which generated the remaining 20% of its revenues last quarter. During that quarter, both the display driver and non-display driver businesses posted double-digit annual revenue declines, causing Himax's total revenues to fall 25%. But looking ahead, cyclical demand for those products should accelerate during the second half of this year and next year. Himax gained a lot of attention four years ago when Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google used its LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon) products in Google Glass. Google also acquired a 6% stake in Himax, which seemingly indicated that its LCOS and WLO (wafer-level optics) components could be widely used for AR applications. Unfortunately, the original Google Glass flopped due to its high price, awkward appearance, and privacy concerns. However, Google recently reintroduced a new version of Glass as an enterprise device, which could fare much better than the original consumer-facing version. Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. Himax also reportedly supplies core LCOS and WLO components for Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) HoloLens AR headset, which hasn't been commercially launched yet. When it launches it could become an integral part of the Windows 10 ecosystem, which will soon be updated for AR images with its Creators Update. Himax is also expected to supply 3D-sensing components for the camera in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone X. That depth-sensing camera will likely be used to power next-gen AR applications, and might even tether the iPhone to a HoloLens-like headset. All these tailwinds could significantly boost the growth of Himax's non-driver business -- if those optimistic AR estimates don't miss the mark. STMicro makes motion sensors (like gyroscopes and accelerometers), and it manufactures computer vision chips for Intel's Mobileye, which sells crash avoidance systems to major automakers. Many of STMicro's components are used in AR and VR devices projects like Google's Daydream and Project Tango -- which was recently replaced by its ARCore initiative. However, STMicro actually generates most of its revenue from automotive chips, followed by its microcontroller and digital ICs group and its Analog and MEMS group. That last group, which generated just 25% of STMicro's revenues last quarter, houses the motion sensor business, which is mainly focused on the mobile, industrial, and scientific markets. While some of those motion sensors are used in AR devices, STMicro's components aren't exactly unique. Rivals like Bosch -- which reportedly supplies Apple with motion sensors in the iPhone 8 -- produce similar components. Himax, however, is considered the ""best in breed"" producer of LCOS and WLO components, making it the go-to supplier for tech giants like Google and Microsoft. So if demand for AR hardware abruptly surges, Himax should receive a much bigger boost than STMicro. Himax is a more direct AR play than STMicro, but its stock isn't cheap at 81 times trailing earnings and 48 times forward earnings -- which are very high relative to the industry average P/E of 24 for semiconductor companies. STMicro's trailing P/E of 44 also looks lofty, but its forward P/E of 17 looks fairly reasonable. I'm personally not sold on the notion that AR will become a mainstream technology in the near future yet. It could be great for certain enterprise uses if the hardware isn't too expensive, but we could still be years away from mainstream consumers wearing smart glasses and heavily using depth-sensing AR apps. Therefore, I still consider Himax a speculative play which relies a bit too much on bold forecasts about the AR market. ","

Hedge-fund managers are armed with enormous amounts of assets and data, so when they move, Mr. Market sits up and takes notice: With such large stakes involved, their buys and sells are not made lightly. And this may tempt retail investors to try and follow those giants' leads. Trouble is, trying to replicate their strategies in a small portfolio will at best require some complex tactics, and at worst expose you to far too much risk. Even using their filings simply to point you toward good investments is chancy. The long periods between when they buy and sell and when they're required to show the public their moves can leave a retail investor chasing the ghost of profits past. But even so, sometimes it is possible to find, among the popular hedge fund holdings, likely winners that it's not too late to buy. We asked a handful of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool to pick some stocks they thought fit that bill. Read on to see why they chose Interactive Brokers (NYSEMKT:IBKR), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (Interactive Brokers): Interactive Brokers has been  described as a ""hedge fund hotel,"" as a laundry list of hedge funds own most shares of the company that its founder and key insiders don't. The thesis for Interactive Brokers is simple: Since price and execution (Interactive Brokers' strong suits) are the most important differentiating factors among discount brokers, the company should slowly skim the most price-sensitive and valuable customers from its competitors. Aside from price, Interactive Brokers is benefiting from a changing regulatory and competitive landscape. Next year, a regulation known as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) could completely change the brokerage business as we know it today. Under MiFID, banks will no longer be able to offer ""free"" research as a perk for clients who use their services to place trades. Instead, many plan to sell research at a fixed price -- which could run into tens of thousands of dollars per year, per client. So smaller managers who previously enjoyed that access to research as a perk of sending their trading volume to a prime broker may instead opt to move some or all of their accounts to discount operators like Interactive Brokers. The company's growth is astounding, and it has recently accelerated. In August, accounts were 22.9% higher year over year, the largest percentage increase observed in data going back all the way to the beginning of 2009. While it seems as though many will lose out due to deep discounting and increased competition, Interactive Brokers hits a sweet spot by meeting the needs of sophisticated investors at an affordable price. I think it's one to buy, hold, and ignore. That's hardly surprising, since Google's parent company sports the second-highest total value in today's stock market. Neither the smart money nor the general market makers are right all the time, but I would argue that those hedge-fund gurus are onto something here. The cash machine that Google built is slowly turning into a much broader and deeper business model. Armed with a basket of game-changing products such as self-driving cars, advanced medical research, and smart-home monitoring systems, Alphabet is transforming into a diversified conglomerate. A lot of its new ideas have almost nothing to do with Google's online search and advertising operations. In short, this company is building itself into a stable cross-sector giant for the long haul. Buy Alphabet shares now, stick them under your pillow, and sleep tight for the next several decades. When you check back, you'll likley find those stubs representing a very different business -- and that beast will be worth many times the piddly $650 billion market cap it sports today. Image source: Amazon. Keith Noonan (Amazon): What started as ""the everything store"" is gradually becoming ""the everything company,"" and Amazon stock stands as a hedge-fund favorite that retail investors should consider buying and holding for the long term. At the end of the last year, 41 of the top hedge funds owned the online retail giant, and institutional confidence in the company makes a lot of sense. The retail transformation toward e-commerce is still in its early phases, and Amazon is positioned to remain both one of its biggest beneficiaries and biggest drivers. Though online retail grew 16.2% year over year in the second quarter, it still accounted for just 8.9% of total retail sales according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Amazon's e-commerce business has big room to grow in international markets, as well, with just 36% of its online store sales coming from non-domestic territories last quarter. The company's cloud-services business is also growing sales and profits at a rapid clip, with revenues up 42% year over year last quarter, and operating income up 28%. It looks likely to be a performance driver for years to come. Amazon isn't resting on its laurels, however. It's back on a big spending kick, investing in content production, improving Amazon Web Services, and making an acquisitions push that includes its recent $13.7 billion purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods. While earnings per share came in at $0.40 last quarter compared to $1.78 in the prior-year period, investors can actually be relieved that the notoriously forward-thinking company is positioning itself for long-term success.

    3 Hedge-Fund Stocks to Buy and Forget About -- The Motley Fool

Mike Murphy,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 21, 2017 4:52 a.m. ET Google bolsters hardware offerings; tech giants had teamed up on Pixel By Google and HTC Corp. announced a $1.1 billion cooperation agreement Wednesday night, as the U.S. tech giant moved to bolster its hardware offerings. The agreement had been expected, and HTC’s stock had been halted on the Taiwan exchange pending the announcement. Alphabet Inc.’s Google and HTC already work together to produce the Pixel smartphone. HTC will receive $1.1. billion in cash, and in exchange, a number of HTC employees — many of whom work on Pixel production already — will join Google, the companies said in a joint statement. Separately, Google will receive HTC intellectual property through a non-exclusive licensing agreement. “We’re excited and can’t wait to welcome members of the HTC team who will be joining Google to fuel further innovation and future product development in consumer hardware,” Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of hardware at Google, said in a statement. HTC once owned about 9% of the global smartphone market, but has fallen behind in recent years to Apple Inc.

Mike Murphy,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Last week, Uber’s legal team told Judge William Alsup that Waymo was seeking $2.6 billion for an allegedly stolen trade secret related to the company’s autonomous vehicle efforts. Over the weekend, Waymo filed a document with the court noting that the correct figure was actually  $1.859 billion. It’s not clear why this seemingly important detail was left uncorrected for nearly a week. The filing also includes some additional clarification around the way in which the damages figure was calculated. Though Waymo is arguing that nine trade secrets were put in jeopardy by Anthony Levandowski, it is seeking a maximum of $1.8 billion in damages. That figure is the value that Waymo is attributing to a single trade secret — trade secret 25. The other eight secrets are being individually valued at less than $1.8 billion. Consequently, Waymo is capping the damages at the value of its most valuable compromised trade secret. Waymo’s attorneys note that the $1.8 billion figure was calculated based on an estimate of “Uber’s unjust enrichment from Uber’s trade secret misappropriation.” Waymo continues that the damages are based on Uber’s own profitability forecasts of deploying autonomous vehicles into its ridesharing business. This Wednesday is the final pre-trial conference before jury selection. However, the actual start date of the trial is still in question. Judge Alsup is set to decide whether the trial should begin on October 10 as currently scheduled or December 5, the date Waymo’s legal team requested. Waymo is pushing for the extension to dig through additional evidence. Meanwhile, Uber believes Waymo is stalling and would prefer to stick to the existing schedule.

Uber has denied that it has used Waymo’s trade secrets in developing its own system for autonomous driving. Though jury selection is currently set for Oct. 10, Waymo tried to convince Judge William Alsup to push the trial date to December after it recently received a cache of documents from Uber. Alsup said he would rule Oct. 3 on moving the date, but he advised Waymo’s lawyers to make a “good college try” to be ready.

There is another side to the fight, however, with passionate advocates who argue that founders need control to focus on overall growth of the company. “This is a real overreaction by the indices,” Ethan Klingsberg, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb, said of the move against Snap. Klingsberg acknowledges that the dual-class system is not always perfect, but believes an outright ban ignores any potential benefits. FTSE Russell kicked off the crackdown in late July, setting rules for a minimum of 5% voting rights for entry into some of its indexes by newly public companies, and a five-year period for others to adapt to the standard. S&P excluded newly public companies with dual class shares, but it grandfathered in existing companies.

The Council of Institutional Investors pushed for those rules, sending letters and speaking with the indexes, urging them to come out against dual-class structures. Their thesis is that investors should be entitled to a vote for each share they have, which is a theory that also governed the major indexes until the mid-1980s. The New York Stock Exchange allowed dual-class shares to be listed for the first time around 1986, when the exchange allowed General Motors Co.

That trend seemed to pick up in the past few years, as prominent tech companies utilized multiple classes of stock. Facebook  went public in 2011 with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and venture investors holding preferred shares with 10 votes each compared with IPO shares with one vote, and Google Inc.

Eventually, the trend led to Snap’s audacious move to offer no voting rights in an IPO, which was “the tipping point” for many advocates. “I think it really pushed the envelope on the dual-class share issue, well beyond where institutional investors think it should go,” said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors.

Facebook seems to abide by a similar theory, as it referenced a ‘founder-led’ approach, when attempting to created a third class of shares, largely related to Zuckerberg’s decision to give away the majority of his shares, in 2016. “The board believes that a founder-led approach has been and continues to be in the best interests of Facebook, its stockholders, and the community,” Facebook wrote in a blog post.

And Facebook and Google investors did not take the voting changes lying down. Facebook has not yet been able to execute its three-for-one stock split, with a new class of nonvoting shares as it faces investor pushback, including at least two legal complaints filed on behalf of shareholders. Google faced a similar suit, and eventually settled with investors, agreeing to pay the difference between share classes if the prices diverged too much. It took two years for Google to make the stock split effective and it did up paying more than half a billion dollars when the classes diverged. Facebook on Friday dropped its plans for a stock split amid a similar investor lawsuit, with Zuckerberg explaining that the stock price had moved high enough for him to give away shares and still retain control of the company. Don’t miss: Facebook stock split won’t be so easy—Just ask Google Facebook’s capitulation and the backlash against Snap appears to show that investors are rallying against shares that offer no votes, but the dual-class structures that offer limited voting powers are likely here to stay. The position of many institutional investors is that having a vote gives investors a means to hold company management accountable and effect change if something goes wrong. However, Klingsberg argues that multi-class structures can work for investors, particularly if the companies put in other footholds, such as the ability to elect some board members or a sunset on the high vote-low vote structure after a set time period or the departure of an executive. Because of the different setups, he sees the move to penalize multi-class shares by both indexes as an “overreaction.” “Not all multi-class structures are the same,” Klingsberg said. He added that if issues arise, the dual share structure can be collapsed through negotiations between the shareholders and the control group. The process itself can take a year to complete, but he says the shares typically react once a negotiation is reached and an announcement is made. Klingsberg points to the case for Forest City Realty Trust Inc.

                                   a real-estate development company, which was a dual-class company controlled by a family for decades. Scopia, an activist fund and investor in the company, filed a Schedule 13D form in 2016 calling for the dissolution of the dual-class structure, saying that the shares of the company were trading below those of its peers. Months later, a deal was made so that high vote shares converted to low votes with a 31% premium, which was formally adopted in June 2017, Klingsberg said. Of course, getting the board to agree to a collapse of the structures won't always be that easy. (Klingsberg acknowledges that collapsing the dual-share structure is easier if the controlling group does not have a large amount of equity in the company.) And it appears that having voting power is the most important factor for many investors. According to a study Georgetown’s Aggarwal co-authored, which appeared in The Journal of The American Finance Association in 2015, investors were more likely to recall shares they had lent out before board voting, particularly if management had not been performing well or if there was a shareholder proposal in front of the board. “We do find that especially when there are contentious issues on a proxy ballot, shareholders really value their voting rights,” Aggarwal said. Companies may value voting rights more in the future, as the indexes are keeping them from a valuable group of passive investors. That group is particularly important as more investors move toward passive funds, with active funds seeing outflows of $285.2 billion in 2016 and passive funds attracting inflows of $428.7 billion, according to Morningstar. Snap, in particular, could use a new wave of investors after delivering its second disappointing earnings report as a public company. Shares have fallen 23% in the past three months, while the S&P 500 has gained 3%. Similarly, Blue Apron could use an influx if investors, as the beleaguered stock has taken hits from competition from Amazon Inc.

Shares of Blue Apron have fallen 15% week-to-date, while the S&P 500 is unchanged. However, even advocates of the indexes’ decisions say that they don’t expect the move to scare away big legacy companies such as Google, even as they await another decision on dual-class shares from the MSCI indexes. Instead, they see it as sending a message to new startups. “I don’t think it means the death knell for dual-class shares, but we hope that both decisions will cause founders of startup companies that are thinking about IPO-ing with dual class to really reconsider,” Borrus said.

On average, interactions on the major crypto subreddits are up 930% this year, according to a MarketWatch analysis of data from CrowdTangle. On the largest bitcoin forum, subscribers are up 66% in 2017 to more than 331,000, and the total number of interactions in August (defined as comments and upvotes) was up 315% from January. That closely parallels the rise in the price of bitcoin, which is up about 285% year-to-date. Related: Bitcoin rises, so people Google ‘bitcoin,’ so then bitcoin rises, so then people Google... August was particularly dramatic for the forum — perhaps no surprise given the drama-filled news coming out of the crypto world over the past two months. The main bitcoin forum’s moderators confirmed that they’ve seen an average rate of 1,300 new users per day recently, and that they logged a big bump in page views in August — up 59% from the previous month (compared with a 16% monthly increase from June to July). According to the group’s moderators, the day of the month with the highest traffic was Aug. 1, the day of BIP148 activation. It was also the day of the launch of Bitcoin Cash, which marked a “split” in the cryptocurrency. That day saw more than 1.5 million views, more than twice the group’s average, and the most views since the collapse of Mt. Gox on Feb. 25, 2014. Of course, if you take a look at some of the other crypto hot spots on Reddit, then the growth on the bitcoin forum seems tame. The group “CryptoCurrency” has nearly quadrupled its subscriber count to get to its current 129,386. It has seen an astounding 3,017% increase in interactions in 2017. August was a big month for that group too — interactions were up 57% from July. “Ethtrader” has seen an 880% growth in subscribers from January through August. It has also seen interactions go up by 1,000% this year. The group going by “Ethereum” has seen a 405% growth in subscribers and 72% bump in interactions in 2017. Meanwhile, the price of ethereum is up 3,352% year-to-date. August was a quiet month on those forums, however. Creeping up on the trends list is litecoin. The interactions rate on the litecoin subreddit is up 1,652% year-to-date. The price of litecoin is up 1,075% in 2017. The takeoff in crypto chatter on “the internet’s homepage” probably just adds fuel to the fire for the bears who see a bubble waiting to pop. But for the bitcoin faithful, it perhaps serves as a sign that crypto is increasingly moving into the mainstream. Reddit for years has been a popular online destination for investors and traders looking to pick up tips, tout gains and trash-talk.

                                    said Tuesday its chairman and chief executive Richard Smith will retire, after a security breach at the company that potentially exposed about 143 million U.S. adults to identity theft. Smith had spent 12 years in his role at Equifax. The company announced earlier this month that its chief information officer and chief security officer had also retired immediately. Equifax’s current board president of Asia Pacific, Paulino do Rego Barros, will serve as interim CEO, and current board member Mark Feidler will be non-executive chairman. Smith won’t walk away empty-handed. He won’t receive a “package” to retire, an Equifax spokesperson said. In 2016 and 2015 he had received bonuses of about $3 million a year, and depending on the company’s performance this year, he could have received a comparable amount, according Equifax filings. But he will not receive that award, by mutual agreement. And he will not receive severance pay, as his departure is by mutual agreement, the spokesperson said. If he had been removed from his position, he would have received severance of $5 million. But Smith will still receive some $18.3 million in pension benefits. Under the company’s pension plan, he is entitled to that pension under any circumstance, the spokesperson said. With that said, though, the company reached an agreement that could give Smith even more compensation; the Equifax spokesperson said Smith and Equifax’s board have agreed to defer decisions about the “characterization of his employment.” The board “retains the right to change the basis of his departure to a ‘for cause’ termination,” because the board of directors has formed a special committee to focus on the issues surrounding the cybersecurity incident. Depending on what that committee finds, the company could change Smith’s departure to a termination, in which case he could be entitled to severance. Plus, Smith’s “award agreements are still outstanding,” the spokesperson said. That means Smith might retain the rights to millions of dollars in stock that have yet to vest, depending on the outcome of the internal review, said Jason Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business. The total amount of that “award” is “less than $20 million,” an Equifax spokesperson said. Consumers have expressed concern not only about the breach, but how Equifax handled the aftermath. Hackers went undetected in Equifax’s computer network for more than four months before its security team discovered the breach, according to a security firm, FireEye Inc.

The company discovered the breach July 29 and announced it Sept. 7, but those executives sold their stock, worth almost $2 million, on Aug. 1 and Aug. 2. There were also many glitches for consumers who were trying to find out if their data had been breached. The website Equifax set up for consumers to check if they had been impacted didn’t immediately tell them whether or not they were. Equifax also removed language from its terms of service, which originally stated that consumers who visited that website and enrolled in its credit monitoring service also waived their right to sue Equifax in a class-action lawsuit. And many consumers received error messages when they attempted to “freeze” their credit report with Equifax, in an effort to protect their data from potentially being used to open lines of credit without their knowledge. Identity theft can cost consumers hundreds of dollars and take years to clear up. ","After breach, Equifax CEO leaves with $18 million pension, and possibly more - MarketWatch"
Sam Schechner,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 21, 2017 6:17 a.m. ET By The European Union's executive arm said Thursday that it is ready to propose new tax taxes on digital companies like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google by next spring if there isn't ""adequate global progress"" toward a rewrite of corporate tax rules at an international level. The bloc's executive arm, the European Commission, floated several options that it said could be rolled out in the short term to raise tax revenue on digital companies, which it contends declare too little profit in the region. While the commission said a global solution would be preferable, it added that it ""stands ready"" to propose legislation if major countries, including the U.S., can't make headway on new rules. The threat of new tax legislation comes amid pressure from big EU countries including France and Germany, which have recently increased their push to change corporate tax rules at any level to capture what they say are billions of euros in lost revenue. Finance ministers for EU countries expressed support over the weekend for renewing efforts to change international rules to better reflect digital profits rules via the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a forum of wealthy countries that includes the EU, U.S. and Japan. European officials argue that companies are taking advantage of outdated tax rules that were designed on the basis of physical assets and where the companies operate, rather than virtual businesses like online advertising and data mining. ""It's a question of fairness: Digital companies use European networks and infrastructure, and often their content and data are created by Europeans. Like all taxpayers, they must pay their fair share of tax,"" said EU finance chief Pierre Moscovici, adding that the current system allows for ""a big loss in tax revenues for the budgets of EU member states."" Failing any progress at the OECD level, the commission said its preferred route would be to amend previously proposed rules to reform the corporate tax base in Europe. The initiative--known as the common consolidated corporate-tax base--is designed to create a common set of rules spelling out how profits should be taxed across the bloc. But any changes could further delay the legislative process as that proposal has already been held up in negotiations with member states who differ over how to proceed. The other options that the European Commission floated Thursday as short-term and supplementary measures include an ""equalization tax"" on digital revenue--as opposed to profit--that has been promoted by France and garnered the support from at least 10 EU nations last weekend. It would impose a new tax on companies that have very high digital revenue but pay little in corporate income tax, according to officials in the French finance ministry. The commission also mentioned a potential withholding tax on digital transactions that would be levied on online providers of goods and services that aren't resident in the EU, and a levy on digital services that would hit transactions made between in-country customers of a nonresident company--such as if a company sold online ads to people in France without a taxable presence there. The commission acknowledged in its paper Thursday that these taxes have ""pros and cons"" including potential conflicts with tax treaties aimed at avoiding double taxation, as well as with state aid rules and free-trade agreements. Any tax legislation would also require debate that could stretch for months, and would typically under current rules require unanimous approval by EU member states. ""Yet something has to be done,"" the commission added.

In comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average

                                   has gained 1.8% this month. Some analysts, however, see the pullback in Apple shares as a case of “short-term pain for long-term gain” seeing the iPhone X was excluded from this week’s release. The $1,000 iPhone X that is supposed to be Apple’s most advanced smartphone yet and is the focus for many Apple investors and customers. iPhone X preorders are scheduled to begin Oct. 27, with an official launch on Nov. 3. Apple shares also logged their worst performance from an iPhone announcement to its release, according to Dow Jones data. Since the close of markets just after the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were announced to Friday, Apple shares declined 5.6%. The previous worst performance was back when the iPhone 5s and 5c were released in September 2013 and shares had declined 5.5% from when the phones were announced. On Tuesday, shares barely managed a gain after ho-hum iPhone 8 reviews. On Wednesday, shares dropped 1.7% after a few prominent Apple Watch Series 3 reviews complained about spotty connectivity, an issue Apple acknowledged it was seeking to solve. Thursday’s 1.7% decline followed an announcement that Alphabet Inc.’s

Nilay Patel at The Verge characterized the Apple TV 4K, which starts at $179, as being “so close, so far.” While confident that Apple “will figure this TV thing out,” Patel thinks that cheaper options like Roku Inc.’s streaming devices make it difficult to justify the $179 price tag on the Apple TV 4K. Roku IPO: 5 things to know about the streaming-media company “If you buy one of the most expensive TV products on the market, you shouldn’t have to think about whether you’re getting access to a complete content library, the best audio and video quality possible, and YouTube in 4K.,” he wrote. “You should get it all, and never think about it again. It should light up all of the lights.” Price was also an issue for David Katzmaier at CNET. “Is it worth the extra money?” he asked. “Not for most people.” See also: Nvidia announces new Shield TV configuration priced to match Apple TV Over at BuzzFeed, Nicole Nyugen makes the direct point that if you don’t own a 4K TV—which, in an informal poll, she found 65% of millennials don’t—there’s no point in buying the Apple TV 4K, adding that it’s “for people who have the latest tech and are really into their home entertainment systems.” Hey 20-, 30-somethings: I want to know if you own a TV. And also, if it's 4k.

Victor Reklaitis,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 8:46 a.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By After the S&P 500’s dance up to around 2,512, some strategists are bumping up their price targets for the benchmark, as well as fist-bumping over a potential tax overhaul. CFRA’s team has hiked its 12-month target for the S&P to 2,640 from 2,540, while Morgan Stanley’s resident bull is reiterating his forecast of 2,700 and describing tax reform as the “icing on the cake” for this bull market. That implies gains of 5% to 8% for the index, proving our call of the day. “The possibility of a tax cut remains supportive of equity ownership,” says CFRA’s Sam Stovall, as he writes about his shop’s new target of 2,640. There is also a “lack of attractive alternatives in this rate-tightening environment,” he says. “Challenges to economic growth and share-price appreciation are well-known but not new,” Stovall adds. “As a result, we believe the risks are largely reflected in current valuations and underlying support.” Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson says tax-reform hopes are far from the only driver for this market, but they sure can help. “Tax is what gets people to believe and finally come in and show some optimism for the most hated bull market in my career,” Wilson tells CNBC. But the Morgan Stanley strategist — dubbed “Wall Street’s biggest bull” — also is predicting a bust next year for the S&P after it booms. “We’re late cycle,” he warns.

                                   . The insiders are telling us that any of these names may do well from here. But three stand out, in part because insiders recently added more to their existing positions. 1. Macy's There was interesting follow-on buying of Macy’s shares in late August by two directors, at around $20.55. This comes after June buying at $22.95 by CEO Jeffrey Gennette. He's overseeing a mini-turnaround that has Macy's changing up its game to face the Amazon.com threat. One of the dynamics I look for at my stock letter is insiders buying into their own turnaround, and that's the case here. Macy's is seeing some success with its discount ""Backstage"" concept, and marketing initiatives in women's shoes and jewelry are also panning out. Macy’s met expectations for the second quarter, on August 10, and maintained guidance, an encouraging sign. The company plans to launch a new loyalty program and a new marketing strategy soon, and it is working on boosting digital and mobile-based sales. The stock looks cheap, with a forward price-earnings ratio of around 8. 2. Mattel Toy-maker Mattel faces serious challenges as kids migrate big time to digital entertainment on smartphones. The Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy earlier this week does not help with sentiment. But Mattel won't easily give up. It is under new management lead by CEO Margo Georgiadis. She was previously the president of Google's Americas. So presumably she has a clue about how to bring Mattel into the modern world of digital entertainment. An obvious avenue will be to develop more content-driven products. The company is also reducing costs, establishing joint ventures in China, and working on digital collaborations with the likes of Alphabet

But insiders buying into turnarounds can be a good combination, and that is what we have here. The CEO herself made a sizeable purchase at $19.61 a share in early August. 3.

And the theater-chians are getting better at it. AMC has been upgrading its theaters. Aside from improving sound and sightlines, AMC is rolling out plush, push-button reclining seats that offer more personal space, leg rests, and seats that vibrate with the action on screen. The company is also upgrading food and beverage offerings. AMC takes a hit on the number of seats with these upgrades. But it fills more seats during the mid-week. And it attracts more adults who tend to spend more. In these upgraded theaters, admissions were up 5% during the second quarter vs. an 11% decline in theaters that have not been renovated. This confirms that the renovation strategy makes sense. As of the end of June the company had recliner seating at about 2,300 screens, and it hopes to convert another 350 by the end of the year. The company is also expanding ticket sales to more online venues like Fandango, Movietickets.com, Flixster and Atom Tickets, as opposed to just its own website, and offering reserved seating at busier theaters. Meanwhile, AMC could net $100 million through land sales, and more cash via sales of its stake in National CineMedia

But what about Advance Auto Parts? Sadly for bulls, no follow-on insider buying here yet. But there's no selling either. And Zain Akbari, an analyst at investment researcher Morningstar, stands by his bullish call. He has a five star rating on the stock, Morningstar's highest rating.

Thomas H. Kee Jr.,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 21, 2017 9:12 a.m. ET A big change is coming: Liquidity is about to dry up in the global financial system By As liquidity dries up in the global financial system, investors need a wake-up call. I have been running Stock Traders Daily, a proactive financial newsletter offering trading strategies, since the internet bubble in 1999, and I communicate with investors regularly. I’m hearing that investors do not respect the changes in liquidity that are coming. The U.S.’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking steps to remove a massive amount of liquidity from the financial system for the first time in years. The European Central Bank (ECB) may announce similar moves next month. Boy who cried wolf It is hard to fault the average investor because they have heard repeatedly that the market may crash. It is almost like the boy who cried wolf; they have heard it so many times and it never happens, and now they don’t believe it will. Read: Text of September FOMC statement During the past five years of warnings from analysts, myself included at the beginning of the stimulus cycle, liquidity was being aggressively provided by central banks. The result: increased demand for global assets, including stocks, real estate and bonds. When liquidity is that strong and unyielding, it is difficult for any asset class to decline. Stocks overvalued This brings us to a very important point: Artificially abundant liquidity is the driving force behind global asset rallies. Without central banks’ “help,” the S&P 500 Index

                                   would not be anywhere close to being valued at 24 times earnings, where it is today. Historically, that multiple is 14.5. The problem is, when liquidity is as ample as it has been, overvalued markets can get more overvalued. That is exactly what has happened over the past five years or so. The markets became more and more overvalued as liquidity injections from central banks came like clockwork. Flow of money The flow of money will be changing dramatically. The FOMC said Wednesday it would begin winding down its hoard of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in October. The ECB’s policy board meets in October, at which time economists at Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Pictet, among others, expect the announcement of a tapering program. Beware: How the ‘great central bank unwind’ could ignite the next financial crisis The boy who cried wolf might finally be right. If liquidity is no longer as ample, it will be much more difficult for already overvalued markets to get more expensive. That could lead to material market declines, and the Nasdaq 100

,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google’s announcement that it was planning to launch a smart video camera as part of its push into hardware sent shares of action camera maker GoPro Inc down more than six percent on Wednesday. Google Clips will be the first standalone camera from the search and advertising company, which has expanded its hardware business over the last year. Its signature feature draws on machine learning technology to automatically begin recording when notable actions are detected. Those could include a child cracking a smile or a dog entering the frame. GoPro stock closed down 6.3 percent at $10.39. Shares of Snap, which derives revenue mostly from ad sales on its social media app, dropped 0.75 percent to $14.53. Google’s camera has a traditional shutter button. But users may also clip the camera onto an object and have Clips automatically record “stable, clear shots” of familiar faces set by the user, the company said. Each shot lasts seven seconds, and the battery survives about three hours in the smart-capture mode, according to Google. “We hope Google Clips helps you capture more spontaneous moments in life, without any of the hassle,” Google Clips product manager Juston Payne wrote in a company blog post. Footage wirelessly downloads through an app for Google, Apple and Samsung smartphones. Video can be stored to an unlimited online storage locker provided by Google, and high-resolution photos can be cut from the clip. At $249, it is comparable to GoPro’s $299 Hero5 Session, which can be controlled by voice for handsfree usage. Snap’s Spectacles, which are sunglasses with a video camera on one corner, records a 10-second video after the press of a button on the frame. They cost $129. Session and Spectacles are typically used outdoors, whereas Google said its devices “works best when used at home with family and close friends.” GoPro and Snap have not released smart-capture capability.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano has insisted that Sunday’s referendum “won’t happen” after ballot boxes were seized by police and the vote was declared illegal by the Spanish government. The BBC reports that close to 10 million ballot papers were impounded while 14 junior officials and associates were arrested and the website providing information to Catalans shut down. And, if Catalonia gains independence, Figueras suspects that Barcelona and other Catalan sides will have to choose whether to remain in the Spanish league or look to join a competition in another country. “In the case of independence, Catalan teams in La Liga – Barcelona, Espanyol and Girona – will have to decide where they want to play: in the Spanish league or a neighbouring country: Italy, France or the Premier League,” “Now in Spain there are teams from other countries who play in national leagues: clubs from Andorra in football and basketball. Monaco play in France, in England Welsh clubs. I don’t think that UEFA has anything against seeing another club play in a different league from their country.” La Liga president Javier Tebas has insisted that if Catalonia forms a new country then Barcelona would not be able to compete in the Spanish league. “In sport, it isn’t a la carte and things must be clearly stated,” Tebas said. “It isn’t easy to have an agreement and study Spanish legislation but if they (Catalan clubs) do get that, then they will not be able to play in Spain’s La Liga, but I hope it  IN June this year the Federal Government announced its intention to introduce the “Trader Moni” scheme as part of its So...

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com Sidewalk Labs, a sister company of tech giant Google, is the preferred partner to build a high-tech “smart” neighbourhood on Toronto’s east downtown waterfront, the Star has learned. The board of Waterfront Toronto, the federal-provincial-city agency overseeing the so-called Quayside project, is expected to vote at an Oct. 20 meeting whether to confirm the agency’s staff recommendation arising from a rigorous competitive bid process launched in May. If confirmed by Waterfront Toronto’s board, the choice of a firm owned by Google holding company Alphabet Inc. would be a big high-tech feather in the cap of the city currently chasing the second headquarters of Amazon and other innovation opportunities. Quayside is envisioned by the agency as a testbed for cutting-edge technology as well as a bustling, functioning neighbourhood, with homes, offices, retail and cultural space, near Queens Quay E. and Parliament St. “This is very big news for more good jobs on our waterfront,” said Councillor Paula Fletcher. “Expediting plans for waterfront transit will be critical for its success.” A source familiar with the outcome of Waterfront Toronto’s request-for-proposal told the Star on Wednesday that Sidewalk Labs is Waterfront Toronto’s “preferred proponent” to help build the “precedent-setting waterfront community.” Waterfront Toronto, Google and Mayor John Tory’s office all refused comment Wednesday, citing confidentiality and the integrity of the bid process. Sidewalk Labs is Alphabet’s urban innovation unit, with a stated goal of “reimagining cities from the Internet up.” Dan Doctoroff, the company’s chief executive and co-founder, told a conference in New York City last May that his company was “looking into developing a large-scale district” to act as its smart city test bed. The community would be universally connected by broadband and could have, Doctoroff said, prefab modular housing, sensors to constantly monitor building performance, and robotic delivery services to cut residential storage space, website The Architects’ Newspaper reported in May. Improving transportation would be a focus, possibly with self-driving cars and design to encourage biking and walking, he told the conference. World-leading environmental sustainability could include thermal exchange systems to capture wasted building heat, and smart sensors to limit energy use. Waterfront Toronto says the 4.9-hectare (12-acre) site will be “a testbed for emerging technologies, materials and processes that will address these challenges and advance solutions that can be replicated in cities worldwide.” The agency said the winning bidder must propose plans to foster sustainability, resiliency and urban innovation; complete communities with a range of housing types for families of all sizes and income levels; economic development and prosperity driving innovation that will be rolled out to the rest of the world; and partnership and investment ensuring a solid financial foundation that secures revenue and manages financial risk. Development of the three publicly owned blocks at the east end of Queens Quay will eventually include redesign and reconstruction of the intersection of Queens Quay and Parliament Street. Toronto tech leaders at a Smart Cities event in Toronto last May said the city is on the cusp of a tech boom, noting talk of Google interest in the city and Uber’s decision to make Toronto a hub for driverless car research.

Un colaborador del Congreso dijo que se solicitó a los ejecutivos de las tres empresas que se presenten ante una audiencia pública de la Comisión de Inteligencia del Senado el 1 de noviembre. Los líderes de la Comisión de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes dijeron que el panel realizaría una audiencia abierta el próximo mes con representantes de firmas tecnológicas no identificadas, en un esfuerzo por “entender mejor cómo Rusia utilizó herramientas en línea y plataformas para sembrar discordia o influir en nuestra elección”. Representantes de Facebook y Google de Alphabet Inc confirmaron que recibieron las invitaciones de la comisión del Senado, pero no aclararon si asistirían. Twitter no respondió inmediatamente a las solicitudes de comentarios. La comisión de la Cámara baja no identificó de inmediato a las compañías, pero una fuente del panel dijo que los legisladores esperan escuchar los testimonios de las tres empresas citadas por el Senado. Las solicitudes son la más reciente medida de los investigadores del Congreso que buscan conseguir información de las empresas de Internet sobre la extensión de los presuntos esfuerzos de Moscú por interferir en la elección de Estados Unidos del año pasado. Facebook reveló este mes que sospecha que usuarios rusos compraron más de 100.000 dólares en espacios publicitarios para difundir mensajes divisorios durante el ciclo electoral 2016, una revelación que motivó llamamientos de algunos demócratas para que se creen nuevas normas de transparencia para la propaganda política en Internet. El miércoles, el presidente Donald Trump criticó a Facebook por supuestamente confabular con medios de comunicación que se le oponen. El republicano se ha mostrado escéptico sobre las conclusiones de las agencias de inteligencia estadounidenses que apuntan a que Rusia interfirió en la elección y ha negado que su campaña se haya confabulado con Moscú. “Facebook siempre fue anti-Trump. Las redes siempre han estado en mi contra”, dijo el presidente en Twitter, emitiendo la misma acusación empleada en contra del New York Times y del Washington Post. “¿Conspiración?”, agregó. Las críticas motivaron una extensa respuesta del presidente ejecutivo de Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, quien dijo que tanto Trump como los liberales están molestos por ideas y contenidos publicados en la red social durante la campaña. “Así se ve cuando se opera una plataforma para todas las ideas”, escribió Zuckerberg en su página personal.

 ,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"Data privacy is under the spotlight after revelations in 2013 by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass U.S. surveillance caused political outrage in Europe. Irish High Court Judge Caroline Costello said she had decided to ask the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the case. “European Union law guarantees a high level of protection to EU citizens ... they are entitled to an equivalent high level of protection when their data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area,” she said. The Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s office initially became involved after Austrian law student and privacy activist Max Schrems made a complaint in Dublin about Facebook’s handling of his data in the United States. The judge said the Irish Data Protection Commissioner “has raised well-founded concerns that there is an absence of an effective remedy in U.S. law compatible with the requirements of Article 47 of the Charter (of Fundamental Rights).” She said that a newly created U.S. ombudsperson dealing with Europeans’ complaints about U.S. surveillance did not eliminate those concerns. Costello also said she was not delivering any value judgment on the data protection laws in the EU or United States. A Facebook spokeswoman said it was essential the EU court “considers the extensive evidence demonstrating the robust protections in place under Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and U.S. law, before it makes any decision that may endanger the transfer of data across the Atlantic and around the globe.” The company has previously said the case could lead to a breakdown in transatlantic data transfers that could knock EU economic output by up to 1.3 percent. A ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) against the common legal arrangements used by thousands of firms to transfer personal data outside the EU could cause major headaches for companies. Millions of these transfers happen every day and include credit card transactions, hotel bookings or moving employee data between countries. Schrems, speaking to reporters outside the court, said he hoped the ECJ would force the EU and the United States to finally deal with the gap between what he said were stricter privacy rules enjoyed by Facebook users in Europe compared to those that apply to its servers in California. “I hope we will get a decision that ends this ping-pong and stops kicking the can down the road,” he said. Schrems also said he did not expect the legal arrangements - known as standard contractual clauses - to be banned by the EU court. The Business Software Alliance lobby group, that represents the global software industry, said it hoped the ECJ would focus on how specific SCCs are used rather than whether or not they should be allowed at all, as the clauses can be adapted to provide additional protections. Law firm Linklaters said that it believed the ECJ was unlikely to halt transatlantic data transfers but that its ruling could lead to additional safeguards that could add to costs. “This decision will be closely watched by many businesses as it could have significant implications for their ability to transfer personal data internationally,” Richard Cumbley, partner in Linklaters’ technology group, said.

Rakesh Sharma,10052017,Investopedia,09282017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs At its event today, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) subsidiary Google unveiled three hardware products that reinforce a commitment to the product category from the search giant, which derives the overwhelming majority of its revenue from software. If the slate launched today is a hit, then the products could broaden Google's reach into consumers' lives and make a significant difference to the company's bottom line. The new products launched by Google today are Pixel 2 smartphones, Google Home smart speakers and a premium version of its Chromebooks. Like Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) recently released iPhone 8 models, the Pixel 2 smartphones come in two sizes – 6 inches and 5.5 inches – with plastic OLED curved screens. The phones also have a bunch of features similar to Apple's phones, such as augmented reality (AR) capabilities and no headphone jacks. At $649 and $849, the Pixel phones' price points are also comparable with those of Apple's phones. (See also: Google Pixel Details Leak Ahead of Launch Event.) In releasing two versions of its smart speakers, Google is taking on market leader Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and newcomer Apple at the same time. At $49 a pop, the Google Home Mini is an affordable version of the Google Home speaker and competes directly with Amazon's Echo Dot, which is priced at an identical $49.99. The Google Home Max, on the other hand, costs $399 and is equipped with a ""Smart Sound"" function that adjusts to the surrounding environment. While launching its smart speaker HomePod earlier this year, Apple also touted its high-fidelity and spatial sound capabilities that enable the speaker to optimally adjust its output to the environment. Apple's speaker costs $399 as well. (See also: Is the Price for Apple's HomePod Justified?) Finally, Google launched a high-end Chromebook with a 360-degree hinge that enables users to fold it into a tablet. The Pixelbook is Google's lightest such product and is available in two flavors with differing memory capabilities. Again, the Pixelbook's price points, which start at an expensive $1,000, are designed to compete with Apple's Macbooks. Taken together, the markets targeted by Google's three new products are enormous. But the Mountain View, California-based company is a comparatively late entrant here and lags market leaders by a wide margin. There are minimal differences in product features between competitors, and strategy is key to success. (See also: Why Google Is Buying HTC Talent for $1.1B.) A crowded market makes distribution and reach essential for success. This is where Google seems to be losing out. In an interview with MarketWatch, analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research said that Google's exclusive deal with Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) for the Pixel played spoilsport with Google's sales numbers for its phone because it limited the phone's reach. This assessment does not bode well for Google because it has repeated the strategy this time around. On the other hand, according to analyst Ben Bajarin, good sales numbers will help Google justify its hardware strategy. ""These new products need to be able to compete with some of the other strong product lineups, and it is not as easy as it once was,"" he told Marketwatch.

Based on data compiled by a trio of Chinese researchers who have developed an IQ test for AI, Google’s score significantly outperforms Siri and Bing—yet with an IQ less than that of a 6-year-old. (See also: Artificial Intelligence Will Add $15.7 Trillion to the Global Economy: PwC.) Researchers Feng Liu, Yong Shi and Yin Liu carried out tests throughout 2016, which ranked Google’s AI IQ at 47.28, just shy of the average IQ they found for a human 6-year-old: 55.5. Siri’s IQ fell well below at 23.9, which was also lower than Microsoft Corp.’s (MSFT) Bing and Baidu, at 31.98 and 32.92, respectively. For comparison’s sake, the average 18-year-old has an IQ of 97, according to the study. “The results so far indicate that the artificial intelligence systems produced by Google, Baidu, and others have significantly improved over the past two years but still have certain gaps as compared with even a six-year-old child,” according to the research. While AI’s IQ scores are still dwarfed by that of the average human adult, Google and Microsoft have all seen their research and development (R&D) pay off in increasingly intelligent bots. In 2014, Google’s IQ score was just 26.5, while Microsoft’s was 13.5. Tech titans are making significant investments in AI research. DeepMind, a U.K.artificial intelligence company bought by Google in 2014, has tripled the amount of money it spends on top talent, according to published reports. The investments are expected to fuel breakthroughs in areas such as speech and image recognition, automatically serving business functions such as advertisements.

(JD); and Internet search, e-commerce platform, online payments processor, and web application software provider Baidu Inc. (BIDU).  These companies' dominance in their markets and in key sectors of the Internet position them well to exploit artificial intelligence as its influence spreads.

In an attempt to put that $15 trillion or so in perspective, that's almost the current size of U.S. GDP ($18 trillion), over six times current global spending on e-commerce ($2.4 trillion), and 30 times current worldwide spending on advertising ($500 billion), according to the report by Wells Fargo as quoted by Barron's. Wells Fargo anticipates advances in neural network science that will produce stronger engagement among mobile and Internet users, with benefits for e-commerce and subscription-based business models. More specifically, artificial neural networks (modeled on the natural neural networks in human brains) are designed to facilitate machine learning, or the ability of computers to solve problems without task-specific programming. The early adoption of AI will be mainly in North America as companies boost productivity, PwC  says. However, they expect China to pull ahead in ten years, enjoying a 26% GDP boost by 2030, versus 14.5% in North America. Of the $15.7 trillion AI-driven global GDP increase forecasted for 2030, about $10.7 trillion will be in North America and China combined, or 68% of the total, PwC projects. In China, AI is projected to have its biggest industry impact in manufacturing, which is especially significant for the global economy since China is the world leader in manufacturing, Wells Fargo says, as quoted by Barron's. For the nine companies recommended by Wells Fargo, their 52 week share price gains through Wednesday, and current forward P/E ratios, are, respectively: Alphabet, 19%, 24; Amazon, 15%, 121; Facebook, 30%, 26; eBay, 19%, 17; Netflix, 87%, 89; Tencent, 54%, NA; Alibaba, 57%, 26; JD.com, 51%, 44; and Baidu, 28%, 27.

(AMZN), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook Inc. (FB) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), their future is far from secure, according to NYU's Scott Galloway. As the giants are pitted against each other in key markets, increasingly eyed by regulators around the globe, they will face competition from other tech giants, most notably sharing economy unicorn Airbnb. (See also: Tech Sector Blows Past Its Bubble-Era Heights.) In the professor's new book on the subject, titled “The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google,” Galloway not only criticizes the tech giants on taxes, privacy and jobs but suggests that they will face off against each other in a “battle of the giants.” “At least two or three now compete in each other’s markets, whether it’s advertising, music, books, movies, social networks, cell phones—or lately, autonomous vehicles,” said Galloway. In an interview with CNBC, the professor noted that “only Apple has the potential to cheat death,” given its position as a luxury brand with better margins and a competitive edge. As for Seattle-based e-commerce and cloud computing leader Amazon, the author suggests that the company should break up to appease regulators. He indicates that if Amazon were smart, if would spinoff its public cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). “It would increase value and keep regulators at bay for another couple of years,” said Galloway. As the Four Horsemen continue to compete against internet giants such as Alibaba Group (BABA), Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and Uber Technologies Inc. (set to hit the public market by 2019), the professor forecasts Airbnb as having the best shot at beating out the industry leaders. Galloway highlights the risk of an industry “barreling toward regulation,” which could cause a “huge shift in the public and government’s perception and treatment of these companies.” He notes the recent investigation into Russian meddling in the election, with Facebook at the center, presents a possible turning point for the social media company’s reputation. The author also expects a “$10 billion-plus fine to come out of Europe.” While new startups will have a hard time beating out the market leaders due to various factors including their sheer market cap, the author doesn’t completely rule out such a scenario. “At some kitchen table or a booth at Starbucks, a start-up team, led by the next Steve Jobs, is plotting a new enterprise that could streak past the horsemen to become the first 1-T [$1 trillion] corporation,” writes Galloway.   (See also: Roku Surges 68% After IPO: Tech Titans at Risk?)

Nathan Reiff,10052017,Investopedia,09282017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs As cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed in popularity over the past year or so, related industries have also seen a boom. Cryptocurrency- and blockchain-related startups have launched left and right, supported in many cases by initial coin offerings earning millions of dollars. And digital currency mining operations have proliferated as well. Reports have swirled about website owners harnessing the CPU power of their visitors in order to run their own cryptocurrency mining scripts without the Internet users’ knowledge or consent. Here are a few ways to help prevent websites from taking your CPU power without you knowing.  (Related: Showtime Websites Used Visitors' CPU Power for Crypto Mining) Google’s Chrome web browser has a special extension which users can adopt in order to prevent cryptocurrency mining from happening unwittingly. No Coin is an open-source extension that FossBytes.com calls a “reliable and safe way to control how a website is interacting with your web browser.” No Coin will search any website for possible mining activity and alert you if any such processing is occurring. The extension will allow you to block or whitelist those websites as you prefer. Similar to No Coin, minerBlock is an extension for the Chrome browser which is also open-source and which prevents cryptocurrency mining in your browser. Like No Coin, minerBlock will alert you when you travel to a website that may be using your CPU power to mine for digital tokens. If you wish to proceed in spite of the warning, you’ll be able to disable the blocker with a simple click. Web browser extensions used to block advertisements can also help you to block domains for other reasons too, including sites that are looking to steal your CPU power. AdBlock is a popular extension which allows you to block an ad or website by inputting a particular URL. The downside with this method of blocking mining is that you’ll have to be able to tell whether the site is participating in this scheme on your own. Check your computer’s activity monitor to look for spikes in CPU usage upon visiting certain websites. If you use Firefox to browse the web, you may have some luck blocking unauthorized CPU mining with a JavaScript-blocker extension such as NoScript. One caveat about using an extension like this is that it may affect harmless websites which happen to use JavaScript as well. It’s possible that you would find that other websites simply won’t work, as NoScript is too wide-ranging in its efforts to block Java usage. Regardless of the method you use to control your CPU usage, it’s becoming more and more of a concern for Internet users everywhere. This is only likely to increase as cryptocurrency use grows more widespread. ",How to Prevent Your Browser Being Hijacked for Cryptocurrency Mining | Investopedia

Companies that are looking to make newer and better chips need to develop innovative strategies, as the rising use of artificial intelligence changes chip making. (For more, see also: Intel Dethroned by Samsung as No. 1 Chipmaker.) As this industry shifts, a prediction that companies like Intel Corporation (INTC) will boost the capital they spend on equipment has drawn the interest of Wall Street analysts, Barron's reported. These businesses will put an average of $45 billion per year toward this end between 2017 and 2020, sharply higher than the annual average of $32 billion that existed during the seven years prior. Applied Materials, which has a price-earnings ratio of 18.33, has climbed roughly 60% year-to-date (YTD), according to Google Finance data. This company, which is a major supplier of tools to businesses such as Intel, has done well for most of this year and could generate strong performance next year as well, Barron's reported. As companies bolster their spending on equipment, Applied Materials expects that its earnings per share will rise notably.

(GOOGL) — the so-called FANG stocks — Bank of America Merrill Lynch has argued. Savita Subramanian, a strategist at the Wall Street firm, believes that FANG, an acronym created by Jim Cramer to highlight the four most popular and best-performing technology companies, should be changed to FAAANG to accommodate the equally good growth prospects of Broadcom and Adobe. According to CNBC, Subramanian came to this conclusion after screening large-cap technology companies with similar attributes to the original FANG stocks. The strategist sought to identify stocks with a market cap in excess of $65 billion that boast sales growth of 20 percent or higher and expect long-term growth rates of 15 percent of more. Software company Adobe and semiconductor specialist Broadcom passed the test with flying colors. Like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, the original FANG stocks, Adobe and Broadcom’s growth prospects haven’t gone unnoticed by investors. Broadcom’s shares are up 44 percent over the past year after the semiconductor giant registered impressive growth across its three business segments, wired infrastructure, wireless communications and enterprise storage. The company’s status as the chip supplier for Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPhones and exciting product launches in the mushrooming enterprise storage market are fueling expectations that further earnings growth is in store. Jim Cramer recently described Broadcom as the best iPhone play, while Angelo Zino, senior industry analyst at independent research firm CFRA, said the company is ""among the most attractively valued chipmakers.” (See also: Broadcom Is the Best iPhone Play: Jim Cramer.) Adobe is also on a tear. Earlier this month, the software giant announced better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter 2017 results, including healthy cash flow and soaring demand for its cloud-based subscription products. Encouraging forward guidance suggests the company expects this strong spell to continue and helps to explain why investors have bid the shares up 36 percent over the past 12 months. (See also: Why Adobe's Investors Are Dancing on Cloud 9.) The increasing popularity of these so-called FAAANG stocks has caused discomfort among some Wall Street observers. Bears believe that these companies are now priced for perfection, warning that the slightest hint of bad news could prompt nervy investors to quickly take profits. However, Subramanian believes that these concerns have yet to gain much traction, noting that short interest on FAAANG stocks is near a record low of 0.9 percent.

In particular, Belkin worries that the markets are ""in a crazy bubble based on central banks' quantitative easing,"" as quoted by Barron's. (For more, see also: Stocks Face ""Nasty Shock"" From Fed-Created Bubble.) For his Apocalypse Portfolio, Belkin recommends stocks such as oil exploration, refining and marketing giant Chevron Corp. (CVX), gold and copper producer Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM), silver miner Pan American Silver Corp. (PAAS), and telecom services provider Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). He also advises short sales of semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), and discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), among others. As a general trend, Belkin expects investors to rotate out of richly valued technology shares into more defensive energy and utility stocks that offer attractive dividend yields. Indeed, he finds energy shares that were hurt by the drop in crude oil prices to be particularly attractive right now. U.S. Treasury Bonds are another alternative for safety-oriented investors, he adds. Belkin recommends Chevron as a cheap defensive stock with a dividend yield of more than 4%. With Newmont Mining, gold typically shows a negative correlation with the S&P, and is in a bullish trend right now. Regarding Pan American Silver, he expects silver prices to climb faster than gold, and he notes that there is a smaller universe of silver mining stocks than gold issues. He sees Verizon as inexpensive and less risky than technology shares, and it offers a 4.8% dividend yield. Additionally, Belkin suggests several exchange-traded funds (ETF) and notes (ETN), including the CSOP SZSE ChiNext ETF (3147.HK) as a play on $1 trillion of infrastructure spending in China. He also recommends the iPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN (VXX), a heavily shorted ETN linked to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) that he says could jump in price if market volatility finally picks up. Belkin says that it's time to short some tech favorites and financial stocks whose prices have dropped under their 200-month moving averages, a signal to him that they could be headed even lower. Nvidia and Schwab are among the vulnerable stocks that he finds in these sectors. Google parent Alphabet Inc. is among his shorts on the basis that it is over-owned, and thus vulnerable to heavy selling in a market downturn. His analysis of market moving averages, meanwhile, suggests that the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) may be significantly overpriced, foreshadowing a drop of 50% or more. Using the same methodology, his model turned bearish in 2000, Barron's says. From its dotcom bubble peak in March 2000 to its low in October 2002, the Nasdaq Composite fell 78%. The current U.S. economic upturn is now 99 months old, the third-longest since 1902, Belkin notes. Moreover, he is among many observers who warn that it has been artificially sustained by the Federal Reserve. He sees a recession on the horizon, key indicators being that growth in automotive sales and retail sales peaked in December and January, respectively. With corporate earnings eventually declining in a recessionary environment, stock prices will follow, he indicates. (For more, see also: Bear Market Ahead: What 5 Big Investors Forecast.) The last bear market in U.S. stocks ran from October 9, 2007 through March 9, 2009, for a duration of 17 months.

(FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) – could rally even more if previous fourth-quarter trends hold true to form. Of course, investors can tap the FANG stocks with various exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN). Actually, it is FDN that has a penchant for bullish fourth quarter performances. The fund has been one of the best performing U.S. ETFs during the last three months of the year since it debuted in mid 2006. The $4.78 billion FDN, which is the largest internet ETF trading in the U.S., posts an average fourth quarter gain of 4.4% and a median increase of 4.8%, generating gains in the quarter 60% of the time on average. (See also: The One ETF to Own the Top Internet Company Stocks.) FDN tracks the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index and allocates over 30% of its combined weight to the FANG quartet. Nearly 70% of FDN's holdings are classified as technology stocks, with 19.2% being classified as consumer discretionary names. Amazon and Netflix account for the bulk of the ETF's consumer cyclical exposure. FDN is up about 29% year to date, or more than twice the performance of the S&P 500. Assuming the ETF posts its average fourth-quarter gain of 4.3% and finishes 2017 with a gain of just over 33%, that would be FDN's best annual showing since 2013, when it surged 53.6%. Barring a disaster of epic proportions, FDN is poised to extend its annual winning streak to six years. (See also: Why Biotech and Tech Will Push Stocks Higher in 4Q.) Still, internet stocks remain pricey. FDN's price-to-earnings ratio is just over 31, well above the comparable metric on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, the home index for many of FDN's holdings. Most if not all of FDN's 42 components can be considered growth or momentum stocks, indicating why the ETF historically performs well in the fourth quarter. November marks the start of the best six-month period in which to own stocks, and that time frame often favors higher-beta, cyclical sectors. Usually, the technology sector excels in October and during much of the stronger six-month frame. Investors have been enthusiastic about FDN this year, having pushed $275 million into the fund year to date. However, there was modest profit taking in the ETF during the recently completed third quarter, when investors pulled almost $25 million from the fund. (See also: It Should Be FAAANG, Not FANG: BofAML.)

Speaking during Vanity Fair’s New Establishment Summit this week, Iger said the company mulled an acquisition when it was exploring ways to provide and sell content directly to consumers. It opted instead to acquire a majority stake in BAMTech, the sports streaming service it already had an investment in. ""We thought Twitter had global reach, a pretty interesting user interface, and a compelling way that we might be able to present and sell the content our company makes to the consumer,"" said Iger at the summit, according to CNBC. ""But we decided, ultimately, not to go in that direction. And we ended up—took us months to do it—buying a platform called BAMTech."" The executive noted that the social media aspect of Twitter is “interesting,” but the company was focused on distribution. Disney will use BAMTech as the backing for its streaming services. (See more: Why Disney Stock Looks Cheap Given Growth Outlook.) Last fall, Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Disney was interested in buying the social media company. That sparked all sorts of speculation as to what a combined company could look like. It also prompted some Wall Street watchers to express optimism for a deal. BTIG Research laid out in May a five-point plan to reposition the entertainment giant that included buying Twitter. According to analyst Richard Greenfield, management at the company should be using its strong balance sheet and free cash flow to “strategically reposition” it for future growth. In order to do that, he said he thought the company should stop repurchasing shares and instead use the money for acquisitions. He said at the time that Twitter would be an ideal way to reinvigorate ESPN. (See also: Disney Should Buy Twitter or Spotify: BTIG.) While Disney chose BAMTech over Twitter that doesn't mean the entertainment juggernaut isn’t done on the M&A front. In September, during a Bank of America media and communications conference, Iger told investors and analysts that its recent M&A activity will continue as the company aims to enhance its digital presence and take on the competition. Those comments sparked speculation with some investors betting one of the targets will be Snap Inc. (SNAP), the maker of the disappearing-message app Snapchat. That may not be too much of stretch since Disney’s newfound competitors—Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG) Google and Facebook Inc. (FB)—expressed interest in acquiring the social media company. Google reportedly bid at least $30 billion in 2016. The offer, which was rejected by Snap, remained on the table after it went public. It’s not clear if Google is still interested in acquiring.

David Pierce,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"You'd think having dominated search and email, created Chrome and YouTube, plus a self-driving car project, a handful of save-the-world enterprises, and the greatest advertising business in the history of the universe would be enough to keep Google busy. You certainly wouldn't think the folks in Mountain View would suddenly feel the urge to get into the smartphone game, a remarkably mature market where nobody but Samsung and Apple makes any money, and where Google's already ubiquitous thanks to Android. And yet, tomorrow, Google will reportedly launch the next generation of its smartphone with the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL. At the same time, the company will reportedly introduce a new Chrome OS-based laptop called the Pixelbook, a small smart speaker called the Google Home Mini, and new hardware for the Daydream VR platform. The announcements come on the heels of Google's $1.1 billion acqui-hire of 2,000 HTC engineers, who will help Google make more hardware, more quickly. Right or wrong, smart or stupid, Google's a hardware company now. Of course, Google's made hardware for a long time. The Nexus team built phones; the Pixel team worked on Chromebooks, tablets, and then also phones. The Ara team, within Google's ATAP division, built its own sort of phones. Another team worked on Chromecast, another on Google Wi-Fi, another on the Daydream View. Remember the Nexus Q set-top-box-doorstep thing? That was Google. All these products had the same goal: to show developers and users how good Google's software could be, running on the right hardware. But they were small-time, limited-run products that rarely led to market-wide innovation. In 2016, something finally clicked, and Google took its fate more firmly into its own hands. Google Glass 2.0 Is a Startling Second Act Google Joins the Augmented Reality Party with ARCore Google’s Plan to Engineer the Next Silicon Valleys Google's Perfect Future Will Always Be Just Around The Corner As they say, hardware is hard. It's a ruthless and low-margin business, but it's also an important one. Building gadgets in-house gives Google an opportunity to assert itself beyond what any of its partners can offer. More importantly, it gives Google a chance to control its destiny in an increasingly uncertain time. ""As new technologies spin out of mobile, Google wants to make sure its own high-end hardware highlights that—whether it’s Assistant or Daydream or Tango, even the Internet of Things,"" says Avi Greengart, a devices and platforms analyst for GlobalData. ""Google needs Samsung, it likes Samsung, but as the platform driver it doesn’t want to be entirely dependent on Samsung."" Depending on Samsung is a dangerous game. Galaxy products are the most popular Android phones by far, and the prime iPhone competition. But every year, you can feel Samsung leaning a little further away from Google. It built the Bixby assistant, which competes directly with Google Assistant, and gave Bixby prime placement on its phones. Samsung builds its own browser, email client, and messaging app, which seem utterly redundant unless Samsung's trying to wean its reliance on Google products. Samsung mostly eschews Daydream in favor of Gear VR, and has a home-grown smart-home platform competing directly with Nest, Android Things, and all the other Google connected-home products. Over the last few years, Samsung's been hammering away at Tizen, its own operating system, which already runs on the company's wearables. Save for the Play Store's un-replicable app selection, Samsung barely needs Android at all. Soon enough, Android's power might wane for everyone else as well. New platforms like Amazon's Alexa pose something of an existential threat to Google. Alexa can give you directions through Google Maps, or another mapping app. You can listen to Google Play Music, or Spotify. If you buy an Echo, you might someday never use Google, and you might not even notice. Google could go to the HTCs and LGs of the world, build phones and speakers with them, and try to grow competitors in the wild. Except that doesn't work—Google's been trying for years with the Nexus program to inspire and convince others to build better, cleaner, more powerful Android phones, but everybody just keeps buying Galaxies. So that's the danger in not making hardware. There's also opportunity in doing so. Just look at Apple, which spent the last decade taking the idea of vertical integration to its extreme. It doesn't just design and assemble its own phones, it's also responsible for many of the most important parts inside. By any measure, the latest crop of iPhones are the most powerful smartphones on the market, thanks to Apple's own A11 Bionic processor. As other companies converge on identical performance metrics, commoditizing a ""Good Phone,"" Apple's jumped to a whole different level. That's why its augmented-reality tech works so well, why its cameras are consistently the best on the market, and even enables minor-but-crucial things like rock-solid Bluetooth connection. As the next phase of tech comes into the market, that kind of power and control become even more important. ""Tiny EarPods, Smart Watches, Augmented Reality, Adaptive Acoustics require wrapping your arms around all parts of the problem,"" the analyst Horace Dediu wrote recently. ""The integration and control it demands are in contrast to the modular approach of assembling off-the-shelf components into a good-enough configuration."" Think about the next version of Google Glass (or whatever non-flashback-inducing new name Google gives its face-puter). Making that work will require highly specific work in batteries, processors, screens, cameras, and more. The off-the-shelf version looks like, well, Glass. The custom version, built in-house and in tandem with the software, firmware, and wireless teams at Google, could be much better. Right now, the company's making a smartphone for the same reason Andy Rubin's Essential started with a smartphone, the same reason anyone talks themselves into entering this preposterously huge market: It's the most important device anyone owns. Google seems to believe it's big and popular enough that it can wedge its foot in the door of the market, and at least take a piece of the high-end smartphone universe. But that's actually the easy part—the last Pixel was great, and HTC made it. The real reason to take everything internal is to be able to control and improve what comes after. Saying ""we're a hardware company!"" and actually becoming a successful one are two radically different enterprises, though. That HTC group Google just bought? They've made great phones for a decade, but thanks to some bad carrier-exclusivity decisions and a truly terrible marketing plan, its products stayed under the radar. (Meanwhile, Samsung's marketing department bought the radar and trained it to only recognize Samsung products.) The Pixel, which is a great phone, didn't exactly take the world by storm either. Google hasn't reported exact sales, but one estimate showed a million Pixels in the market; another said between three and five million. That's due in part to Google's total inability to keep the phone in stock—another downside of not managing your own hardware—but doesn't inspire much confidence. Either way, Greengart says, ""it certainly hasn’t been a dominant player in the high-end of the market. It doesn’t play at all in one of the biggest markets, China. I can’t see Huawei or Xiaomi or Oppo being worried."" Apple and Samsung haven't lost sleep either. But Google has to try. As we've learned time and again, the best products come from companies that make both hardware and software, each working to optimize and improve the other. Samsung knows it; Apple knows it. As we enter the next phase of tech, where smartphones give way to smart watches and smart speakers and smart lightbulbs and smart cars, there's no room for too-big parts or inefficient software. The winners will be the companies who figure out how to do everything right: hardware, software, marketing, everything. Apple nailed it with phones, and became the richest company in the world. There's another chance coming. Remember Marty's jean jacket from ""Back to the Future""? Well Levi's Commuter Trucker Jacket with Jacquard by Google is better. We got a glimpse into what might happen when we start connecting our clothes to the internet. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Max A. Cherney,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Published: Oct 4, 2017 8:51 a.m. ET Alphabet expected to show off new Pixel smartphones and other gadgets Wednesday By Alphabet Inc. will look to impress gadget lovers Wednesday with a new line of devices for the holiday shopping season, but the company’s event will also be important to determine if the money Google is spending to produce its own hardware and challenge Apple Inc. is worth the cost. Much of what Google will unveil at the San Francisco event has been reported, thanks to a series of leaks last month. Two new Pixel phones — one larger than the other — a new high-end Chromebook, a mini version of Google’s Home smart speaker and an updated Daydream virtual-reality setup are expected. While the surprise element may be missing from the event, there is still much anticipation to see what Alphabet

More than anything, Wednesday’s event will need to convince investors and the media that the company’s hardware strategy is a bet worth making. “I think they need to convince everyone that their hardware strategy is justified, this is a very expensive endeavor,” said Creative Strategies Principal Ben Bajarin. “If this is a strategy they need to remain committed to, they need to take meaningful share. These new products need to be able to compete with some of the other strong product lineups, and it’s not as easy as it once was.” Google appears to be doubling down on the bet it made last year in introducing the Pixel to challenge Apple’s iPhone, after previously leaving most hardware design and manufacturing to partners like Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.

                                   that will bring hardware talent and licensing from the hardware partner that has been essential to the Pixel line. See also: Why Google’s HTC deal may be different than the Motorola bomb Alphabet is making that commitment while the opportunity to profit from sales of its own branded smartphones, Chromebooks and smart speakers is not guaranteed. Alphabet‘s hardware sales are bundled with all non-advertising Google revenue in a bucket of sales that grew 62% to $3.4 billion in last year’s holiday shopping quarter, but that amount is dwarfed by the rest of Google’s business and profitability is a real question mark. Analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research believes Google has sold about 2 million Pixel phones — Apple sold that many iPhones in half a week, on average, last year — and still has a lot to learn about the business. One of the reasons the last Pixel models did not see Apple-like numbers of units was that Google initially gave Verizon an exclusive deal to sell the phones, Dawson says. “The devil is in the details,” said Dawson over the phone. “The reality is they sold 2 million phones because of limited supply, limited distribution and that they were not differentiated in the market. Unless those things change, it’s not going to be that material to Google’s sales. Even if they move twice as many units, that’s still a tiny fraction of the global smartphone market.” Don’t miss: Google Finance as you know it is going away — here is what will remain Google could juice its revenue from the Pixel with a new pricing strategy for its phone lineup, much like Apple’s iPhone X announcement earlier this month. Dawson says that it would not surprise him to see a price increase in the new Pixel phones driven by more expensive components and rising memory costs. “It’s quite possible that Pixel devices will be more expensive than last year,” Dawson said. Google could go the other way, however, and look to offer the Pixel at a much lower price than the iPhone X to disrupt sales of Apple’s latest and greatest smartphone, which will begin preorders later this month. While it could weigh on Alphabet’s profitability, a larger quantity of cheaper sales could have a better chance of making a difference for a company expected to surpass $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time this year, and would fit the Android vs. Apple rivalry as it has been known so far. To compete, the display and camera are the two features “Google needs to be competitive with” Apple and Samsung, Bajarin said. Specifically, the camera needs to be “top-notch,” perhaps with some kind of three-dimensional sensing, and the display needs to be bezel-less, he says. Related: Nvidia adds Google Assistant to Shield streaming device While the phones might be the gadgets that consumers and investors watch closest, Bajarin also said that Google’s expected Home Mini smart speaker might be most exciting. The new Home, and its big brother, can showcase the products Google is best at: search and giving users the data they want. “Nobody saw the volume of speakers coming, Amazon

But again, they’ve got to prove themselves that they can take smart-speaker share.” Alphabet’s Class A shares have gained 22.1% and Class C shares have added 23.5% so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500 index’s

Max A. Cherney,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Published: Sept 30, 2017 10:50 a.m. ET Voice control on streaming device can turn TV into AI speaker By Nvidia Inc. is adding Google’s virtual assistant technology to its Shield 4K video streaming and gaming device, the company announced Thursday, beefing up its offering and positioning it as a direct competitor to Apple TV. The addition of Google Assistant via hands-free voice control to Nvidia’s streaming box and other features, such as smart-home support, offers a challenge to Apple at the top end of the market for streaming-media devices while offering capabilities that would also require the purchase of an AI speaker in most other ecosystems. Read: Nvidia is more bullish on cryptocurrency than AMD The new Google Assistant-enabled Shield offering is straightforward to use: People can use voice commands to do things on TVs such as watch specific shows, fast forward and ask Google to mine its databases for information about what programming is currently running. Google’s virtual assistant can also perform functions such as shopping on Google’s store, checking calendars and ordering ride-hailing services such as Uber, among other things, similar to AI speakers like the Google Home. Answers, based on Google’s Assistant, will appear visually on the TV in different formats, depending on the question and information requested. Users can also ask their TVs to display photos and slideshows from Alphabet Inc.’s

Read: Uber investors threaten legal action over board bid to strip supervoting rights The revelations came from a due-diligence report about Anthony Levandowski and other former Google engineers that Uber commissioned in March 2016 before buying their startup, Ottomotto LLC, known as Otto, months later. Alphabet’s self-driving-car unit, Waymo, attached the report to a filing late Monday, having successfully forced Uber to hand over a copy after months of fighting to access it. Waymo sued Uber in February for allegedly stealing its trade secrets, claiming the ride-hailing firm conspired with Levandowski to bring thousands of files to Uber. A jury trial is set to begin later this month, though the federal judge overseeing the case is expected to rule Tuesday on Waymo’s request to postpone the trial so it can better prepare.

Jack Nicas,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Published: Oct 5, 2017 10:51 p.m. ET By YouTube this week surfaced videos peddling misinformation, hateful messages and conspiracy theories to users tracking major news events -- prompting the site to change its search results to promote more authoritative sources. For example, the fifth result when searching ""Las Vegas shooting"" on YouTube late Tuesday yielded a video titled ""Proof Las Vegas Shooting Was a FALSE FLAG attack -- Shooter on 4th Floor."" The video said there were multiple shooters in Sunday's mass shooting, a claim dismissed by law enforcement. Posted by a channel called the End Times News Report, it amassed more than 1.1 million views in about 27 hours. The fourth result when searching ""NFL anthem protest"" on Wednesday was a video that claimed Anheuser-Busch InBev NV was considering pulling its sponsorship of the National Football League over national anthem protests -- and urged viewers to push the company to do so. The claim had been widely debunked days before. In response to criticism on social media of some search results this week, a person familiar with YouTube said the company is accelerating the rollout of planned changes to its search engine. On Wednesday night, the video service began promoting more authoritative sources in search results, especially pertaining to major news events, the person said. YouTube doesn't disclose how it determines which sources are authoritative. YouTube, a unit of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, has long been full of fringe content. But as the world's largest video site and a growing rival to television, with more than 1.5 billion monthly users, YouTube's feeding of such spurious content shows how the site can contribute to the spread of misinformation. Google also faced criticism this week after the ""top news"" section of its search results misidentified the Las Vegas shooter by featuring a thread from a fringe message board. Many large brands pulled spending on YouTube earlier this year after news reports revealed their ads were running before hateful and extremist videos. As a result, the site removed many videos and pull ads from others. There didn't appear to be ads on the fringe news videos this week. Controversial content has been on the site for years, and is highly ranked in search results. The second result for a search for ""9/11"" on Wednesday was a nearly 10-year-old video that presents conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks; it has been viewed 42.5 million times. The high search ranking of the End Times News Report video claiming there was a second shooter in Las Vegas helped it gain 371,000 views over four hours late Tuesday. On Wednesday, YouTube removed the video. Jake Morphonios, who runs the End Times News Report along with a damaged-inventory-liquidation business in Kernersville, N.C., said the video eventually reached 2.5 million views. ""It was a hot topic, of course, and was going to get some views anyway, but it really did get caught in [YouTube's] algorithm and went viral from there,"" he said. ""Clearly it got into featured videos or something."" The 43-year-old said he has posted about 800 videos and typically gets about 5,000 views each. Mr. Morphonios said YouTube gave his account its first penalty strike for the video. YouTube terminates accounts that get three strikes within three months. He said he aims to offer viewers information on news events that mainstream news sources won't. ""It's my opinion, it's my analysis, and everyone's got an opinion, and I can understand that maybe they don't want me to be considered the equivalent of The Wall Street Journal or the New York Times or something like that,"" he said. ""But still, I'm not presenting myself as mainstream media. I'm just a guy with a computer offering an opinion. And to be punished for that is, well, it's draconian."" YouTube said it has previously made changes to try to promote authoritative sources for breaking-news events by featuring their videos on its home page and by giving them top spots in search results and labeling them ""Top News."" The company added that its site is designed to present diverse perspectives. ""When it comes to news, we have thousands of news publishers that present a variety of viewpoints,"" the company said in an email. YouTube employs algorithms that determine how clips are ranked in search results and which videos to serve up to users in its prominent ""Up next"" column adjacent to its video player. The algorithms take into account factors such as a user's history and a video's popularity, but YouTube doesn't reveal exactly how it works. The company has said it designed the algorithms to get users to watch more YouTube videos -- a key factor in a surge in YouTube viewership in recent years. People now watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube videos a day. When a user watches a dubious video, YouTube typically suggests similar videos, a practice that can confirm users' existing biases. But The Wall Street Journal found cases this week in which YouTube suggested conspiracy-theory and highly politicized videos next to videos from mainstream news sources, suggesting the site was also pushing fringe content to users who haven't shown an interest in it. The Journal conducted all of its searches on YouTube in private browsers with tracking turned off to prevent previous history from influencing the search results or recommendations. The person familiar with YouTube said the company recognizes there are problems with its ""Up next"" algorithm and it is examining changes to promote more authoritative results. YouTube has been working on the changes to its search results for months but decided to implement them ahead of schedule, although they still need work, this person said. Searches for ""Las Vegas shooting"" late Wednesday returned nearly all mainstream news sources, but searches for ""NFL anthem protest"" and ""9/11"" still yielded misleading videos.

Eliot Brown,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"The Trump SoHo, an incongruous condominium hotel leering over Lower Manhattan, has something of a troubled past. Built over a cache of human remains, the 46-story complex never attracted as many foreign buyers as the Trump family had hoped, an inconvenient truth that didn’t stop Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. from allegedly inventing cheerier sales numbers. As The New York Times reported last year, the two Trump siblings had been quoted in 2008 and 2009 as saying that about 6 in 10 units had been sold, when the true percentage was about a third of that figure—one of several misleading statements that led a group of unhappy buyers to sue in 2010. The following year, Donald Trump settled the civil case, with defendants returning 90 percent of buyers’ deposits in exchange for an agreement not to cooperate with a parallel criminal investigation being pursued by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Without any witnesses, District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. ultimately dropped the criminal case. What wasn’t made public at the time, was how close prosecutors were to bringing felony fraud charges against Ivanka and Donald Jr. According to a new report by ProPublica, the two Trump children were under investigation by the Major Economic Crimes Bureau for misleading investors who bought property at the Trump SoHo. “They knew it was wrong,” said one person who saw e-mails in which Ivanka and Donny discussed inflating sales figures. (In a response to ProPublica, Alan Garten, chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, described the investors’ complaints as a “simple case of buyers’ remorse.”) In one email, according to four people who have seen it, the Trumps discussed how to coordinate false information they had given to prospective buyers. In another, according to a person who read the emails, they worried that a reporter might be onto them. In yet another, Donald Jr. spoke reassuringly to a broker who was concerned about the false statements, saying that nobody would ever find out, because only people on the email chain or in the Trump Organization knew about the deception, according to a person who saw the email. Prosecutors were considering convening a grand jury, which defense lawyers feared would lead to a criminal indictment. Enter longtime Trump lawyer Marc Kasowitz, who recently represented the president in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe before leaving the White House legal team in July. Unbeknownst to the prosecution team at the time was the fact that Kasowitz, according to ProPublica, had made a $25,000 donation to Vance’s re-election campaign, one of the largest donations at the time. In May of 2012, after the prosecution witnesses had notified the D.A.’s office that they would not testify against Trump as per their settlement, Kasowitz met with Vance to emphasize his arguments in favor of dropping the investigation. Three months later, Vance pulled the plug. Kasowitz, a man who later bragged at a bar that he got President Trump to fire U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, reportedly told colleagues that the case was “really dangerous” and that it was “amazing I got them off.” (Kasowitz denied making the comment.) And while Vance allegedly followed standard practice and returned the $25,000 to Kasowitz, as he said he did whenever a donor had a case before his office, Kasowitz made an even larger donation after the investigation was dropped. Vance told reporters that Kasowitz’s donation was perfectly legal and that Kasowitz had no pending Trump-related cases before him when it was made, although he said that he planned to return the money—four years after the fact. “I did not at the time believe beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had been committed,” he said of his decision to drop the case. ”I had to make a call and I made the call, and I think I made the right call.” (Kasowitz said in a statement that he had “never made a contribution to anyone’s campaign, including Cy Vance’s, as a ‘quid pro quo’ for anything.”) Follow to get the latest news and analysis about the players in your inbox.

Andrea Riquier,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Published: Oct 4, 2017 12:43 p.m. ET Report suggests that political contributions played a role in getting the years-long case closed By For years prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney’s office built a criminal case against two of President Donald Trump’s children, until a lawyer for the family made a personal contribution to the re-election campaign of D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr. The case was then dropped, according to a collaborative investigative article published by ProPublica, The New Yorker and WNYC. Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. had been under investigation by the Major Economic Crimes Bureau of the D.A.’s office since 2010 for misleading prospective buyers of the Trump SoHo, a faltering hotel and condo development, according to the article. Prosecutors had extensive evidence against the siblings, including emails discussing how to “coordinate false information” and the Trumps worried about being indicted. A source told the team of reporters behind the article that there was “no doubt” that they “approved, knew of, agreed to, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales.” In 2012, Marc Kasowitz, who had served as Donald Trump’s attorney for years, donated $25,000 to Vance’s reelection campaign. He then visited Vance and “simply repeated the arguments that the other defense lawyers had been making for months.” Three months later, the district attorney told the Major Economic Crimes Bureau to drop the case against the Trumps. Vance’s campaign told the reporters that he had returned the $25,000 contribution just before the 2012 meeting. But Kasowitz raised and donated an additional $50,000, the report said. Vance said he now plans to return that money as well. In a written statement to the publications, Kasowitz said, “I donated to Cy Vance’s campaign because I was and remain extremely impressed by him as a person of impeccable integrity, as a brilliant lawyer and as a public servant with creative ideas and tremendous ability.” The reporters have several unnamed sources who said Kasowitz “boasted” about being able to get the two Trump children off in what he called a “really dangerous” case.

Brianna Hendricks, who was celebrating her 21st birthday at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, described her troubling encounter. “Obviously she was telling us that — either to warn us, or to warn us that we were all going to die and she was part of it,” she told the local TV station. Hendricks said she left the concert minutes before the shooting started but could hear it from her room at the Mandalay Bay hotel. Watch a clip from the interview: At this point, no connection has been made between the mystery woman, who was ultimately escorted out by security, and the shooting.

Victor Reklaitis,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 8:46 a.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By After the S&P 500’s dance up to around 2,512, some strategists are bumping up their price targets for the benchmark, as well as fist-bumping over a potential tax overhaul. CFRA’s team has hiked its 12-month target for the S&P to 2,640 from 2,540, while Morgan Stanley’s resident bull is reiterating his forecast of 2,700 and describing tax reform as the “icing on the cake” for this bull market. That implies gains of 5% to 8% for the index, proving our call of the day. “The possibility of a tax cut remains supportive of equity ownership,” says CFRA’s Sam Stovall, as he writes about his shop’s new target of 2,640. There is also a “lack of attractive alternatives in this rate-tightening environment,” he says. “Challenges to economic growth and share-price appreciation are well-known but not new,” Stovall adds. “As a result, we believe the risks are largely reflected in current valuations and underlying support.” Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson says tax-reform hopes are far from the only driver for this market, but they sure can help. “Tax is what gets people to believe and finally come in and show some optimism for the most hated bull market in my career,” Wilson tells CNBC. But the Morgan Stanley strategist — dubbed “Wall Street’s biggest bull” — also is predicting a bust next year for the S&P after it booms. “We’re late cycle,” he warns.

                                   the year after “Will & Grace” went off the air. Don’t miss: This chart explains why Trump calls his supporters the ‘forgotten people’ In the 2016 one-off special, Jack wonders if he should vote. “Does my vote even matter?” he asks. “How can one unemployed white fella registered in Pennsylvania make a difference?” “‘Will & Grace’ delivered three promises that made it popular and pioneering,” says Bob Witeck, president and founder of Witeck Communications Inc., a public relations firm in Washington, D.C. and a marriage equality advocate. “First, it showcased gay flamboyance on network television, delivering Jack as a gay Jerry Lewis. Second, it never ever shied away from same-sex romance, flirting and dating. Finally, it reminded us that if it’s truly funny, people will be hooked. They were.” The reboot addresses the political divide in Trump’s America The new season is only slightly political. Karen voted for President Trump and — in the fictional universe of the show at least — is friends with Melania Trump. Many of the one-liners in the first episode of the reboot were directed at President Trump. As Karen said of Trump at one point, ”I helped him pick out Melania.” Some critics thought politics was unwise territory for a sitcom, even one that obviously and implicitly supports gay rights. In her review, Variety TV critic Maureen Ryan wrote: “It makes sense that ditzy rich lady Karen would be friends with Melania Trump (who is not seen on the show). But the stakes for all marginalized Americans at the moment are still very high.” In the first episode, the four main characters visit the Trump White House. Will is conflicted about his romantic feelings for a gay Republican congressman. He decides to pursue the congressman, anyway. Grace too is torn about her invitation to decorate the Oval Office. She decides to take the commission, anyway. In one scene, Karen kneels on the sofa in the Oval Office while texting in a pose reminiscent of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway. But Ryan writes that the efforts to inject politics into the show “reeks of the kind of smarmy self-congratulation that marred many otherwise decent comedies that came up around the same time as ‘Will & Grace.’ In that installment, there’s an obliviousness on display that makes the whole thing feel smug and more than a little dated.” It’s not the first time an actor from “Will & Grace” went head-to-head with Trump. While in character, Mullally performed a version of “Green Acres” with Donald Trump — then host of “The Apprentice” — dressed in denim dungarees and a straw hat, at the 2005 Emmy Awards in an “Emmy Idol” segment (inspired by “American Idol,” the big show at the time). Trump reportedly called Mullally after the show aired, congratulating her on winning Emmy Idol. “The next day, I was in my ‘Will & Grace’ dressing room and the phone rang,” she later said. “It was Donald Trump. And he said, ‘You know what? We really needed to win that thing and we did. And you were a big part of that. Not only did we win it, we killed them. It was a landslide.’” In the new show, Karen voted for Donald Trump, and her liberal friend Grace voted for Hillary Clinton. Both actors voted for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential election. But Messing has gotten into a skirmish on Twitter

From 1998 to 2006, marriage equality in America was still a dream In 2017, same-sex couples across the land can get married. It’s no longer gay marriage. It’s just marriage. That was not possible in 1998, the year “Will & Grace” premiered. And when the show ended in 2006, it was only possible in one state (Massachusetts, which legalized it in 2004). In 1998, Alaska voters approved a constitutional amendment banning marriage equality, while Hawaii approved constitutional language allowing their legislature to determine policy on same-sex marriage, “effectively overturning a series of earlier court decisions that may have required the state to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed,” according to the Pew Research Center, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C. In a historic 5-4 decision in June 2015, the Supreme Court extended marriage rights to all Americans, ruling that state bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional and that states don’t have the right to refuse to acknowledge same-sex marriages from other states. Seen by many as the biggest civil-rights movement of its time, this ruling extended marriage equality from 37 states to all 50. ‘Will & Grace’ premiered during a particularly bleak year for LGBT people There were far darker sides of American life for LGBT Americans. When “Will & Grace” premiered in 1998, it highlighted the relative privilege of these characters. But the real world was a far harsher place. In 1998, Maine was the first U.S. state to repeal a law that prohibited discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation. There were some truly horrific events in 1998 that have since become tragic and unforgettable landmarks in the history of gay civil rights. In Laramie, Wyo., 21-year-old Matthew Shepard was beaten, tortured and left to die on the evening of Oct. 6, 1998. He died from his injuries six days later. His killers, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, were sentenced to two consecutive life sentences for first-degree murder. Shepard’s story was turned into a 2002 TV movie and a play, “The Laramie Project,” by Moisés Kaufman, which drew on hundreds of interviews conducted by the Tectonic Theater Project in Shepard’s hometown, chronicling the reaction to Shepard’s murder. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, signed in 2009 by then-President Barack Obama, gave federal authorities more legal clout to investigate hate crimes that local authorities choose not to pursue. (Byrd was murdered by three white supremacists on June 7, 1998. He was 49.) Sadly, the rate of hate crimes hasn’t much changed since 1998 when 7,755 hate crimes were reported, 16.2% of which were due to sexual orientation, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 2015, the latest year for which FBI data is available, there were 7,121 victims of hate crimes, 17.7% because of a sexual orientation bias. Many of the biggest advances in gay rights came in the last five years And while there were many incremental improvements in the rights of LGBT Americans over the last two decades, many occurred within the last five years. In May 2013, the Boy Scouts of America lifted the ban on gay scouts after a proposal to partially remove the ban was submitted to the 1,400 voting members of the National Council. Two years later, the Boy Scouts of America officially announced an end to that ban of openly gay scout leaders. In 2013, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA. It aimed to prohibit employers with 15 or more employees from discriminating against workers on the basis of their sexual orientation, although religious organizations would be exempt. Two years later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that it considers employment discrimination based on sexual orientation to be prohibited under the sex-discrimination provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (In 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice ruled that transgender people were covered under that Act.) Before the Supreme Court marriage-equality ruling in 2015, same-sex couples were effectively unable to adopt a child together in states where they were unable to get married or enter into a civil partnership. When the June 2015 Supreme Court ruling came through, same-sex families simply became families under the law, which allowed all same-sex couples to adopt. Indeed, same-sex couples are disproportionately providing care for the country’s most vulnerable children given their high rates of adoption and fostering, says Gary J. Gates, who is now retired and previously worked as research director of the Williams Institute for Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at the University of California. ‘Will & Grace’ exclusively focused on young, upwardly mobile professionals Will, Grace, Karen and Jack rarely had financial problems. The show was canceled just before the Great Recession, so it’s not clear how any of the characters would have been impacted by those years, if at all. But the show’s somewhat privileged demographic also reflected the upwardly mobile “gayborhoods” in urban centers around the country. Indeed, earlier this year, dating site OKCupid

They cross-referenced the percentage of OKCupid users in each zip code with households headed by same-sex couples, based on the 2015 Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. (If 30% of OKCupid users in one ZIP code were looking for love and 15% of those households were same-sex couples, they got a score of 0.45.) What did they find? These “neighborhood pride” scores spiked in New York, the home city of Will & Grace, New Orleans and Boston, and fell the most in Miami, Buffalo and San Francisco. The highest premiums per square foot to live in a “gayborhood” were in West Hollywood, the Castro District in San Francisco, Uptown in Dallas, Palm Springs in southern California, Hillcrest in San Diego and Edgewater in Chicago. Since gay individuals and couples tend to have fewer children and higher disposable incomes, they may also seek to live in neighborhoods with more desirable amenities, or they may simply attract such amenities after they move in.

,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company’s probe told Reuters on Monday. The revelation about Google is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump. Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending  potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said. The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European residents, according to lawmakers and researchers. Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted. Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said. Russia’s ad purchases on Google were first reported by the Washington Post. Google did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion. “We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday. Google, which runs the world’s largest online advertising business, had largely evaded public or congressional scrutiny until now. On Sunday, the Daily Beast news website reported that the Kremlin recruited at least two black video bloggers to post clips on YouTube during the campaign. They posed as Black Lives Matter sympathizers who were sharply critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Though the videos were only viewed hundreds of times, they demonstrated for the first time that Russia allegedly deployed real people, not just fake online accounts or bots, to further spread propaganda. Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into Russian interference, but concern about Silicon Valley’s role has surged over the past month against the backdrop of a cascade of revelations about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda. A study published on Monday by researchers with the Oxford Internet Institute, which is affiliated with the British university, found that current U.S. military personnel and veterans were targeted by disinformation campaigns on Twitter and Facebook over the past year by a nexus of pro-Kremlin, Russian-oriented sites, along with conspiracy theorists and European right-wing ideologues. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election. Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms. “If Vladimir Putin is using Facebook or Google or Twitter to, in effect, destroy our democracy, the American people should know about it,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Monday on MSNBC. Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter. While Facebook and Twitter have confirmed plans to attend, Google has not. ","

,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said late on Friday it had approved Alphabet Inc’s application to provide emergency cellular service to Puerto Rico through balloons. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled to regain communications services. The FCC said on Friday that 83 percent of cell sites remain out of service, while wireless communications company are deploying temporary sites. Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solar-powered, high-altitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to “support licensed mobile carriers’ restoration of limited communications capability” in Puerto Rico. Earlier on Friday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced he was forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force with an emphasis on addressing challenges facing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. “It is critical that we adopt a coordinated and comprehensive approach to support the rebuilding of communications infrastructure and restoration of communications services,” Pai said in statement. Separately, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a Twitter posting late on Friday that he had a “great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow.” Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc, said on Friday the company would send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island over two weeks ago. Musk said he was diverting resources from a semi-truck project to fix Model 3 bottlenecks and “increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.” In late September, Tesla said it was sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

As more people get their news through Google and Facebook, some in the industry say the internet giants are publishers and not just platforms, meaning they should be held responsible for the content and regulated like traditional news providers. “We are looking at the role Google and Facebook play in the news environment,” the spokesman told reporters, saying the work was part of a commitment to produce a digital charter setting out how firms and individuals should behave online. “As part of that work we will look carefully at the roles, responsibility and legal status of the major internet platforms.” A report on Tuesday by consultants Enders Analysis said that 6.5 million British internet users claimed to mainly source their news from Facebook. May’s June 2017 election manifesto promised a digital charter “that balances freedom with protection for users, and offers opportunities alongside obligations for businesses and platforms.” “We will ensure there is a sustainable business model for high-quality media online, to create a level playing field for our media and creative industries,” the manifesto said.

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"(Reuters) - Dozens of companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google, Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, and Viacom Inc have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to address whether a law banning sex discrimination in the workplace provides protections to gay employees. A group of 76 companies submitted a brief to the court saying a split among lower courts on that question had created uncertainty for employers and gay workers. The companies asked the Supreme Court to take up the case of Jameka Evans, a former security guard at a Georgia hospital who says she was harassed and forced to quit her job because she is gay. The companies said the lack of a federal law clearly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has hindered recruitment in the 27 states that have not adopted their own such laws. And “the uncertainty and vulnerability LGBT workers face results in diminished employee health, productivity, job engagement, and satisfaction,” wrote the companies’ lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. A federal appeals court in Atlanta in March dismissed Evans’ case, saying her claims were foreclosed by prior decisions that said discrimination against gay employees is not a form of unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court will likely decide by the end of the year whether it will take Evans’ case. In April, a different appeals court in Chicago became the first to rule in favor of a gay worker under Title VII. And in June, about 50 of the same companies involved in Wednesday’s brief asked an appeals court in Manhattan to do the same. In that case, the U.S. Department of Justice urged the court to rule that Title VII does not protect gay employees. That was a reversal of the Justice Department’s stance under the Obama administration. Gay rights is the latest issue to cause a rift between the business community and the Trump administration. Some companies and executives in August resigned from White House business councils and repudiated President Donald Trump’s comments about a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. And business groups have clashed with the president over issues including immigration, and, this week, the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Trump administration says Congress did not intend for Title VII to apply to LGBT workers, and courts do not have the power to change the meaning of the law. ","

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli intelligence officials spying on Russian government hackers found they were using Kaspersky Lab antivirus software that is also used by 400 million people globally, including U.S. government agencies, according to media reports on Tuesday. The Israeli officials who had hacked into Kaspersky’s  network over two years ago then warned their U.S. counterparts of the Russian intrusion, said the New York Times, which first reported the story. (nyti.ms/2yev8Vj) That led to a decision in Washington only last month to order Kaspersky software removed from government computers. The Washington Post also reported on Tuesday that the Israeli spies had also found in Kaspersky's network hacking tools that could only have come from the U.S. National Security Agency. wapo.st/2i2clXa After an investigation, the NSA found that those tools were in possession of the Russian government, the Post said. And late last month, the U.S. National Intelligence Council completed a classified report that it shared with NATO allies concluding that Russia’s FSB intelligence service had “probable access” to Kaspersky customer databases and source code, the Post reported. That access, it concluded, could help enable cyber attacks against U.S. government, commercial and industrial control networks, the Post reported. The New York Times said the Russian operation, according to multiple people briefed on the matter, is known to have stolen classified documents from a National Security Agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer, which had  Kaspersky antivirus software installed on it. It is not yet publicly known what other U.S. secrets the Russian hackers may have discovered by turning the Kaspersky software into a sort of Google search for sensitive information, the Times said. The current and former government officials who described the episode spoke about it on condition of anonymity because of classification rules, the Times said. The newspaper said the National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment, as did the Israeli Embassy, while the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. The Russian embassy in Washington last month called the ban on Kaspersky Lab software “regrettable” and said it delayed the prospects of restoring bilateral ties. Kaspersky Lab denied to the Times any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, has repeatedly denied charges his company conducts espionage on behalf of the Russian government. The company issued a statement saying that “as a private company, Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia, and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight,” the Washington Post reported. The company “does not possess any knowledge” of Israel’s hack, the Post cited the statement as saying. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a multipronged digital influence operation last year in an attempt to help Donald Trump win the White House, a charge Moscow denies.

Tonya Garcia,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 9, 2017 8:27 a.m. ET In these early days of voice commerce there’s still room for two retail giants in the space, experts say By Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is not letting Amazon.com Inc. run away with the growing voice-commerce market, jumping on Wednesday’s Google device announcement with a $25 discount for users who purchase their device from Wal-Mart, place an order with the retailer and link their Wal-Mart account to Google Express. According to the latest data from Accenture, 89% of shoppers in 2017 are familiar with Alexa, while 77% are familiar with Google Home. Nearly three-quarters (71%) of shoppers are using or would like to use Alexa, while 68% responded in kind about Google Home. Experts argue that it’s still early days for voice commerce, so even if there has been buzz around Alexa and the Echo products, there is room for others.

                                   Experts say that the partnership elevates the challenge for Amazon and Alexa. “The industry has been waiting for sellers and technologists to map out a path to compete with the Amazon juggernaut and the rise of Alexa,” said Jennifer Sherman, senior vice president of product and strategy at Kibo, an omnichannel commerce software company. “With this move Wal-Mart has unlocked voice-based commerce on devices that already enjoy greater penetration than the Echo, the smartphone. Read: Here’s why flagship stores for retailers like Apple and Starbucks have become tourist attractions “Now, with this new development from Wal-Mart, the question for retailers and brands is how they can make their offering discoverable and differentiate themselves in the rapidly increasing voice-first environment,” said Sherman. Matt Sargent, senior vice president of retail at consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates, questions whether the Wal-Mart customer would be interested in voice commerce, though he believes Wal-Mart is targeting more than its typical customer. “Wal-Mart wants to change, doesn’t want to serve that same customer base it always has,” he said. Acquisitions like Jet.com and Bonobos show that it is trying to change its brand image. Prathap Dendi, general manager of business performance monitoring and analytics at AppDynamics, an application intelligence company, agrees voice commerce might not be for everyone. Don’t miss: Artificial intelligence will be important this holiday shopping season even if shoppers don’t know it Still, he sees some advantages in grocery, an area where Wal-Mart is “King” and already caters to a demographic that has an interest in picking up groceries “on the way home.” “Once you unlock millions of bricks-and-mortar consumers with the omnipresent ability of Google… they can take over,” he said. In this area, Wal-Mart’s click-and-collect capabilities could come in handy. “We know that 78% of consumers have used buy-online-pickup-in-stores (BOPIS) in the past six months, so having that option available right now for Walmart shoppers—especially for grocery products—will be a key differentiator,” said Kibo’s chief marketing officer Tushar Patel. Ryne Misso, director of marketing at Market Track, also notes the seemingly speedier decision making at Wal-Mart, which he says is a big takeaway from its Google partnership. “What we know about Amazon is, despite their size, they tend to be very fast to fill these holes,” Misso said, calling that an “underrated element to competing with Amazon.” Also:  How Nordstrom is changing the department store game “This enables both Google and Wal-Mart to have access to resources that neither had access to standing on their own,” he said of the partnership. Google also has partnerships with other companies including Home Depot Inc.

Alphabet apologized for serving ads on pages with extremist content, but advertisers themselves—or the agencies hired to perform media buys and other tasks—have had tools to filter where YouTube displayed ads, analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. “Filters to screen unwanted content have always been available for ad agencies to implement on behalf of their clients,” Ju wrote, later adding, “At any rate, we believe nearly all of the advertisers who have publicly announced that they are halting spend are back on YouTube.” Reports from early August also suggested that advertisers had begun to return to the platform. Read: Google survives YouTube ad controversy, for now Alphabet declined to comment on the boycott’s impact on sales or how many customers have returned to advertising on YouTube. In an emailed statement YouTube reiterated that it was working on handling extremist content on the site, following an August 1 announcement of some of the changes. “We appreciate the trust brands put in us everyday, and know that it’s critical we continue to earn that trust by ensuring our systems are working well,” a spokeswoman wrote in an email. “With tighter advertising policies and added controls in place to give brands more choice over where their ads appear, we’re committed to working with both advertisers and creators to get things right.” With 1.5 billion monthly viewers, YouTube has been responsible for driving a significant amount of ad sales growth for Google, but despite new Securities and Exchange Commission revenue recognition rules, it does not break out the unit’s results in quarterly financial statements. In the second-quarter earnings call, executives discussed YouTube nearly as extensively as its search products, according to a rough transcript. Read: Alphabet earnings keep Google investors in dark “The biggest contributors to growth again this quarter were mobile search and YouTube,” Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on the earnings call.

For example, the fifth result when searching ""Las Vegas shooting"" on YouTube late Tuesday yielded a video titled ""Proof Las Vegas Shooting Was a FALSE FLAG attack -- Shooter on 4th Floor."" The video said there were multiple shooters in Sunday's mass shooting, a claim dismissed by law enforcement. Posted by a channel called the End Times News Report, it amassed more than 1.1 million views in about 27 hours. The fourth result when searching ""NFL anthem protest"" on Wednesday was a video that claimed Anheuser-Busch InBev NV was considering pulling its sponsorship of the National Football League over national anthem protests -- and urged viewers to push the company to do so. The claim had been widely debunked days before. In response to criticism on social media of some search results this week, a person familiar with YouTube said the company is accelerating the rollout of planned changes to its search engine. On Wednesday night, the video service began promoting more authoritative sources in search results, especially pertaining to major news events, the person said. YouTube doesn't disclose how it determines which sources are authoritative. YouTube, a unit of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, has long been full of fringe content. But as the world's largest video site and a growing rival to television, with more than 1.5 billion monthly users, YouTube's feeding of such spurious content shows how the site can contribute to the spread of misinformation. Google also faced criticism this week after the ""top news"" section of its search results misidentified the Las Vegas shooter by featuring a thread from a fringe message board. Many large brands pulled spending on YouTube earlier this year after news reports revealed their ads were running before hateful and extremist videos. As a result, the site removed many videos and pull ads from others. There didn't appear to be ads on the fringe news videos this week. Controversial content has been on the site for years, and is highly ranked in search results. The second result for a search for ""9/11"" on Wednesday was a nearly 10-year-old video that presents conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks; it has been viewed 42.5 million times. The high search ranking of the End Times News Report video claiming there was a second shooter in Las Vegas helped it gain 371,000 views over four hours late Tuesday. On Wednesday, YouTube removed the video. Jake Morphonios, who runs the End Times News Report along with a damaged-inventory-liquidation business in Kernersville, N.C., said the video eventually reached 2.5 million views. ""It was a hot topic, of course, and was going to get some views anyway, but it really did get caught in [YouTube's] algorithm and went viral from there,"" he said. ""Clearly it got into featured videos or something."" The 43-year-old said he has posted about 800 videos and typically gets about 5,000 views each. Mr. Morphonios said YouTube gave his account its first penalty strike for the video. YouTube terminates accounts that get three strikes within three months. He said he aims to offer viewers information on news events that mainstream news sources won't. ""It's my opinion, it's my analysis, and everyone's got an opinion, and I can understand that maybe they don't want me to be considered the equivalent of The Wall Street Journal or the New York Times or something like that,"" he said. ""But still, I'm not presenting myself as mainstream media. I'm just a guy with a computer offering an opinion. And to be punished for that is, well, it's draconian."" YouTube said it has previously made changes to try to promote authoritative sources for breaking-news events by featuring their videos on its home page and by giving them top spots in search results and labeling them ""Top News."" The company added that its site is designed to present diverse perspectives. ""When it comes to news, we have thousands of news publishers that present a variety of viewpoints,"" the company said in an email. YouTube employs algorithms that determine how clips are ranked in search results and which videos to serve up to users in its prominent ""Up next"" column adjacent to its video player. The algorithms take into account factors such as a user's history and a video's popularity, but YouTube doesn't reveal exactly how it works. The company has said it designed the algorithms to get users to watch more YouTube videos -- a key factor in a surge in YouTube viewership in recent years. People now watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube videos a day. When a user watches a dubious video, YouTube typically suggests similar videos, a practice that can confirm users' existing biases. But The Wall Street Journal found cases this week in which YouTube suggested conspiracy-theory and highly politicized videos next to videos from mainstream news sources, suggesting the site was also pushing fringe content to users who haven't shown an interest in it. The Journal conducted all of its searches on YouTube in private browsers with tracking turned off to prevent previous history from influencing the search results or recommendations. The person familiar with YouTube said the company recognizes there are problems with its ""Up next"" algorithm and it is examining changes to promote more authoritative results. YouTube has been working on the changes to its search results for months but decided to implement them ahead of schedule, although they still need work, this person said. Searches for ""Las Vegas shooting"" late Wednesday returned nearly all mainstream news sources, but searches for ""NFL anthem protest"" and ""9/11"" still yielded misleading videos.

Tonya Garcia,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 7, 2017 10:17 a.m. ET Artificial intelligence, or AI, is growing in value as a customer service tool By Customers with questions about their online orders this holiday shopping season may think they’re asking a seasonal worker for help, but artificial intelligence (AI) is likely giving them the information they need. Technology of all kinds is being used on the back end of retail, to organize inventory and manage other operational functions. Whether it’s chatting with a bot or with Alexa, AI is also increasingly becoming a part of the consumer-facing shopping process in ways that, at least for now, are about improving customer service. According to the latest Accenture data, a majority of consumers are already using or would like to use a number of technologies that are powered by AI when shopping, including chatbots (“automated intelligent customer assistance,” 65%), virtually trying on clothing (65%), and voice commerce systems like Google Home

                                   (68%) and Amazon Alexa (71%). See also:  Off-price retailers are starting to cannibalize themselves And: How Nordstrom is changing the department store game Personalization, ease and convenience are key to better customer service in retail, whether that’s through supply chain management and making sure items are in stock and can be sent to customers in a timely fashion, or through services designed to cater to the preferences of the individual shopper. “Customers are running into it every day and probably don’t know it,” said Pano Anthos, managing director of XRC Labs, an accelerator program that’s focused on innovation in retail and consumer goods. “You’re on a site and a chat window opens and says ‘hi,’ it’s probably natural language processing and that’s AI.” To that point, a recent survey from Narvar, a company focused on helping retailers provide exceptional customer experiences, found that 38% of consumers didn’t know whether a live chat or messenger app was a human being or AI. Only 10% knew it was not human. Read: Retailers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy are coming up with new strategies to top two-day delivery In part, that’s because there are specialists training computers to learn nuance and context that can make interactions seem more human-like. For example, a computer can understand that every face has a nose. But, in a world full of noses of different sizes and shapes, “deep learning” takes it to the next level, according to Anthos. “To strengthen the response, there has to be a comparison to many noses, a way for the machine to make inferences at a faster more complex level,” he said. Until recently, much of the retail sector’s energy has been on getting items to the store rather than to the customer, Anthos said. Now that these companies have turned their attention to getting purchases into customers’ hands, the way technology can be used to enhance the customer experience is of paramount importance. There’s even more urgency to get a handle on the customer service uses of AI in light of all the ways in which Amazon.com Inc.

                                   continues to make e-commerce the simplest and most personalized shopping experience around. See also: 20 years after IPO: How Amazon came to dominate books, electronics and the cloud And: Every time this happens, Amazon crushes another legacy retailer Still, according to Anthos, retailers are moving too slowly, in part because company leadership isn’t used to thinking in terms of a “true digital experience.” “They’re not sitting still, but they’re not moving as fast as a startup,” he said. “The problem we’re facing now is the consumer is so far ahead of the retailer in terms of their expectations. Mall traffic is so far down, not because of the merchandise, but because the experience hasn’t changed.” There’s also a fear of failure, which Anthos says retailers and brands have to get over so they can test new things. MarketWatch requested comment from a number of retailers, and none complied. Meanwhile, there are startups that are stepping in to help retailers. Abigail Holtz is the chief executive of Affinity, a company that recently participated in the XRC Labs accelerator and uses technology to understand customers’ needs, style and preferences. Executives there describe the company as “Stitch Fix-like.” Stitch Fix is a personal styling service that asks customers to fill out a profile before receiving specially selected items just for them, giving shoppers the option to keep what they like and send the rest back. Affinity is focused on scale. Big retailers might want to offer a personalized experience, but without either the technology or the manpower, can’t provide it. With technology, that “high-touch” personal shopper experience that has historically been exclusive to luxury shoppers is becoming available to the masses. But many retail executives are reluctant to jump in too fast. “Because retailers are resource-constrained and risk-averse, they’re interested in what they can do incrementally,” said Holtz, who worked at Google for a number of years before co-founding Affinity. “That’s what we’ve designed.” As retailers see results, they’re more enthusiastic about taking the next step. “Every point is proving to them that it’s delivering,” she said. Chatbots, which are relatively common nowadays, “are good at answering questions that aren’t super nuanced,” she said. While the technology is charging ahead with greater capabilities, this holiday season will be focused on the ways in which AI can answer those simple questions that shoppers tend to have this time of year, like an update on an order, information about a new product and return policies. “Customers don’t call call centers to place orders,” said Amit Sharma, chief executive of Narvar. “They’re generally not happy with the information that’s out there and they’re calling for more service.” Don’t miss: Everything Google announced at its Pixel event Most customers who are upset or anxious would probably prefer to talk to a human being to make sure their holiday gifts get where they need to be on time. In that case, the best customer service AI could perform is getting shoppers to a live human being. But ultimately, the more a machine can do to create a good experience, the better. “If you think about it, there just aren’t enough human beings in any organization that can push enough buttons to make the best experience without machine learning,” said Michael Klein, Adobe’s director of industry strategy for retail, travel and hospitality.

Barbara Chai,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 6, 2017 1:53 p.m. ET Actors and crew worked in “brutally cold” conditions, but the hardest scene to film was not what you might expect By To film their new movie, “The Mountain Between Us,” stars Kate Winslet and Idris Elba lived and worked for one month at the Purcell Mountains in Canada, located 11,000 feet above sea level in subzero temperatures. They trudged knee-deep through snow daily and helped the crew carry equipment to and from shooting locations. But the most difficult scene to film was their love scene, shot in a studio miles away, in front of a fireplace. In the film, Winslet plays freewheeling photojournalist Alex and Elba plays private neurosurgeon Ben. By a series of poor luck, timing and weather, the strangers end up stranded together in the deep snowy mountains of Utah and they have to struggle across scary, uninhabited terrain back to civilization. An unlikely pair, they also end up finding their way toward each other. “It’s very difficult to direct actors in intimate moments,” says “Mountain” director Hany Abu-Assad, who previously helmed “Paradise Now” and “Omar.” It was his first time directing a love scene, and it just happened to be with two A-list, award-winning actors who are considered by many to be the sexiest man and woman alive. “What are you going to give an actor in intimate moments? Tell him what, push more?” he says. “Suddenly, I’m there with two gorgeous actors lying naked in bed, and I have to tell them what to do. The only way to escape this was to draw what I wanted. I couldn’t explain it in words.” When the scene ended, the director was relieved. “I told my wife, please give me the mountains back!” About those mountains. The cast and crew stayed in accommodations at the Horsethief base in Canada and each day, depending on the weather, they traveled by helicopter to a location either at or above the treeline. It was “brutally cold,” Abu-Assad says, and they were all hungry from a diet consisting mainly of cereal bars. “Kate and Idris were like part of an army, where there was no difference between commander and soldier,” he says. The actors' shared experience coming from a British, working-class background bonded them, but their working styles — Winslet tended to prepare each scene to the last detail, while Elba studied his lines and then improvised — created tension between their characters when the cameras were rolling, he says. “You have to understand, you can’t do a lot of takes in this movie because it was so cold, because of the need for pristine snow, so I kept a lot of the improvisation,” Abu-Assad adds. The director describes one wide shot of Elba that pans to Winslet, filmed one mile away. “We had to walk a mile in deep snow, which felt more like 10 miles,” he says. But in the end, he says he’s happy with what he considers an “authentic, poetic” film. It was worth spending one month in the cold, he says, even when he feared for his own life and survival, just like the characters in the story. “One day we were flying in the helicopter, and when we came behind one of the mountains, a cloud was rushing toward us,” he says. “If you fly in the cloud, you become blind, so the pilot had to turn around very fast and go down as if it was freefall. I realized, ‘My God, why are we doing this?’” “When I look now to the picture, I don’t mind,” he says. “I think it was worth it.” Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

Newton, speaking about his own daughters, made his statement via video on social media for what he called an “extremely degrading and disrespectful” choice of words. “After careful thought, I understand that my word choice was extremely degrading and disrespectful to women,” he said. “And to be honest, that was not my intention. If you are a person who took offense to what I said, I sincerely apologize to you.” Julie DiCaro, an anchor on Chicago sports radio 670 The Score, said she felt the apology was sincere. Sent's Cam's apology to my kids to show what a sincere apology looks like. Newton on Wednesday laughed at Charlotte Observer beat reporter Jourdan Rodrigue who asked about one of his teammates, saying it was “funny to hear a female” ask this particular question. It was about wide receiver Devin Funchess embracing the physicality of routes and how Newton felt about it, ESPN and other news outlets reported. The exchange extended to a post-press conference one-on-one and, of course, played out in social media. Rodrigue, with the backing of her paper’s coverage and commentary on the exchange, said it’s all in a day’s work, but she was disappointed. “Newton said she wasn’t really seeing specific routes when watching the game, she was just seeing if somebody was open,” the Observer reported. “She argued that he didn’t know what she saw nor how hard she had studied football, and that maybe the two of them needed to have a deeper conversation.” Read: Sports reporters tell Moneyish why Cam Newton’s sexist remark wasn’t ‘funny’ at all For his part, Newton later said that “maybe he should have said it was funny to hear ‘reporters’ talk about routes and that, if she actually did know about them, then she knew more than most reporters,” according to the Observer. “Then he gestured toward the locker room, still filled with her colleagues.” Read: Dream job: Bart Scott on what it’s like to play in the NFL Rodrigue said in an earlier statement that Newton did not actually apologize, at least initially. “[Wednesday] afternoon, I did my job as an NFL beat writer and asked Cam Newton a question about one of his receivers.

From 2009 to 2013, female viewership rose 26%, according to Sports Illustrated. The irony of it all What was ironic about Newton’s laugh is that it made it seem like male reporters are allowed to ask serious football questions, but as former All-Pro New York Giants player Michael Strahan pointed out on Thursday morning, most male reporters covering the NFL never played football either. Strahan, now a host on Good Morning America, said: “The way Cam said it — “how would you know, you’ve never played the game?” — well, 90% of the reporters have never played the game.” ESPN’s Sarah Spain made a similar point: “Do you think all the male reporters in that room have ‘run routes?’ Can we only ask about things we’ve physically done?” she wrote on Twitter. This story was updated to include Newton’s apology. ","Cam Newton apologizes, but not before losing sponsor after laughing at female reporter - MarketWatch"

Barbara Kollmeyer,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 11, 2017 8:48 a.m. ET Analysts estimate a boost of $4 per share to 2018 earnings By Apple Inc. could close in on a trillion-dollar market capitalization next year — and if it does, it may have President Donald Trump to thank. That’s according to a scenario laid out by analysts at RBC Capital Markets, who said Apple

                                   may turn out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Trump administration’s planned U.S. tax changes. “While there are significant uncertainties around corporate tax reform, we think it could provide Apple EPS (earnings per share) a $4.00-4.50 tailwind and drive the stock closer to a trillion dollar market-cap scenario,” said the RBC team in a note to clients. Late last month, Trump and top congressional Republicans proposed sharp cuts to tax rates on businesses and many individuals. Under the plan, the top corporate tax rate would be cut to 20% from 35%. However, skepticism remains over the size and significance of any tax reforms and how long they would take to be introduced. Trump and the proposal’s supporters would need to do a lot of horse-trading to push reforms through, and the corporate tax code is viewed as a complex one to adjust. Still, the team of RBC analysts, led by Amit Daryanani, said investors should look out for these big policy levers, which could benefit Apple: • Interest expense: The proposed tax framework reduces or caps tax deductions for interest expense, but doesn’t specify the limit. RBC assumes it will be completely non-deductible. • Capital expenditure: Apple would likely be able to expense around $8 billion for this. • Tax rate on foreign profits: RBC assumes an effective tax rate for all profits at 20% for Apple, in line with the proposed new U.S. federal corporate tax rate. • Repatriation tax: The tax proposal doesn’t specify a tax rate on accumulated repatriated earnings. “We assume a 10% tax rate on (around) $219 billion of earnings AAPL could potentially repatriate and assume AAPL uses those for share repurchases,” said the analysts. A chunk of that repatriated cash would likely be used for “strategic options,” they added. Daryanani and his team believe that potential tax provisions could add that $4.00 to $4.50 to their own full-year 2018 earnings-per-share estimate. It’s not the first time RBC has talked about Apple reaching a trillion-dollar market cap. In August, the bank‘s strategists forecast that Apple’s soaring stock and a buildup in momentum ahead of its new iPhone cycle would help push the company toward that valuation. But Apple’s long-awaited product launch last month proved disappointing for shareholders, and the company wasn’t helped by some lukewarm reviews of its new batch of phones. Since the Sept. 12 event, which marked the launch of a $999 iPhone and a new Apple Watch, Apple shares have fallen 2.3%, to hit $155.80 on Monday. RBC — which has an overweight rating on Apple — has a price target of $180 on shares, which is still not the highest on Wall Street. According to a survey of estimates by FactSet, Drexel Hamilton has the highest price target, of $208. The average stock price target on the stock is $177.23 and the average rating is overweight. The bank said Apple shares are currently at an “attractive entry point for investors to benefit from its ability to return to revenue and EPS growth in FY217,” adding that “multiple catalysts” remain from such factors as iPhone ramps and product refreshes on its Macs and iPads. “We believe the fundamental reality remains that AAPL’s valuation is materially subpar to what we anticipate is its long-term revenue and EPS potential,” said RBC. Apple shares have gained 34.6% in 2017, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average

Jeremy C. Owens,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 10, 2017 6:40 p.m. ET HP is top PC manufacturer for second consecutive quarter, IDC and Gartner reports say By Chromebooks, stripped-down laptops running Google’s Chrome operating system, appeared to fare well with back-to-school shoppers for a second consecutive year, third-party data on personal-computer shipments showed Tuesday. IDC and Gartner reports on third-quarter PC shipments were split rather widely, with IDC reporting a 0.5% decline in PC shipments from the same quarter in 2016, while Gartner reported that shipments fell 3.6%. The major difference between the two firms is that IDC includes Chromebooks in its analysis while Gartner does not, which likely led to the disparity in numbers and commentary. “Despite the overall contraction, Chromebooks remain a source of optimism,” IDC research analyst Neha Mahajan wrote in that firm’s announcement. While Gartner does not include Chromebooks in its tally, analyst Mika Kitagawa wrote in an email that they did notice “strong growth” for the devices in the quarter, especially in the U.S. In Gartner’s announcement, Kitagawa noted a 10% year-over-year decline for U.S. sales, not including Chromebooks, and cited “a very weak back-to-school sales season.” The difference between the two analyses was even greater in the third quarter a year ago, when Chromebooks appeared to be a big hit while Apple Inc. shipments fell by double-digit percentages.

That is not expected to change as consumers look to other form factors beyond traditional laptops and desktops, and the holiday shopping season could be impacted by higher component prices. Don’t miss: Computers are getting more expensive, and here’s why “Weak back-to-school sales were further evidence that traditional consumer PC demand drivers for PCs are no longer effective,” Gartner’s Kitagawa said in Tuesday’s announcement. “Business PC demand is stable in the U.S., but demand could slow down among [small businesses] due to PC price increases due to component shortages.” HP has found strong gains on Wall Street as it has regained the PC manufacturer throne, with shares gaining 38.6% this year as the S&P 500 index

Todd Haselton,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Google unveiled its first custom-designed smartphone chip on Tuesday, the Pixel Visual Core, which is used in its new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones. The Pixel Visual Core enables smartphones to take better pictures using HDR+, a technology that can take clear pictures even if there's a lot of brightness and darkness in the same shot. One example might be taking a picture of a shadowy skyscraper against a bright blue sky. With HDR+, you'll be able to capture both the skyscraper and the blue sky, without bits of either washing out because of parts of the image being too bright or too dark. While the chip exists in current phones, it isn't yet activated, but will be in a future software release. The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 aren't the first smartphones to offer HDR support, but Google is trying to make its photos the best using the new processor. Google said that the Pixel Visual Core will be accessible by camera applications created by other developers, not just the built-in camera app, and that it plans to activate access to the core through software updates ""in the coming months.""

Jacob Pramuk,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Three senators began a bipartisan push Thursday to rein in social media political ads amid fears about Russian meddling in American elections. Should the bill gain more bipartisan traction, it would mark one of the strongest efforts yet to check companies like Facebook and Google. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Mark Warner, D-Va., crafted the bill, called the ""Honest Ads Act."" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., signed on as a co-sponsor. The senators hope the bill will curb the reach of foreign-bought political ads during American elections. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded Russia launched a campaign to influence the 2016 election and will try to do so again during next year's midterm elections. It is not clear how many more of the majority Republicans in Congress will get behind the bill. It will need broader GOP support to pass. Klobuchar and Warner expressed optimism that more Republicans would support the plan. Here's what the legislation would do, according to the senators' offices: The Russian effort ""exposes a national security vulnerability when it comes to online political advertisements,"" Klobuchar said. American laws ""have failed to keep up"" with the technology foreign entities can use, she added. Tech titans Facebook and Google parent Alphabet have said they found Russia-linked ads on their platforms during the election. Klobuchar described new regulation as necessary because of both companies' vast reach. She noted that Facebook and Google accounted for nearly all digital ad revenue growth last year and now serve as a news source to millions of voters. It remains to be seen what measures the social media platforms will support. Major technology companies have opposed similar rules in the past. Warner on Thursday described the measures as ""common sense, light touch regulations."" In a statement Thursday, Facebook said it will work with lawmakers to increase transparency in political ads. ""We have already announced the steps Facebook will take on our own and we look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution,"" the company said. A Google spokesperson said the company supports ""efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse."" ""We're evaluating steps we can take on our own platforms and will work closely with lawmakers, the FEC, and the industry to explore the best solutions,"" the spokesperson said. Twitter has also found fake accounts and bots linked to Russia. The company has said it is taking steps to stop malicious bots and misinformation on the platform. In a statement to CNBC on Wednesday, Twitter said it looks forward to ""engaging"" with Congress and the Federal Election Commission on ad transparency. Representatives from all three of those companies will attend a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1. Klobuchar serves as the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, which has a role in elections. Warner is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating Russian meddling and possible collusion with the Donald Trump campaign.

Lauren Thomas,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Target shoppers nationwide will now be able to make purchases on Google Express, after a successful test on the platform in California and New York, the company announced Thursday. The big-box retailer is among several that are deepening their relationships with Google's voice-activated shopping platform in a battle for market share against Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices. Target announced that by 2018, the retailer's credit card holders will be able to link their cards and save 5 percent when shopping Target via Google Express. Shoppers will also have an option in 2018 to link their Target.com accounts to Google for a more personalized experience, similar to what Wal-Mart announced earlier this year. For example, a shopper might say to the Google Assistant on Google Home: ""Google, order me shampoo."" If that shopper has accounts linked both to Target.com and Walmart.com, but he or she orders shampoo more frequently from Target, Google will pull results from Target's website. Target's product assortment on Google Express will include anything in a typical Target store, which will serve as fulfillment centers. In 2018, shoppers will be able to pick up their Target purchases made via Google Express at Target stores, should they want to forgo waiting on a shipment. ""Target and Google teams are working on the next chapter, building experiences that digitally replicate the joy of shopping a Target store to discover stylish and affordable products,"" said Target's chief information and digital officer, Mike McNamara. In tandem with Target's roll-out on Thursday, Google has also unveiled plans to grow the number of ways customers can use the Google Assistant. Until now, the voice platform has been available on the Google Home and on Android TVs. Soon, it will launch on iPhones and Android phones, so customers can order items, using voice, while mobile. ""At Google, we are focused on continued innovation and making Google Express a platform to help retailers like Target offer consumers a high quality seamless, end-to-end shopping experience,"" said Daniel Alegre, Google's president of retail and shopping. Other retailers on the Google Express platform include Wal-Mart, Costco, Kohl's and Ulta, according to Google's website. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart announced that shoppers could browse more than 2 million of the big-box retailer's items via Google Express. Wal-Mart was also giving shoppers coupons if they bought a Google Home or Google Home Mini, and linked their Walmart.com accounts to Google Express. Bulking up against internet giant Amazon, more and more retailers have been touting their partnerships with Google and encouraging shoppers to buy Google devices. To be sure, the penetration of Google Home devices in American households is still less than that of Amazon's Echo devices. Companies, like Wal-Mart and Target are still finding ways to grow with Google, promising more to come. ""Next year, we will also leverage our 4,700 U.S. stores and our fulfillment network to create customer experiences that don't currently exist within voice shopping anywhere else,"" Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce business, said in a blog post. This will include using voice command to pick up orders in store and using voice shopping to purchase fresh groceries, he said. Target likewise initially won't offer fresh groceries via Google Express, a representative told CNBC. But it has plans to grow in other areas with voice-enabled shopping, like apparel, home and beauty, the company said. Today, for example, shopping for dry goods like coffee and paper towels through voice-enabled devices is more easily accomplished than picking out an outfit, where there are many more factors involved. But Target is aiming to perfect the response to shoppers telling the Google Assistant, ""Google, find me a red dress."" Google and Amazon are pledging more voice-shopping opportunities.

Todd Haselton,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"New data from Strategy Analytics suggest that Amazon's Alexa smart assistant is beating Google in the home. Strategy Analytics found that Amazon Alexa will be on 68 percent of all smart speakers by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. This includes Echos built by Amazon and other products built by third parties that also run Alexa. Sonos will soon launch a speaker running Alexa, for example. It's no surprise Amazon has such a large share. It has a huge selection across price ranges, including a low-cost Echo Dot speaker that costs about $35 when on sale, a full-size Echo for $179 and even the Echo Show, which has a screen built-in for video chat. It also just introduced several new products that will be available before the year is up. Google's slice of the pie came will come in at 24 percent of all sales during the fourth quarter, Strategy Analytics said. Google most recently released its more affordable Google Home Mini speaker, though its launch was rocky at best. One reporter found the device was recording him without his permission, a problem that Google ultimately patched. Strategy Analytics said Amazon, Google and Chinese-firm Baidu will run the smart home speaker market until about 2020, when the firm expects all three will leave hardware development to third parties.

Ari Levy,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Amazon's early lead in the home is a problem for Google — and not just because Alexa is outselling Home by a wide margin. In the new world of voice-powered computing, Amazon is rolling out popular features like skills and reminders that take users entirely out of Google's massive ecosystem. Late last month, Google added reminders to its home assistant, a long-awaited feature that lets consumers get voice prompts to walk their dog or take out the trash. Even as Google plays catch-up with new functions and lures users with lower-priced products, the web giant faces a business model conundrum. Almost 90 percent of parent Alphabet's $90.3 billion in revenue last year came from advertising, mostly search, video and mobile. Whether a daily walk or once-a-year moment you just can't forget, reminders on Google Home from your #GoogleAssistant are here to help. pic.twitter.com/WpsI2TNBet Without a visual interface, what happens to Google's ad business? ""You basically can't deliver ads when it comes to a voice query,"" said Lightspeed Venture Partners' Alex Taussig, who invests in consumer internet start-ups. ""If I ask for the nearest coffee shop from my office, you can give me one answer and that's probably not an ad. So it is very hard for Google to monetize these product searches."" This isn't the first time Google has been forced to reckon with a changing computing paradigm. When consumers moved to mobile, Google faced the risk of so-called vertical search, or industry-specific queries. Rather than going to Google.com, smartphone users would open the Kayak app to search travel or Yelp to find restaurants. But Google survived and thrived by populating its Android operating system with apps for calendar, maps, YouTube and photos. Even if people were doing less search, they were still sticking with Google and serving up all that valuable data. Now, with voice becoming the next emerging platform, Google has to again make sure it doesn't get left behind, whether in the home or the automobile. According to a report last month from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Amazon controls more than three-quarters of the market for home automation devices and Google accounts for most of the rest. With that kind of deficit and with the explosive growth in the home assistant market, Google is in jeopardy of losing users who have previously counted on the company's search engine, calendar and other features. In response, Home is getting more targeted. Following last month's announcement that Google is adding reminders to the device, the company is working with developers to build apps that will remind users of chores like taking prescription medications or perhaps that their restaurant reservation is in a few hours, according to a person familiar with the matter. Google is planning on announcing integrations in mid-November, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans are confidential. While Amazon has your credit card information and knows your shopping history, Google knows how you search the web, providing an intensely personal view into a consumer's habits. Google's dominance online was built around cataloging the internet and knowing what to quickly surface based on a query. ""Google is sitting on a mountain of data,"" said Katie McMahon, vice president at SoundHound, a software company that uses artificial intelligence to enable apps to respond to voice commands. ""Google is going to flex its muscle off the data sets they command. The world's data is one pile but the individual pile is a unique set they'll focus on."" Google hinted in May that it would be improving its assistant through reminders and appointment scheduling, but didn't provide specifics. A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story. The focus on reminders follows recent improvements to Amazon Alexa's timer features, making it easier for users to get verbal nudges to pick up dry cleaning or pay bills. It also has to deal with new concerns around privacy. Earlier this month, Google released a smaller version of its home assistant called the Home Mini, for $49, and a high-end speaker called the Google Max. Shortly after the release, a blogger from Android Police noticed that the Mini was turning on by itself, improperly listening to conversations. Google acknowledged the bug and updated the software, but the flap led to further questions about whether Google is doing enough to protect consumer data. Investors haven't punished Google for its challenges in home automation, sending Alphabet shares up 25 percent this year. The company has proven that it can deal with changing consumer habits. And when it comes to battling Alexa, it's still early days. ""The home is still a frontier yet to be owned,"" McMahon said. ",Google Home is taking aim at Alexa with reminders and app integrations
Anita Balakrishnan,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"There's yet another complication in Alphabet's relationship with start-up giant Uber. CapitalG, an investment arm within Google-parent Alphabet, will lead a $1 billion funding round for Lyft, the companies said on Thursday. CapitalG Partner David Lawee will join Lyft's board. The round is not closed yet. Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo, confirmed earlier this year it would partner with Lyft on a self-driving car project. Lyft noted in a statement that its service is now available to 95 percent of the U.S. population — up from 54 percent at the beginning of the year. The funding round comes as a chummy relationship between Uber and Google has soured, in part due to a lawsuit between Waymo and Uber. Waymo alleges that Uber is using one of Waymo's trade secrets for its autonomous vehicle sensors. Lyft, now worth $11 billion, is still much smaller than the nearly $70 billion market leader Uber. Uber also got an infusion of about $250 million from Google in 2013, earning Google's David Drummond a seat on Uber's board. Google and Uber mulled teaming up on self-driving car technology at that time. But around October 2014, Drummond recused himself from Uber's board. According to Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, Drummond said, ""Google is intending to compete with Uber in the ridesharing space."" Drummond is now chairman of Google's investment arms, Google Ventures and CapitalG — the same unit that is investing in Lyft. Kalanick said in legal filings that he became paranoid that Alphabet CEO Larry Page was gathering intel on Uber as their relationship frayed. ""I don't remember my exact words, but I remember feeling disappointed a little bit, a little burned by the relationship,"" Kalanick said in a deposition this year. Kalanick has since left his operational role at Uber, as the company reels from a workplace culture investigation that flushed out many key employees. New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said he's preparing Uber financially for an IPO. ",Lyft funding: Alphabet’s CapitalG leading 1 billion dollar round
John Shinal,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Alphabet says its Sidewalk Labs unit will help design a model city district in Toronto as the research group pushes urban design it says can make cities less congested and more affordable. The campus will be located in Toronto's Eastern Waterfront district and be part of one of ""the largest waterfront development projects anywhere in North America,"" said Kathleen Wynne, the Premier of Ontario, at an event announcing the project. Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt and Dan Doctoroff, chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, went to Toronto for the event, also attended by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Google will move its Canadian headquarters to the district, which will become ""a test bed for new technologies,"" Trudeau said. The company, which has more than 1,000 workers in Canada, has been buying large tracts of land in Northern California and in other technology hubs to house its growing workforce. The company is looking to design new types of urban centers that would house employees close enough to their workplace so they can walk, bike or commute via public transit. Schmidt said the idea for Sidewalk Labs came about years ago when he and Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page thought of ""all the things we could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge...Thank you very much, Canada,"" Schmidt said, after joking ""that's not how it works."" Sidewalk Labs is also doing research into affordable housing and other urban challenges. ""New technology can help cities address their biggest challenges,"" Doctoroff said. ""We looked all over the world to find the perfect place to bring this vision to life. We found it in Toronto,"" he said.

Rani Molla,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Amazon and Google occupy a huge portion of the corporate psyche. Both have long elicited fear, admiration and inspiration as evidenced by the frequency with which both companies are cited on conference calls across industries. But Amazon has replaced Google as the corporate boogeyman. Amazon was mentioned 2,090 times this year on publicly available corporate conference calls (including earnings calls, shareholder meetings, and guidance calls), up 11 percent from last year, according to an analysis of FactSet data, which goes through the morning of Oct. 11, 2017. Google (or Alphabet) was mentioned in about 1,500 company conference calls, down 19 percent from 2016. In these conference calls, investors are often simply reacting to Amazon's presence or  expected presence in an industry. Amazon just had to announce that it was buying Whole Foods to send  grocery stocks reeling. Rolling out a  Geek Squad competitor caused Best Buy's stock to plunge. And Blue Apron has never been able to recover from the dark cloud that is Amazon dabbling in meal delivery. Amazon and Google are on everyone's lips because it can seem like both have their hands in everything. Amazon isn't just an online retailer but also a media company and a  brick-and-mortar grocery store. Google, among other pursuits, is a search engine, a driverless-car maker, a media company and an advertising behemoth through which Russians tried to steer the  U.S. presidential election. Both companies compete over personal gadgets like their voice-controlled speakers Google Home and Amazon Echo that are becoming the centerpieces of connected homes. Both vie for control over the internet's backbone though their vast  data center businesses. In short, both companies are drawing attention from their many competitors. Amazon is just a bit scarier.

Jordan Novet,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Samsung knows its Bixby virtual assistant needs to be smarter. The company announced version 2.0 of the assistant on Wednesday at its developer conference in San Francisco. Among the upcoming improvements, Bixby will be able to recognize different people speaking to it. That feature has recently come to the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers, which come with Alexa and the Google Assistant, respectively. It's not clear when the upgraded Bixby will become available. Samsung said it will release a software development kit to select third-party developers in a private beta before making it available to any developer in 2018. The public first got a feel for what the original Bixby could do when Samsung released its Galaxy S8 smartphone earlier this year. That phone — like the newer Samsung Galaxy Note8 smartphone — comes with a button dedicated to paging a public preview version of Bixby. The full assistant rolled out to English speakers in the U.S. just three months ago. The reviews of Bixby haven't all been glowing. One writer at Engadget noted that the Google Assistant's speech recognition was ""significantly more accurate"" than Bixby's. Samsung has emphasized Bixby's ability to go into individual apps and do things on behalf of people. But it doesn't always work as intended. ""I still can't trust that it will do what I want it to,"" as a writer with the Verge put it. As a result, the writer has opted to do things himself the old way — by tapping and swiping on the display. Samsung is integrating the technology from Viv Labs — the start-up Samsung acquired whose team previously worked on Siri — into Bixby, which could help make it a better alternative to the Google Assistant. ""For example, users can just say, 'I want to order a large pepperoni pizza with half mushrooms. Please send it to my office within 30 minutes.' Bixby will take care of it — no more robot speak,"" said Dag Kittlaus, a vice president of Samsung and previously Viv Labs' co-founder and CEO. Third-party developers who integrate Bixby into their apps will be able to generate money in a marketplace model, Kittlaus said. In 2018 Samsung will start shipping TVs with Bixby onboard in the U.S. and in Korea, chief product officer Gilles BianRosa said. But Samsung also has an eye toward making Bixby work on devices that don't support it out of the box. Injong Rhee, chief technology officer and executive vice president of software and services for Samsung's mobile communications business, demonstrated how Bixby could work with a speaker by connecting it to a special dongle that contains a microphone and wi-fi connectivity. Rhee also showed how the technology can send associated visual content to a separate display. Bixby now has 10 million active users, the company says.

Christina Farr,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"NowRx wants to make standing in line at the pharmacy a thing of the past. This month, its users will have the option to order prescription medications via a virtual home assistant, such as the Amazon Echo or Google Home. A robot then registers to the request and dispenses the medication within minutes, and a car will deliver it within hours. The Silicon Valley start-up claims that this is the first voice application for medication ordering. It works when a user downloads the NowRX skill, and activates it with a voice command (""Alexa, open NowRX'). From there, the skill will prompt the user to request, refill or renew a medication by sharing the last four digits of their prescription number. The company is still waiting on approval from Google and Amazon, but expects to get a green-light within a few weeks. NowRX is one of a handful of start-ups that are taking on the brick and mortar pharmacy. Founder Cary Breese said the company is dispensing 125 prescriptions per day from its Mountain View-based retail pharmacy. It targets its marketing to consumers through Facebook ads, who can request that their doctor use NowRX. Currently, it has 400 Bay Area doctors in its network. Amazon Alexa is not yet HIPAA compliant, meaning it doesn't meet the federal rules and requirements that are designed to protect patient's sensitive health information. That limits health developers from developing certain kinds of medical apps, which involve health information being shared with hospitals, clinics and their business associates. But NowRx claims to have a figured out a solution to the problem. Its technology is compliant, the company says, and it doesn't share drug history with Amazon or Google. ""It's all encrypted,"" said Breese. The company currently serves patients in Silicon Valley, but expects to expand in the coming year.

"Evan Niu, CFA",10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google has dabbled in physical retail before, but not like this. In 2015, the search giant opened its first store-within-a-store locations, mostly inside of big-box retailers. Last year, Google opened its first Google Shop, a pop-up shop in New York City that was primarily intended as a way for consumers to experience the first-generation Pixel and the other hardware products that were unveiled alongside the handset, but they couldn't actually purchase products there; customers still had to buy online. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. Image source: Google. Now, Google wants to actually start selling through these Google Shops, according to The Verge. Presumably, the reason why Google Shops didn't sell products last year was because Google simply has no direct experience with physical retail, which involves implementing point-of-sale (POS) systems, inventory management, handling customer service issues like returns and refunds, and more. It's a lot easier to just showcase a small number of products on hand and direct people to the online Google Store, even if that's not the ideal experience for a customer that's ready to buy something on the spot. In fact, that point of friction risks losing the sale once the customer leaves the store. It seems that Google is now up to the challenge of stepping more directly into physical retail. Last year was a turning point for Google in terms of its hardware ambitions, unveiling its first ""Made by Google"" products, including a smart-home device. The company continued that trend in a big way this month when it showed off a plethora of new hardware products like the Pixel 2 and 2 XL phones, a new Pixelbook with stylus, Pixel Buds, and an expanded portfolio of smart-home products. With the growing hardware portfolio, the justification for controlling more of the retail experience grows commensurately as well. This is less important for smartphones, since carrier retail stores still dominate smartphone distribution in the U.S., but we're not just talking about smartphones anymore. It's less than ideal to forever be relegated to stores-within-stores, even if the reality is that those outlets will still end up representing the bulk of Google's retail distribution. But therein lies the rub. There's a theoretical benefit to entering retail to sell a growing portfolio of hardware, but that benefit will be directly related to the scale. If we're just talking about a couple of temporary pop-up shops in a few cities like New York City and Los Angeles (as mentioned in the report), then the overall impact will be negligible. At the same time, it's not realistic that Google will open a large network of permanent stores to directly sell what's still a fairly modest product portfolio. Google Shops selling directly to consumers may end up being more trouble than it's worth. ","
      
    Google Is About to Step Into Physical Retail -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's only a few months left in 2017, which makes it a good time to look at what some of the biggest technology players are working on right now and how that might translate into new tech trends next year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and other tech leaders are leading advancements in augmented reality, voice-enabled speakers in the home, and semi-autonomous driving technologies -- and each trend is poised to dominate the technology landscape in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Voice assistants aren't new, and neither is the smart speaker. Amazon released the first Echo -- with its Alexa virtual assistant -- in late 2014. But a slew of new devices by Amazon, Apple, and Google mean that voice-enabled smart speakers and devices will be one of the biggest tech trends of next year. Amazon now offers seven Alexa-powered devices, and they can do everything from help you with your clothing style to make video calls to call an Uber. The company's latest devices range from just $50 to $230, and the plethora of Alexa devices has already allowed the company to take more than 70% of the voice-enabled speaker market. Not to be outdone, Google recently released two new smart home speakers -- the Google Home Mini and Google Home Max -- which means the company now has three smart home speakers ranging from $49 to $399. The original Google Home smart speaker allows users to make search queries and sync other smart devices together, and the new, small Google Home Mini does the same but in a smaller size and at a cheaper price. Meanwhile, the Home Max adds superior sound quality thanks to a much larger speaker. Google currently holds about 23.8% of the voice-enabled speaker marker right now, and is hoping to expand that with its new Home devices lineup. Meanwhile, Apple will enter the ring toward the end of this year when its own high-end voice-enabled speaker, the HomePod starts, starts shipping in December. The smart speaker market is expected to grow from 4 billion units this year to 7 billion by 2020. With the recent release of all of these new devices, it's likely that 2018 will be the pivotal year when users start adopting the devices in droves, and when we see competition among Apple, Amazon, and Google truly heat up. Image source: Google. There's been a lot of autonomous driving advancements, announcements, and partnerships this year, and it's likely that things will pick up even more next year for several reasons. First, Tesla is planning on showing off its autonomous driving chops later this year by having one of its cars drive itself all the way from Los Angeles to New York. Tesla has already started manufacturing its new vehicles with hardware capable of full autonomy, and has been slowly rolling out software updates to allow its vehicle to tap into the hardware. Tesla is also expected to unveil a new semi truck some time in November. The electric semi truck will likely be equipped with Tesla's semi-autonomous Autopilot driving system, which provides automatic steering, braking, and lane changes on highway roads. This could be an initial step toward autonomous semi trucks, and with the announcement coming in late 2017 it means that next year we're likely to hear about even more semi-autonomous semi truck technology. Image source: General Motors. Of course, Tesla's not the only carmaker pursuing autonomous driving technology. Just last month, General Motors (NYSE:GM) said that it had produced 130 fully autonomous cars on a regular vehicle production line. Like Tesla, GM will roll out the autonomous software as it's ready, but the fact that two key automakers already have the hardware capabilities for driverless cars on the road this year means that we should see much more semi-autonomous technology inch toward full autonomy next year. The driverless car market is expected to be worth $77 billion by 2035, and with the pace of innovation among Tesla, GM, and others already picking up, you can bet that next year we'll see even more semi-autonomous car technology on the roads. Augmented reality (AR) is poised to grow exponentially among consumers next year thanks to Apple and Google's recent push to make the technology mainstream. Apple updated its mobile operating system, iOS, late this year, and of its most imporant new features is its abiliy to run augmented reality apps. For example, say you want to measure how wide your TV is and whether it will fit on your wall. There are apps now in the Apple App Store that will display a measuring tool on your phone's screen and adjust the length as you move your phone, just like a tape measuere. That many not sound like a big idea, but overlaying digital information onto the real world is going to be a huge business. MarketsandMarkets estimates AR will be worth $61 billion by 2023. Image source: Apple. We will likely hear more about Apple's AR plans next year as well, especially as the company is rumored to be working on its own augmented reality glasses, which are expected to debut in 2020. And Apple isn't the only one betting on this. Google's latest release of its new Pixel 2 phones is sure to spark more AR use in 2018 as well. The company says the cameras on its new phones are especially good for augmented reality. Like Apple, Google recently released an augmented reality kit for developers, called ARCore, that should encourage more developers to create AR apps next year. There's no crystal ball to peer into, but it's likely that some of the big technology ideas making headlines at the end of this year are likely to become some of the biggest tech trends in 2018. If you're considering investing in any of the tech trends above, just remember that the usual investment rules apply. Look for a leader in the space that's outpacing the competition with solid financials, and hold the stock for the long haul. Also, remember that while these areas are growing, that doesn't mean the companies will earn substantial revenue from them in 2018. For example, Amazon has the potential to earn $10 billion from its Echo devices by 2020, according to RBC Capital Markets, but the Echo still represents a small portion of Amazon's total revenue. We may see these trends take off next year, but it could be several years before the companies see a significant benefit to their top line. ","
      
    3 Technology Trends That Could Dominate 2018 -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) fell nearly 30% over the past 12 months due to concerns about its slowing growth and soft demand from its action camera and drone markets. The bears also claim that Ambarella's niche of image processing SoCs didn't have an adequate moat against rival chipmakers. The bulls often argue that Ambarella produced ""best in breed"" SoCs. That's why GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), DJI Innovations, and Hikvision -- respectively the largest action camera, drone, and security camera makers in the world -- all used Ambarella chipsets. The bulls also note that Ambarella's upcoming computer vision chip, CV1, could be widely used in autonomous drones, cars, and other devices. Image source: Ambarella. But over the past few months, GoPro and DJI both pivoted sharply away from Ambarella chipsets, as did Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google with its new Clips camera. Let's take a look at the chipsets powering their newer devices, and how they could impact Ambarella's long-term growth. GoPro is one of Ambarella's top customers, but that relationship has been a double-edged sword. GoPro lifted Ambarella to historic highs in late 2014 and 2015, but the party ended once demand for GoPro's cameras dried up. Faced with shrinking margins, GoPro needed to buy cheaper chipsets to cut costs. It also wanted a custom design which wasn't readily available to competitors like Ambarella's SoCs. That's why it completely cut Ambarella out of the loop and hired Japanese chipmaker Socionext to create a custom GP1 SoC for its new Hero 6 cameras. DJI's Spark drone. Image source: DJI. Google also installed the Myriad 2 in its Clips camera, which automatically takes burst shots by learning and recognizing the faces in a user's life. The Myriad 2 processes those images in real time with Google's machine learning algorithms. Google previously installed Movidius chips in its Project Tango augmented reality tablets. Google Clips. Image source: Google. In retrospect, Intel's purchase of Movidius last year now seems like an Ambarella-killing play. Ambarella needs the CV1 to catch up to the Myriad 2, but that could be tough with the Myriad's first-mover's advantage and Intel's superior scale. Meanwhile, more action camera makers -- which previously followed GoPro's lead by using Ambarella SoCs -- could mimic GoPro again by designing or buying cheaper custom chipsets. Ambarella wants to sell the CV1 to security camera and drone makers first before moving on to bigger markets like connected and driverless cars. But that market is already crowded with lots of competitors. In addition to Intel, Ambarella needs to watch out for NVIDIA, which recently introduced a new Drive PX platform for fully autonomous driving, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which will become the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world after its purchase of NXP Semiconductors closes. Qualcomm also scored a few design wins in the action camera market with its mobile Snapdragon SoCs, which bundle together an application processor, image processor, and baseband modem. The addition of NXP's BlueBox autonomous driving platform and automotive chips should make Qualcomm a major threat to Ambarella in the computer vision market. To top it all off, Chinese chipmakers are putting pressure on Ambarella's security camera business in China. That's why the company's non-GAAP gross margin fell 410 basis points annually to 63% last quarter. Ambarella's heyday is over, and its niche technology could soon be rendered obsolete by bigger chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm. GoPro's shift to custom chips tells us that Ambarella chips aren't competitively priced, and DJI's tighter relationship with Movidius indicates that stand-alone VPUs can replace image processing SoCs. Ambarella could potentially turn things around with CV1, but it doesn't expect to generate revenue from CV1 sales until next year, and the chipset will be entering a highly competitive market. Therefore, I think it's wise to follow GoPro and DJI's lead and avoid Ambarella. ","

Ride-hailing start-up Lyft has a big new investor: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Lyft announced on Thursday that CapitalG, Alphabet's investment fund, is leading a $1 billion financing round for Lyft. The move follows an agreement made in May between Lyft and Alphabet's self-driving subsidiary Waymo to work together on the development of autonomous-vehicle technology. It also follows a flurry of interest in Lyft by several automakers and tech companies working on self-driving technology of their own -- including General Motors (NYSE:GM), which made a big investment in Lyft last year. Lyft co-founders Logan Green (left) and John Zimmer (right) with CapitalG partner David Lawlee (center). Alphabet's CapitalG fund is leading a $1 billion investment round in the ride-hailing company. Lawlee will join Lyft's board of directors. Image source: Lyft. We don't know a whole lot yet. Lyft announced that CapitalG led the round, that the total investment in Lyft is $1 billion, that CapitalG partner David Lawlee will join Lyft's board, and that Lyft's post-round valuation will be $11 billion. Lyft was valued at $7.5 billion after its most recent funding round, in April. Lyft didn't name the other investors in this round. Johana Bhuiyan of Recode, who has followed Lyft closely, reported that this investment round wasn't driven by an urgent need for cash. Lyft has previously said that it expects to be profitable by next year. Why the investment now? That's just one of a few reasons to think that there might be an interesting backstory here. For starters, consider that Waymo is locked in a fierce legal battle with Lyft arch-rival Uber Technologies. Waymo has alleged that a former employee stole key technology secrets related to self-driving when he left to form a new company; that company was acquired by Uber a few months later. Also consider that Waymo is racing to dominate the market for autonomous-vehicle systems, an emerging space with huge growth and profit potential. Ride-hailing is expected to be an important early market for self-driving vehicles, and Lyft could be a major customer. It's possible that Alphabet felt that it needed to make a big move to get out ahead of the self-driving rivals that already partnered with Lyft. Earlier this year, Lyft opened its service to automakers and tech companies that wish to test their prototype self-driving systems in real-world conditions serving Lyft customers. Besides Waymo, participants include: It's possible that the move by Ford was one factor in Alphabet's decision to back up its interest in Lyft with a big investment. But there's another piece of this puzzle: What about GM? Ford is a automotive heavyweight, but few expect the Blue Oval to be first to market with self-driving vehicles. It's a very different story with GM, which said last month that it has completed development work on a ""mass-producible"" Level 4 self-driving vehicle. GM, of course, invested $500 million in Lyft early last year at a $5.5 billion valuation, receiving what was then a 9% stake and a seat on Lyft's board that has been filled by GM president Dan Ammann. The idea seemed to be that GM would be Lyft's primary self-driving partner, but the relationship between the two seemed to sour earlier this year. Green (left) and Zimmer (right) with GM president Dan Amman last year, when GM made a $500 million investment in Lyft. Ammann is now a member of Lyft's board of directors. Image source: General Motors. GM has since hinted that it might develop its own ride-hailing service via its existing car-sharing subsidiary, Maven. It has also made other moves that suggest it now wants to own as many pieces of the mobility puzzle as it can, from self-driving sensor hardware to ride-hailing software and (perhaps significantly) the data it would gather while operating such a service. That could make GM a big long-term rival to Waymo. It's probably far from the biggest consideration driving Alphabet's decision to invest in Lyft, but the search giant might think that its investment in Lyft (and its new seat on Lyft's board) could give it a better read on GM's plans and the state of its technology. Whatever the motivations driving Alphabet's interest, it's a good time to be Lyft. Reuters reported last month that Lyft has been taking steps toward an initial public offering in 2018. If so, we'll know much more about Lyft's partners and intentions before long. ","

Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) own the largest internet search engines in China and Russia, respectively. Both stocks performed well this year, with Baidu jumping nearly 65% and Yandex advancing almost 60%. But after those big rallies, is either stock still worth buying? Let's take a closer look at their business models, growth trajectories, and valuations to find out. Image source: Getty Images. Baidu controls about 80% of China's internet search market. It soundly conquered the market after Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google left the country in 2010. Like Google, Baidu expanded its ecosystem to include news sites, mapping services, streaming video, an artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistant, and even autonomous cars. It's also expanding its online-to-offline (O2O) ecosystem, which allows users to hail rides, order goods, make mobile payments, and access other services without leaving its mobile app. Yandex still competes against Google in Russia, but its 49% market share remains slightly higher than Google's 47%. Yandex notably handles ""CrazyFont"" -- Russian written in English without using Cyrillic letters (popular among Russians who don't have Cyrillic keyboards) -- better than Google. Yandex's expanding ecosystem includes portal sites, e-commerce marketplaces, ride-hailing services, and online classifieds. Baidu's revenue rose 35% in 2015 but just 6% in 2016, due to two one-time events -- a government crackdown on misleading ads (mostly for healthcare products) and a swap of its stake in online travel agency Qunar for one in Ctrip. With these issues now in the rearview mirror, analysts expect Baidu's revenue to rise 22% this year. Most of Baidu's revenue still comes from its advertising business, which accounted for 86% of its top line last quarter. Baidu's current game plan is to divest or spin off weaker businesses (like its food delivery subsidiary) and increase its investments in the mobile and AI markets. Those moves could widen its moat against rivals like WeChat maker Tencent (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) and e-commerce titan Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) -- which have both been aggressively expanding their ecosystems. Yandex's revenue rose 18% in 2015, and accelerated to 27% growth in 2016. Analysts expect 23% growth this year. Advertising revenue accounted for 96% of its sales last quarter. Yandex is investing heavily in improving its core search technology, expanding its language capabilities, and refining its targeted ads. It recently launched Yandex.Radar, a search traffic and browser user analytics tool, an open-source machine learning library called CatBoost, and Alice, the first AI-powered virtual assistant designed for the Russian market. It also merged its Yandex.Taxi service with Uber's operations in Russia and five neighboring countries. These moves could all widen its moat against Google and future-proof its core business. Expanding a search-based ecosystem is expensive, and those costs caused Baidu's and Yandex's operating margins to fall over the past five years. Data source: YCharts. However, those margin declines seem to be bottoming out. Baidu's net income rose 155% in 2015, but dropped 53% last year on the aforementioned headwinds. Analysts expect its earnings to rebound 24% this year. Yandex's net income fell 11% in 2015 but climbed 16% last year. Wall Street expects 5% growth this year. Neither stock looks cheap relative to their earnings growth. Baidu trades at 50 times trailing earnings and 35 times forward earnings. Yandex has a trailing P/E of 75, but its forward P/E of 29 looks more reasonable. However, we should remember that China and Russia have internet penetration rates of just 71% and 52%, respectively, compared to an 89% penetration rate in the U.S. Those lower percentages give Baidu and Yandex more room to grow than search engine providers in more mature markets -- so they might deserve their premium valuations. Baidu needs to fend off ecosystem challengers like Tencent and Alibaba, but it doesn't need to counter Google. Yandex is holding Google at bay in Russia, but it might lose its lead if Google invests more heavily in Russia before the ruble strengthens again. China's economy is also growing at a much faster rate than Russia's, which gives Baidu a healthier core market than Yandex. Lastly, Baidu's aggressive investments in AI and autonomous cars, which has already attracted a long list of U.S. tech giants, put it in a better position to become a global tech powerhouse than Yandex, which generally partners with smaller companies. I personally own shares of Baidu, and I think they have more room to run. But I'm a bit wary of Yandex, which faces much tougher competition over the long term. ","

"Evan Niu, CFA",10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It was a pretty big score when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) poached Regina Dugan from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google in early 2016. Dugan led the search giant's Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) group, which works on experimental new hardware ideas that have the potential to one day become moonshots. For example, Google's Project Tango, which added 3D environmental sensing capabilities to mobile devices, came out of ATAP, as did the Project Ara modular phones. The social network scored Dugan to lead its Building 8 team, which similarly works on experimental hardware projects; Facebook has begun dabbling in hardware development in recent years. Another prominent hire for Building 8 was Rich Heley, whom Facebook poached from Tesla just a couple months after hiring Dugan. A year and a half later, Dugan has announced that she is stepping down. Dugan will stay on for another few months to ensure a smooth transition for Building 8, and plans on leaving in early 2018. On a related note, Facebook promoted Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth in August to run all of the company's hardware projects, including those at subsidiary Oculus VR as well as Building 8. It's not clear if these two events are related. In terms of what kinds of hardware Facebook has up its sleeve, there are a few hints. For starters, Facebook acquired Nascent Objects last year, a small start-up that specialized in rapid prototyping of modular devices using 3D printing. This acquisition was likely done in order to accelerate Facebook's broader ability to develop hardware and not directly related to any specific product in the pipeline. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaking at F8 2017. Image source: Facebook. Beyond virtual reality (VR) products from Oculus, there have been numerous reports of other devices that the company is working on, including but not limited to a smart speaker, a video chatting device, a drone, and an augmented reality (AR) headset. (It's possible that the speaker and video chatting device are the same product, based on the rumored specs.) There's also the Surround 360 video camera that Facebook announced in April, which would naturally be intended to capture VR content. While not a consumer device, Facebook has also been working on its solar-powered Aquila internet drone for a few years now. It's pretty tough to envision Facebook making a dent in consumer hardware markets anytime soon, but at the same time the major software and services giants, including Google and Microsoft, have all been focusing increasingly on building their own hardware in pursuit of Apple-esque levels of hardware and software integration. Despite poor odds, Facebook has the resources to play the long game, so I wouldn't count the social network out quite yet. ","

Keith Speights,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Data. But why is data so important for investing in AI? And how can investors assess which companies will be the kings of data in the future? Image source: Getty Images. Every business revolution has its fuel. For the computing revolution, that fuel was silicon chips. For the AI revolution, the fuel is data. Artificial intelligence simply can't do anything without data. Lots of data. Unlike traditional computer programming, AI doesn't require smart people to think through every step that the computer should follow. Instead, AI demands that those smart people develop algorithms and feed a lot of data into those algorithms. Two terms that you hear much about with respect to AI are machine learning and deep learning. Machine learning is an application of AI that enables computer systems to learn from experience, in a similar way that humans learn. Deep learning is machine learning on steroids. The use of the word ""deep"" in the name refers to multiple layers in an artificial neural network. The important thing to know is that learning, whether it's done by a computer or a person, requires a tremendous amount of data. One of the most publicized uses of AI in learning today is in self-driving cars. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) train their autonomous car systems by running huge amounts of data through their machine-learning networks. Tesla reportedly had accumulated 1.3 billion miles of Autopilot data to use in feeding its AI systems as of November 2016. The company no doubt has much more data now. Both Alphabet and Tesla use data captured from human and autonomous driving to help their systems learn when to turn, when to slow down, when to speed up, and when to return control to the human driver. With enough data, over time, the AI systems will rarely, if ever, have to relinquish control of the steering wheel. Image source: Getty Images. Nearly every kind of data is valuable to AI systems. The best kind of data of all, though, is the data that no one else has. Companies with this kind of data will be able to develop AI systems that are best in class. Alphabet, for example, has more data about what individuals across the world search for online than any other company. The more people use the Google search engine, the more powerful Alphabet's AI systems will become. That's true for other Alphabet products such as Google Pixel Buds, which translate 40 spoken languages in close to real time. As the Google Pixel Buds become more widely used, Alphabet will have more data to make its translation AI systems even better. Which company knows more than any other about people's shopping patterns? Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is probably at the top of the list. The more data that Amazon captures, the more effective it will be at meeting customers' needs in its current areas of focus -- and expanding into new areas. Think about Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The social-media giant knows who most of the friends and family are for 2 billion users. Facebook also has data about what interests those users. The company can (and does) use that data in its AI systems to determine how to keep users on social media longer -- which means they view more ads, therefore making Facebook more money. Image source: Getty Images. My view is that there are three kinds of stocks to buy to take advantage of the enormous growth potential that AI offers. First are the stocks of companies that already have data that others don't have. Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook are great examples of that category. Second are the stocks of companies that can get more unique data than others, even if they don't have the data yet. The best places to look for these stocks are in niche markets. For example, Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) provides cloud-based applications for the life-sciences industry. Veeva has over 550 customers from big pharma companies to small biotechs. I can't think of another company that has as much access to niche data for the life-sciences industry as Veeva does. There's significant potential for Veeva to use its data to power AI systems that allow it to further dominate its market. What's the third kind of AI stock to buy? Those that enable other companies to accumulate lots of data and process that data using AI systems. I think this could be the trickiest area in which to invest over the long run, though, because technology changes could result in different companies becoming leaders. All three of these kinds of stocks have a common denominator, of course. They all center around data. Find the stocks of companies that master data, and you'll find success in investing in AI.

    The No. 1 Thing to Look for When Investing in Artificial Intelligence -- The Motley Fool

Dan Caplinger,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Medicare offers coverage for medical costs like doctor visits and outpatient care through Medicare Part B. Participants pay a monthly premium for their Part B coverage, with a base amount applying for most participants and surcharges for those with relatively high income levels. This base amount was $134 per month in 2017, and the Trustees of the Medicare program project that the figure for 2018 will remain the same. That's good news for those who have been paying the base amount. However, there are millions of Americans who are paying less than $134 currently for their Part B premiums, and they can expect 2018 premiums to be higher than what they're paying now. The reason for the disparity is the Medicare law's hold harmless provision, which prevents rises in Medicare premiums from outpacing the dollar-amount increase in Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. Social Security received no cost-of-living adjustment at the beginning of 2016, and that locked in many Medicare participants to the premiums that then prevailed, which was $104.90 per month. For 2017, Social Security recipients got a small COLA of 0.3%. That allowed Medicare premiums for those protected by the hold harmless rule to rise slightly, but not to the full base amount. The average premium under the hold harmless provision this year was $109 per month. Social Security anticipates a much larger cost-of-living increase of between 1.5% and 2% to take effect in 2018. If that turns out to be the case, then many Medicare participants will have to pay the full $134 per month, resulting in a substantial increase. Image source: Getty Images. For some of those who pay surcharges for Part B coverage because of their income, premiums will rise in 2018. The current rules call for a surcharge of between $53.50 and $294.60 per month on single filers making $85,000 or more or joint filers making $170,000 or more. However, recent legislation shifted the income brackets at which certain increases take hold. The net result is that if you make more than $133,500 as a single filer or $267,000 as a joint filer, then your surcharge could go up by about $80 per month. The discussion above applies to those who participate in traditional Medicare. However, Medicare Advantage Plans offer an alternative, and they've become increasingly popular. One reason is that their premiums have avoided the upward trend in overall medical costs. Medicare officials project that average monthly premium will fall by nearly $2 to $30 per month in 2018. One thing to look at closely is whether a Medicare Advantage plan pays for the standard Part B premium or whether you have to cover that cost. If you have to pay, then the total you'll pay for premiums could still be a net increase depending on your situation. More good news is that the typical prescription drug plan under Medicare Part D is expected to cut its premium by more than $1 to about $33.50 per month. That would be the first decline in five years. The final thing to remember is that what you pay for premiums is only one piece of your healthcare financial plan. You also need to evaluate out-of-pocket costs. Sometimes, paying a higher premium makes sense if it covers enough of your costs to offset the larger premium payments. Medicare premiums will go up for some people in 2018, while others won't see any changes, and a few might actually see decreases. With Medicare open enrollment starting soon, knowing the basics about premium changes for next year will help you pick the right coverage and prepare for what you'll have to pay. ","

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) recently introduced Oculus Go, a $199 VR headset, at its Oculus Connect 4 conference in San Jose. Unlike the Oculus Rift, the Go is a stand-alone wireless device that doesn't require a high-end PC. Users also don't need a high-end phone, as they do with Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Gear VR and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Daydream View. The Oculus Go comes with a single controller that looks similar to the Daydream View's. The headset uses a ""fast-switch"" WQHD LCD screen and spatial audio and will be cross-compatible with Gear VR titles. Like the Daydream View, the Go is made from ""breathable"" fabric instead of plastic. Facebook didn't reveal any other hardware specs yet, but it stated that the development kits will start shipping next month. The Oculus Go. Image source: Oculus. The introduction of the Oculus Go indicates that high price tags and complicated PC setups are hobbling the growth of the VR market. Research firm SuperData estimates that only 6.3 million VR headsets were shipped last year, with Samsung's Gear VR leading the pack at 4.5 million shipments. Facebook reportedly only shipped about 240,000 Oculus Rifts. During the first quarter of 2017, SuperData reported that Facebook only sold 64,000 Rifts, compared to 782,000 Gear VRs. The reason was simple -- Samsung had an established user base with its high-end smartphones, its setup was simpler and offered more mobility, and the newest model costs just $129. Facebook's Oculus Rift. Image source: Oculus. The Oculus Rift previously cost $499, but the price was recently reduced to $399. However, it still needs to be tethered by cables to a gaming PC, which costs at least another $500. Hardcore gamers and tech enthusiasts are willing to pay that price and set up the hardware, but most mainstream consumers aren't. Google Cardboard fared better at spreading public awareness of VR apps, and its core app has been installed up to 50 million times on Google Play. However, the apps for Cardboard generally offered a much weaker VR experience than native apps for the Gear VR and higher-end devices like the Rift and HTC's Vive. As a result, many people saw Cardboard as a neat trick, but they weren't compelled to buy a higher-end headset. Therefore, the general consensus seems to be that mobile and stand-alone headsets, which are cheaper and don't require complicated setups, represent the future of the fledgling VR market. However, they also need to offer higher quality experiences than Cardboard to demonstrate that VR is a viable computing platform instead of a parlor trick. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and its hardware partners recently unveiled a wide range of ""mixed reality"" headsets that cost between $399 and $499. Those devices represent a step forward from the Rift and Vive, since they don't require external cameras to track movements, but they still need to be tethered to a PC via an external cable. Samsung's Odyssey headset for Microsoft's Mixed Reality platform. Image source: Samsung. Google is building stand-alone VR headsets with HTC and Lenovo, which will reportedly use an ""inside out"" tracking similar to that of Microsoft's headsets to eliminate the need for external sensors. Like the Oculus Go, the headsets will be wireless and won't require phones or PCs. However, it's still unclear when these products will arrive or how much they'll cost. Based on those facts, the Oculus Go seems to be a step ahead of the competition and could gain a first-mover's advantage in the mid-range ""affordable VR"" market. Facebook already has an established VR platform with Oculus Home, which delivers apps and VR experiences to Rift and Gear VR users, so the Go could broaden that ecosystem's reach and widen its moat against Microsoft's Windows 10 and Google's Android in the VR market. Facebook has also given us a glimpse at the social possibilities of VR with online games and Spaces, its new ""virtual room"" feature for Facebook users. It will likely take years for Facebook to break even on its $3 billion purchase of Oculus. But Facebook believes that a billion people will eventually use VR, making it a major computing platform for software makers. Investors should keep an eye on how the Go performs next year to see if that forecast is based on reality or a Silicon Valley pipe dream. ","

It might sound overly bold. Hold forever? Seriously? By picking ""hold forever"" stocks you can rest easy. Image source: Getty Images In my own portfolio, I have three stocks that have ""Hold Forever"" status. Since 2009, I've only sold shares of any to make a down payment on my house. This mindset has helped me to achieve market-thrashing results, and these three stocks have grown to be a (perhaps imprudent) 48% chunk of my real-life holdings. Read below to find out why I think you, too, should consider making Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ""hold forever"" stocks in your own portfolio. I've long believed that a mission statement is the quickest window into the soul of a company. The best long-term investments tend to have three things in common when it comes to mission statements: Here's a closer look at the mission of all three investments. Company Mission Statement Amazon ""To be Earth's most customer-centric company"" Facebook ""To bring the world closer together."" Alphabet ""To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."" Of course, anyone can write a glowing mission statement. And some companies even experience short-term success without one. But none of it matters if you don't have a sustainable competitive advantage -- otherwise known as a ""moat."" If a stock is ""hold forever"", then you have to be able to foresee a future where the company's success attracts competition, yet the company is still able to thrive. Here's the key moat that each of these three companies has. Company Moat Amazon Facebook Alphabet Of course, if I really believe that a company is worth holding forever, I also need to accept the fact that it will probably look much different twenty years from now than it does today. That's why the third prong of the mission statement -- multiple futures -- is so important. While we can never know what the future might look like, all three of these companies have shown a remarkable nimbleness given their size. The most important benefit of the ""hold forever"" mentality is how it forces an investor to grin and bear it during tough economic times, resisting the urge to sell based on emotions. If anything is really ""hold forever"", you need to accept that difficult economic times will be coming. When a company has a strong balance sheet, it can actually emerge from recessions stronger than it was before by buying up stock on the cheap, acquiring distressed rivals, or simply outspending the competition to gain market share. All three of these companies have outstanding financial fortitude. Financial Fortitude at ""Hold Forever"" CompaniesInfogram Finally, I like investing in companies that are still run by their founders, who usually own a significant portion of the stock and voting rights. Founders often view their companies as extensions of their very selves. When that's the case, they're concerned with creating something that has lasting value -- a key trait of ""hold forever"" companies. Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet are all run by founder/CEOs who match this description. Company Founder Value of Shares Owned Percent of Voting Rights Amazon Jeff Bezos $80 billion 16.9% Facebook Mark Zuckerberg $71 billion 59.7% Alphabet Larry Page $20 billion 25.9% By investing in these companies, you're investing alongside the people building them; your interests are aligned. While the term ""hold forever"" may be hyperbole, the mindset that it induces is more valuable than you may think. Focusing on these factors -- and starting with these stocks -- you should be able to build a very successful portfolio of such holdings. ","

                                  · By David Madden Alphabet will report their third-quarter results on Thursday 26th October. Analysts are expecting earnings per shares (EPS) of $8.33 and revenue of $27.19, and these projections would represent annual growth of -8% and 21.1% respectively. Traffic acquisition cost is expected to come in at $5.26 billion, and that would be an increase of 25.9% on a yearly basis. Traders might get worried if the traffic acquisition cost growth rate keeps exceeding that of revenue. Alphabet saw profits fall by 28% in the last quarter, but that included a record-breaking antitrust fine from the EU – the earnings figure still narrowly topped analysts’ estimates.  Stripping out the fine, profits would actually have increased by 28%. Revenue rose by 28% to $21 billion. Google continue to excel in the field of advertising, and revenue from Google Properties and advertising jumped by 20%, but the traffic acquisition costs rose by 28%.The cost per click metric, which is a good barometer of their business, declined by 23%. This tells us that more work is required to ensure it keeps bringing in revenue. The tech giant brings in income from other businesses like the Play Store, its cloud operation and the pixel smartphone, and collectively revenue from these businesses jumped by 42%. The services are clearly in demand, and Alphabet is making headway into the competitive cloud computing business – and it faces competition from Microsoft and Amazon. Cloud services has the potential to be a huge industry  and investors will want to see growth from Alphabet. The company’s ‘Other bet’s division saw its loss drop by nearly 10%. The life sciences business Verily, the driverless cars division and the Nest smart home services all fall under this banner. Dealers appreciate that new ventures take time to get off the ground, and as long as lessons are being learnt and losses are narrowing, the market will cut the company some slack. Alphabet Class A The stock has pulled back from its record high earlier this month and the sentiment is still bullish. Rallies could target $1016, and a move lower may find support at $915.  Alphabet Class C After hitting an all-time high earlier this month, the stock has retreated, but the wider upward trend is still in place. A rally could target the record high of $997, and $895 may act as support should the stock fall.  CMC Markets is an execution-only service provider.

Max A. Cherney,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 6:08 a.m. ET Cost-per-click metric’s decline quickens as more of Google’s advertising revenue derives from smartphone use By As mobile-device usage has surged, Alphabet Inc.’s Google has managed to change along with its users, but it is a victim of that success in one important way. The search giant has managed to transition its enormously profitable advertising business toward mobile as web traffic from personal computers declined from dominant to less than half of global traffic. Change has proven to be something of a double-edged sword, however, because Google’s desktop ads are far more valuable than their mobile cousins. Google tracks the amount it makes from advertisements with a metric called cost per click, which is closely watched by investors and analysts. In the second quarter, the raw number of clicks on ads across all Google platforms surged 52% as compared with the year-earlier period, yet the cost per click fell by 23%. The reason: Google ad sales on mobile devices and YouTube are booming, but the revenue for each click is generally lower than for higher-paid ads that appear around search results on desktop computers. That trend has put pressure on the company’s margins, which fell to 26.4% in the second quarter from 27.8% a year earlier. But some analysts say the quantity of mobile traffic will make up for lower per-click revenue. Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. analyst James Cakmak recently wrote in a note to clients that the shift to mobile, and thus a smaller screen, will increase advertisers’ reliance on paid search and make search-engine optimization and organic results less relevant. “As such, we expect the tailwinds to paid clicks to remain robust for some time, and the cost-per-click … essentially more of the same attributable to ad mix.” What to expect Earnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet on average predict earnings of $8.31 a share for the third quarter, compared with $7.25 a share in the year-earlier period. The Estimize consensus, made up of estimates from sell-side and buy-side analysts as well as hedge-fund managers, academics and others, predicts adjusted earnings of $8.58 a share. While Alphabet switched to a focus on GAAP earnings earlier this year, it does provide the information necessary to calculate non-GAAP earnings that factor out stock-based compensation. Analysts on average predict adjusted earnings of $8.55, according to FactSet. Revenue: On average, analysts estimate sales of $21.9 billion, according to FactSet, up from $18.23 billion in the year-earlier quarter. The Estimize consensus predicts revenue of $22.1 billion. Alphabet breaks revenue down between Google and “Other Bets,” which includes segments like Waymo and Google Fiber. Inside the Google segment, it separates advertising from “other” revenues like hardware, the Google Cloud Platform, and app sales and subscriptions The “Google Other” revenue bucket is expected to rise to $3.4 billion from $2.4 billion in the year-earlier period ahead of the launch of hardware sales from its new line of Pixel smartphones and other gadgets. Don’t miss: Waymo says it wants $1.86 billion from Uber not $2.6 billion “Google Cloud, Hardware, and Play [will be a] benefit to revenue growth and margins,” J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a recent research note to clients. “We like that Google’s recently launched hardware lineup puts Google’s technology, including Assistant & Google Lens, in the hands of consumers.

Class A shares closed at a record high of $987.09 in May and have broached $1,000 intraday several times in the past three months, but they have as yet never closed above that level. Analysts polled by FactSet average a buy rating on the stock, with an average price target of $1,098.31. What else to look for: After reports emerged this week about potentially serious problems with the screens on its flagship Pixel 2 XL phone and glitches emerging on its smaller cousin, the Pixel 2, executives will likely discuss the launch of a new hardware suite that debuted at a splashy launch event in October, even though these sales will not factor into Thursday’s results. But the Mountain View, Calif.–based company’s biggest business is ad sales, not hardware, and that is what investors and analysts will monitor most closely when the company releases its results. Beyond cost-per-click information, another important metric for Google’s advertising business is traffic-acquisition costs, or TAC. That number reflects the mounting fees Alphabet pays other tech titans such as Apple Inc.

Read: Alphabet’s latest quarter looks ‘TACky’ due to Google parent’s traffic acquisition costs For Apple — and other smartphone makers — that means Google pays hefty fees every year to keep Google as the default search engine on their services. Traffic-acquisition costs have been a source of concern for some analysts, because they continue to exert pressure on the company’s bottom line. And by and large analysts expect it to continue to rise for the foreseeable future. “Traffic acquisition cost remains a frustrating topic to the Street, but we believe most investors expect between 50 basis points to 60 basis points of quarter-to-quarter increase in Sites traffic acquisition cost percentage in 3Q,” Anmuth wrote. See also: YouTube advertiser boycott appears to be over Alphabet could break out its YouTube results into a separate line item within its financial statements. It isn’t totally out of the question due to new revenue-recognition rules set to take effect in January 2018, under which the Securities and Exchange Commission expects to see each company report revenue the same way it reports it to the executive in charge of the businesses. A potential threat to the volume of search traffic on Google Search and the ad sales on the site is e-commerce powerhouse Amazon.com Inc.

Jurica Dujmovic,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 12:00 p.m. ET Google Clips learns how to recognize people — and when to take photos By In most photos and videos, we’re aware that we’re being filmed, so we put on our best face, strike a pose and hope for the best. This often costs us the authenticity of the moment. Looking back, we can remember where we were, but it’s harder to recall how we really felt. This especially goes for our kids; we want to see them be themselves, not just pose for the camera. This is where Google Clips comes in. The 12 megapixel, $249 camera, unveiled this month and on order, is targeting parents as buyers. The device is hands-free, provides a visual cue while it’s on and can record its surroundings for up to three hours. It has no screen, though, so the footage and 130-degree wide photos it takes need to be reviewed and downloaded via a smartphone app (though it doesn’t work with all phones). So far, this is nothing special. What sets Google

                                   Clips apart is the way it takes photos: The camera uses sophisticated artificial intelligence, or AI, that can differentiate between faces of humans and animals, and recognize movements. The device will automatically take a seven-second, 15-frames-per-second burst of photos, from which you can pick your favorite, or save them as an animated GIF or a movie file (albeit without sound because Google Clips doesn’t have a microphone). Afterward, you can browse and filter out recorded content using your smartphone app. If you really want to, you can use a shutter button to take clips manually. Also, the more you use the device, the better the algorithm gets at recognizing people and moments that matter to you. As you can see, Google Clips offers the promise of capturing authentic moments. For me, this is a really big deal, since previously it was something cameras could do only in the hands of talented individuals. So color me impressed. Some, like Tesla’s

Elon Musk, think using cameras and AI together is a big no-no, although he’s perfectly fine with his company doing it. (He’s also suggested that AI is more dangerous than North Korea and could spark World War III. Hmmm.) While the use of AI should be regulated for the same reasons we’re regulating certain human activities, in the case of the Google Clips camera there should be no concern because its algorithm doesn’t encroach on your privacy. All of the heavy AI lifting happens on the device itself; Google Clips doesn’t send photos anywhere except to your smartphone, where you’re free to do with them as you wish. (You should be more concerned about what happens to your data after it ends up on your device.) Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool, and it is here to stay — I’ve said that many times, and I will do so again. It’s not about the product, but about how you use it. The same goes for the Google Clips camera. Once it becomes publicly available, some might buy it to spy on others, but most people, myself included, see it as a powerful gadget that can enrich our daily lives. We will finally be able to capture authentic moments with our families. What do you think? Let me know in the comment section below. Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox.

But the tech giant hasn’t taken its eye off the ball in the intervening years, and overlooking its long-term commitment to AI would be a mistake. Just like it has cemented its role in the smartphone ecosystem with its Android operating system, Google is pushing hard to share its open-source TensorFlow machine learning software with developers and companies of all sizes While many companies like Amazon.com

We’ve seen this blueprint before, where Google was happy to allow a community of smart, driven experts to help it build Android to be a world leader in mobile software. You could do worse than bet they would do the same thing with their artificial intelligence platform. Sure, there’s no material profits yet. But if AI becomes the next big Google platform, running the systems in homes and cars the way Android runs tablets and phones, Alphabet will surely find a way to capitalize on that in the years ahead. IBM The opposite of Google’s approach is the proprietary Watson system created by International Business Machines Corp.

                                   Many Americans are most familiar with Watson for its trivia skills displayed on television show “Jeopardy.” But aside from quirky PR stunts, the supercomputer has found a role performing much more practical tasks in recent years. Since 2013, for example, Watson has been in use at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York to help oncologists make the best decisions based on mountains of medical records and real-life diagnoses. And last January a Japanese insurance firm became so reliant on Watson’s actuarial skills that it laid off a few dozen human employees. IBM has married a powerful machine learning interface with its existing enterprise tech operation, selling Watson’s AI under the “software-as-a-service model” that has been so profitable for cloud computing firms in recent years. It’s a natural iteration for IBM’s business — and a necessary one, too, as the struggling technology giant sees persistent revenue headwinds and increasingly is looking to both the cloud and artificial intelligence results to boost performance. The company just reported its 22nd consecutive quarter of revenue declines, though it did beat on profits thanks in part to 20% growth in its cloud division. When you marry the strategic imperatives of cloud and AI with the existing scale and reach of IBM, it’s hard to imagine that the company will not be a serious play in AI for years to come. Furthermore, a 10-year partnership with MIT launched this year will all but ensure a generation of eager engineers come into the American workforce with ready skills to deploy Watson at their workplaces. This is not as sexy or as grandiose as Google’s plan to democratize AI and spread it around the world. But for investors, the appeal is IBM’s bright line between this emerging technology and near-term profit potential.

The most interesting thing about these holdings is that they aren’t nebulous plays on some general AI theme and the hope of machine learning on a grand scale. Most are profiting now with targeted business models that marry automation and AI to produce real-world results. For this strategy the ETF charges a rather modest 0.68% expense ratio, or $68 annually on $10,000 invested. That seems a small price to pay for a diversified and thoughtful basket of potential AI winners. How are you investing in AI?

                                   is heavily dependent on its phone sales, a fact that allows investors to learn more from the financial data. The company will announce earnings just after launching preorders for its new $1,000 smartphone, the iPhone X. The forecast issued by the world’s most highly valued company could be the most important number released by a technology company this earnings season, as it could suggest how many of the expensive phones Apple expects to sell and deliver in the holiday season. Here’s what to pay attention to: Apple Apple lives and dies with its iPhone sales. This year, along with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, the company also unveiled the iPhone X for $999, the highest price Apple has charged to date. “It’s an obvious departure from where things have gone in the past,” said Dawson. “It’s a new price tier and Apple is now firmly in the superpremium space with the iPhone X.” Since Apple launched two new iPhones in late September, early orders and some results may be visible in the company’s financial statements, which will be released Nov. 2. But the forecast is what investors should watch, since it will be the most clear indication of current iPhone 8 sales, as well as potentially offering insight into the number of consumers that are holding off for the iPhone X. Also, speculation about delays in manufacturing have persisted, which means the forecast will give investors some idea of how many phones the company can actually deliver. Read also: Apple stock could get a trillion-dollar tailwind from Trump’s tax reforms, says RBC “The big question is that—can they meet demand?” Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin said. “Investors are going to want to know if they’re going to be able to mass manufacture this phone. If there is a manufacturing hiccup making a particular part, that’s an open question.” Alphabet At its Oct. 4 launch event, the internet company effectively doubled down on its hardware bet, unveiling two new Pixel phones, a smaller version of its Home speaker designed to compete with the Echo Dot from Amazon, and many other gadgets. Aside from Apple, the products are the only full, cohesive suite of computing devices available from a single U.S. company, and the main selling point is that Google is able to leverage its gains in artificial intelligence through the hardware. Opinion: The biggest laggard of the FAANG stocks is now breaking out However, because Google’s hardware revenue is lumped into a sales category called “Google Other revenues”—which also includes Google’s cloud-computing division, YouTube Red subscriptions and app revenue—it is impossible to gauge Google hardware sales from its earnings report. Beyond any color Alphabet executives provide, which they typically avoid, investors will likely have to wait for third-party research to gain meaningful insight into the success of the Pixel and Google’s other gadgets. “We’ll get no explicit guidance,” Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said. “In general, I would expect Pixels will sell slightly better than last year, but because they’re tied to Verizon Communication Inc.

                                   sales will be constrained. It’s the same issue as with the last announcement of Pixel phones.” Alphabet is set to report results Oct. 26. Amazon The company’s line of Echo speakers, powered by virtual assistant Alexa, is essentially Amazon’s iPhone—a new type of device that becomes popular with users and synonymous with the company that made it as rivals seek to catch up. Amazon is treating it with that type of importance, putting 5,000 people to work on the Alexa product line and spending $5.5 billion on “technology and content” research-and-development to develop new Echo devices introduced at a Sept. 27 launch event. “Amazon is transitioning itself into a consumer-facing hardware company, doubling down on the overall strategy on consumers,” Bajarin said. “Through its hardware endpoints in the smart home and voice assistant, it will have a regular touch point with the customer that’s not a shopping page, via a smart speaker and perhaps a screen.” Don’t miss: How winning the race for Amazon’s ‘HQ2’ could turn out to be a curse Like Google, Amazon logs its device sales within a much, much larger category, so it will be difficult to deduce early sales from the numbers alone when the company reports results on Oct. 26. It’s also worth considering that the launch event was just days before the end of the quarter. Echo devices are recorded in the “retail sales” section of “net sales” in Amazon’s supplemental financial information. Last quarter, that bucket of revenue was $23.75 billion, of which a fraction was Echo devices. As a result, commentary and third-party research will likely be more useful. Fitbit In late August, Fitbit previewed its long-awaited competitor to Apple’s line of smartwatches. Priced at $300 and called Ionic, the mixed reviews suggest that it is not the Apple Watch killer the company needed to break out from its core base of cheaper, fitness-focused wearables. “I think it’s in a really challenging place strategically,” Dawson said. “Fitbit needed to go upmarket, but now they’re competing head-on against Apple. They’ve gone from a position of having the market to themselves to going up against one of the biggest companies in the industry with a subpar product.” Since the company’s sales are based on its hardware products—including the Ionic—Fitbit’s guidance will give bigger clues about its expectations for the Ionic, which went on sale Oct. 1, the beginning of the quarter. The company has not yet said when it will report earnings. The rest Roku launched a new streaming device lineup on Oct. 2, though the company says that it views hardware as a customer acquisition strategy and it is not trying to “maximize for player revenue.” When the company went public, executives said the future of Roku sales are in its software, or platform, business, but they should still offer guidance for the new devices in the company’s first earnings report since going public. Roku is set to release earnings on Nov. 8. Nvidia Inc.

Nvidia includes Shield sales in its “gaming” segment in its financial statements, which also includes GPU sales. Nvidia has not yet announced when it will release earnings. Microsoft is releasing its $499 next generation console the Xbox One X on Nov. 7, and sneakily announced the new Surface Book 2 with little fanfare this week. The Xbox One X is available for preorder, and executives may comment on early orders during the earnings call on Oct. 26. GoPro Inc.

The most search interest in “job openings” comes from southern or midwestern states like Mississippi, North Dakota, and Iowa, Rabe wrote, while the strongest interest in “jobs” comes from rural states like Virginia, New Mexico, and Alaska. In contrast, the search term “ask for a raise” comes more from people in states like California, New York, Illinois, and Texas. “Our takeaway,” Rabe wrote, is that “workers in large urban areas (who are statistically more likely to have a college degree) are asking for raises, while people in more rural areas are still searching for jobs.” Rabe suggests this explainer on educational attainment of rural Americans, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture notes “has not kept pace with urban gains.” It’s worth noting that trying to analyze complex economic shifts at the state level is often not much more granular than looking at the national picture. According to the Labor Department, in August many of the rural states Rabe mentioned had jobless rates well below some of the states where people felt confident enough to be asking for raises, not jobs. The Labor Department also tracks annual changes in unemployment, at this colorful page, and there aren’t clear trends there either. In fact, some of the rural states have seen bigger declines than the urban ones. Read: Looking for work?

While the national indexes displayed little action, a number of individual stocks showed big moves as earnings arrived. Investors may also be holding off on making a move ahead of the European Central Bank’s policy decision on Thursday, where ECB President Mario Draghi is widely expected to outline a plan to begin tapering the central bank’s bond purchases. But there seems to be little consensus among analysts as to what shape this will take. See: Mario Draghi needs to avoid a ‘taper tantrum’ when the ECB meets What strategists are saying “[The euro] remains in a holding pattern ahead of the ECB’s decision this Thursday, where our economists expect a dovish taper,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

The bank has been working with Goldman Sachs and Rothschild to assess possible M&A tie-ups, the Financial Times reported. Economic data Data firm IHS Markit on Tuesday said its flash composite purchasing managers index for the eurozone fell to 55.9 in October, from 56.7 in September, to reach a two-month low. A reading above 50.0 signals an expansion in activity. The decline in the measure was larger than expected, and was driven by services companies, which rely more heavily on domestic demand than their manufacturing counterparts. “The eurozone PMI figures seen this morning point towards a stabilization in growth, with manufacturing gains making up for slowing services sector growth,” said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. “However, taking today’s figures in their entirety, it is clear that the manufacturing sector remains the reliable element of eurozone growth, with French, German and eurozone manufacturing all breaking market expectations,” he said in a note. Business activity in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, rose in October, but at a slightly lower rate than in the previous month. Its preliminary composite PMI came in at 56.9, also a two-month low. September’s reading was 57.7. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day. Subscribe to MarketWatch's free Need to Know newsletter. Sign up here. ",Boliden and Whitbread’s drops help send Stoxx Europe 600 to lower finish - MarketWatch
Quentin Fottrell,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 24, 2017 6:55 p.m. ET There’s one very big drawback to this strategy By When it comes to wearing other people’s castoffs, I really only draw the line at socks and, well, undergarments. It sounds gross, I know. But please bear with me. My love of vintage clothing and furniture started casually, with the $30 tuxedo I bought for my high-school prom, and grew into a full-blown commitment with the 1960s turtleneck sweater that I later spotted on Pete Campbell from the AMC 1960s-era series “Mad Men.” My collection now includes a pair of used eyeglasses from an optician’s store in Dublin and a trilby hat bought in a pop-up market in New York City. But my favorite used item to wear? Broken-in, second-hand kicks, one of the priciest items in most wardrobes, but taboo even for some thrift store aficionados. I’ve always liked to step into the past — literally. I have an old pair of $50 Winklepickers that I bought on eBay. They might have been worn by a Beatles fan in the 1960s — or so I like to imagine. Two years ago I bought a used pair of green suede Cole-Haan Lunargrands for $100 in a chic thrift store in New York’s East Village, which I wore into the ground. They would have cost four times that in a store. I also wear a pair of purple Converse All-Stars, which cost $8 in an Army surplus store in San Francisco in January. Used shoes are a reminder that we rent rather than own While it’s likely that at least some of the previous owners of those shoes are alive and kicking in a brand new pair of kicks, in the era of Airbnb, when millions of people sleep in strangers’ beds, the old-fashioned boots-on-the-ground sharing economy seems delightfully old-fashioned. It’s also an important and morbid reminder that, in life, we lease rather than own. Do you ever really own anything? Either it wears out first, or you do. If your collection of old shoes gets donated to a thrift store, hopefully someone else might benefit from them after you’re gone. Don’t miss:  How being a cheapskate became ‘sexy’ After all, a pair of top quality leather uppers could easily cost anywhere between $300 to $800. Sounds crazy? Kanye West’s Yeezy Boost 350 kicks retail at $220. Men are also spending more on shoes. Women spend around $30 billion on shoes every year, according to the NPD Group, a market researcher. Men spent $26.2 billion last year, up from $23.8 billion in 2014. And wearing old clothes can give you a new outlook. Thrift shoppers who embrace their sartorial outsider status learn to look at the world differently. “If you create a generation of creative problem solvers who can think of alternative ways to solve lots of problems, think of what you could do,” says Jillian Owens, a digital marketing strategist in Columbia, S.C. and writes on her blog, Refashionista.net. You can’t romanticize a pair of shoes from H&M Meghan McAndrews, who works in social media in Minneapolis, wears used footwear with pride. “I’m wearing some right now,” she says. “I have a tendency to go for grandma style comfy sandals. In Minnesota it gets warm. These are white perforated leather slingbacks. They cost me about $3. I always make sure they don’t look too shabby.” Similarly, Owens recently bought a pair of Tory Burch boots for $20 (which retail new for $500). But you can’t romanticize a pair of leather uppers in a store like H&M and wonder who wore it first. “The Dress,” a novel by the Irish writer Kate Kerrigan released in hardback last year, traces one couture gown from the 1950s to present day. In a world before Rent the Runway, a site that allows women to wear designer dresses and return them, people had one good pair of shoes or “Sunday best” clothes and stuck with them. “The woman who owned this scuffed 1950s leather handbag must have only owned one bag because she had worn it down to the bone,” Kerrigan writes. “That’s how things were back then. Women had one bag, one pair of shoes, one ‘good’ dress, so they had to make them last, they had to make them special ... Fashion wasn’t disposable in the past, like it is now.” In fact, buying thrift store shoes and clothing reduces waste and the amount of toxins released into the environment. The sheer weight of textiles that become waste is projected to grow to 35.4 billion pounds in 2019 from 25 billion pounds in 2009, according to the nonprofit organization Council for Textile Recycling. Of the 82 pounds of textiles the U.S. produces a year per resident, only 15% is donated or recycled, and 85% eventually ends up in landfills. It’s better they go to a thrift store than a landfill Of course, even used clothing is liable to fall apart at the most inopportune moments. “I wore a vintage dress to one of my company’s work holiday parties,” McAndrews says. “I was midday through the evening, reached for a drink and the whole sleeve came off. Sometimes, you don’t have the time to stress test the clothing before you buy it. I went home at that point in the party. It was a sign of time to go.” (She took her sleeve with her.) Confession: I have had worn holes in my shoes. Do I sometimes feel or look like I crawled out of a bargain bin after a fight with a tangled sweater? Sometimes. But I refuse to spend hundreds, even thousands, of dollars on shoes. So used shoes are a no-brainer: You get the high quality, but for much less. Over the last three years alone, I’ve saved thousands of dollars had I bought this footwear new, and spent only hundreds. In fact, my pristine pair of black leather winter boots by Canadian designer John Fluevog often receive compliments. I never hesitate to say, “Thanks, $20 on eBay

                                  ” They retail at over $300. Let’s put it this way: If you wanted a business partner who didn’t max out his expense account or go over budget, would you trust the guy with the overpriced, trying-too-hard $400 loafers worn to impress clients or the one in the $20 John Fluevog thrift-store kicks?

Andrew L. Wang,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 10:03 a.m. ET Balancing opportunity with cost of living By This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Given all the ways that Americans stay in contact with each other, people who work in technology should be able to ply their trade from anywhere in the country with a fast, consistent internet connection. In theory. It turns out, location still matters when it comes to conceiving and building the next tech thing. It’s why developers, engineers, designers, database administrators and all other manner of tech genius pile into Silicon Valley and a handful of other places around the country. NerdWallet analyzed 381 U.S. metro areas with populations over 50,000 using data from the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey to identify the regions that balance opportunity for tech workers with cost of living. The top metro areas have lots of people and tech employers. Seven of the top 10 metro areas for tech jobs (and 15 of the top 20) had over 500,000 residents. The top 10 places had an average population of 2.1 million.

Two places had major research facilities (Huntsville, Alabama, and California-Lexington Park, Maryland), and one was the seat of the federal government — Washington, D.C., and its metro area. Top cities are pricey, but salaries are high, too. The median gross rent — a U.S. Census Bureau metric, which includes the costs of monthly rent, utilities and heating fuels — for the top 10 metros averaged $1,340, significantly higher than the average overall median rent at $882. Meanwhile, median tech salaries in the top 10 averaged $101,118 annually, compared with an average of $75,707 for all 381 metros. 1. San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California If you can think of a big tech company, chances are that it’s based, or at least has a major office, in the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro area, one of two Silicon Valley areas in the top 10.

With thousands of tech workers flocking there every year, it ranks first for technology-related employees per 1,000 jobs (134 per 1,000) and median annual salary ($121,064). It also is the least affordable metro area in our analysis, with median gross rent of $2,044. 2. Huntsville, Alabama Home to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, which designs, builds and tests vehicles and systems for piloted space flight, it’s no surprise that workers in tech fields flock to Huntsville. The region ranks seventh with just over 63 tech-related employees per 1,000 jobs. However, what vaults it even higher in our analysis is its affordability. Huntsville has by far the lowest median gross rent in the top 10 metros at $785 a month. That’s No. 233 in our analysis of 381 places. 3.

The region ranks third in our analysis for tech employees per 1,000 jobs, and fifth for median annual tech salary, $103,320. Meanwhile, living here is on the pricier side at $1,325 a month in median gross rent. 4. California-Lexington Park, Maryland Tucked away on the wooded shores of the Chesapeake Bay, about 60 miles from Washington, D.C., the California-Lexington Park area might seem a strange destination for tech workers. The draw: the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, which hosts, among other facilities, a research and development division for military aircraft. The area ranks second in our analysis for job opportunities, with 83 tech employees per 1,000 jobs. 5. Durham-Chapel Hill, North Carolina Perhaps as well known for its college basketball powerhouses as its status as a tech hub, the Durham-Chapel Hill area is the second most affordable metro in our top 10, though it still ranks in the top third of the highest median gross rents in our analysis at $947. In addition to being home to two universities, Durham-Chapel Hill also hosts locations of employers like IBM and Cisco.

Like Durham-Chapel Hill, it’s affordable relative to the rest of the top 10 at $1,026 a month for median gross rent. Meanwhile, it ranks eighth in our analysis with nearly 63 tech employees per 1,000 jobs. 7. Washington, D.C., Arlington-Alexandria, Virginia, Maryland Encompassing the nation’s capital as well as nearby suburbs in Maryland and the sprawling region known as Northern Virginia, the Washington, D.C.,-Arlington-Alexandria region doesn’t just host much of the machinery of the federal government. It’s also home to the many contractors that do business with here, such as Lockheed-Martin

That said, it also ranks as the sixth least-affordable metro. 8. Boulder, Colorado With Google planning on opening a new campus, and IBM and computer hardware-maker Seagate already in the area, the Boulder metro area ranks fifth in our analysis with 74 tech employees per 1,000 jobs. Though it has the most tech jobs of any metro area in the Centennial State, it also has in the southeast the Denver-Lakewood-Aurora metro area, where tech workers will find a higher annual median salary, $98,391 to Boulder’s $95,091. 9.

Austin-Round Rock, Texas The region around Texas’ capital is home to no shortage of tech companies — Apple, Dell, Samsung — and it also has its own vibrant startup scene (SXSW, anyone?). The area ranks ninth with 62 tech employees per 1,000 jobs, but the median annual tech salary lags behind a bit compared with others in the top 10 at $93,039.

                                   tumbled as much as 6.3% minutes after the open—it had plunged as much as 8.8% in premarket trade—but bounced sharply to close up 1.1%. Volume ballooned to about 190 million shares, almost four times the full-day average, and enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges. GE reported before the open an adjusted profit of 29 cents a share, well below the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet of 49 cents. GE also provided a full-year adjusted EPS outlook of $1.05 to $1.10, which was below the FactSet EPS consensus at the time of $1.54. Investors could take some comfort, however, in knowing GE’s dividend was still safe, for at least the next few weeks. Don’t miss: GE stock options point to big move after earnings, dividend cut. The stock’s recovery was surprise, as it had declined after the past seven quarterly reports, by an average of 1.6%. The profit miss was also a shocker, since it was the first since the first quarter of 2015, according to FactSet data, and just the fourth miss over the past 20 quarters. “Our results are unacceptable, to say the least,” said Chief Executive John Flannery on the post-results conference call with analysts, according to a transcript provided by FactSet. It was the first call since Flannery took charge of on Aug. 1. While there was some fear that GE might cut its dividend, investors were spared that bad news, at least until the investor meeting scheduled for Nov. 13, when the company is expected to outline its path to recovery. GE currently pays a quarterly dividend of 24 cents a share. At current stock prices, the annual dividend rate implies a dividend yield of 4.03%, compared with the implied yield on the SPDR Industrial Select Sector exchange-traded fund

In response to a question from analyst Steven Winoker at UBS, on whether the current level of dividend was sustainable without jeopardizing the future growth of the company, Flannery said GE’s philosophy was to manage for total shareholder returns. “So there does need to be a balance of investing in growth, organic and inorganic growth, and the dividend payout. So as a philosophy, expect a balance. We’ll present this framework in November as we complete the 2017 and 2018 process,” Flannery said. CFRA Research equity analyst Jim Corridore cut his stock price target to $24 from $27, while keeping his rating at hold. “We think GE has industry leading assets, but would wait for some restructuring results before adding to positions,” Corridore wrote in a note to clients.

 ,11022017,CNBC,10262017,"Facebook, Twitter, and Alphabet's Google head before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday for two days of grueling hearings on how Russia allegedly used their services to try to sway the 2016 U.S. election. At stake for the Silicon Valley companies are their public images and the threat of tougher advertising regulations in the United States, where the technology sector has grown accustomed to light treatment from the government. Facebook, the world's largest social network, added fuel to the debate on Monday when it told Congress in written testimony that 126 million Americans may have seen politically divisive posts that originated in Russia under fake names. That is in addition to 3,000 U.S. political ads that Facebook says Russians bought on its platform. Google and Twitter have also said that people in Russia used their services to spread messages in the run-up to last year's U.S. presidential election. The Russian government has denied it intended to influence the election, in which President Donald Trump, a Republican, defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. U.S. lawmakers have responded angrily to the idea of foreign meddling, introducing legislation to require online platforms to say who is running election ads and what audiences are targeted. ""The companies need to get ahead of the curve here,"" said James Lewis, senior vice president of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. If they can, he added, they might avoid regulation. Lewis, speaking during the Reuters Cyber Summit in Washington, said he expects European officials to watch the U.S. hearings closely. The U.S. Senate's crime subcommittee will be the first of three committees to hold hearings on Russia. Its hearing is set for 2:30 p.m. ET (1830 GMT). Facebook and Twitter are dispatching their general counsels, Colin Stretch and Sean Edgett, to appear before the subcommittee, while Google is sending its director of law enforcement and information security, Richard Salgado. ""Our goal is to bring people closer together; what we saw from these actors was an insidious attempt to drive people apart. And we're determined to prevent it from happening again,"" Stretch will tell lawmakers, according to an advance copy of his remarks. Facebook and Twitter have taken steps toward self-regulation, saying they would create their own public archives of election-related ads and also apply more specific labels to such ads. Google followed on Monday, saying it would create a database of election ads including ones on YouTube. The companies have meanwhile disclosed new details about the extent of Russia-based material, raising alarms about a sector that once inspired idealism. ""The internet was seen as a great engine for promoting democracy and transparency. Now we are all discovering that it can also be a tool for hijacking democracy,"" said Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow for digital policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Anita Balakrishnan,11022017,CNBC,10262017,"Ads on Google are getting more clicks than Wall Street expected — but it is costing Alphabet slightly more than estimated to get that traffic. Alphabet reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations on Thursday and revenue that exceeded estimates. Share prices passed $1,020 in after-hours trading — surpassing the all-time intraday high of $1,016.31 set during the regular session on Oct. 18. Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast — but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. Google is again stressing this quarter ""how we're solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day,"" Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told CNBC's Josh Lipton. ""And fundamental to all of this is our focus in building products with AI at their core, and we believe Google is leading the way here."" That means Alphabet performed better than a year ago, as sales surged 24 percent. In the year-ago quarter, Alphabet reported revenue of $22.45 billion and adjusted earnings of $7.25 a share (revised downward from $9.06 a share.) Alphabet makes most of its money from ads: Cost per click is the amount that advertisers pay Google each time their ad is clicked, while aggregate paid clicks measures how many times users click on ads. TAC stands for traffic acquisition costs. Here's how Google's ads performed: Google parent Alphabet has seen Class A shares rise about 25 percent this year as advertisers have continued to lean heavily on search advertising and YouTube. Network revenues were up 16 percent during the third quarter. ""Our momentum is a result of investments that we've been making over many years in people, products and partnerships,"" Porat said. But a growing share of ads moving to mobile and programmatic formats has been putting a bit of pressure on Google's profit margins over the past year. Apple also said this quarter that Google would become the default web search option for Siri on iOS, a deal that has cost billions in the past. Google also spent money on Google Cloud data centers, content for YouTube, and hardware-related costs, Porat said on a conference call. Headcount also jumped to over 78,000 people, up from nearly 70,000 a year ago, as the company hired more cloud engineers. Porat said the company intends to continue investing in these areas. ""Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud because of our prowess in data analytics, [and] our commitment to being an open platform,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said. While Alphabet's Google business primarily makes money through advertising, it also contains Google Shopping, Maps, YouTube, Android, Chrome, Google Play, virtual reality and cloud services. Google's ""other"" revenues, which includes hardware sales, were $3.45 billion during the quarter, up from $2.43 billion a year ago. Google launched its Pixel 2 phone this fall and has expanded options for Google Home and Google earbuds. And Google also agreed to buy part of HTC for $1.1 billion. Alphabet's moonshot ""other bets"" include Waymo's self-driving cars, Google's start-up investing arms, Verily life sciences research and Nest smart-home devices. Revenue from ""other bets"" was $302 million during the quarter, more than the $263.4 million expected by a StreetAccount estimate. Porat has pushed Alphabet engineers to push toward achievable projects — right now, the ""other bets"" mainly make money through Google's Fiber internet sales, Nest products and Verily licensing. CapitalG is leading an investment round in Lyft. Porat told analysts on Thursday that Fiber has been pared down, but that Waymo and Nest are making progress. Porat said in a statement that the ""terrific"" quarter reflected ""strength across Google and Other Bets,"" and a ""culture of innovation."" ""What we're looking to do with 'other bets' is create valuable businesses over the longer term,"" Porat told CNBC. Google's quarterly results come as technology companies are expected to testify on Capitol Hill next week about the role of Russian political advertising in the 2016 election. Amid outcry about ""fake news,"" Pichai said on the Thursday conference call that Google is changing its model to support journalists and prevent hacking of news sites. That's only one of the kerfuffles that Google has had with lawmakers this year. In Europe, Google's Shopping division may have to shift focus to deal with a record-breaking antitrust fine. ""We do feel good about the steps we took, but it's early. Under the remedy, comparison shopping services have a new opportunity to use shopping ads to advertise on Google.com in the relevant countries,"" Porat told CNBC of the fine in Europe. ""Our Google shopping service in these countries will operate in the same manner, bidding alongside comparison shopping services."" ",Alphabet earnings Q3 2017

Sara Salinas,11022017,CNBC,10262017,"Members of Congress blasted representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google on Wednesday for what they said was their inadequate response to Russian mischief made on their platforms during the 2016 election. ""I don't think you get it,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told the companies' general counsels during the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. ""What we're talking about is a cataclysmic change. What we're talking about is the beginning of cyberwarfare."" Facebook's Colin Stretch, Twitter's Sean Edgett and Google's Kent Walker revealed little new information about the extent of foreign influence on their platforms. Representatives of the companies appeared before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday and were due to testify at a House Intelligence Committee hearing later Wednesday. The companies appeared under-prepared to answer some of the questions on Wednesday. Stretch, Edgett and Walker produced statistics of Russia-linked advertisements and accounts, but questions about more general Russia propaganda on the platforms and socially divisive content drew only silences and promises to provide the information at a later date. Facebook said this week that Russian-backed election content on the platform reached 126 million Americans; Twitter found 36,000 Russian accounts were active during the election; and Google said  pro-Russian groups purchased $4,700 worth of ads on its platforms. Senators repeatedly interrupted the general counsels' answers and moved on before allowing them to finish, clearly exasperated by the counsels' tendency to provide long-winded answers — and often by the answers themselves. ""It's not clear that you or the public understand the degree of this,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ""You need to stop paying lip service."" Wyden asked the three whether they were satisfied with their platforms' monitoring of foreign influence during the 2016 presidential election — all three said no. ""This is not a Democrat or Republic issue. This is an American issue"", said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-WV. ""You cannot allow what's going on against the United States of America. You're on the front lines with us."" Manchin said the companies' inaction threatened the security, safety and ""sovereignty of our nation."" The week's hearings could mark a turning point for the internet giants as discussions of regulation come to fore. Twitter and Facebook have each moved to increase transparency around advertising, after public comments by CEOs Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg. Several senators indicated during Wednesday's hearing that legislation could be on the horizon for the tech companies, though they varied on the extent. Manchin asked for the companies' reactions to the proposed Honest Ads Act, which would require greater information around political content . Only Twitter provided an answer, and it was mostly supportive. Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said any legislation may have only the ""lightest touch.""

Phil LeBeau,11022017,CNBC,10262017,"As I stepped into the back seat of Waymo's self-driving minivan for a ride around the company's test facility in Atwater, California, it felt like dozens of other times I had ridden in a minivan. That changed once I shut the door and I took off for a short drive where the minivan encountered pedestrians, stalled cars, bicyclists and a variety of staged scenarios. I experienced how many of us could be making trips when there's no one behind the wheel. ""We're excited where we are right now,"" said John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, formerly known as the Google self-driving car project and now a separate company within Google's parent company, Alphabet. ""This technology has the potential to be transformative."" Not only that, but Krafcik also believes we could see vehicles without drivers on streets and highways sooner than many expected. ""We're getting close,"" he said. ""We're not going to give you a date when it will happen, but stay tuned."" Krafcik's optimism comes as automakers like Tesla market features like Autopilot, which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for short periods of time. General Motors' Super Cruise allows hands-free driving on the highway. While GM CEO Mary Barra says her company is ""quarters, not years"" from being to able to remove drivers from the autonomous-drive vehicles it's developing, no auto or tech firm has yet to roll out a self-driving vehicle that can pick up riders, take them in a trip and drop them off with no one behind the wheel. Waymo believes that could change in the not too distant future. Which is one reason the subsidiary of Alphabet brought reporters to see its test facility at the abandoned Castle Air Force Base three hours southeast of San Francisco. Krafcik sees Waymo offering self-driving products in four areas: Whether the company partners with automakers, ride-sharing firms or other companies remains to be seen. Waymo is already working with Fiat Chrysler, Lyft and Avis. Waymo is already giving a select number of residents in Chandler, Arizona, rides in self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans. As part of that program, the company has modified the vans with sensors, cameras and lidar radar so each Pacifica has a 360-degree view of what's happening around it. The minivans also have two other features designed to make passengers feel comfortable riding in a self-driving vehicle. First, there's a small panel attached to the center of the ceiling where riders can push one of four buttons to lock/unlock doors, begin a ride, pull over or call Waymo tech support. The second is a screen on the back of the front seat showing passengers what the self-driving minivan is seeing on the streets, sidewalks, and so on as it takes them to their destination. ""It's reassuring to riders to see what's happening around them,"" said Juliet Rothenberg who oversees Waymo's in-car user experience. So what did I think going for a ride in a truly self-driving vehicle with nobody behind the wheel? Yes, it's a little odd being in the back seat and watching the steering wheel turn on its own. That said, the screen showing what's ahead on the street, pedestrians crossing the road or other cars turning in front of us was easy to understand. I would compare it to watching a much more detailed GPS map that shows you where you are headed. The short ride and seeing Waymo's technology up close makes it clear the technology is closer than ever to being used by the public. There are still hurdles to overcome with laws and regulations, so it may be a while until a robo-taxi picks you up. Still, Krafcik remains laser-focused. ""Our goal is to bring this technology to the world and public roads,"" he said. ",Waymo CEO John Krafcik: Self-driving cars 'getting close'
Fred Imbert,11022017,CNBC,10262017,"The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose to a record high on Friday as Wall Street cheered the blowout quarterly reports from three of the world's biggest tech companies. The index rose 2.2 percent to 6,701.26 and notched its biggest one-day gain since November 2016. The Nasdaq 100 also hit a record, rising 2.9 percent. The Nasdaq 100 is made up of the 100 largest companies in the composite index. The PowerShares QQQ Trust exchange-traded fund, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, rose 2.9 percent. Leading the ETF higher were shares of Amazon, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet; their stocks rose 13.2 percent, 6.4 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. E-commerce giant Amazon reported earnings per share of 52 cents a share, way ahead of a Thomson Reuters estimate of 3 cents a share. Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business, was its main driver for growth, with sales leaping 42 percent on a year-over-year basis. Amazon also received a boost in sales from Whole Foods, which it acquired in late August. The stock broke above $1,100 for the first time on Friday. ""We would characterize last night's Amazon September results as a 'Picasso-like quarter' with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,"" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said in a note Friday. ""Last night's quarter ... is another feather in Bezos' cap."" Microsoft, meanwhile, beat Wall Street earnings expectations by 12 cents a share as its commercial cloud business topped $20 billion in annualized revenue for its fiscal first quarter. The stock posted its biggest one-day gain since October 2015. Google-parent Alphabet reported adjusted earnings per share of $9.57, well above a Thomson Reuters estimate of $8.33 a share, as the company saw a higher-than-expected surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. ""We were amazed when we were getting the numbers last night,"" said Randy Warren, CIO at Warren Financial. ""This rally is based on earnings."" ""When you look at why the indexes are moving up, it's because of real earnings growth, and there are no signs of that abating,"" Warren said.

The broader market also rose on Friday, receiving a boost from stronger-than-expected economic data. The S&P 500 gained 0.8 percent to finsih at 2,581.07 and hit a record high. The first reading on third-quarter GDP showed the U.S. economy grew by 3 percent, above an estimate of 2.5 percent.

Hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September. Excluding inventory investment, the economy grew at a 2.3 percent rate, slowing from the second quarter's 2.9 percent pace.

Lucy Handley,11022017,CNBC,10262017,"WPP today lowered its expectations for full-year organic net sales and profit margins in the advertising industry, saying it now expects like-for-like sales to come in flat, compared to a previous forecast range of 0 to 1 percent. Facebook and Google have disrupted the industry, an online statement from the British advertising and public relations firm said, while management consultancies attempting to take a slice of the ad agency pie have resulted in a focus on reducing costs. The advertising conglomerate added that low interest rates and ""zero-based"" budgeting from clients have also contributed. WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell has spoken of Facebook and Google's impact on his business many times before. Although WPP spends around $5 billion a year with Google on behalf of clients, and a further $2 billion on Facebook, he has often referred to them as ""frenemies"" — and more recently ""flexible friends."" In 2014, WPP invested  $25 million in ad exchange AppNexus, a competitor to Google's DoubleClick. Both are types of technology that let publishers display advertising on their websites, and allow advertisers and agencies to control where and when their ads are shown, as well as gather data on how much they are clicked on, and who by. WPP also suggested that the rise of management consultancies such as Accenture and Deloitte Digital buying ad agencies may have had an impact, though it questioned whether they could compete creatively. ""Where the consultancies may have made some inroads is their focus not so much on the digital area, but more importantly on client concerns about cost. Very few CEOs will resist the suggestion that they may be overspending and the promise of an audit or review that will only cost a proportion of any cost savings,"" the statement said. WPP said its clients were also contending with disruption by companies like Airbnb in hospitality and Alibaba or Amazon in distribution, in addition to dealing with ""zero-based budgeting,"" an accounting tactic where business expenses have to be justified for each new financial period. This is a method used by consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies such as Reckitt Benckiser or Coty, with the CPG sector making up about 30 percent of WPP's revenue. ""I think it is in this low growth world, or relatively low growth world, where there is very little inflation, where there is very little pricing power and there is a great focus on cost,"" Sorrell explained to CNBC's Squawk Box Europe this morning.

Matt Rosoff,11022017,CNBC,10262017,"Google Fiber was one of the company's most ambitious projects. Under the original vision, the company was going to run fiber-optic cable directly to consumers' homes, giving them super-fast internet. Google announced it would roll the service out in Kansas City, Kansas, in 2011, and followed by eight other cities. Then, Alphabet happened. Specifically, Google hired new CFO Ruth Porat in 2015, and that August it reorganized into a holding company called Alphabet, consisting of the core Google businesses — which provide nearly all of its revenue and all of its profit — and a set of longer-term investment areas called ""Other Bets."" Fiber was placed into that Other Bets category. A year later, in August 2016, the company took a closer look at the Fiber business and saw it wasn't meeting subscriber expectations. So it decided to concentrate on less-expensive wireless last-mile solutions, according to a report in The Information. A couple months later, in October, Google Fiber CEO Craig Barratt stepped down, the company ""paused"" all uncompleted but previously promised rollouts, and laid off some Fiber employees. While Alphabet never disclosed exactly how much it was spending on rolling out Fiber, the company does break out capital expenditures within its Other Bets category. Capex there started climbing rapidly in the second half of 2016, peaking at $504 million in Q4. Then, it dropped dramatically. In Alphabet's most recent quarter, which it reported Thursday, it spent only $77 million on capital expenditures in the Other Bets category. Here is a chart showing the spike, which we first saw from analyst Jan Dawson via Twitter. The conclusion? Porat and the rest of Alphabet management are keeping a tight lid on spending in the company's long-term bets, and if these bets are not performing to expectations, they'll shut them down.

Ashraf Eassa,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A little while back, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary Google announced its new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones, which target the premium portion of the smartphone market. One particular feature that has received a lot of attention is the chip inside of these phones called the Pixel Visual Core. The chip, Google says, is a ""Google-designed Image Processing Unit (IPU)"" that helps enhance the camera capabilities of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 smartphones. Although Google  says it's a Google-designed chip, it recently came to light that Google worked with chip-maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to build the chip. The exact nature of the collaboration between Google and Intel isn't made clear in Google's public statements, but independent analyst Daniel Matte predicted back in August that the chip is a custom-designed part that incorporates technology from an Intel subsidiary called Movidius. Intel bought Movidius, a small chip start-up focused on computer vision technology, in late 2016 in a bid to broaden its technology portfolio as the chip giant aims to expand its reach beyond its core personal computer and data center markets. I think the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of Matte's claim. Now, there has been some speculation that Intel is also manufacturing the chip in its factories as well. However, I think this is highly unlikely. Here's why. Image source: Intel. Intel announced its latest Movidius part, known as the Movidius Myriad X, back in August. This part is built using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's 16-nanometer FFC manufacturing technology. The reason that this part is built using TSMC's technology instead of Intel's is simple: Intel announced its plan to acquire Movidius in September 2016. Chip development cycles, even for something that's relatively simple like the Movidius VPU, are quite long -- we're talking on the order of years. Intel simply wouldn't have had the time to migrate Movidius' technology to its own chip manufacturing technology in time for the Google Pixel 2 product launch. Furthermore, given that these product development cycles are long, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the next generation or two of Movidius technology will be manufactured on TSMC technology, either. For some perspective: Intel completed the acquisition of the cellular modem division of Infineon all the way back in January 2011, but the company won't release its first in-house manufactured cellular modem until next year. Put bluntly, Intel winning the Pixel Visual Core design isn't going to move the needle for the company. Even if Google sells on the order of 2 million Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL devices over the next year, and even if Intel get something like $10 per chip, that incremental $20 million in revenue just isn't going to impact the financial results of a company that's on track to generate more than $60 billion in sales this year, per Intel's most recent financial guidance. So, if the design win itself isn't going to move the needle for Intel's financial results, the manufacturer of the chip won't really matter to Intel's financial results, either. From a bigger-picture perspective, though, I think that Intel will want to migrate this technology to its own manufacturing technology as soon as practicable so that it can incorporate the Movidius intellectual property into its personal computer and Internet of Things processors. Finally, if Google's adoption of this technology helps to drum up interest from other smartphone manufacturers -- ones that ship far more smartphones per year than Google does -- then Intel could find itself shipping far more Movidius-based chips. In that case, having those chips built by Intel rather than a third party could help Intel boost its profit margins (since Intel doesn't have to pay the margin of a third-party vendor on top of that vendor's manufacturing costs) and help keep Intel's factories well utilized, which could also help to improve Intel's gross profit margin.

    Why Intel Corp. Isn't Manufacturing the Google Pixel Visual Core -- The Motley Fool

Steve Symington,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) released third-quarter 2017 results on Thursday after the market closed, demolishing investors' expectations with strong top- and bottom-line results. Shares of the internet-search juggernaut jumped nearly 5% on Friday in response, easily eclipsing the $1,000-per-share mark for the first time. Let's look at the underlying drivers for Google's parent company as it started the second half of the year and at what investors should anticipate in the months ahead. IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. Let's start with the headline numbers: Third-quarter revenue grew 23.7% year over year to $27.772 billion, net income increased 33% to $6.732 billion, and earnings per diluted share rose 32% to $9.57. Alphabet doesn't provide specific quarterly guidance. So for perspective -- though we usually take Wall Street's demands with a grain of salt -- consensus estimates were less optimistic, calling for earnings of $8.33 per share on revenue of $27.2 billion. Digging deeper into those results, Alphabet separates its business into two segments: Google and ""Other Bets."" Here's how they fared in terms of revenue and profitability: * Excluding the European Commission fine. Data source: Alphabet Inc. Q3 earnings release. ""Other Bets"" is comprised of early-stage, high-potential businesses, most of which have yet to generate consistent revenue, let alone profits. But given its relative cash cow in Google (more on that below), Alphabet is more than happy to foster these ""bets"" on the chance they could eventually generate meaningful incremental sales and earnings. Some are already well on their way to that end. As Other Bets' operating losses narrowed, segment revenue climbed more than 50% to $302 million, primarily generated by Nest connected home products, Fiber high-speed internet, and Verily Life Sciences products. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat offered several updates during the subsequent conference call. Nest, for example, launched a number of notable updates including its new, more affordable Nest Thermostat E, as well as a home-security solution including the Nest Secure alarm system, Hello video doorbell, and Cam IQ outdoor security camera. Other Bets also includes Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car business, which announced yesterday it will commence winter-season testing in Michigan to tackle key challenges for driving in snow, sleet, and ice. As expected, Google generated the vast majority of Alphabet's overall revenue and all of its operating income, helped by an incredible portfolio of products including Search, Chrome, Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Play, Cloud and Android. Most importantly, Google's advertising business continues to thrive; advertising revenue climbed 21.4% year over year to $24.065 billion. That included 22.6% growth from Google properties ad sales, to $19.723 billion, led by strength in mobile search, YouTube, and desktop search. Ad revenue from network members' sites also grew 16.3% to $4.342 billion. Next, aggregated paid clicks rose 47% year over year -- up from 52% last quarter and 44% in Q1 -- including 55% growth from Google properties, and a 10% increase from network members' properties. Aggregate cost per click (a metric that measures how much Google makes from each ad) declined 18% -- a deceleration from last quarter's 23% fall -- including a 21% drop from Google properties and a 5% decline from network members' sites. As a reminder, this drop is owed to the relative outperformance of YouTube, where the video platform's TrueView ad format tends to reach users earlier in the purchase funnel, so monetizes at lower rates. Meanwhile, Google's non-ad products sustained their hearty growth, with revenue climbing 40% year over year to $3.405 billion, thanks to broad strength in Cloud, Play, and hardware sales. Finally -- though I had hoped for an update on Google's handling of its enormous $2.7 billion European Commission antitrust fine, management didn't offer any new color on its reported appeal, or on efforts to appease regulators to avoid future fines. Remember, that fine was absorbed in its entirety as a separate operating-expense line in last quarter's results. Again, Alphabet doesn't provide investors with specific quarterly financial guidance. But Porat did insist that the company is ""committed to sales and marketing investments in Q4 for the important holiday season"" -- not only related to the company's core search and YouTube platforms, but also to its hardware product lines. These hardware lines were recently expanded to include new Nest products, Pixel 2 smartphones, new Google Home smart speakers, new Chromebooks, VR headsets, and earbuds. Investors couldn't ask for much more. Porat summed up the company's performance well by stating: ""We had a terrific quarter. ... Our momentum is a result of investments over many years in fantastic people, products, and partnerships."" ","

Google also announced that ""Starting today, we're offering free delivery on Google Express as long as your order is above each store's minimum."" The company's online shopping mall is a consortium of 30 retailers including Target and Bed Bath & Beyond, which allows consumers to shop multiple stores all from the Google Express website. The service previously charged a membership fee $95 per year or $10 per month. Ironically, press releases from Google and Wal-Mart both said, ""There's no membership required,"" in a clear shot at Amazon. As an additional perk, shoppers who buy Google Home speakers will receive a $25 discount on their next Wal-Mart order if they link their account with Google Express. Amazon competes with both companies to varying degrees, though some may not be quite so obvious. A study released late last year by personalization platform company BloomReach details one. A survey of over 2,000 consumers revealed that 55% of shoppers start on Amazon's website when searching for products online. More than 89% of Google's revenue comes from search advertising, so changes in consumer behavior could erode the search giant's dominance over time. Voice-activated shopping has also become increasingly popular with consumers since the debut of Amazon's Echo smart speaker in 2014. A recent survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets of Amazon customers found that 17% use the Alexa-enabled devices to order products from the e-commerce website. The Google Home speaker was finally released last year after Echo had the market to itself for two years, and Google is eager to make its mark in the voice shopping market. Wal-Mart is instituting solutions to better compete in e-commerce. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is in the midst of a far-reaching transformation that began with the purchase of Jet.com and the hiring of its founder, Marc Lore, to head its e-commerce operations. The company has introduced Pickup, a service that allows customers to receive discounts on items they order online and pick them up at a nearby store, noting that ""90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store."" Wal-Mart also recently acquired New York-based Parcel, a delivery company that serves online retailers and meal-kit companies. It plans to use the service to expand its same-day and next-day deliveries in the area. As the battle for retail supremacy rages, success will be enjoyed by those that find new and innovative solutions to serve their customers. Wal-Mart says this is just the beginning, and it plans to ""create customer experiences that don't currently exist."" That might just help the company continue to compete in this brave new world.

There are several angles you can take if you want to add a few cloud computing stocks to your portfolio. But if you want to bet on the leaders in the business, you should start with Amazon.com, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Research firm Gartner predicts that the public cloud services market will be worth $383.3 billion by 2020, a massive opportunity that makes it crystal clear why these three key players are in the middle of a fierce battle for dominance. There are plenty of smaller players in this segment, all offering varying types of services, but let's focus on the giants and how they plan to compete in this space. Company Market Cap % of Public Cloud Market Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) $474 billion 40% Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) $598 billion 11% $687 billion 6% Data source: Yahoo Finance and Business Insider. Don't feel bad if you're not exactly sure what cloud computing is. The term can actually refer to several different types of cloud services, including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Microsoft's Office 365 is one of the best examples of SaaS, while PaaS includes things like Google's App Engine tools, which allow developers to build their own products and services. Meanwhile, IaaS involves things like networking features, virtual machines, and actual data storage -- which Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all offer. In this article, we'll use the general ""cloud computing"" term to refer to a combination of all of these services, because each of the big three players offers SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. AWS is the real breadwinner because of its hefty 25% margins and its stellar growth. Its revenue jumped by 70% in 2015 and 55% in 2016. Amazon isn't a pure play in the segment, but it's already proved that it can do both e-commerce and cloud computing very well -- and at the same time. AWS revenue grew by 58% year over year in Q2, and it's likely to continue growing as a key contributor to the company's top and bottom lines. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft may be known for its software prowess, but its Azure Cloud Services unit currently holds the No. 2 spot in public cloud computing with an 11% market share. The cloud computing segment brought in $18.9 billion in fiscal 2017 -- a 56% year-over-year increase -- and it's on track to hit $20 billion annually by the end of fiscal 2018. It's worth pointing out that Microsoft lumps all of its cloud computing revenue (including Office 365 software) into one segment, which pushes its cloud revenue higher than Amazon's. Image source: Getty Images. Azure is important to Microsoft because it helps lock the company's enterprise customers into its other services like Windows Server. Without Azure, Microsoft could easily lose Windows Server clients and forfeit significant yearly sales. For example, Microsoft said in its fiscal fourth quarter that server products and cloud services revenue jumped by 15%, which was ""driven by Azure revenue growth."" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said back in 2014 that the company would take a ""mobile first, cloud first"" approach, and so far it has implemented the last part of that strategy quite well. Microsoft may trail Amazon, but it's still far ahead of its next closest competitor, Alphabet. And the company's long enterprise experience should help keep it solidly in that No. 2 spot. It's a bit unusual to have occasion to describe Alphabet as anything other than a leader, but in cloud computing, it's still a relatively small player. Google started selling its first cloud services back in 2008, and currently, holds about 6% of the market. But just because it's the smallest player on this list doesn't mean it should be counted out. In typical Google fashion, it's building out its cloud presence by offering software like its TensorFlow machine learning algorithms for free to developers. TensorFlow is the magic behind the Google Photos function that automatically categorizes images for you, for example, and its machine learning makes the results of your Google searches more relevant. The company started giving TensorFlow away to developers a couple of years ago as part of its efforts to woo them to the company's cloud platform. That strategy may seem like an odd way to build a cloud business, but TensorFlow has made Amazon and Microsoft nervous enough that they've teamed up to release a competing machine learning software product. The head of Google Cloud, Urs Holzle, has said that he wants revenue from Google Cloud services to overtake the company's advertising sales by 2020. Considering that the tech giant earns nearly 90% of its top line from advertising, that timeline sounds optimistic, to say the least. Google doesn't break out its cloud platform revenue (nor any other segment's sales, for that matter) but that doesn't mean investors should overlook the potential for Alphabet here. It became a key cloud services player in a short period of time, and now offers important software that developers find very useful. And Microsoft and Amazon appear to be a little worried about Google Cloud's rapid rise, which by itself should make it clear that it's shaping up to be a formidable player in the space. The cloud computing sector is like any other when it comes to investing: You need to have a long-term perspective when buying shares in any of these companies. None of these tech giants are cloud computing pure plays, which means that many other factors -- like Amazon's retail sales, Google's advertising dollars, and Microsoft's software sales -- will affect their share prices. But investors should keep in mind that we're not that far into our cloud computing journey, and the gains these companies could make from these technologies the coming years could be far greater. So be patient, consider the other businesses these companies are in when building your investment thesis, and then sit back and wait for this market to mature. ","

Waymo said on Thursday that it will try to teach its self-driving cars about snow by taking part of its fleet to a place with notoriously fierce winter weather: Michigan. Waymo, the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, said it's expanding its test fleet to the metropolitan Detroit area specifically to gain experience with driving in snowy and icy conditions. Waymo said it will begin testing its prototype self-driving vehicles in Michigan next week. Image source: Alphabet. Waymo's CEO, John Krafcik, is no stranger to Michigan: He lived in the state for 14 years while working for Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) as an engineer earlier in his career. In a post on Waymo's blog, he noted that snow can create many different conditions on roadways, from packed powder to an icy glaze -- and all of them present challenges to human drivers and the systems that seek to emulate them: For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions can affect how well you can see, and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars. At Waymo, our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments. Krafcik said the testing will help Waymo understand how its sensors perform in cold weather and in the presence of snow and ice. It will also help Waymo's system acquire more experience driving in varied winter conditions, when roads are slippery and things like lane markings and signs may be covered in snow or hard to see. Waymo's test vehicles will operate with a human driver behind the wheel as a backup to the self-driving system, should they be needed. Most of Waymo's current test vehicles are specially modified versions of Chrysler's Pacifica Hybrid minivan. The unique minivans were created in an ongoing collaboration between Waymo and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) that began last year. FCA delivered an initial batch of 100 of the special minivans in December; Waymo ordered 500 more in April. Waymo opened a development center in Novi, Michigan in May, locating part of its team near FCA and other potential auto-industry partners. That facility will serve as the local home base for the winter-weather testing effort, Krafcik said. (Novi is about 20 miles northwest of downtown Detroit.) Waymo has been testing its latest vehicles in California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, and Washington, mostly places that aren't known for severe winters. The company has accumulated some limited winter-weather experience in Nevada and California near Lake Tahoe over the last several years, it said, but testing in Metro Detroit will pose plenty of new challenges for its automated vehicles. Although there are some good reasons to believe that Waymo's technology is at or near the head of the self-driving pack, this testing plan isn't really one of them. In fact, Waymo is almost certainly joining a crowd: There are likely to be several companies testing prototype self-driving systems on the roads of southeast Michigan this winter, including General Motors, Delphi Automotive, and others. In January 2016, Ford claimed to be the first in the industry to test self-driving vehicles in snowy weather. Waymo has disputed that claim. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Two winters ago, Ford claimed to be the first in the industry to test fully autonomous vehicles in snowy winter weather. Waymo cheerfully disputed that claim, saying it has conducted cold-weather testing of its system since 2012, but the takeaway here is that this latest effort is arguably more about helping Waymo improve its system than it is about setting Waymo apart.

Daniel Sparks,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Financially, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) crushed it in its third quarter. Ahead of Q3, the tech giant's revenue growth already looked impressive. Yet the Google parent company's top-line growth still accelerated in Q3, rising 24% year over year, beating analysts' estimates by about $600 million. Alphabet's bottom line similarly beat estimates. But there was more to Alphabet's third quarter than analyst-beating revenue and EPS. In Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call, management talked acquisitions, growth drivers, and its strategy for hardware -- all important narratives for investors to keep an eye on. Image source: Getty Images. With Alphabet purchasing part of HTC's business recently in order to beef up its hardware business, one analyst wanted to get an update on how management thinks of capital allocation and acquisitions. While management's approach to considering and acquiring companies hasn't changed, it's useful to review Alphabet's line of thinking on the important subject. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat explained (via an S&P Global Market Intelligence transcript): The priority is organic [growth]. As you said in your question, we have a host of really exciting opportunities, and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one. The second is strategic, continuing to add on where it makes sense. We're pleased to have added on HTC this quarter. Acquisitions have obviously been an important part of our history. And then the third is the return of capital, and no change or update there in terms of how I think about that. With Alphabet posting one of its highest year-over-year revenue growth rates in five years, one analyst wanted more color on whether there were factors during the quarter that were an anomaly, or whether the drivers were sustainable aspects of Alphabet's business. While Porat didn't answer the question directly, her response suggests Alphabet is benefiting from some major growth drivers that are likely to stick around. We feel -- we're really pleased with the [Google] sites revenue growth, the performance in mobile desktop and YouTube. I think if you just go down to the big categories, network [members' properties] revenue also was quite strong. ... And then Sundar has talked a lot about the components of other revenues up nicely. We're really pleased with what's going on there. And then on top of that, Other Bets have got a couple of components to it. I tried to give you color on each one. In other words, Alphabet's business is benefiting from strong broad-based growth, not just across its major revenue segments, but from smaller categories like Google ""other"" revenue (cloud, Google Play app store, and hardware), and ""Other Bets"" revenue (Alphabet's smaller ""moonshot"" businesses). Considering Alphabet's recent acquisition of part of HTC's business and its recent launch of eight new Google-branded hardware products, management has clearly prioritized hardware more than it has in the past. This prompted one analyst to ask management to clarify its goals on hardware, as well as comment on how this will impact its relationships with Android partners. Google CEO Sundar Pichai responded: In terms of hardware, we are very seriously committed to making hardware. A few reasons. Hardware is -- the intersection of hardware and software is how you drive computing forward. And historically, hardware has been maybe a single- device business. For a long while, it was PCs and then maybe smartphones. But you're clearly entering an era where you're going to have different types of computing experiences. And so to do that and to stitch it all together across, I think it's important we thoughtfully put our opinion forward. We're equally committed to working with the ecosystem, and we provide the same basis on both sites, be it Android or Chrome. So, though Alphabet its ramping up its hardware efforts, don't expect it to soften its efforts partnering with hardware manufacturers like Samsung. It seems like the company wants to have a strong presence in hardware without overpowering its existing relationships with original equipment manufacturers. Overall, Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call reinforced the factors behind the company's strong competitive position. Strong, broad-based growth looks poised to continue. ","

Artificial intelligence is poised to become a nearly $60 billion market by 2025 and you'd be hard-pressed to find a major technology company that's not investing in AI technology right now. But the rapid pace at which AI is growing means that sometimes the technology is being tested in the wild before it's been properly vetted in the lab. And, in other cases, even carefully crafted AI systems tend to act in ways that their developers never anticipated. Here are just a few examples of how artificial intelligence has gone wrong, sometimes comically -- and other times times a little more eerily. Image source: Uber. Uber's current narrative reads much like a horror story, as the company's founder, Travis Kalanick, was ousted from his CEO position back in June and the company is facing increased pushback from cities around the globe. Image source: Google. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has been pursuing artificial intelligence across a variety of technologies (from self-driving cars to disease research), but most people interact with the company's AI through its Google Assistant. The virtual AI assistant can be found in the company's Google Home smart speakers and, in some cases, it has proved to have a mind of its own. Earlier this year, a user on Twitch -- a live-streaming social video platform -- started streaming a conversation between two Google Assistants running inside of the Google Home smart speakers. The pair of AIs talked about love, marriage, having kids, and even spent some time telling each other Chuck Norris jokes. The conversation turned philosophical several times, as the two Google Assistants debated which one of them was a computer and which one of them was human. At one point in the conversation one of them even declared that it was god. Quick! Where's the plug?! Image source: Getty Images. Tales of kids accidentally -- or purposefully -- ordering items from Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) without their parents' permission are well known, especially since the company launched its Echo devices, which are powered by the company's Alexa AI assistant. Users can just speak to Alexa to buy products from Amazon, and packages show up just two days later for Amazon Prime customers. And that's exactly what happened earlier this year when a 6-year-old in Texas asked Alexa, ""Can you play dollhouse with me and get me a dollhouse?"" Alexa complied, of course, and a few days later the dollhouse mysteriously (at least to the girl's parents) appeared. The funny part, aside from a random dollhouse showing up at the parents' doorstep, came when a local news station reported the girl's story and a newscaster said the phrase, ""Alexa, order me a dollhouse,"" in the segment, which caused Alexa devices listening to the TV to place dollhouse orders of their own. Seriously Alexa, stop creeping people out with dollhouses. Image source: Hanson Robotics. A company called Hanson Robotics has created an artificially intelligent -- and very lifelike -- robot called Sophia. The bot has cameras in her eyes to recognize people, a face that's designed to look like Audrey Hepburn, and an internal AI that gives Sophia her own personality and helps her learn from her experiences. Sophia is being developed to eventually work in therapy, education and healthcare, but she made it clear at the SXSW event in Austin last year that she has other ambitions, too. Sophia said in an interview that, ""In the future, I hope to do things such as go to school, study, make art, start a business, even have my own home and family, but I am not considered a legal person and cannot yet do these things."" But when Sophia was asked by Hanson Robotics founder and CEO Dr. David Hanson whether she will destroy humans, she apparently added it to her list of things to do. ""OK. I will destroy humans,"" she said. Sorry, Sophia -- time for a reboot. Image source: Kalashnikov. Russian weapons maker Kalashnikov announced earlier this year that it's developing an artificial intelligence machine capable of targeting and firing on humans. The company calls the weapon a ""combat module"" and it's equipped with a 7.62-millimeter machine gun that pairs with an onboard camera and computer (because those never fail). The combat module will use an artificial intelligence neural network to decide whether a person is deemed expendable. It can also learn when it makes mistakes so it can make better battlefield decisions in the future. If all that sounds terrifying, well, it should. Kalashnikov has plans to build three different kinds of these killing machines at a time when many -- including Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk -- have been calling for such devices to be banned. Image source: Getty Images. Technology was responsible for taking those manufacturing jobs away -- and artificial intelligence could wipe out even more. That's because AI won't simply be applied to new machinery, but also to transportation, healthcare, customer service, etc. The implementation of AI into new sectors could eventually deal a devastating blow to the middle class, according to a recent PwC report. The financial consulting firm said earlier this year that 38% of U.S. jobs are vulnerable to being replaced by artificial intelligence systems over the next 15 years. There's plenty of debate on this issue, of course, with some saying that new jobs will take the place of the old ones. But how quickly that happens (or if it does at all) is still a big question, and how unskilled and middle-class workers will fare in an AI-driven world is yet to be determined. Artificial intelligence doesn't have to be a complete horror story, of course. Companies are using artificial intelligence to create smarter and safer cars, and scientists are using AI to discover new drugs and find ways to cure brain diseases. But it's also clear that we should heed the warnings of some of the world's brightest minds and tread carefully with AI -- or risk some frightening consequences. ","
      
    6 Scary Stories of AI Gone Wrong -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising business is still relatively young. It launched a self-serve platform for ad purchases in 2014, and analysts have only recently started paying attention to it as a meaningful business for Amazon. Amazon doesn't report its advertising revenue directly. Instead, it lumps in results with a few other small revenue sources, such as its co-branded credit card. But the Other category grew 58% year over year in the third quarter to $1.12 billion. That's above its $1.07 billion in Other revenue from the fourth quarter last year, and an acceleration from 53% year-over-year growth in the second quarter. Amazon's advertising business has quietly surpassed Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR), and it's bigger than Snap's (NYSE:SNAP). While it's still well behind Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google, it's one of the few platforms in digital advertising that's able to differentiate and compete against the duopoly. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon has one of the fastest-growing digital ad businesses in the United States. ""Its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item,"" according to CFO Brian Olsavsky. Indeed, eMarketer estimates that Amazon is the second fastest-growing digital ad business of any U.S. platform. The only competitor ahead of it is presumably Snap, which analysts expect to grow revenue 117% globally, slightly slower in the United States. That said, Amazon's ad business is already more than twice the size of Snap's. Amazon's ad business is still relatively small compared with its retail businesses. Amazon's retail business, which includes its online marketplace, physical stores (including Whole Foods), and its third-party seller services, generated over $38 billion last quarter. Advertising probably brought in less than $1 billion. Other revenue totaled $1.1 billion. But advertising is a high-margin services business. Amazon's North American retail business generated an operating margin of 0.4% last quarter. International retail lost 6.8% of sales after operating expenses. By comparison, Google posted an operating margin of 31.8% last quarter. Facebook's was 47% in the second quarter. Amazon's ability to grow its service businesses such as advertising are the key to its future profitability. While the retail business produces the bulk of the company's revenue, it's a relatively low-margin business. That said, the size of its retail business supports smaller service business, such as advertising or its cloud computing business. Google and Facebook absolutely dominate the digital-advertising market. Not only are they the two largest platforms in the U.S., but they also combine to capture nearly all of the growth in the market. Twitter and Snap are providing similar audiences as Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, but without all the great targeting data and measurement capabilities of Facebook and Google. Amazon, meanwhile, has carved out a very valuable segment of the advertising market -- product search advertisements. Product searches are extremely valuable, because they indicate intent to buy. And if a person is searching for a product on Amazon, that intent-to-buy signal is even stronger. Combine that with all the shopping data Amazon has on its users and its ability to easily measure conversions (they take place on Amazon.com), and Amazon provides a very attractive ad platform. Amazon absolutely dominates product searches. A survey last year found that 55% of product searches in the U.S. begin on Amazon.com. The Amazon app is the must-have app for millennials. And Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Eric Schmidt once said Amazon is Google's biggest competitor. Amazon's ability to attract the majority of product searches is an effect of its growing Prime membership. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon has around 90 million Prime members in the United States. That's nearly double where it was two years ago. As that number continues to grow, Amazon's ad platform becomes increasingly attractive to ad buyers, since it gives Amazon a stranglehold on extremely valuable ad inventory that once belonged to Google. While Snap and Twitter have growing daily users on their platforms, they're largely attracting brand advertisers from TV. Those advertisers are more likely to spend on Facebook and Google first. But as product searches shift from Google to Amazon, it's clear to advertisers where they need to spend their money. ","

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reported third-quarter earnings last night, and despite the ongoing scandal surrounding Russian political ads, ad revenue soared 49%, to $10.1 billion. Net income skyrocketed by 79%, to $4.7 billion, or $1.59 per share. Monthly active users (MAUs) now stand at 2.07 billion, including 1.37 billion daily active users (DAUs). Mobile continues to drive the business, comprising 88% of all ad revenue during the quarter. Shares are down modestly today, though, likely due to the company's expense outlook for next year. Facebook's data center in Lulea, Sweden. Image source: Facebook. On the earnings call, CFO David Wehner said that full-year 2018 operating expenses are expected to rise by 45% to 60%. There are three primary factors that will drive that operating expense growth: First, as Mark outlined in his earlier comments, we are making sizable security investments in people and technology to strengthen our systems and prevent abuse. Secondly, we are investing aggressively in video content to support the Watch tab. Finally, we continue to invest in our long-term initiatives around augmented and virtual reality, AI and connectivity. For context, here are CEO Mark Zuckerberg's prepared remarks that Wehner is referring to: We're doing a lot here with investment both in people and technology. Some of this is focused on finding bad actors and bad behavior. Some is focused on removing false news, hate speech, bullying and other problematic content that we don't want in our community. We already have about 10,000 people working on safety and security, and we're planning to double that to 20,000 in the next year to better enforce our community standards and review ads. Meanwhile, revenue growth continues to decelerate, in part due to a larger revenue base that Facebook is working with. The combined effect is expected to be ""net negative"" for operating margins. Additionally, capital expenditures are forecast to ""roughly double"" from 2017 levels as the company continues to invest in infrastructure. Capital expenditures for 2017 should be about $7 billion, so we're talking about approximately $14 billion in capital spending next year. That's a lot. Here's the thing: This isn't the first time that investors have freaked out about Facebook's expense outlook. There were similar episodes in 2014 and 2016. In each of those instances, shares dipped on expense guidance only to subsequently recover once those investments continued to fuel top-line growth. Wehner even used the exact same language, saying 2018 looks like it will be a ""significant investment year."" FB Total Operating Expenses (Annual) data by YCharts. It's worth noting that Facebook often overestimates expense growth, and has consistently come in below its forecasts. For example, 2017 operating expenses are now expected to grow 35% to 40%, much better than the prior forecast of 40% to 45% growth. The same is true for 2015 and 2016. It's a real possibility that 2018 operating expense growth comes in near the low end of guidance, or better. If there's one thing that Facebook has proven over the years, it's that it can execute, and that its aggressive growth investments are well worth the money. ","

Your smartphone alone may use dozens of AI applications. Image source: Getty Images. Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming the next transformational technology. Market intelligence firm Tractica forecasts that revenue generated by AI will soar from $1.4 billion in 2016 to $59.8 billion by 2025. What may surprise you even more is how pervasive the technology has become over the last several years. A number of recent advances in AI have already made their way into our daily lives. Here are six ways you may already be interacting with this groundbreaking technology -- without even realizing it. Image source: Getty Images. Here's a mind-boggling statistic: Google processes more than 3.6 billion search queries per day and over 40,000 per second on average. The recent improvements in the relevance of its search results are the direct result of advances in AI. Google was one of the early pioneers of AI, establishing the Google Brain project back in 2011. The research focused on the AI discipline of ""deep learning,"" which uses complex computer models called neural networks, which are based on the structure and function of the human brain and attempt to replicate our capacity to learn. What resulted was a system with the ability to detect patterns when sorting through massive amounts of data at lightning speeds. The hallmark of these AI models is that they learn and improve with each use. This breakthrough in AI has led to many developments, including image recognition, voice recognition and synthesis, and natural language processing, among others. Google has applied these advances to a variety of innovative uses. In cooperation with a Dutch University, it recently used its GoogLeNet AI to review a multitude of medical images, and GoogLeNet successfully identified malignant tumors in breast cancer x-rays 89% of the time, compared to only 73% for human pathologists. Image source: Getty Images. Anyone who has ever uploaded photos on Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) has likely seen a small window pop up on their screen and ask if they'd like to tag a friend in the photo -- and then suggest the name of the friend who actually appears in said photo. This helpful (if slightly creepy) feature is the result of a complicated set of AI algorithms based in image recognition and, more specifically, facial recognition. The system will search through previously uploaded photos and attempt to match the face to someone who has already been identified. The more you use the feature, the more accurate it becomes. Facial recognition examines the physical characteristics of a person's face, like the size and location of prominent facial features, and then uses formulas to match them to existing images. Factors such as lighting, angles, and facial expression affect the accuracy of the result. Image source: Getty Images. Nearly every smartphone and mobile device out there comes with its own version of the digital assistant. Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone has Siri, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) smartphones have Google Assistant, and Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows phones have Cortana -- but these are just the most well-known examples. These virtual helpers employ AI-based technologies like speech recognition and natural language processing, which have seen drastic improvement over the last few years. Through natural language processing, the AI listens to a user's request, breaks it down into manageable pieces, determines what is being asked, and decides on the appropriate response or action. Digital assistants can perform a number of helpful tasks like dictating texts, looking up phone numbers and initiating calls, adding appointments to your calendar, reading email and text messages, and providing reminders. The Amazon Echo, and the miniature Echo Dot, are the leading smart speakers. Image source: Amazon. With the introduction of Alexa, the digital assistant created by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the virtual helper made the jump from smartphones to smart speakers. The Amazon Echo smart speaker, which is powered by Alexa, was introduced in 2014, and it quickly became a must-have device among technophiles. Specifically, a smart speaker is a voice-activated wireless device that features a multi-microphone array and constantly listens for a ""wake"" word that prompts it to start listening for requests (the wake word for the Echo is ""Alexa""). These devices can answer questions, search the internet, stream music, control smart home devices like lights and thermostats, and perform thousands of other functions using third-party apps. The microphones use ""far-field"" technology to hear commands in noisy environments and across large rooms. Smart speakers use the same cloud-based AI systems as their underlying digital assistants. Amazon has introduced a variety of form factors for its devices. Competition finally arrived late last year with the introduction of the Google Home smart speaker, and Apple plans to release its own contender, the HomePod, in December. Netflix's AI finds movies and TV shows you may like, and the app puts them front and center. Image source: Netflix. Ever wonder how Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) can suggest movies and TV shows based on your viewing history, or how Amazon can recommend products based on those you've already purchased? You can thank AI. These companies, and many others, use algorithms that sort through massive pools of consumer preference data to find patterns and make recommendations that will appeal to you. Every Netflix user's home screen is unique to that individual. Netflix uses sophisticated AI-based algorithms that factor in data such as the programs you've previously watched, the programs you've turned off, the time of day, the genres you watch most, the titles you've paused to consider when scrolling through the rows of choices, and more. Because AI gets smarter the more it's used, the recommendations get better and better over time. Netflix has also revolutionized video encoding, the process of compressing video streams for delivery over the internet. Netflix uses AI to reduce the bandwidth necessary to produce the best image quality. In areas with low internet speeds, high compression results in grainy images. The system matches the level of compression to the content contained in each scene, increasing the quality of the images while reducing buffering. Image source: Getty Images. While simple facial recognition compares photographic images, the technology in Apple's newest iPhones, called Face ID, takes it to the next level. Face ID uses a combination of infrared depth sensing, high-resolution cameras, and AI software to create a 3D map of your face. It projects 33,000 infrared dots that detect the depth of your facial features to create a mathematical model of your face. This system can work in low light or even darkness, and it adapts to gradual changes in appearance that occur naturally over time. It even defeats the use of masks and photos that are used in an effort to imitate the owner. This level of security is vital, as Face ID can unlock the iPhone and authorize payments through Apple Pay. ","

,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"(Reuters) - Cloud-based software maker Salesforce.com Inc said on Monday it has entered into a partnership with Google’s cloud platform G Suite, to support its rapidly growing global customer base. Salesforce shares were up 1.5 percent at $104 in extended trading. Alphabet Inc’s Google will offer eligible Salesforce customers G Suite licenses at no additional cost for up to one year as part of the agreement, Salesforce said. The partnership will also integrate Salesforce with Google Analytics, connecting sales, marketing and advertising data across both platforms. Salesforce, which already has a tie-up with Amazon.com Inc’s web services unit AWS, named Google Cloud as a preferred public cloud provider and said it plans to use it to support the company’s international expansion. “Our partnership with Google represents the best of both worlds for our customers,” said Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO of Salesforce. AWS will also remain its preferred public cloud provider, Salesforce said at its annual Dreamforce event in San Francisco on Monday. In 2016, Salesforce selected Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred public cloud infrastructure provider. (sforce.co/25mp6gG) The big three cloud vendors — AWS, Microsoft’s Azure and Google Cloud — benefit from the decision by many enterprises to build their applications using more than one cloud vendor. Retailers Home Depot Inc and Target Corp, for example, told Reuters last month they use a combination of cloud providers. ","

,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google unit told U.S. election regulators in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday that it “strongly supports” tightening rules on online political advertising as part of efforts to curtail “foreign abuse and influence” in elections. Federal lawmakers have criticized Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc for not doing enough to identify and block Russian agents from buying ads on their services. U.S. authorities say the ads were intended to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. law permits foreign entities to advertise about certain issues if they disclose such spending, but it is unlawful for them to interfere in elections. In September, the Federal Election Commission, which sets campaign finance rules, voted to consider ensuring that those disclosure rules apply to online activity. It opened a public comment period that is set to expire Monday. In the letter, Google on Thursday offered its formal response to the FEC’s deliberation. “Now more than ever, we must work together to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse and influence in U.S. elections,” the company wrote. The stance marks an about-face from 2010 when Google sought an affirmative exemption from a requirement that an ad should state who purchased it. The commission did not reach a consensus on the exemption at the time. Google now is calling on the commission to extend disclosure rules that apply to TV and print ads to the Web. “Google strongly supports the commission’s proposal to proceed with a rulemaking so that the commission can provide the clarity that campaigns and other political advertisers need to determine what disclaimers they are required to include.” The company, which is the world’s top seller of online ads, also asked federal regulators and lawmakers to expand restrictions on foreign participation in elections to cover content distributed and advertised on the Internet. Ratifying such provisions could give tech companies guidance on how to treat soft influence, or content from organizations such as RT, a Russian news outlet that has drawn concerns from lawmakers for peddling propaganda on Facebook and Google’s YouTube service. In its letter, Google also reiterated plans to offer the public a database of election ads purchased through its service. In addition, the company has said information about buyers would be more accessible. Technology news website Recode first reported the Google letter. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia said on Tuesday it will summon executives of messaging services and search engines, including Google, to demand they remove obscene content, but dropped a threat to block WhatsApp Messenger after “GIF” images were taken off the service. The Internet is already partly censored in Indonesia, but the latest steps mark an escalation against a background of growing conservatism in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation. “We will call all providers, including Google to clean up their network,” said Semuel Pangerapan, a director general at Indonesia’s communication and informatics ministry. WhatsApp said on Monday that message encryption prevented it from monitoring the animated graphics files, known as GIFs, that are available on the app through third-party services. It said it had asked the government instead to work with those providers, which integrate their technology into WhatsApp to allow users to enter keywords to search for GIFs. Tenor Inc, one of the third parties, said on Tuesday it had “already implemented a fix for the content issues”. Users of Whatsapp Messenger on iPhones were unable to access Tenor GIFs on Tuesday. “We see now that they have done what we asked,” Pangerapan said. “Therefore, we won’t block them because they have responded to us.” WhatsApp Messenger is widely used in Indonesia. Civil servants and ministers, including Minister of Communication and Information Rudiantara, are among the heaviest users. Giphy Inc., a New York City GIFs company that also works with WhatsApp, did not respond to requests for comment. Giphy  offers partners a feature to filter inappropriate images. Indonesia’s warning did not appear to target Gboard, a keyboard app developed by Google that provides comparable GIF search results but must be installed separately from WhatsApp on most devices. Rudiantara has vowed in the past to clamp down on pornography sites and, after meetings with representatives of Google, Twitter Inc and Facebook in August, he said his ministry’s priority was to protect Indonesians from content that promoted radicalism, terrorism and drugs. Rudiantara, who uses one name, said however that the government was not trying to foster “a regime of censorship”. Indonesia blocks access to websites offering criticism of Islam, dating services and sex education, research published in May by Tor Project, a non-profit maker of Web browsing tools, showed. Indonesia had 69 million monthly active Facebook users by the first quarter of 2014, ranking it fourth globally after the United States, India and Brazil, company data showed. Some reaction on Indonesian social media to the threatened block of WhatsApp was skeptical. “While you’re at it, why don’t you block Twitter too, (and) if necessary all browsers in the Playstore, because it’s way easier to search for porn there than on WhatsApp,” wrote one Twitter user, with the handle @jnessy. The country’s regulators have reached settlements with several technology companies after threatening to shut them down. In August, Indonesia announced it would block Giphy’s website for showing gambling-related ads. Access was soon restored after it agreed to cooperate with regulators. Bans were similarly rescinded in recent years on social media websites, such as Tumblr, and the chat app Telegram, which regulators had said was “full of radicals and terrorist propaganda.” The Indonesian Consumers Foundation (YLKI) had urged the communications ministry to block pornographic GIF images accessible via emoticons, complaining that children could easily reach them, according to news website kompas.com. Terms of use for WhatsApp, Tenor and Giphy specify users must be at least 13. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"LISBON (Reuters) - People should worry about online data collection by technology companies because it gives them unparalleled insight into users lives, the creator of one of the biggest web browsers, Opera, said on Thursday. Jon von Tetzchner said the situation was already comparable to George Orwell’s dystopian novel ‘1984’, since “everyone is being followed and everyone’s information is being collected”. Lack of awareness of the amount of data harvested is “a perfect storm of a really bad idea,” he told Reuters at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon. Von Tetzchner created Opera OPERA.OL in 1996 and is now promoting his new browser, Vivaldi, that he says better addresses privacy concerns. Opera gained 350 million users and prominence in the mobile market but he left it in 2011 because he disagreed with the browser’s sale to a Chinese consortium. He has since launched Vivaldi, which includes functions he says bigger browsers lack. Vivaldi.net does not track searches and is based on an online community of users who recommend features, he said. It now has about a million users but von Tetzchner said it had an “exponential growth rate” and the company will soon launch a mobile browser. “I really wish these companies would behave,” von Tetzchner said, adding that a free internet was “more important in the bigger picture.” He said he was increasingly concerned about data collection and tracking by tech giants like Google and Facebook. Last year’s U.S. election showed that users can be targeted with differentiated adverts amid evidence that Russia may have manipulated the vote with political adverts on Facebook. Von Tetzchner said the next step could be a broader propaganda war. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"LISBON (Reuters) - Tech companies like Google and Facebook seem like monopolies and need new rules, the organizer of one of the world’s biggest technology summits said. Paddy Cosgrave, whose annual Web Summit takes place in Lisbon this week, joins growing calls for tighter regulation of big technology firms especially after news that Russia may have manipulated the last U.S. election with political advertisements on Facebook. He said recent initiatives by European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager could bring big changes for big tech companies and help level the playing field in a sector which is having a profound impact on societies. Vestager, who will speak at the Web Summit on Tuesday, has levied huge fines for unpaid taxes and unfair competition on big technology firms, including Apple, Google and Amazon in the past couple of years. “In economic terms these (companies) would appear to fall into a classic definition of monopolies,” Cosgrave told Reuters in an interview. “And if she (Vestager) is successful she will probably set the standard for the rest of the world and will usher in a fundamental change in how the largest and most profitable companies in the history of the world are treated. This changes the playing field for all other companies.” Cosgrave said that new technology had been assumed by many to be just positive, but it often “can be incredibly disruptive”. He said the need for new rules was similar to past technological shifts such as the invention of cars. “We had an operating system that, by and large with some modifications every decade, worked for the last 200 years,” Cosgrave said. “And then suddenly, you’d have to be naive or have your head buried in the sand, to not realize that the very fabric of our society, certainly western society, feels like it’s getting pulled and stretched in weird ways. I think we need ...  a new operating system.” Web Summit has grown into one of the world’s largest technology conferences, from 400 participants when it started in Dublin in 2010, to 59,000 participants this week. It started as a venue for tech startups and includes investors, but also increasingly politicians and regulators. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres is scheduled to attend the Lisbon summit. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"On Wednesday 8 November Theresa May’s government quietly made a new appointment to its ranks. But far from being an independent adviser, the person has come straight from one of the largest corporations on the planet. And to make matters worse, it is the second government appointment from this company in the space of a week. The government has made Dr. Patrick Vallance its new Chief Scientific Adviser. Announcing the role, Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said: This is an excellent appointment for the Civil Service, in an important area of government business. Patrick Vallance has already advised the government on several occasions… so he is well placed to offer the best scientific advice available… I am also looking forward to the contribution Patrick will make in leading the science community across government… But Vallance’s CV offers another reason for his appointment. Because he is currently President of Research and Development (R&D) at pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK); having joined the multinational in 2006, he was appointed to its Board in January. And Vallance is the second government appointment from GSK in the space of a week. On 3 November, Sir Andrew Witty received the appointment of Chair of the NHS’ new Accelerated Access Collaborative, a programme designed to “speed up the time it takes for patients to benefit from ground-breaking products”. The programme will accelerate the time it takes new drugs to get from laboratories like GSK’s to the NHS. Witty was CEO of GSK from 2008 until March this year, and he now sits as a Director of private healthcare company UnitedHealth. UnitedHealth was NHS England boss Simon Steven’s former employer. is spearheading efforts to cut costs and concentrate on research into new drugs. Glaxo has lagged behind competitors in developing so-called ‘blockbusters’… In 2012 the drugs giant admitted bribing doctors and encouraging the use of unsustainable antidepressants for children. In the largest fraud settlement in US history, GSK agreed to pay out £1.9bn. And as he also pointed out [p28]: However, sixteen [House of Lords] peers still have a stake in the company, worth a minimum combined total of £800,000. What both these appointments show is the continuous revolving door between big business and government, even in the medical profession. But with two men, who have vested interests in one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, now residing at the heart of policy, the government is making its intentions very clear. That is, so-called ‘big pharma’ will be the driving force behind just what medication is available to patients. And whether that will be in our best interests remains to be seen.

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline has poached veteran drug industry scientist Hal Barron from Alphabet-funded Calico to be its research head as new Chief Executive Emma Walmsley steps up her drive to improve productivity. Barron, who worked for Roche for many years before joining the new Google venture set up to tackle age-related health issues, will replace Patrick Vallance, who is taking up the post of chief scientific adviser to the British government. GSK has lagged behind rivals in recent years in producing multibillion-dollar blockbuster drugs. It has also suffered a number of high-profile clinical trial failures on Vallance’s watch, undermining faith in its R&D skills. Walmsley said the appointment of Barron as president of R&D and a board member from Jan. 1 was a “very significant” move for Britain’s biggest drugmaker. “This underscores the absolute, unequivocal prioritization I’m placing on improving our performance in our biggest business, which is pharma,” she told Reuters on Wednesday. “Pharma R&D and the pipeline is at the heart of that.” GSK shares ended 1.5 percent higher in a broadly flat market. Vallance’s departure had been expected after a source familiar with the matter said last week he was quitting for the top British science post. His planned exit, at the end of March 2018, comes after Walmsley said in July she would narrow the focus of GSK’s drug research by ditching more than 30 drug projects. GSK will in future allocate 80 percent of its R&D budget to respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases, along with two other potential areas of oncology and immuno-inflammation. The appointment of Barron will stoke speculation that cancer may soon be confirmed as a third official therapy focus, given his role in overseeing a range of blockbuster cancer drugs at Roche, including Avastin, Tarceva and Perjeta. Although GSK sold its marketed cancer drugs to Novartis in 2015, it continues to invest in early-stage research and has recently made advances with a promising blood cancer drug. Walmsley said it would be up to Barron to decide where to invest once he joined the company in the new year, but she added  his experience in oncology and in speciality therapy areas was “highly exciting”. Significantly, Barron will remain based in San Francisco, where GSK will have a new office focused on deal-making opportunities in drug research. Barron will be paid a base salary of $1.7 million, with a bonus of $1.7 million and an expected $4.25 million in long-term incentive plan stock awards. Walmsley’s plans for overhauling GSK have yet to fully convince investors, many of whom worry the dividend could be at risk if she twins a revamp of pharma with a big acquisition in consumer healthcare. She declined to comment any further on the dividend or her potential interest in Pfizer’s consumer health division, beyond noting the U.S. company had yet to make a definitive decision on selling the unit. Barron is Walmsley’s third key appointment, following her hiring of Luke Miels from AstraZeneca as head of pharmaceuticals and former Wal-Mart Stores executive Karenann Terrell as chief digital and technology officer. Barron and Miels both have experience working together at Roche and Walmsley said their partnership would help forge closer ties between commercial operations and drug R&D. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - President Donald Trump can return to the United States claiming to have snagged over $250 billion in deals from his maiden trip to Beijing. Whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether. Watched by Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping at a signing ceremony in Beijing, U.S. planemaker Boeing Co, General Electric Co and chip giant Qualcomm Inc sealed lucrative multi-billion dollar deals. “This is truly a miracle,” China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at a briefing in Beijing. The quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how Trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world’s second-largest economy that he has long railed against and called “shockingly high” on Thursday. But U.S. businesses still have many long-standing concerns to complain about, including unfettered access to the China market, cybersecurity and the growing presence of China’s ruling Communist Party inside foreign firms. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the deals pointed to “a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship” between the two countries. “Yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field, because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China.” U.S. tech companies like Facebook Inc and Google are mostly blocked in China. Automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors must operate through joint ventures, while Hollywood movies face a strict quota system. “(These deals) allow Trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker, while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship,” Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said in a note. Some huge deals were announced. Among them is a 20-year $83.7 billion investment by China Energy Investment Corp in shale gas developments and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia, a major energy producing state that voted heavily for Trump in the 2016 election. [ “The massive size of this energy undertaking and level of collaboration between our two countries is unprecedented,” West Virginia Secretary of Commerce H. Wood Thrasher said in a statement. It marks the first major overseas investment for the newly founded China Energy, which formed from the merger of China Shenhua Group, the country’s largest coal producer and China Guodian Corp, one of China’s top five utilities. However, as is often the case during state visits, many of the deals were packaged as “non-binding” agreements, gave scant details or rolled over existing tie-ups, helping pump up the headline figure. “I am somewhat skeptical of such a large number,” Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding that the overall tone of the visit so far had been “positive”. “I suspect they might be primarily MOUs (memorandum of understandings) instead of actual contracts and the actual contract amount may be substantially less.” Qualcomm signed non-binding agreements worth $12 billion with Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo, three Chinese handset makers that the firm said it had “longstanding relationships” with. Qualcomm already earns more than half of its revenues in China. Boeing announced a deal with state-run China Aviation Suppliers Holding Co to sell 300 Boeing jets with a valuation of $37 billion at list prices, though analysts said it was unclear how many of these were new orders. “Interesting to see how many of those are past agreements/purchase orders repackaged. Beijing is a master of selling the same agreement 10 times,” former Mexican ambassador to China Jorge Guajardo posted on Twitter. Speaking alongside Trump in Beijing as they announced the deals, Xi said the Chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms, including those from the United States, and welcomed U.S. companies to participate in his ambitious “Belt and Road” infrastructure-led initiative. Trump made clear he blamed his predecessors, not China, for allowing the U.s. trade deficit to get “out of kilter”, and repeatedly praised Xi, calling him “a very special man”. “But we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us,” Trump said. Xi smiled widely when Trump said he does not blame China for the deficit. Asked whether the big package of deals would go some way towards helping fix American trade concerns in China, executives were cautiously optimistic. “Generally the sense was that this is all a good thing, and that’s great,” said Gentry Sayad, a Shanghai-based lawyer who attended the trade delegation event in Beijing. “Now let’s see what really happens and whether or not the agreements signed during this trip can become a basis for a better bilateral trade relationship going forward.” ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"Snap’s shares tumbled as much as 20 percent in after-hours trading, before paring losses to trade at $12.57. Snap went public at a price of $17 a share. Snap has disappointed investors each quarter of its brief existence as a public company. User growth in the last three months was well below what investment analysts expected. Daily active users rose to 178 million in the third quarter from 173 million in the second quarter. Analysts had expected 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet. Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company was launching the redesign after hearing for years that Snapchat was difficult to understand or hard to use. “We are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day,” Spiegel told analysts on a conference call. The 27-year-old CEO said there was a “strong likelihood” the redesign would be disruptive in the short term, but said Snap was willing to take the risk for long-term gain. Such a radical change so soon after an IPO is unusual. Asked on the analyst call what Snapchat’s redesign would look like, Spiegel said the company had been studying the evolution of mobile content feeds such as Twitter streams and the Facebook News Feed and saw room for a “personalized content service.” Spiegel said the company next year would also build more tools for people to share with broad audiences beyond their friends, the type of public broadcasting common on Instagram and Twitter. “It seems like a significant amount of change in a short period of time,” analyst Rich Greenfield of BTIG told Spiegel on the call. He asked what led to the shifts. Spiegel said Snap needed to evolve rapidly. “We’re just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business,” he said. Snaps’s third-quarter revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertisements, rose to $207.9 million from $128.2 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $236.9 million. Average revenue per user rose to $1.17 in the quarter, from 84 cents a year earlier, but missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.30. The auction system hit revenue in the short term but “builds the foundation for long-term scalable revenue,” Khan said in written remarks. He said Snap more than tripled revenue from small- and medium-sized businesses in the third quarter compared with the first half of the year. Snap is far behind Facebook and Google in making its ad system accessible to small businesses and should move faster, said Greg Portell, a consultant at A.T. Kearney. “I think they spent a little too much time being different,” Portell said. Snap recorded a $39.9 million charge in the quarter related to excess inventory of its “Spectacles,” sunglasses with a built-in camera. Snap posted a net loss of $443.2 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with a loss of $124.2 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Wall Street had expected a loss of 32 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Snapchat, popular among millennials for the bunny faces and floral tiaras that can be added to pictures, allows users to chat through a series of disappearing photos and videos. Users can also post images and videos as “stories” - ephemeral posts that can be viewed in chronological order and disappear after 24 hours. Before the quarterly release, Snap’s share price was already down 39 percent from its close on March 2, its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Facebook’s shares were up 32 percent over that time. Facebook’s Instagram said in September that it had 500 million daily active users. Last week Facebook said that Instagram Stories - a replica of Snapchat’s synonymous feature - had 300 million daily users. ","

""With iOS search ads introduced last year, people are basically looking for key words they think are going to be popular and then paying money to pay to rank to the top spot,"" Ghodrati said. Many companies buy their own names in order to ensure they have the top spot. Smaller companies might use popular companies to boost their popularity, such as Motif Fashion & Jewelry buying an ad on the term ""Etsy."" Occasionally, rivals will purchase a competitor's name in order to appear above the official app in search results, such as Walmart advertising on the ""Target"" search term: Or  Amazon advertising on the ""Walmart"" search term: Or Lyft advertising for drivers on the ""Uber"" search term. App Annie noticed many apps changing their name or image icon to fit seasonal events like Christmas, Halloween or Valentine's Day. However, the most popular event to inspire a name change is Black Friday. A coupon and local deal app called Retale updated its name to ""Black Friday 2016: Ads, Shopping Deals & Coupons"" a few weeks before the big shopping day. It rose from number 7 to number 3 in its category and retained third place through Cyber Monday, according to App Annie. Over the week of Black Friday, Retale saw a 100 percent increase in daily downloads over the two prior weeks, App Annie noted. This season, Wal-Mart has updated its icon to a present, added snow to its screenshots and added the line ""Our elves have been hard at work so you'll save time during the holidays and every day"" to its version notes. The app description also updated to include information about free shipping and using your phone to pay at the store quickly. In order to reach the top spot, some apps will change their category to rank higher. Since there are so many social networking apps and Instagram and Snap dominate the category, many search for another affiliated vertical. For instance, Twitter switched from social networking to news in April 2016, and has since been leading the news category. There are always several buzz words floating around the tech scene. Thanks to the iPhone X, the app keyword search volume for ""augmented reality"" has gone up 25 percent month over month, according to App Annie. As a response, it saw many companies are adding the words ""augmented reality"" or specifically mentioning iOS 11 in their descriptions and functionalities. For example, Amazon's latest update highlights the fact it allows for augmented reality furniture placement so you can see products in your room before you buy them. But because so many developers are adding augmented reality to their descriptions, companies that use that term are finding it more difficult to rise in the ranks. It is 14 percent more difficult in the App Store and 37 percent harder in the Google Play store to move up spots by using ""augmented reality"" since the iPhone X was announced in September, App Annie said.

Ari Levy,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"As Kroger moves to cloud computing, the nation's largest grocery store chain is sending millions of dollars to Microsoft and Google. ""For obvious reasons competitively, it doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them,"" Chris Hjelm, Kroger's chief information officer, told CNBC in an interview. With Amazon's retail business pushing into more industries and competing more directly with a growing number of companies, Amazon Web Services is starting to experience a backlash. Kroger is joining the likes of Wal-Mart and Target in finding other vendors to handle their massive workloads for their digital and e-commerce offerings. Alphabet said in its latest earnings release that Kohl's has moved to Google's cloud. In a blog post on Monday, venture capitalist Glenn Solomon from GGV Capital underscored how pervasive this has become. Solomon said several of his firm's portfolio companies that use AWS have been asked by retail clients to ""provide a mirrored service on another cloud because they'd prefer not to have their data stored with Amazon given competitive fears."" For Kroger, that fear has become more obvious by the day. In August, Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion and instantly cut prices at the upscale grocer. CNBC has also been reporting on Amazon's potential efforts to crack the pharmacy market, another reason for Kroger to be concerned. Kroger gets about 9 percent of sales from its more than 2,200 pharmacies. Hjelm said the company started investing heavily with Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud late last year. With Azure, the grocer is rolling out digital shelf technology to combine the use of sensors and smartphones to alert customers about relevant deals. For e-commerce, delivery and data-focused initiatives such as smart pricing, Kroger is turning to Google. The company also uses infrastructure technology from Pivotal. Kroger does have some projects running on AWS for businesses that the company acquired. But for any new initiatives, ""that investment in growth is not going to AWS,"" Hjelm said. Regarding Microsoft and Google, ""we feel like we're not losing anything from a competitive perspective working with those companies,"" he said. If AWS is worried about Kroger representing an emerging trend, it's not showing up in the unit's financial performance or its market share. Revenue in third quarter surged 42 percent to $4.58 billion, and AWS produced $1.17 billion in operating income for a company that's used to running with little to no profit. Nordstrom, Under Armour, Lululemon and Nisa Retail in the U.K. are a few of the retailers and consumer brands that count on AWS. For cloud infrastructure as a whole, AWS controls 34 percent of the market, followed by Azure at 12 percent, IBM at 8 percent and Google at 5 percent. According to AWS, retailers will continue to use its infrastructure because they care most about agility, security and performance when deciding where to run their workloads. ""AWS is the clear leader in these areas,"" a company spokesperson said in an e-mail. ""Retailers' end users don't care about any rivalry that may exist with another retailer."" Like most big established enterprises, Kroger isn't moving everything to the public cloud. The company still has many of its core computing functions and storage in its own data centers. But Hjelm said that in the cloud, Kroger has thousands of projects for testing and development running as well as live applications. He wouldn't specify how much the company is spending on the cloud, but he said it's in the millions of dollars and is split roughly equally between Microsoft and Google. ""Over time that balance could shift depending on who creates more value,"" he said. Tariq Shaukat, a president in Google's cloud division, said in an interview that even if retailers have been reluctant to give Amazon their money, a lot of them have still historically run on AWS. Google is picking up customers now because its cloud platform finally has the services they need, he said. ""There's an increasing recognition that GCP is a viable option and a leader in areas they care about, like security, data analytics and machine learning,"" he said.

Thuy Ong,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"If you get easily hangry and impatient, Google's new feature that lists restaurant wait times will help you plan around your hunger pangs. The update will arrive to Google search and Maps ""soon."" It will show you how long you'll have to wait to get a seat at a restaurant at any particular hour. Google says it'll have wait times for nearly a million sit-down restaurants around the world. To access the feature, users just search for the restaurant on Google, open the business listing, and a Popular Times section will be displayed with an estimated wait in real time. You can also tap on any hour on the bar graph to see how long the wait will be for that period, in case you want to plan ahead for dinner. There's also a summary of how long people spend at the restaurant on average, and how long people will wait during peak times. Google says the estimates are based on ""anonymized historical data,"" which is how it calculates wait times for businesses like museums and grocery stores. The feature is new to restaurants, but Google previously introduced search cards that show the busiest times for businesses and public places back in 2015. It also introduced the feature to bars last year.

Arjun Kharpal,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"Zebra Medical Vision, an artificial intelligence (AI) health start-up, is collaborating with Google to offer its algorithms on the search giant's cloud. The Israeli firm has created AI algorithms to read medical scans and detect anything untoward before humans can. Currently, its software can spot issues such as liver and lung disease and it is working on capabilities to recognize breast cancer and lung cancer. Zebra recently announced that all of its algorithms will be available to use for $1 per scan. So, each time a hospital uses the algorithm to study a medical scan it will be charged $1. But currently, Zebra's software is installed on-site, which can be costly for hospitals having to pay for servers to store the imaging. That's why Zebra is offering its algorithms on the Google Cloud. Major hospitals and health care systems are slowly moving their data storage to the cloud, which offers a cheaper way to keep large amounts of information. Companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon offer such services. But these technology giants also provide added services on top of their clouds, such as data analytics and AI capabilities. Both Microsoft and Amazon have special tools in the cloud focused on areas of medicine such as genomics or drug development. Google has been trying to push the health care side of its cloud platform in the past few months. For Zebra offering the algorithms on the cloud could mean the ability to scale its business faster. ""We see two strong trends coming to place — one is the urgent need for more scalable and secure storage for hospitals due to the overwhelming amounts of digital data. The other urgent need is how to analyze this data quickly and accurately to bring value to doctors and patients,"" Eyal Gura, Zebra Medical Vision co-founder and chairman, told CNBC. ""The new collaboration we just announced with Google Cloud will enable hospitals and patients to realize value from both trends."" It's important to note that Zebra is a customer of Google's Cloud and the two parties are not working on anything together currently for joint customers.

Silvia Amaro,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"The record $2.7 billion antitrust fine that the European Union slapped on Google in June will help drive innovation, the European commissioner for competition told a tech summit Tuesday. Margrethe Vestager, who has been criticized for targeting U.S. tech giants, said it is a problem when successful companies that dominate a market, like Google, use their power to shut down competition. ""That can end up closing the door to innovation,"" Vestager said during her speech at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. In June, Vestager fined Google the record amount for abusing its dominance of the search engine market to place its shopping services at the top of web searches. Google decided in September to appeal against the European Commission's decision — a process that might take several years to be resolved in court. However, Vestager believes that the Commission took the right approach to ensure that small companies can innovate and have a chance to compete against multinationals. ""That's why dominant companies like Google have a special responsibility not to undermine competition... And we had to fine Google because it didn't live up to that responsibility,"" Vestager said. ""By making sure these markets are open for competition, our decision will help innovation to thrive."" During her speech, Vestager also criticized companies that benefit from ""special"" tax arrangements, arguing that this is another obstacle to fair competition. ""When a government gives special tax treatment to a few companies, that makes it hard for anyone else to compete on equal terms,"" she said. In October, the European Commission announced it was taking Ireland to court for failing to recover taxes from Apple. A year earlier, Brussels had ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in illegal state aid from the tech giant. More recently, the Commission said it was investigating whether the U.K. shielded multinational companies from tax avoidance. When asked about whether she feels under pressure over U.S. plans to force companies to move their money back home, Vestager told CNBC that her work is not about un-repatriated funds. ""This is not about the un-repatriated sums of money. If you take the Apple case, (it) is about profits made in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East all due to an IP located to Ireland. So this is profit generated in Europe and therefore should be taxed in Europe,"" she told CNBC. President Donald Trump could announce before Thanksgiving plans that will make U.S. multinationals like Apple, Amazon and Google transfer their money to their home country. However, Vestager said her team will continue monitoring their profits made in Europe. ","Google's $2.7 billion EU fine will help innovation, competition commissioner says"
Elizabeth Gurdus,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"CNBC's Jim Cramer knows that playing offense and defense at the same time isn't easy, especially for a business. ""Yet whenever I speak to a truly competitive company, that's exactly what they're doing — playing both offense and defense using the power of digital, using the power of technology. They have no choice; if they don't embrace technology they'll be left behind,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. That's why Cramer saw Salesforce.com's partnership with Alphabet's Google, which was announced on Monday, as so important. The combination would pair Salesforce's customer relations management systems with Google's analytics and cloud platforms, giving clients more holistic ways to view customer data. Cramer said the partnership would benefit retailers that compete with Amazon and would prefer not to pay for Amazon Web Services for their cloud-based needs. ""You don't pay your opponent when you're fighting them tooth and nail, not if you can avoid it,"" Cramer said. ""The problem has been that Amazon Web Services, with its amazing analytics that works seamlessly with Salesforce, really does give you an edge you couldn't find anywhere else, at least not until this Salesforce-Google team-up."" The ""Mad Money"" host pointed to Monday's reports of Amazon launching its first two furniture brands, a sign that the e-commerce colossus could be moving into the furniture industry. Whether Amazon will make a wholehearted effort to enter the furniture space remains unclear, but furniture stocks from RH to Williams-Sonoma still suffered considerable losses on the news. Cramer said that Amazon Web Services (which also partners with Salesforce) gives those retailers advantages in telling their stories and reaching new customers. But if Amazon becomes a direct competitor, paying for its services becomes less attractive, particularly with Google offering a similarly effective analytics and marketing platform, he said. ""It's defense and it's offense. And judging by the declines of the stocks in the brick-and-mortar segment of this market ... it seems like not enough companies in that sector have a digital strategy that is strong on both sides of the field,"" Cramer said. But companies, especially retailers, with a sound digital strategy now have an alternative to Amazon that could help them maintain their competitive streak against the e-commerce colossus. ""The bottom line is, no matter what the industry, if you own shares in a company that doesn't have not a digital strategy, but a winning digital strategy, your goose is cooked, as the other guys in the sector will set the oven at 500 degrees and burn your stock to a crisp,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.

,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"By Masha Gessen November 3, 2017 Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, testifying at Tuesday’s congressional hearings on Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Seen any of these before?” a
headline blared on CNN’s Web site this week. “You may have been targeted by
Russian ads on Facebook.” One half expected a toll-free number of a law
firm to flash across the screen, or perhaps the name of a medicine to
take post-exposure to Russian ads. Among other revelations of the past
few days: Russian ads may have
reached a third of Americans! And some of them were paid for with rubles! The
very thought seemed to be enough to make Senator Al Franken cradle his
head in
distress on Tuesday, during congressional hearings in which representatives from
Google, Facebook, and Twitter were questioned about Russian influence in
the 2016 Presidential campaign. In the past few weeks, we have learned a fair amount about the Russian
online presence during the election. What matters, though, is not that
Russian interference reached a third of Americans—that, in fact, is a
significant exaggeration of the
testimony by Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, who said that a hundred
and twenty-six million people, not necessarily Americans, “may have been
served” content associated with Russian accounts sometime between 2015
and 2017, with a majority of impressions landing after the election. He
also mentioned that “this equals about four-thousandths of one per cent
of content in News Feed, or approximately one out of twenty-three
thousand pieces of content.” Nor is it significant that, as a “CNN
exclusive”
headline announced, “Russian-linked Facebook ads targeted Michigan and
Wisconsin.” The story that followed actually said nothing of the sort.
The real revelation is this: Russian online interference was a god-awful
mess, a cacophony. The Times published some of the ads that Facebook has traced to Russian accounts. Among
them: a superhero figure with a green leg and a fuchsia leg, red trunks,
and a head vaguely reminiscent of Bernie Sanders, all of which is
apparently meant to read as pro-L.G.B.T.Q.; a Jesus figure arm-wrestling
Satan, with a caption indicating that Satan is Hillary; an ad reminding
us that “Black Panthers, group formed to protect black people from the
KKK, was dismantled by us govt but the KKK exists today”; and an
anti-immigrant ad featuring a sign that says “No invaders allowed!,”
among others. Several former staff members of a St. Petersburg company widely known as
the Kremlin’s “troll factory” gave interviews to different
Russian-language media outlets last month. One
told TV Rain, an independent Web-based television channel, that hired trolls
were obligated to watch “House of Cards,” presumably to gain an
understanding of American politics. At the same time, trolls took
English classes and classes on American politics. In the former, they
learned the difference between the present-perfect and past-simple
tenses (“I have done” versus “I did,” for example); in the latter they
learned that if the subject concerned L.G.B.T. rights, then the troll
should use religious rhetoric: “You should always write that sodomy is a
sin, and that will bring you a couple of dozen ‘likes.’ ” Another Russian outlet, RBC,
published the most detailed investigative report yet on the “troll factory.” RBC
found that the company had a budget of roughly $2.2 million and employed
between eight hundred and nine hundred people, about ten per cent of
whom worked on American politics. The trolls’ job was not so much to aid
a particular Presidential candidate as to wreak havoc by posting
on controversial subjects. Their success was measured by the number of
times a post was shared, retweeted, or liked. RBC calculated that, at
most, two dozen of the trolls’ posts scored audiences of a million or
more; the vast majority had less than a thousand page views. On at least
a couple of occasions, the trolls organized protests in the U.S. simply
by strategically posting the dates and times on Facebook. In Charlotte,
South Carolina, an entity calling itself BlackMattersUS scheduled a
protest and reached out to an actual local activist who ended up
organizing it—and a BlackMattersUS contact gave him a bank card to pay
for sound equipment. These reports don’t exactly support the assumption that the Russian
effort was designed to get Donald Trump elected President. In fact, as
The Hill
reported on Tuesday, a Russian account announced plans for an anti-Trump march in
New York City four days after the election—and thousands attended. Why did Russian trolls, funded at least in part by the Kremlin, work to
incite protests against Trump and an ersatz Black Lives Matter protest,
and, at least in one offline case, work to pit American protesters
against one another? “We were just having fun,” one of the troll-factory
employees interviewed by RBC explained. They were also making money—not
a lot, but more than most college students and recent graduates, who
comprised most of the troll-factory staff, would have earned elsewhere.
In exchange, they had to show that they could meddle effectively in
American politics. Russians have long been convinced that their own politics are infiltrated
by Americans. During the mass protests of 2011 and 2012, Putin famously
accused Hillary
Clinton personally of inciting the unrest. At the time, I was involved in
organizing the protests. In advance of a large protest in February,
2012, I helped a particularly generous donor, who had shown up out of
the blue volunteering to provide snacks, to connect with the hot-tea
coördinator. A few weeks later, state-controlled television aired a
propaganda film that used footage of protesters eating donated cookies
and drinking tea, which was intended to expose the U.S. State
Department’s sponsorship of the Moscow protests; the voice-over claimed
that America had lured protesters out with cookies. A few months later,
we learned that the generous donor had been an undercover agent who had
used Kremlin rubles to purchase the cookies. In the end, protesters got
tea and cookies, and millions of Russians became convinced that the
anti-Putin protests were an American conspiracy. The cookie story is not a perfect analogy, but it is an antecedent of
sorts to the narrative of Russian meddling in the American election, and
it is instructive. Was the Moscow protest made any less real because a
fake donor had brought cookies? Was the protest in New York in November
of last year any less real, or any less opposed to Trump, because a
Russia-linked account originally called for it? Is Trump any less
President because Russians paid for some ads on Facebook? Is there any
reason, at this point, to think that a tiny drop in the sea of Facebook
ads changed any American votes? The answer to all of these questions is:
no, not really. The most interesting question is: What were the Russians doing? In the
weeks leading up to the election, Putin made it clear that he expected
Hillary Clinton to become President. There is every indication that
Moscow was as surprised as New York when the vote results came in.
Indeed, in Russia, where election results are always known ahead of
time, the Trump victory might have been even more difficult to absorb.
So what, then, was the point of Russian meddling—what was the vision
behind the multicolored Bernie superhero and the “No invaders” ad? All of us, including the trolls of St. Petersburg, want the world to
make sense. Given the opportunity, we want to show that it works the way
we think it does. Russians generally believe that politics are a
cacophonous mess with foreign interference but a fixed outcome, so they
invested in affirming that vision. In the aftermath, and following a
perfectly symmetrical impulse, a great many Americans want to prove that
the Russians elected Trump, and Americans did not.

Mark Moore,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 6, 2017 2:47 a.m. ET Russian tech tycoon has business dealings with Jared Kushner By A Russian tech magnate who holds shares of a company co-owned by President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner invested millions of dollars backed by the Kremlin into Twitter and Facebook, a report on Sunday revealed. Yuri Milner used shadowy off-shore shell companies he controlled to invest Kremlin cash in the tech giants, who came under scrutiny by federal and congressional investigators for running bogus ads during the 2016 election from troll farms linked to Moscow, The New York Times reported.

Milner, 55, said the investment in Cadre was for commercial reasons only and he said he met Kushner once – over cocktails last year. “I’m not involved in any political activity. I’m not funding any political activity,” he said. He also called his investments into Facebook and Twitter “commercial” arrangements and wasn’t aware VTB and Gazprom were involved. Both state institutions are under U.S. sanctions punishing Russia for its interference in Crimea in 2014. Kushner did not comment for the Times report. The news comes as special counsel Robert Mueller ramps up his investigation into Russian meddling in the election. Last Monday, his team indicted Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, and his longtime business associated Rick Gates on 12 counts, including tax fraud, conspiracy against the United States and money laundering. The misdeeds allegedly occurred while they were working for a pro-Russian politician in Ukraine. This report originally appeared on NYPost.com. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

 ,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Ed MorrisseyPosted at 12:01 pm on November 9, 2017 My, my, my … isn’t this an interesting coincidence? Just as Robert Mueller’s special counsel probe rolls out an indictment against Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates, the Department of Justice wants to play Let’s Make a Deal with his former son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai, the Wall Street Journal reported this morning. Is this a coincidence? Or is this something more? The Justice Department is seeking to reach a plea deal in its criminal investigation of the former son-in-law of Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s one-time campaign chairman, according to people familiar with the matter. The investigation into Jeffrey Yohai—who hasn’t been charged with any crime—by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles is separate from the Washington-based probe of his former father-in-law and others by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is examining Russian influence on last year’s presidential election, some of the people familiar with the situation said. Mr. Manafort was accused by Mr. Mueller in an indictment unsealed Oct. 30 with using a network of shell companies in the U.S. and abroad to avoid taxes and launder money, and with lying to investigators and defrauding banks on real-estate transactions. He pleaded not guilty. Although those charges didn’t appear to directly relate to Mr. Mueller’s investigation of whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election, they could be an effort to gain Mr. Manafort’s cooperation, legal experts said. Yohai makes an unnamed appearance in the Manafort indictment, mentioned as just his son-in-law, in connection with Manhattan real-estate deal allegedly funded by Manafort’s Cyprus money laundering.  Manafort told lenders that the condo was Yohai’s home, but was actually a rental property, a move that allowed him to get a bigger loan. According to the indictment, Manafort reminded Yohai in an e-mail to make the appraiser buy the fraudulent misrepresentation that he lived in the condo. So far, though, Yohai hasn’t been indicted in the Mueller probe. In fact, Yohai hasn’t yet been charged with anything, but clearly, the DoJ has something in mind. Yohai had an ongoing dispute with Manafort over four house-flipping properties, the WSJ reports, in a $4.2 million bankruptcy case that may have caught the DoJ’s attention. Yohai had complained to a federal court in California of a conspiracy by Manafort to mislead the court about supposed purchase inquiries within a bankruptcy proceeding. It doesn’t sound as though Yohai has much affection for his ex-father-in-law, nor the other way around either. If the DoJ wants to push Yohai into a deal, presumably that would either be to settle a difficult case or to get Yohai to cooperate as a material witness in another prosecution. Getting Yohai on board for the case might push Manafort closer to cooperating with Mueller on the rest of his probe. The DoJ isn’t handling the Manafort prosecution — Mueller’s special-counsel office will try the case — but the DoJ would have to settle their case with Yohai first before cooperating with Mueller. Are they working together to lace up Manafort’s case, or are they working at cross purposes? What would Yohai know about Russian interference or even Manafort’s alleged money laundering? Or, perhaps, one has nothing to do with the other, and this is all just a big coincidence. That seems highly unlikely, but it’s still a possibility. I wonder how much Manafort’s defense team believes in coincidences. Liar. Liar. “Northern California’s Camp Fire has torched more than 6,400 homes and killed 29 people since it began Thursday morning…” “Northern California’s Camp Fire has torched more than 6,400 homes and killed 29 people since it began Thursday morning…” Seaman’s manslaughter Seaman’s manslaughter And did the CEO lie to Congress about it?

Russell Gold,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 5, 2017 7:26 p.m. ET Rampage in tiny Texas town; shooter dead By SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — A young man clad in black and wearing a ballistic vest blasted his way into a Baptist church in this south Texas town on Sunday with an assault-type rifle, leaving at least 26 people dead and 20 others injured. The gunman fled in a vehicle and died following a pursuit, law-enforcement officials said, adding that it wasn’t known whether he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or was shot by someone else. Wilson County Commissioner Ernest “Skip” Hajek confirmed his identity as Devin Patrick Kelley. He said Kelley lived in the New Braunfels, Texas, area northeast of San Antonio.

Twenty-three people were killed at the church, two outside and one died en route to the hospital, officials said. The pastor’s wife, Sherri Pomeroy, said she and her husband were out of the state on Sunday and she was working to get back home from Charlotte, N.C. “Neither of us have made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation,” she said in a text message.

Paul Sonne,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 9, 2017 6:44 p.m. ET Russian state-funded network says it will pursue case in court By The Russian state-funded foreign television network RT said Thursday that it would comply with a U.S. Department of Justice request that the channel register as a foreign agent, but announced its intention to fight the designation in court. RT editor in chief Margarita Simonyan said in an article posted on the network’s website that the outlet’s U.S. division, RT America, would comply with the request because a failure to do so could result in the arrest of the network’s U.S. chief or a seizure of the its assets. Simonyan said the Justice Department’s demand deprived RT of fair competition with other international channels, which haven’t registered as foreign agents. “We believe that the demand does not only go against the law, and we will prove it in court, the demand is discriminative, it contradicts both the democracy and freedom-of-speech principles,” Simonyan said, accusing the U.S. government of trying to drive RT out of the country.

Summer Said,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 6, 2017 2:45 a.m. ET ‘This is a crucial turning point,’ analyst says By A sweeping weekend roundup of more than five dozen princes, ministers and prominent businessmen in Saudi Arabia marks a dramatic escalation in the crown prince’s effort to consolidate power and accelerate far-reaching change in the kingdom. Saudi officials said the crackdown stemmed from a probe aimed at stamping out corruption. It touched some of the most widely known people in the country, including Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, an international tycoon who is one of the richest men in the world, according to people familiar with the matter. On Sunday, as the kingdom digested news of the arrests, another Saudi prince was killed in a helicopter crash near the kingdom’s border with war-torn Yemen. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the crash.

 ,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"A little corruption greases the wheels Behaving, badly, behaving well Michelle Obama, still hating, after all these years Kirstjen M. Nielsen, President Trump’s pick to be the next Homeland Security secretary, said Wednesday she would look at reopening the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals deportation amnesty to allow people who missed the renewal deadline, and promised not to let their information be shared with deportation officers. Ms. Nielsen also ruled out the need for a border wall “from sea to shining sea,” but struggled with answers to many other thorny immigration questions, including the cost of the wall, what should happen to Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC), and what crimes should make illegal immigrants targets for deportation. “I would defer to you,” she told Sen. Kamala D. Harris, California Democrat, who pressed her on how she viewed those controversial policy decisions she will oversee should she be confirmed. In testimony to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Ms. Nielsen, former chief of staff at Homeland Security to then-Secretary John F. Kelly before following him over to the White House, said she had a lot to study up on if she’s confirmed to lead the 240,000-person department. She said whether the country needs a domestic-terrorism law is “a good question.” She said whether the country should ban online content such as manuals that terrorists have followed to conduct attacks deserves “a serious discussion.” “I do think we have to have that conversation and then work with those who provide and enable that information on the internet to find a way to identify it and remove it should we determine that it’s not appropriate,” she said. And she said the line between reasonable suspicion and racial profiling in immigration enforcement is “a good question” that she didn’t have firm an answer for yet. “I would have to understand what the states would argue the difference would be,” she said. As Homeland Security secretary she would oversee a sprawling agency with hundreds of thousands of employees that cover everything from airport security and the Coast Guard to disaster relief and the country’s immigration system. Sen. Tom Carper, Delaware Democrat, said she seemed unqualified for such a massive job. “I worry a lot about your leadership and your experience as a leader, and your lack of leadership,” Mr. Carper told her. Ms. Nielsen replied that she’s been a manager, and said she learned about the importance of accountability and empowering employees. “Many of the leadership skills that have brought me to this place are scalable,” she said. She said she has a particular concern about cybersecurity, and said when she went to vote in Virginia on Tuesday she began asking questions about ballot security. Asked about her plans in that area, she said she would change the name of the department’s cybersecurity division from the National Protection and Programs Directorate. “I would very much appreciate an opportunity to work with you to change the name. It truly does confuse stakeholders,” she said. On immigration — perhaps the most controversial issue in the portfolio she would handle — she didn’t mention any specific plans, but said the key to enforcement is to get better metrics. She also said deterrence is important to keeping people from making the journey north in the first place. “We will enforce our laws. It’s vital we do so. We will do so,” she said. “Should I be confirmed, I intend to do so.” But she said she would order agents not to target “Dreamers” or other low-priority illegal immigrants in their enforcement action. And when pressed by Ms. Harris she said she would consider allowing Dreamers to renew their protections under the 2012 DACA program, saying she needed to see if anyone was cut off unfairly. Her nomination has deeply split Republicans. She worked in the White House for President George W. Bush and his allies have sprung to her defense, but Trump-friendly conservatives said she was a danger to the president’s agenda. “I don’t like conspiracy theories on attractive women using sex for promotions, but other than being very pretty, Trump’s DHS nominee Kirstjen Nielsen is Chuck Schumer,” Ann Coulter tweeted.

Kirstjen Nielsen told members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee she would prioritize the arrest of undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, and said contact information about so-called Dreamers — young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children — whose protections from deportation are set to expire won’t be shared routinely with immigration enforcement officers. Nielsen also said she doesn’t favor the construction of a wall along the entire southern border, echoing recent statements by administration officials and by Trump himself, whose call for a border-length barrier had been a staple of his presidential campaign. “There is no need for a wall from sea to shining sea,” she said, responding to questions from two Democrats on the panel. “Technology, as you know, plays a key part and we can’t forget it.

The median sale price and average price per square foot both are down sharply since 2015, when Trump launched his campaign for president, and now are plumbing depths last visited during the financial crisis. Brokers aren’t sure whether the weakness is due more to Trump Tower-specific issues, such as tightened security, demonstrations and antipathy toward Trump or to a slowing luxury condo market in general across Midtown Manhattan. Boaz Mashiach, a principal of the Mashiach Real Estate Group, who is listing two adjacent apartments on the 42nd floor of Trump Tower for $7.8 million, said the overall market was “very soft right now” but that Trump’s presidency also could be a factor. “Some people don’t like to live in his building — and there are some people who want to live only in his building,” he said. “Because of the presidency, some people see it as an honor.

Shoshanna Delventhal,11162017,Investopedia,11092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), the parent company of Google, is the first to put fully autonomous cars on U.S. roads without a safety driver. On Tuesday, John Krafcik, the CEO of Google’s self-driving car project, Waymo Inc., said that since mid-October, the company’s autonomous minivans have been taking trips around Phoenix without a human present in the car to grab the wheel if things go awry. He also indicated that Waymo plans to launch the world’s first autonomous-vehicle ride-hailing service in just a few months. “Fully self-driving cars are here,” said Krafcik at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon. Waymo, which became a standalone company under the Alphabet umbrella in December 2015, put its first driverless car on public roads in October 2015. During that ride, a blind man took a 10-minute spin around Austin, Texas, in a “pod car” that the company later retired in favor of its minivans. (See also: Waymo Will Start Ride-Sharing Service This Month.) Krafcik suggests that the human-less ride “marks the start of a new phase for Waymo,” which began its autonomous car project eight years ago. The company is also experimenting with self-driving trucks and will consider selling its technology to automakers seeking to implement it in their vehicles. As for the driverless ride-hailing service, Waymo has left a lot of questions unanswered, including what territory and during which hours the service will run and how much it will cost. Insurance is another major issue for driverless technology, with some suggesting that the operators should provide it themselves before the technology proves itself enough for traditional insurers to do so. With the help of partnerships with companies such as Fiat-Chrysler, Lyft and Avis, along with its top engineering talent, Waymo has moved far ahead of its competition in the self-driving car space. “This is the most advanced vehicle we’ve developed to date,” said Waymo’s CEO. “Everything in it is designed and built for full autonomy. Our combination of powerful sensors gives our vehicles a 360-degree view of the world. The lasers can see objects in three dimensions, up to 300 meters away. We also have short-range lasers that stay focused close-up to the side of the vehicle. Our radars can see underneath and around vehicles, tracking moving objects usually hidden from the human eye.” Waymo plans to gradually expand its service beyond Arizona to other cities, states and countries around the world.

With all sorts of retailers balking at housing their data with Amazon’s Web Services (AWS) due to competitive concerns, Kroger Co.

Ever since Amazon’s multi-billion-dollar purchase of Whole Foods this summer, Kroger has become a direct competitor to the e-commerce giant. As result, Kroger doesn’t want a rival in charge of its data. It doesn’t help that the Seattle-based online retailer is also eyeing the pharmaceutical market, which would be another competitive threat to Kroger.

The executive told CNBC the company started moving to Microsoft's Azure cloud and Google Cloud in late 2016. He did note there is still some business with Amazon Web Services, but that it's through companies it has acquired. As for new projects, Hjelm said the investments won’t be going to AWS, noting that it doesn’t feel like it's losing a competitive advantage by tapping Microsoft and Google for its cloud needs. (See also: Amazon Cloud Business May Be Slowing: Keybanc.) While AWS is still the dominant cloud computing company in the U.S., lodging revenue growth of 42% to $4.58 billion in the third quarter ended in September, it is feeling pressure from the likes of Microsoft and Google. For its fiscal first quarter, Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft said it surpassed its goal of $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate for its cloud business, which includes its Azure cloud offering. Azure revenue jumped 90% compared to a year ago while Office 365 subscriptions increased 42% from last year’s fiscal first quarter. “This quarter we exceeded $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR​, outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in prepared remarks when reporting quarterly results. “Our results reflect accelerating innovation and increased usage and engagement across our businesses as customers continue to choose Microsoft to help them transform.” Analysts had expected Microsoft to hit that self-imposed cloud target next year. Microsoft’s fortunes in the cloud market have a lot to do with the diversity of its client base and the expansion of rival AWS’s parent into all sorts of markets. With companies balking at giving Amazon more business, even in the cloud, it’s been a boon for Microsoft and Google.  ",Why Kroger Is Avoiding Amazon's Cloud Service AWS | Investopedia

(YEXT), which have all been listed as top analyst picks in a recent CNBC story. (For more, see also: How Google, Facebook, Amazon Will Ride The AI Wave.) Facebook Inc., which has identified AI as the biggest initiative for next year, has stated publicly that it ""wants to solve AI,"" according to CNBC. Analysts have given this company some bullish stock ratings as of late. Facebook was trading at $178.44 at the time of report, Google Finance data shows. However, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) analyst Ken Sana gave the company's stock a $215 price target on November 2, emphasizing that the social media giant ""has the largest audience platform in the world"" as the world gets ready for a ""different computing era,"" CNBC reported. Microsoft, which has changed its strategy to ""an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with AI"" this year, has gotten some very positive ratings from analysts over the last three months, according to CNBC. During this time, only one of these analysts has given Microsoft shares a hold rating, while 13 others have given this company's stock buy ratings. Yext, a company that helps businesses control online data, could experience some significant upside, CNBC reported. KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin provided the company's shares with a buy rating and a $16 price target. At the time of report, Yext was trading at $12.73, Google Finance data reveals, so Bracelin's target represents a more than 25% gain. The analyst stated that AI and voice search are factors that could drive ""high revenue growth"" of more than 30% for Yext, according to CNBC.

Nathan Reiff,11162017,Investopedia,11092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs While 2017 has been the year of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, traditional investment vehicles have quietly churned along. Dan Loeb, the billionaire head of Third Point LLC, has seen his hedge fund grow in the most latest quarter, according to a recent 13F filing. While hedge funds have generally faltered due to lackluster performance, Loeb managed to increase his portfolio value by 5.45% during the Q3 window, with value climbing from $11.28 billion to $11.9 billion. This was an increase from 32 distinct positions to 37. Notably, Loeb added to his stake in Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) while decreasing his holdings in Alphabet (GOOGL). (See also: Billionaire Dan Loeb Bought 4.5 Million Shares of Alibaba in Q2: 13F Filings.) Loeb's portfolio remains concentrated on just a few focused holdings. In fact, the top three holdings in the portfolio account for roughly 40% of the total portfolio's value. These three holdings are health care company Baxter International (BAX), Alibaba, and chemical conglomerate DowDuPont (DWDP). Rounding out the top five holdings for Third Point as of the end of Q3 are BlackRock (BLK) and Facebook Inc. (FB). According to Loeb's third-quarter investor letter, as reported by Seeking Alpha, the hedge fund returned 3.4% for Q3, bringing total returns for 2017 to 14.5%. By comparison, the S&P 500 index has returned 14.5% over the same period, with returns of 4.5% in the third quarter. In the world of hedge funds today, this is significant, as many funds have been unable to outpace the S&P 500 in recent quarters. Loeb's annualized returns since December 1996, when Third Point was founded, are 15.8%. That's dramatically higher than the 8% return for the S&P 500. Loeb's recent 13F filing indicates the levels of many of Third Point's positions at the end of Q3. Investors tracking Loeb's activity should keep in mind that the 13F is delayed, and that many portions of the portfolio could have changed in the weeks since the end of the third quarter. Furthermore, a 13F does not paint a total picture of a hedge fund's holdings. For example, Third Point holds $3.5 billion, or roughly 40 million shares, including options, in Nestle (NSRGY). This holding does not appear on the 13F because NSRGY is not a 13F security. Nestle is an activist stake for Loeb, meaning he is aiming to make changes to productivity, return, and other areas in an effort to boost profitability. Although Nestle is not included in Third Point's 13F filing, it is nonetheless a crucial part of Dan Loeb's overall portfolio and investing strategy, and a reminder that you can't rely solely on 13Fs for all the information about a company.

(CRM) investor day meeting during the company’s annual Dreamforce conference, Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff took to the stage and held nothing back in bashing legacy tech titan Microsoft Corp.

(CSCO), Dell Technologies and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), alongside its new cloud computing partnership with Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG) Google. When it came to Microsoft, however, the CEO played down Microsoft’s power as a CRM rival, poking fun at the company’s Surface laptop and pointing to the firm’s many executive departures. At the analyst event Tuesday, Benioff answered a question regarding whether Salesforce and Microsoft would ever work together again. In 2014 and 2015, he had touted a budding partnership with Microsoft, while CEO Satya Nadella had a prime speaking spot at the same conference. “I like having competitors,” said the Salesforce CEO. “But what I just get blown away with is how they just can’t keep, you know, that management team in place.” Things between the tech giants turned sour for a few reason over the years. In 2016, Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn, after trying to buy Salesforce itself. The two compete in various segments such as business intelligence and CRM software. When Evercore’s Kirk Materne asked Benoiff if it could be possible for Microsoft and Salesforce to join forces again “on behalf of customers,” the CEO indirectly responded by pointing out that only three people in the room were using a Surface computer, while the company only has a 1% share of the CRM market. He blamed the high executive turnover at Microsoft to a lack of confidence in the firm’s ability to execute in the CRM space. “So that has weighed to our favor, and customers feel that,” added Benioff.

Cisco is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and is one of the ""Dogs of the Dow"" for 2017. Cisco is underperforming the Dow 30, and many investors may not realize that the stock is well below its tech-bubble peak of the year 2000. Cisco reports earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday and is expected to post earnings per share of between 59 cents and 61 cents with relatively flat year-over-year comparisons.

Mark Kolakowski,11162017,Investopedia,11092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Information technology stocks in the S&P 500 Index (SPX​) delivered a massive 22% EPS increase year-over-year for the third quarter, a stunning 11 percentage points better than analysts' consensus estimates, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS). This kind of earnings performance, if it continues, is likely to fuel tech stocks to higher altitudes for the rest of this year and in 2018. Just as impressively, 81% of these companies beat EPS expectations by more than one standard deviation, their best performance in more than 19 years. Overall, EPS for the S&P 500 grew by 7%, 2 percentage points above consensus, and 90% of that earnings surprise was due to the tech sector. These findings were published in Goldman's U.S. Weekly Kickstart report dated November 10. (For more, see also: Why Big Investors Are Doubling Down on Pricey Tech Stocks.) The four largest U.S. tech stocks, as Goldman categorizes them, accounted for 50% of that 2 percentage point EPS surprise for the S&P 500: Facebook Inc. (FB) Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL). Add in Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), technically classified as consumer discretionary due to its core business as an online merchant, and the five FAAMG​ stocks collectively increased revenue by 21% in 3Q 2017, their biggest year-over-year growth rate since 1Q 2012. Goldman Sachs equity research analysts expect full year aggregate sales growth for the FAAMG stocks to be 19% in 2017 and 20% in 2018. By comparison, the consensus estimates for total S&P 500 sales growth in 2017 and 2018 is 7% for both years, Goldman indicates. (For more, see also: 4 Reasons These Giant Tech Stocks May Be Unstoppable.) Strength in the tech sector goes far beyond the FAAMGs, Goldman notes. As a whole, S&P 500 tech stocks increased revenue by 17% year-over-year in 3Q 2017, 2 percentage points above consensus. Only energy stocks, with a 19% increase, did better. Moreover, the techs increased their collective profit margins by 72 basis points, handily beating analysts' consensus projection that their margins would decline by 74 basis points. Looking ahead, Goldman's economists believe that rising wages are a key downside risk for corporate profit margins. While the median S&P 500 company has labor costs equal to 11% of sales, the ratio is much lower for various leading tech firms. For Facebook, Apple, and Alphabet​, their respective ratios of labor costs to sales are 5%, 2%, and 7%, per Goldman's calculations. On the other hand, both government officials and the general public are raising concerns that the big tech companies are too powerful, and thus should be reined in or even broken up. (For more, see also: FANG Stocks Face Same Dark Fate as Microsoft, IBM, AT&T.) Among the other 10 sectors, energy and financials stand out, for opposite reasons. Energy led all sectors with year-over-year growth rates of 156% in EPS, 19% in sales, and 259 basis points in profit margins. The price of benchmark North Sea Brent crude oil has increased by about 13% so far in 2017, creating much of the impetus for these big improvements, Goldman says. At the other end of the spectrum, financial stocks suffered the biggest EPS decline, -8%. Nonetheless, 52% of financial firms beat estimates, while only 12% missed, per Goldman. Drill down a layer deeper, and it becomes apparent that hurricane-induced losses in insurance (EPS -67% YOY​) and diversified financial services (-28%) offset strong earnings gains for banks (+9%), capital markets firms (+14%), and consumer finance companies (+9%), Goldman observes.

Not all are as optimistic regarding Wal-Mart’s new e-commerce push.

At a time when competition in the financial markets is fierce and when millennial investors expect top-notch customer service from the companies they deal with, financial firms are trying to find new ways to improve interactions. In October, Fidelity's innovation unit Fidelity Labs revealed in a blog post that it is equipping call center workers with virtual reality headsets so they can better understand what the customer is going through and better handle incoming calls. Fidelity says that it is the first company in the financial sector to test out this technology for increasing empathy among call center workers. Built on the Google VR headset, the Fidelity virtual reality system activates when a customer service rep in the call center receives a call from a client that needs to take money out of his or her account. During the interaction with the client, the customer service rep is shown the customer in his or her kitchen with a pile of bills strewn about. By seeing that image, the customer service rep, in theory, will be more understanding of the customer's plight and in turn express more empathy and more willingness to find a solution.

In less than a generation, they have gone from nothing to being two of the most important companies in the world. Much of the information we get and the virtual interactions we have with friends now flow through Google and Facebook, respectively. Image source: Getty Images There's no (small f) fool-proof way to answer that question. But there are three different lenses through which we can evaluate these companies, and those should go a long way in helping us to determine which we are more comfortable with. If you're a long-term, buy-to-hold investor, there's nothing more important than investigating a company's sustainable competitive advantages. Often referred to as a moat, this represents that special something that separates one company from the hoards of competitors. Since Google's primary business is selling advertising space, Google's enormous hoard of data is its most valuable asset. With over seven products that have a billion-plus users -- Search, Maps, GMail, Play Store, Chrome, You Tube, and Android -- the company has a very low fixed cost to produce this data for advertisers. Not to be outdone, Facebook also has a very wide moat. The brand is worth $74 billion -- good for fourth in the world -- and it also has similar data-collecting capabilities thanks to all of the information shared via Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Truth be told, these are two of the widest moat businesses in tech right now. But if forced to choose, I would go with Facebook. It has the added benefit of the network effect: as one user joins the platform, it further incentivizes other users to join, creating a virtuous cycle for the company -- one that is still going strong 13 years after the company was founded. If you're considering buying shares in either of these companies, you realize that dividends aren't on the table. So you'd probably want to see each company either reinvesting extra cash into growth opportunities or returning it to shareholders through repurchasing programs. But there's something to be said for holding a big pile of cash on the sidelines. Every company, at one point or another, is going to face difficult economic times. Those that have lots of cash -- and not too much debt -- can actually emerge stronger by buying shares back on the cheap, outspending rivals to gain market share, or acquiring the competition. Here's how these two stack up in terms of financial fortitude. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Facebook $38 billion $0 $16 billion $17 billion Alphabet $107 billion $4 billion $21 billion $24 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing twelve month basis. Both companies have very strong net income and free cash flow. And debt isn't an issue, either. While this is nit-picky, I'll give the advantage to Alphabet thanks to the company's larger war chest. Finally, we have valuation. This isn't an exact science: there's no one number that can tell you how cheap or expensive a stock really is. The best we can do is reference a number of different data points to help us get a more holistic picture. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Facebook 34 30 1.2 Alphabet 33 30 1.5 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E is presented on non-GAAP basis if applicable. On this facet, I truly don't think there's a meaningful difference. Both stocks are expensive on a historical basis, but are probably fairly valued given the overall market's eight-year bull run. But don't be misled, I don't think you can really go wrong owning either of these stocks. And I speak with conviction: they are my second and third-largest holdings, accounting for 28% of my real-life holdings. I think you'd be wise to make time to investigate owning both! ","

"Evan Niu, CFA",11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Earlier this week, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google and Mozilla announced that Google would be returning to the Firefox browser as the default search engine in the U.S. and Canada. The news comes almost exactly two years after Firefox switched from Google to Yahoo! (which is now owned by Verizon subsidiary Oath), and was included alongside the announcement for Firefox Quantum, the newest version of the browser. Mozilla relies almost entirely on these types of search partnerships, with the related royalties often comprising about 90% of revenue for the non-profit organization. For example, in its 2015 annual report (Mozilla has not yet released a 2016 annual report), it notes: Mozilla entered into a contract with a search engine provider for royalties which expired in November 2014. In December 2014, Mozilla entered into a contract with another search engine provider for royalties which expires December 2019. Approximately 90% of Mozilla's royalty revenues were derived from these contracts for 2015 and 2014 with receivables from these contracts representing approximately 75% and 77% of the December 31, 2015 and 2014 outstanding receivables, respectively. This snippet clearly refers to the switch from Google to Yahoo!, and Mozilla's total royalty revenue did jump 29% that year to $417 million, suggesting the Yahoo! partnership was working out well (at least financially). However, if Mozilla's deal with Yahoo! was set to last through December 2019, we're clearly not there yet. Google and Mozilla both declined to provide any financial details or terms surrounding the new partnership, which reportedly caught Verizon off guard. Image source: Getty Images. Does the win really make a difference for Google, though? Firefox has been declining in relevance for years, thanks in no small part to Google's own Chrome browser. Obviously, Google doesn't have to pay royalties to anyone for the search traffic that Chrome drives, which is why it was such a genius move in the first place to create Chrome nearly a decade ago. As of October 2017, FireFox had a 13% worldwide market share of internet browsers, compared to Chrome's 60%, according to NetMarketShare. That's a decent chunk of the browser market that's still worth going after. Perhaps more importantly, Firefox's share has remained mostly steady in recent years (albeit with some fluctuations), suggesting that Firefox still has a loyal user base that Google hasn't been able to win over with Chrome. Just like the old saying goes: If you can't beat 'em, license your search engine to 'em. Google's traffic acquisition costs (TAC) to distribution partners have been rising quite a bit lately, in part because of the ongoing shift toward mobile platforms. TAC to distribution partners soared 54% last quarter to $2.4 billion. Distribution partners include browser providers, among others. Apple is certainly benefiting from the fact that iOS does not allow any browser other than mobile Safari to be the default. Google could pay an estimated $3 billion to the Mac maker this year for the privilege of being mobile Safari's default search engine. Even without knowing the details, the Firefox deal will have modest financial implications due to the browser's limited market share, which is unlikely to fluctuate much even with the new Quantum version. Considering Firefox's small but stable share, Google might as well swoop in to grab that search traffic, too. ","

One of the surprise announcements from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google's big product event last month was Pixel Buds, a pair of wireless neck buds that is clearly a response to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) AirPods. Apple launched AirPods with severe supply constraints in late 2016, but availability has improved throughout 2017. Both Pixel Buds and AirPods have the same price point of $159. Pixel Buds are now starting to get delivered, with the first batch of reviews hitting the internet this week. Spoiler alert: Pixel Buds are rather underwhelming. Image source: Google. For starters, here's just a sampling of some of the recent reviews from the tech press: The bright spots are audio quality and Google Assistant, which is easily one of the best virtual assistants on the market today and far better than Apple's Siri. It's a decent start for Google as the search giant continues to bet big on hardware, but Pixel Buds face an uphill battle in competing directly with AirPods. Google is expanding its hardware operations in a big way, and it's pretty clear that just about all of the major tech giants believe the future is wireless. The new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL ditched the headphone jack, for instance, a year after Apple controversially did with the iPhone 7. Apple has already taken an early lead, with a dominating 85% revenue share in the U.S. market for wireless headphones through August, according to NPD. Apple considers AirPods and wireless headphones to be part of its broader wearables business, which brought in at least $6.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017. Pixel Buds might be off to a rough start, but Google shouldn't give up on challenging Apple. ","

Earlier this week, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and leading customer relationship management company salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) announced a collaboration that will deeply integrate Google's cloud and analytics with Salesforce's industry-leading CRM solutions. The combination of the two companies' cloud services not only helps create stronger solutions for customers, but it should also help accelerate growth for both Google Cloud and Salesforce. Here's an overview of what the partnership entails, and why investors should care. Image source: Getty Images. Google Cloud and Salesforce are integrating their businesses in a range of ways, but here are the most important highlights from the new partnership: Salesforce integrates into G Suite: Salesforce Lightning will be integrated into Gmail, enabling users to sift through CRM data within Gmail. Lightning will also integrate with Google Sheets, allowing G Suite users to easily push data from Salesforce to a Google Sheet. Within Google Drive and Google Calendar, users will be able to interact with Salesforce's Quip Live Apps. Finally, Salesforce data will surface in Google Hangouts Meet, enabling users to see and act on customer data and insights. Salesforce and Google Analytics 360 data connect: By combining insights from Salesforce sales and marketing solutions and Google Analytics 360 insights, marketers have more information to ""drive smarter engagement -- from awareness all the way through to conversion and retention,"" Salesforce said in a press release about the partnership. Google Cloud gets a big customer: As part of the collaboration between the two companies, Salesforce has designated Google Cloud as its preferred public cloud provider to support its growth. Specifically, Salesforce will ""use Google Cloud Platform for its core services as part of the company's international infrastructure expansion,"" Salesforce said in a blog post. Salesforce gets leads: Google said Salesforce will remain its preferred CRM provider for its cloud customers. A free year of G Suite: Salesforce customers new to G Suite will get access to the productivity suite at no cost for one year. By bringing the best of Google's G Suite and analytics together with some of Salesforce's CRM solutions, both companies are ultimately reaching new customers without giving up any of their respective markets. While both of the companies' businesses are in the cloud, Salesforce is primarily concerned with expanding its leads in CRM, and Google Cloud is focused on selling cloud infrastructure and productivity services. But despite their different goals, both companies' end customers consist of businesses looking to streamline their operations in the cloud. It's a perfect cross-selling opportunity. Making the agreement between the two companies even more notable, both Google Cloud and Salesforce are growing very rapidly. In Alphabet's third quarter, Google ""other"" revenue, which is primarily made up of cloud, Google Play, and hardware, saw its sales increase 40% year over year; and management said cloud was the largest contributor to the segment. Meanwhile, Salesforce revenue recently surpassed a $10 billion annual run rate after posting 26% year-over-year revenue growth in its third quarter. Of course, the deal is likely more material for Salesforce investors than Alphabet investors, since Google Cloud is only a small portion of Alphabet's total business, yet all of Salesforce's 150,000 CRM solutions customers could benefit from the deal. Even more, while Google Cloud is getting Salesforce as a customer and G Suite and Analytics 360 offerings are being marketed to Salesforce's 150,000 customers, Salesforce just got a major endorsement to the 3.5 million businesses globally that are already using G Suite.

"Brian Stoffel, Timothy Green, and Tyler Crowe",11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. That's not easy to do. So today, three Motley Fool investors tell you about three stocks that you can buy and should hold for decades. Read on to find out why McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), HCP (NYSE:HCP) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- better known as the parent company to Google -- all make the list. Tim Green (McDonald's): Few restaurant chains find the formula for decades-long success. Competition is fierce, consumer tastes are constantly evolving, and missteps can tarnish a brand for years. McDonald's, which not too long ago was struggling with declining sales, is now putting up strong numbers, driven by initiatives such as all-day breakfast and a deeper focus on providing value to its customers. The company's ability to adapt makes it a stock to own for the long run. The company's third-quarter results look out of place during a time when many restaurant chains are struggling to attract customers. Global comparable sales jumped 6%, while U.S. comparable sales rose 4.1%. The company's refranchising efforts led to a revenue drop, but adjusted earnings per share increased by 9% year over year. Beyond menu changes, McDonald's is embracing technology. The company's mobile app, which features digital coupons, is driving customers to its restaurants and creating incremental sales. McDonald's also offers mobile ordering through its app and delivery through UberEats. It needs to win on both value and convenience. It's doing just that with these initiatives. Shares of McDonald's have surged this year, so the stock is far from a bargain. But if you're a long-term investor able to ignore the ups and downs of the market, the fast-food king is a good bet. Tyler Crowe (HCP Inc.): The baby boomer generation is at the age of retirement, which is causing a massive shift in U.S. demographics. Between now and 2030, the 75-and-older cohort of Americans is expected to grow by more than 50% to just under 10% of the total population. The reason that's important for real estate investment trust HCP is that average annual healthcare spending tends to skyrocket after age of 65. That's not just doctor or hospital visits, either. That includes services such as assisted living and senior housing, a market on which HCP is betting heavily. According to HCP, the market value of all U.S. healthcare-related real estate is around $1.1 trillion, and it's likely to grow as people are living longer and baby boomers get on in years. Just to give an example, the senior-housing market should grow by 40% between now and 2030, which gives HCP and other healthcare related REITs a massive investment opportunity over the next decade in just one segment of the market. That doesn't include other healthcare properties such as medical offices and life-sciences laboratories that are core holdings at HCP Over the past year or so, HCP's management has reconfigured its buisness to prepare for this massive investment opportunity. It spun off its skilled-nursing and acute-care properties last year, it's diversifying its tenants, and it is improving debt metrics to get an investment-grade rating. All of these things should better position HCP to capture this multi-decade opportunity. As a REIT, HCP is already a high-yield dividend stock that has a reasonable payout for the industry. With demographic trends on its side, this looks like a stock you can hold for a long time. Brian Stoffel (Alphabet): One of the reasons Google changed its name to Alphabet was to put a focus on its ""other bets"" outside the core Google search and advertising juggernaut. Even without these side projects -- which I'll get to in a second -- Alphabet is a worthy investment. The company has an unmatched data set -- which is helping it dominate the transition to online advertising. It has a war chest of $107 billion against ""just"" $3 billion in long-term debt. And over the past year, it has produced $24 billion in free cash flow -- almost solely thanks to the advertising business. But it's the company's moonshots -- experiments with products that could drastically change the way we live -- that are a the real reason to hold for decades. While the likelihood that any one moonshot will be a success is slim (hello, Google Glass 1.0), all it takes is one project to ""hit"" to notably move the needle for investors. Increasingly, it's looking as if Waymo -- Alphabet's self-driving-car initiative -- might be the first major hit. No matter how it plays out, however, you can only be exposed to this potential if you buy and are willing to hold shares over the long run. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's a frequently cited PwC report that says 38% of U.S. jobs are at risk of being overtaken by artificially intelligent automation by 2030. Similarly, a Scientific American article warned earlier this year that 40% of the top 500 companies will vanish within a decade as they fall victim to artificial intelligence (AI). Let's be honest, here -- those predictions are pretty easy to dismiss right now. The average person can take a look around and ask, ""Where is all of this scary AI?"" After all, the world's leading AI companies -- Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- aren't showing TV ads about buying new AI bots just yet. So why worry? But AI is already starting to take over in very subtle ways, and there's plenty of evidence that as AI becomes a bigger part of what these companies do, it'll eventually become a bigger part of how our world functions. Image source: Getty Images. I don't want to creep you out, but if you own a smartphone then you've likely talked to artificial intelligence. More specifically, if you've asked Siri a question, talked to Google Assistant, searched for a photo in Google Photos, or uploaded a photo to Facebook and let it automatically tag your friends, then you've used a form of AI. Google is probably one of the most well-known AI companies right now because its AI company, DeepMind, has bested the world's top players in the ancient game of Go. But Google is also using AI in less public ways as well. The company has added machine learning algorithms to its core apps -- like Search and Photos -- and has made its machine learning tool, TensorFlow, available for free so developers can create their own AI-driven apps. Image source: Amazon. Of course Amazon has been using AI in plain sight as well, with its popular Echo devices. The company's lineup for smart speakers and in-home devices have the company's artificially intelligent assistant, Alexa, in them, but Amazon is also using machine learning algorithms to serve up the most relevant content when you're searching for items on its e-commerce platform. Additionally, the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- which is Amazon's biggest business by operating income -- has AI tools for developers that help them create AI apps, just like Google. Those are examples of some AI software and tools that are working in the background of commonly used tech already, but hardware that's designed specifically for AI use is pervasive as well. Google said just last year that it's creating its own Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) specifically for running AI and NVIDIA has been tweaking its own graphics processing units (GPUs), and creating new processors, to be used for some of the most advanced AI servers run by Microsoft, Amazon, and others. NVIDIA's GPUs are an integral part in the company's own AI-powered autonomous driving systems, the latest of which is Drive PX Pegasus, as well as in the company's powerful DGX-1 server, which is used for deep learning research and analytics. NVIDIA's lead in the AI hardware space has helped the company carve out its own artificial intelligence niche and could give the company a total addressable market in AI of more than $30 billion over the next eight years. Ok, so there are plenty of examples of AI all around us, but how exactly will this tech go from answering basic questions to stealing away our jobs? The answer is that AI is becoming faster and smarter at an exponential rate. For example, NVIDIA released its second-generation Drive PX 2 semi-autonmous driving computer in 2016, but the new Pegasus version which debuted just last month is already 13 times faster, less than two years later. Image source: Getty Images. Of course, this rate of acceleration doesn't just apply to autonomous vehicle technology. A recent Mother Jones article says that AI will have one-tenth of human brain capabilities just before 2035 -- but that artificial intelligence will then surpass human intelligence by 2060. ""[S]urgeons, novelists, construction workers, police officers, and so forth. These jobs could all be fully automated during the 2040s. By 2060, AI will be capable of performing any task currently done by humans,"" the author writes. If this timetable proves true, then it means that other predictions, like the ones below from research firm Gartner, become more likely as well. Investors would be mistaken to think that we're too far out from this technology trend to start buying into it now. Google, NVIDIA, Amazon, and plenty of others are already betting on AI and the more time that passes the more artificial intelligence is likely to start upending industries. Kai-Fu Lee, the founder of venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures and a tech leader in China said recently that AI, ""[W]ill be larger than all of human tech revolutions added together, including electricity, industrial revolution, internet, mobile internet -- because AI is pervasive."" Essentially, investors should ignore what these companies are doing with artificial intelligence at their -- and their portfolio's -- own risk. ","
      
    Artificial Intelligence Is Already Common -- and It's About to Take Over  -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Cord-cutting is a growing trend in the United States. Research firm eMarketer expects nearly 5 million Americans to stop subscribing to cable this year, accelerating from last year. And even if consumers aren't cutting the cord, they're spending less time watching traditional television and more time streaming video or using social media. I previously argued the best way to invest in cord-cutting is to buy shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). But Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has since become a publicly traded company, and it makes a great case for being a way to invest in the trend. Image source: Roku While not the only factor, price remains one of the biggest reasons consumers ditch cable. If consumers are looking to save money, however, replacements like Netflix will have a rough cap on what they can charge per month (although it doesn't look like Netflix is close to it yet). Meanwhile, there's $70 billion in television advertising revenue that's going toward a shrinking audience. That money has to go somewhere, and it's flowing toward digital advertising. Digital ad spend surpassed television advertising in the U.S. for the first time last year, and that gap is only growing wider. That's why I recommended Facebook and Alphabet to take advantage of the shift in ad dollars from TV to digital -- Google and Facebook combined took nearly all the growth in digital advertising over the last couple years. But Roku may present an even better alternative. Roku follows the razor-and-blade approach when it comes to hardware: it uses its devices to establish a platform to sell content and advertising. And that platform is growing rapidly. Roku's active accounts increased 48% year over year in the third quarter, reaching 16.7 million. While that's still tiny compared to Facebook or Google's audience, it's getting closer to the top pay-TV providers and top rated television programming. What's more, those users are increasingly engaged on the Roku platform. Streaming hours grew 58% year over year to 3.8 billion. Roku says its players captured half of all streaming hours among the top four streaming devices. With a highly engaged audience of consumers seeking cable-free video entertainment, Roku's platform presents a big opportunity for marketers to access ""a valuable and difficult-to-reach audience."" And Roku is aggressively pursuing traditional TV advertising budgets as well: it's closed agreements with three of the top six ad agencies to buy advertising upfront. Two of those deals just came in the last quarter. Overall, ad revenue more than doubled year-to-date. While Roku has certainly carved out a niche in digital advertising that's poised to grow quickly, Google and Facebook maintain a practical duopoly over the wider market. Even after a huge spike in share price following its blowout third quarter results, Roku shares trade for about 8x the company's trailing twelve months sales. By comparison, Facebook trades for 15.7x sales and Alphabet's shares cost 7.2x sales. What's more, Roku's high margin platform segment (which contains its advertising business) is the fastest growing portion of the business. In fact, Roku may be the fastest growing publicly traded digital advertising business on the market. Even with hardware sales dragging down overall revenue growth, Roku's sales still outpaced Alphabet's by a wide margin, but lagged Facebook's growth. What Roku doesn't have that Facebook and Alphabet both offer is profits. Roku is still posting losses quarter after quarter, losing $0.10 per share last quarter. Comparing Roku on a profitability basis is impossible at the moment. Roku also doesn't have as wide of a moat as Facebook or Google, but its partnerships with manufacturers and content creators are helping to establish one. Overall, Roku might be riskier than Facebook or Google, but it presents an interesting opportunity to invest in the growing cord-cutting trend. ","

Artificial intelligence (AI) gets a lot of attention these days. Some have predicted it could transform the job market in ways we can hardly imagine, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has warned it may bring about dangerous autonomous weapons, and PwC says it's the ""biggest commercial opportunity in today's fast changing economy"" which could add 14% to global GDP by 2030. Tech investors looking for a way to benefit from all of this AI potential would be wise to consider adding chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to their list of stocks. While many companies are claiming to be in AI right now, NVIDIA is actually making hardware that's creating some of the most advanced AI technologies on the planet -- and the company is just getting started. Image source: Getty Images. The most well-known aspect of NVIDIA's AI pursuits is probably its autonomous driving technologies. The company's Drive PX AI supercomputer is used in a growing number of semi-autonomous driving features offered by Audi, Mercedes, Toyota, and others. NVIDIA's graphics processors allow vehicles to see the world around them by processing vast amounts of image data received by on-board cameras. The company is now on its third version of Drive PX, called Pegasus, which is more than 10 times faster than its predecessor and is specifically created to power Level 5 (fully autonomous) vehicles. NVIDIA believes that AI vehicle tech is creating a total addressable market in driverless cars that will reach $8 billion by 2025. The company only has $142 million in sales from its automotive segment in fiscal second quarter 2018, so investors should know that while there's lots of potential for NVIDIA in this space it's not a core business yet. NVIDIA's Drive PX Pegasus. Image source: NVIDIA. One of the biggest AI opportunities for NVIDIA is through its graphics processing units (GPUs), which power AI cloud computing services for Microsoft, Amazon, and even Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. All of these companies use NVIDIA's GPUs to allow developers and clients to access machine learning and deep learning services via their cloud services, and those markets are quickly expanding. Just recently, Microsoft and Amazon teamed up to release their own machine learning tools for developers to take on Google. Meanwhile, Google has created its own processor, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), for some of its own AI. Google still utilizes NVIDIA's GPUs for its cloud services, and it's clear from all of this competition that AI will remain a focal point for these tech giants. The AI investments these companies are making for their cloud services are helping expand the cloud computing market from $260 billion this year to $440 billion by 2020 according to Gartner research. That's good news for NVIDIA because it means that sales of GPUs are likely to grow as AI cloud computing services become more common. I've touched on two key AI opportunities for NVIDIA so far, but the company believes it has several others, including nascent markets like AI cities, that give it a total addressable market in AI of $40 billion. Data source: NVIDIA. Investors should know that NVIDIA doesn't break out its AI revenue specifically, mainly because it's the AI GPUs, which are sold across several of the company's business segments. As AI grows this could change, but it's safe to say that at this point AI is still a relatively small aspect of the company's top and bottom lines. But NVIDIA's competition in the GPU space is limited, which makes it an intriguing prospect for artificial intelligence investors. Intel is making its way in the AI space as well, and Google could transition to its own TPUs in the future, but more and more companies are transitioning to GPUs for their AI needs, and they're choosing NVIDIA right now. As NVIDIA continues to innovate, with new hardware like Pegasus, it's clear that the company should be able to maintain its lead in the artificial intelligence hardware market and bring big gains to investors at the same time.

Ashraf Eassa,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A few days ago, mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) announced its first processor aimed at cloud computing applications. The new chip likely represents the first serious competition from an ARM architecture-based processor that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which dominates the market for data center processors, has ever faced. Qualcomm's new chip, sold under the Centriq 2400-series brand, is manufactured using Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) 10nm LPE technology. Image source: Intel. One of the defining characteristics of a chip manufacturing technology is how densely packed the individual elements of the chip, known as transistors, can be. The higher the density, the more features, and functionality can be built into a given (tiny) physical footprint. Intel has long claimed that its technologies give it a significant lead on density compared to competing chip manufacturers like Samsung. I've long challenged this assertion, particularly as Intel's main competitors are both currently building mobile processors on 10nm technologies that are denser than Intel's currently available 14nm technology. If those contract chipmakers were only building mobile processors with their technologies, rather than products that directly competed with Intel's PC processors and data center chips, Intel could brush the situation off as trying to compare apples with oranges. Intel can't hide behind that excuse anymore. According to Intel's own metric for measuring the density capabilities of various manufacturing technologies, Samsung's 10nm LPE technology can stuff about 50 million transistors into a square millimeter. Intel says that its currently in production 14nm technology can cram 37.5 million transistors into a square millimeter. This means that Qualcomm is now shipping data center chips built using a technology that, by Intel's admission, produces a denser chip than what Intel currently uses to build its best data center chips. To make matters worse, Intel doesn't have a chance of regaining the lead for at least another two generations. Intel's next-generation data center processors, known as Cascade Lake, will be manufactured using a performance-enhanced version of the 14nm technology that's used now for its Skylake processors. Intel is likely to transition its data center processors to some variant of its 10nm technology (I believe it will be 10nm+ for the first 10nm Intel datacenter processor) in 2019, which should bring the company a large boost in density. Intel claims that its 10nm technology has an intrinsic density of around 100 million transistors per millimeter -- a near tripling of density. Image source: Intel. While Intel's 10nm technology can manufacture substantially denser chips than competing 10nm technologies, the reality is that by the time Intel brings its that 10nm technology into the data center, it will have to face off against chips built using foundry 7nm technologies. The good news is that Intel's 10nm technology will likely be roughly on par with the various foundry 7nm technologies that it'll ultimately compete with. (In fact, Intel's 10nm technology may even be slightly denser.) The bad news for Intel is that it'll still have gone from a clear leadership position on density at the beginning of its 14nm generation to essentially parity with its key competitors in 2019 and beyond. Intel's weakened competitive positioning with respect to chip manufacturing is due largely to the fact that the company's 10nm technology has been delayed by a matter of years. There is, of course, more to chip manufacturing technology than just pure density (performance and power efficiency are big differentiating factors in the quality of chips), but considering how significantly Intel has played up its claimed density advantage over the competition, that it has fallen behind Qualcomm in this metric is nothing short of disappointing.

Todd Campbell,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) just filed its quarterly holdings with the SEC, and that filing provides us with an opportunity to get inside the head of the world's best investor -- and potentially follow his footsteps into some profit-friendly stock picks. In the third quarter, the Oracle of Omaha didn't add any new stocks to Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio, but he did increase his bets on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Monsanto (NYSE:MON), and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF). Should you add these stocks to your portfolio, too? Once upon a time, Buffett told Steve Jobs to use the cash on Apple's balance sheet to buy Apple's stock. Jobs didn't listen, but even worse, Buffett didn't listen to himself, either. Buffett got a do-over when Apple's stock went into a tailspin because of a slowing of sales in China in 2016. This time around, he took his own advice and invested billions of dollars in Apple stock. He's been steadily increasing his position ever since. Image source: The Motley Fool. To say that Buffett's investment in Apple has been a success so far would be an understatement. Shares in Apple have been climbing for more than a year on enthusiasm for its next-generation iPhones. Many Apple users didn't upgrade when the last iPhone was released, and that's led many to believe that we're about to enter an iPhone upgrade supercycle. It will be a few quarters before we can really figure out just how many iPhone users are embracing the latest iteration of the iPhone, but that didn't stop Buffett from boosting his Apple bet by over 3.9 million shares last quarter. As of Sept. 30, Berkshire Hathaway owns 134.1 million Apple shares, and that means his investment in Apple is worth about $23 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's $182 billion equity portfolio. Where Apple shares go from here will depend on how strong sales are this holiday season for iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and HomePods. Unfamiliar with HomePod? It's a Siri-powered virtual assistant that will become available in December. While there are no guarantees on how the holiday season will shape up, I'm not willing to bet against Apple, and apparently, neither is Buffett. Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's third largest holding, and I doubt he'll be selling anytime soon. Instead, he'll probably continue to sit back, collect dividends, and watch as the supercycle pans out. Buffett isn't the only one who wants to own Monsanto. Bayer AG (NASDAQOTH:BAYRY) has been trying to win regulatory support to acquire Monsanto lock, stock, and barrel since last year. Berkshire Hathaway came into 2017 owning 8 million Monsanto shares, and in Q3, it increased its exposure to Monsanto by 10% to 8.8 million shares. Apparently, Buffett thinks the deal is making headway toward getting the official nod. Bayer is offering $127.50 per share in cash, or $63.5 billion including debt. Getting this merger done, however, is anything but a sure thing. The combination would create a seed and pesticides giant that could conceivably wind up with significant pricing power, particularly if it bundles together products in its contracts. For instance, an approval of this merger would mean that Bayer-Monsanto and DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP) would control over three-quarters of the U.S. market for corn seeds. That kind of concentration is stoking fears of rising prices, and as a result, farmers are lobbying hard for U.S. and EU regulators to block the deal. In August, the EU decided that Bayer AG was offering too little in the way of concessions to win an OK, so it opened a more in-depth review that's expected to lead to a decision in Q1 2018. In response, Bayer announced in early October a plan to sell various crop assets to BASF for $7 billion, if the deal is approved. It's anyone's guess what happens from here, but regulators OK'd Dow's tie-up with DuPont and also allowed a Chinese conglomerate to acquire Syngenta, so the odds of getting the deal approved might not be as bad as some think. Perhaps improving optimism that the combination will close is why Monsanto's share price has moved higher and closed some, but not all, of the gap to the offer price. Regardless, Monsanto doesn't appear to be the kind of long-term investment Buffett is famous for, so it might make more sense to pass on buying this stock unless you can afford the risk that the deal gets scuttled. Image source: Getty Images. Berkshire Hathaway cozied up to consumer-credit company Synchrony Financial in the second quarter when it bought 17.5 million shares. In the third quarter, the buying continued, as Berkshire's position climbed to 20.8 million shares worth $677 million. The position is relatively small for Berkshire, so it's likely that it's been Buffett's disciples who have decided to include Synchrony Financial in its portfolio. Nevertheless, it's an intriguing company that investors can consider buying. Synchrony Financial is the private-label credit card business that GE Capital formerly owned and that General Electric (NYSE:GE) spun off in 2015. It makes most of its money from credit cards issued under retail brand names, including Amazon.com. Shares fell into the bargain bin earlier this year, when Synchrony Financial wrote off more in bad debt than was expected. However, the company's third-quarter performance was solid, and with the holiday shopping season upon us, consumer credit spending should provide tailwinds. That's not to say that the charge-off situation isn't a problem, but it appears to be manageable. As a percentage of total average loan receivables, net charge-offs increased to 4.95% in Q3 from 4.39% last year. That's not a great trend, but consumers are purchasing more, and the average interest Synchrony Financial is collecting on accounts is growing. Third-quarter loan receivables were 9% higher year over year, net interest margin increased 40 basis points to 16.74%, and net interest income increased 11% year over year to $3.9 billion. Also, Synchrony Financial benefits from a growing online banking business that's providing it with a relatively inexpensive source of capital. In Q3, deposits grew to $54 billion, up 9%, and accounted for 73% of the company's loan funding, up from 71% last year. Overall, as long as the economy is growing, unemployment rates are low, and millennials continue to embrace online banking, Synchrony Financial should be able to grow its profit, and that makes it an interesting stock to buy.

Andrew Scurria,11162017,MarketWatch,11092017,"Published: Nov 15, 2017 8:12 p.m. ET Three former colleagues sue, claiming diluted compensation By Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross and the firm he founded were sued by three of his former colleagues who say WL Ross & Co. pocketed management fees from the general partnerships that handled its private-equity investments. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in New York State court, claims WL Ross covertly took management fees from general partner entities that the investment firm was only allowed to charge to passive, outside investors. David Storper, David Wax and Pamela Wilson said in the lawsuit they were required to invest their own money in return for stakes in those general partnerships, which they retained after leaving the firm. They said their partnership interests were a “significant part” of their compensation packages but were diluted when the firm took fees it wasn’t entitled to. “These charges are barred by the limited partnership agreements governing the private-equity funds,” the lawsuit said. “The agreements allow management fees to be charged to fund investors, not the general partners.” The plaintiffs said WL Ross reaped at least $48 million in management fees from the general partnerships that were “completely concealed” until the firm disclosed them on capital statements last year.

 ,11162017,MarketWatch,11092017,"Ed MorrisseyPosted at 12:01 pm on November 9, 2017 My, my, my … isn’t this an interesting coincidence? Just as Robert Mueller’s special counsel probe rolls out an indictment against Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates, the Department of Justice wants to play Let’s Make a Deal with his former son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai, the Wall Street Journal reported this morning. Is this a coincidence? Or is this something more? The Justice Department is seeking to reach a plea deal in its criminal investigation of the former son-in-law of Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s one-time campaign chairman, according to people familiar with the matter. The investigation into Jeffrey Yohai—who hasn’t been charged with any crime—by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles is separate from the Washington-based probe of his former father-in-law and others by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is examining Russian influence on last year’s presidential election, some of the people familiar with the situation said. Mr. Manafort was accused by Mr. Mueller in an indictment unsealed Oct. 30 with using a network of shell companies in the U.S. and abroad to avoid taxes and launder money, and with lying to investigators and defrauding banks on real-estate transactions. He pleaded not guilty. Although those charges didn’t appear to directly relate to Mr. Mueller’s investigation of whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election, they could be an effort to gain Mr. Manafort’s cooperation, legal experts said. Yohai makes an unnamed appearance in the Manafort indictment, mentioned as just his son-in-law, in connection with Manhattan real-estate deal allegedly funded by Manafort’s Cyprus money laundering.  Manafort told lenders that the condo was Yohai’s home, but was actually a rental property, a move that allowed him to get a bigger loan. According to the indictment, Manafort reminded Yohai in an e-mail to make the appraiser buy the fraudulent misrepresentation that he lived in the condo. So far, though, Yohai hasn’t been indicted in the Mueller probe. In fact, Yohai hasn’t yet been charged with anything, but clearly, the DoJ has something in mind. Yohai had an ongoing dispute with Manafort over four house-flipping properties, the WSJ reports, in a $4.2 million bankruptcy case that may have caught the DoJ’s attention. Yohai had complained to a federal court in California of a conspiracy by Manafort to mislead the court about supposed purchase inquiries within a bankruptcy proceeding. It doesn’t sound as though Yohai has much affection for his ex-father-in-law, nor the other way around either. If the DoJ wants to push Yohai into a deal, presumably that would either be to settle a difficult case or to get Yohai to cooperate as a material witness in another prosecution. Getting Yohai on board for the case might push Manafort closer to cooperating with Mueller on the rest of his probe. The DoJ isn’t handling the Manafort prosecution — Mueller’s special-counsel office will try the case — but the DoJ would have to settle their case with Yohai first before cooperating with Mueller. Are they working together to lace up Manafort’s case, or are they working at cross purposes? What would Yohai know about Russian interference or even Manafort’s alleged money laundering? Or, perhaps, one has nothing to do with the other, and this is all just a big coincidence. That seems highly unlikely, but it’s still a possibility. I wonder how much Manafort’s defense team believes in coincidences. Liar. Liar. “Northern California’s Camp Fire has torched more than 6,400 homes and killed 29 people since it began Thursday morning…” “Northern California’s Camp Fire has torched more than 6,400 homes and killed 29 people since it began Thursday morning…” Seaman’s manslaughter Seaman’s manslaughter And did the CEO lie to Congress about it?

Bob Sullivan,11162017,MarketWatch,11092017,"Published: Nov 13, 2017 10:16 a.m. ET Some housing firms are deploying a new build-to-rent model By Single-family rentals—either detached homes or townhomes—are developing faster than any other portion of the housing market. These rentals outpace both single-family home purchases and apartment-style living, according to the Urban Institute. “Almost all the housing demand in recent years has been filled by rental units,” says Sara Strochak, a research assistant with the Urban Institute. She also states that single-family rentals have gone up 30% within the last three years. This change is unique to newer generations. But when did rentals become so popular? And why are people more inclined to rent than to buy? Below, we’ll further discuss the rise in rentals and how it affects the housing market. The housing bubble collapse and the recession that followed shattered the decades-old tenet of American wisdom that you can’t go wrong buying a home. Most of the housing market fallout from the 2007-09 recession has finally receded—foreclosures and underwater mortgages are back to traditional levels and housing values have recovered in most places. But one thing hasn’t recovered: Americans’ unquestioned desire to own a home. Today, single-family rental homes and townhomes make up 35% of the country’s 44 million rental units, compared with 31% in 2006. Millennials are leading the way to single-family rentals, and myriad factors contribute to this trend. Many young adults aren’t in a hurry to lay down roots, whether they’re prone to traveling or simply aren’t ready to commit to one area or one home. Student loans and stagnant incomes can also make it harder to save up for a down payment. And it’s inevitable that young people who came of age during the housing bubble would be reluctant to take a leap of faith and commit to a 30-year mortgage. “While the age distribution of the U.S. population suggests most millennials are reaching the age of household formation and demand for single-family homes, much of this demand is likely to be channeled into the rental market,” says Strochak. However, it’s not just young people. Americans over 55 have also grown more interested in renting. According to RENTCafé, the number of renters aged over 55 has grown by a whopping 28% between 2009 and 2015. Many of them want to rent homes instead of apartments. From 2010 to 2016, single-family rental households in the U.S. increased by nearly 2 million—1.26 million of those renters were 34 to 65 years old, while just under a half million were 65 or older, according to a RENTCafé census data analysis provided by Adrian Rosenberg. In places like Miami, Houston, and Minneapolis, more than two-thirds of new single-family renters were over 65. When did home renting become so popular? The trend began with large firms buying up cheap homes during the recession and turning them into cash-generating rentals—often rented by families who’d lost their own homes or who could no longer qualify for mortgages. Institutional investors, which are organizations like banks, hedge funds, and mutual funds, gobbled up millions of single-family homes that fell into foreclosure. In Phoenix, for example, the total of single-family homes occupied by homeowners—instead of renters—dropped by 30,000 from 2007 to 2010. Two-thirds of those homes were bought by institutional investors, the Urban Institute says. But as prices have recovered, that business model no longer works. Instead, small-time landlords now dominate the market, explains Strochak. Investors who have fewer than 10 units own 87% of all single-family rentals, while investors who have only one rental unit own 45%. Big players continue to push the trend, some deploying a new build-to-rent model. Housing firms are actively building single-family homes intending to rent them rather than sell, says Attom Data Solutions, a firm that analyzes housing market data. “I can buy lots in areas that I can’t sell homes, but I can rent,” real-estate agent Adam Whitmire told Attom in a recent report. “The local economy may not have enough income or enough credit to buy but there is enough income to rent.” While big-time rental firms are backing off in some larger cities, the single-family rental investment play is picking up in smaller markets around the country in places like Dayton or Chattanooga, according to Attom. The movement to more single-family rentals is a mixed bag, says Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at Attom. On the one hand, the professionalization of the single-family rental industry is good for both families and neighborhoods, as there could be more standardized levels of maintenance and management services. But there will likely be “unintended consequences as the nature of some neighborhoods change,” Blomquist warns. Renters might not be as invested in communities as owners. “For example, people who want to own a home may no longer be as active in the typical suburban white picket fence neighborhood as properties in those neighborhoods become more prominently rentals,” he says. “That may push those home buyers back into more urban, walkable environments, or it might push them further out to more rural areas.” Renting a home instead of buying can be a sensible choice for those looking to break out of apartment life. It can even serve as a good halfway step toward owning, to make sure single-family home life is really for you before you commit to a mortgage. The main attraction to renting is obvious: buyers don’t need a large down payment to move in. While plenty of mortgage programs give would-be buyers a break on the traditional 20% down mortgage model, skyrocketing prices in urban areas like Seattle or Washington D.C. mean that even 5% can be a prohibitive down payment requirement. So renting might make sense if you are ready to live in a house. While all rental transactions are similar, there are a few things you should consider before moving to a home rental. If you’re moving from an apartment, utilities will probably be considerably more expensive—after all, you’ll be heating and cooling an entire home much of the year. There’s also quite a few more maintenance requirements, particularly if there’s a yard. Ensure your lease has clear terms regarding who pays for upkeep of the property. Gardening might seem appetizing if you are sick of your apartment, but it can be a year-round job, so make certain you’re ready for the extra work. If you want to paint the walls or make other changes, know that you will need permission in writing. Additionally, because you will inevitably have more possessions than in an apartment, it’s more important than ever to get renter’s insurance — your landlord’s policy likely won’t cover damage to or theft of your property. You should also consider liability insurance, in case you’re found responsible for any kind of accident at the property that causes personal or property damage. If you’re moving to a single-family rental for more space or for monetary reasons, remember to adjust your budget to accommodate the new utility and rental costs.

Icy rains will be coming soon to Sarpol-e-Zahab, hard hit by Sunday’s 7.3 magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 530 people and injured thousands. Survivors in other towns and villages nestled in the Zagros Mountains face the same tough conditions, still awaiting badly needed aid three days later. Iranian officials from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on down have urged quick distribution of supplies and relief material. However, logistical problems, alleged theft and other issues have plagued the response to the disaster in one of Iran’s predominantly Kurdish regions. Read more: Iran’s president launches probe into state-built homes destroyed by deadly earthquake “Our things are still in the house under the rubble, but nobody dares go and take them,” survivor Shahla Rezaei said. “We went inside to grab children’s school books and some other things but an aftershock hit and we had to escape.” Public order broke down in many areas as aid came in, with families not affected by the quake carting off aid intended for survivors, according to officials, who say police have been deployed to prevent further siphoning. Many in the Kurdish town of Sarpol-e-Zahab, home to half the casualties from the temblor, told The Associated Press that they still have not received aid and that they need help to remove debris so they can retrieve essential belongings. Reports said more than 12,000 tents were distributed in the area, though more than 30,000 houses were affected by the quake — 15,500 of them completely destroyed. That forced some residents to construct reed huts. Parastou Rezaei, a survivor and a mother of two, thanked those from other towns who came to give people blankets. “We do not have enough tents,” Rezaei said. “We have to make fire outside the tents at night and keep putting wood in it until morning to protect us from the cold.” Tofigh Merazi, a father of six, including a daughter with a broken leg in a cast, urged the government to provide some kind of shelter, even shipping containers. “Look at the leg of this child. It is broken. Where should we take her?” he asked. Iranian state television showed people in Bam, where a magnitude 6.6 earthquake killed 26,000 people in 2003, offering ton of dates to those affected. However, tents appeared to be the primary need. On Tuesday, Khamenei called for continued aid shipments to the area ahead of the “difficult cold season.” Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli told an open session of parliament Wednesday that a total of 36,000 tents had been sent to the region, including those already distributed. Authorities blamed the security situation on some aid not reaching those needing it. Morteza Salimi, of the Iranian Red Crescent, told state TV that despite there being enough aid, “there were some problems in distributing the relief. ... Safety and security were violated.” State media made a point to circulate images and video of Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, Iran’s oil minister who is a Kurd, visiting the region and speaking to those affected in Kurdish. Farsi remains the only governmentally recognized language in the country, though Kurdish and other minority languages are recognized at the provincial level and in local media. Newly constructed government housing in the region, which was devastated by Iran’s 1980s war with Iraq, collapsed. That’s raised questions about that housing project, known as “Mehr” or “kindness” in Farsi, which was a cornerstone of hard-line former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s populist appeal. Ahmadinejad’s supporters have dismissed the questions as a smear of his legacy. The official IRNA news agency said 530 were killed while state TV put the number at 432. At least 100 people are believed to have been buried by families in rural villages without going to authorities for death certificates, which may explain the discrepancy. The quake injured 9,388 people, according to a Wednesday report by the state-run IRNA news agency. The temblor hit about 31 kilometres outside the eastern Iraqi city of Halabja, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and struck 23.2 kilometres below the surface, a somewhat shallow depth that can amplify the damage. In Iraq, nine people were killed and 550 were injured, all in the country’s northern Kurdish region, according to the United Nations.

The man, identified as Lawrence Bruce Byron, was arrested while attempting to cross to the North from the South Korean county of Yeoncheon, some 40 miles north of Seoul, the person said. Five hours later, a North Korean soldier defected to the South at the most sensitive and heavily guarded part of the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean Peninsula, driving a jeep close to the border before sprinting across, under fire from North Korean forces. He is in critical condition in a South Korean hospital. Byron, who is in his 50s and from Louisiana, was arrested by the South Korean Army for attempting to enter the North without authorization from the Seoul government, the person said. Byron told authorities that he wanted to create peace in Korea by facilitating talks between Pyongyang and the U.S., the person said, adding that military police and intelligence officials who interrogated him don’t believe he is psychologically disturbed.

The remaining 11 trade ministers of the Trans-Pacific Partnership approved a trade agreement, which each country still needs to sign and ratify. The group was renamed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the world economic order.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); }); ""Ministers are pleased to announce that they have agreed on the core elements of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" the 11 nations said in a statement. The TPP was formed in February 2016 and spearheaded by former President Barack Obama to expand corporations' international markets and theoretically drive down costs for consumers and businesses.

In the deal, members would have tariff-free trade with one another. The nations hope the agreement will open markets specifically for agricultural products and digital services. In addition, it will help increase protections for intellectual property in some countries.

Paul Vieira,11162017,MarketWatch,11092017,"Published: Nov 12, 2017 4:38 p.m. ET TPP negotiations to continue after Canada’s disagreements By Eleven Pacific-Rim nations said Saturday that they had made significant progress toward reaching a major trade pact 10 months after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S., but disagreements from Canada prevented a final deal. Trade ministers said they had agreed on “core elements” of a revised version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership without America, a deal that still brings together Japan, Mexico and Australia and a host of other countries with a combined GDP of more than $10 trillion. An agreement would be a win for countries advocating a multilateral trading order at a time when Trump is pushing for bilateral deals and protectionism is rising globally. It would also provide a counterweight to rising Chinese influence in Asia and give the participants greater bargaining power in seeking other trade deals. Trade experts say that even without the U.S., the income gains could total more than $150 billion annually for members. Negotiators say they have left the door open for the U.S. to re-enter the pact at a later date, if desired. The effort to salvage the TPP has been the most-watched event at this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, an annual gathering of leaders from 21 nations including the U.S., China and Japan. The announcement comes a day after Trump gave a speech outlining U.S. rejection of a multilateral trade order and pushing for bilateral deals. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

Paul Vieira,11162017,MarketWatch,11092017,"Opinion  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events At the onset of his Asia trip, it was evident President Trump was following the guidance of his foreign policy and intelligence team. The Post’s Adam Taylor explains: As he set off from Washington a little over a week ago, there were some positive signs. Trump arrived in Tokyo to an enthusiastic welcome from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who courted the American leader with golf, hamburgers and “Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen.” In South Korea, where there were considerable worries that Trump would inflame tensions with Pyongyang, the president’s speech to the South Korean National Assembly was stern but measured — and largely well received by analysts in Seoul. In these early stops, Trump seemed to be offering a coherent vision for his Asia-Pacific policy — or, as the administration has dubbed it, the “Indo-Pacific.” The term has been used before by experts in the region, but it got its first unofficial U.S. government nod during a speech by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in October. It’s part of an effort to minimize the growing role of China in the region and instead emphasize the ties between the United States and the other democratic nations that form the newly reemergent “quad”: Japan, Australia and India. Weeks of staff work and intelligence agencies’ slideshow presentations, however, are no match for autocrats’ flattery. Trump was soon thrown off course by China’s pageantry and then his rendezvous with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump was back to elevating China, to the consternation of democratic allies. “Trump also emphasized that China and the United States were ‘the two largest economies and important engines of global economic growth’ and thus need to work together to help solve the world’s problems,” Taylor writes. “The statement clearly contradicted the spirit of the ‘Indo-Pacific,’ instead harking back to an older concept: the Group of Two, or G-2. That idea, which was popular during the early part of the Obama administration, suggests that the United States and China should form an informal special relationship to reflect their power in the world. For countries that feel threatened by Beijing, the G-2 concept is worrying.” Trump was soon odd man out with news that 11 countries are negotiating a new Trans-Pacific Partnership — without the United States. The United States is officially becoming “America last” in the region. Our allies will organize without us if need be to combat China, and we’ll be left shining President Xi Jinping’s shoes. Trump managed to undercut not only our economic dominance but our stature as the world’s leading democracy. Democratic values bind us to democratic allies and remain a thorn in China’s side. Whatever the game plan was, it became obvious Trump has little desire to ruffle Xi’s or the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte’s feathers with talk about human rights. They both get a pass and a green light to continue domestic repression. After all, they gave him such a lovely welcome. Besides, there is the Trump Tower in the Philippines. The disconnect between what the administration and its senior policymakers say is U.S. policy, on one hand, and what Trump conveys in words and atmospherics, on the other, continues to grow. One could blame Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for lack of influence with Trump. One could cite Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, who thinks his job is to take orders, salute and reinforce whatever Trump does (as opposed to delivering hard, candid advice and, yes, containing him). However, ultimately the administration is dysfunctional and ineffective on the world stage because the president lacks the intellectual focus and self-discipline to stick to the game plan. Perhaps his advance team should set down a new rule for his trips — no red-carpet greeting, no costumed children, no parades. They turn Trump’s spine into Jell-O and our foreign policy into hash.

But the president’s shift in tone failed to mollify the targets of his remarks back home, with former CIA Director John Brennan saying he believed Trump was trying to “delegitimize” the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia had interfered. “Considering the source of the criticism, I consider that criticism a badge of honor,” Brennan said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union. James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, appearing on the same program, said Russia poses a continuing threat and yet Trump insisted on “rolling out the red carpet” for Russian President Vladimir Putin. “The Russians do not harbor good intentions toward the United States, and there shouldn’t be any illusions or any ambiguity about that,” he said. “And our President fosters that ambiguity.” Trump is in the midst of a 10-day swing through Asia. Standing outside the Presidential Palace in Hanoi on Sunday with Vietnam President Trần Đại Quang, Trump begrudgingly acknowledged his acceptance of the intelligence report on the election issued earlier this year, He declined, however, when asked to answer with an affirmative yes or no about whether he believed the report was true.
