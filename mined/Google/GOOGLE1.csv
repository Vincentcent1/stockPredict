,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"(Reuters) - Alphabet’s Google is on track to purchase enough renewable energy to cover all its global electricity consumption next year, the company said on Tuesday. Google expects its purchases of wind and solar energy will be enough to cover its data centers and offices worldwide starting in 2017. Google began with a global target because companies often cannot specify what type of power utilities supply to their facilities, and renewable energy is unavailable in some key markets where it operates, particularly in Asia. The company will now focus on striking more regional deals where its data centers and other significant operations are located, said Gary Demasi, director of global infrastructure and energy. “We have to keep up with growth but also need to evolve beyond this very important milestone for Google, to be able to do renewable energy projects in every market where we operate,” he said. Google signed its first long-term renewable power agreement in 2010 and has since struck 19 similar deals, making it the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, Demasi said. The cost of wind energy has fallen 60 percent during that time, Demasi said, underscoring the business rationale for renewable energy. The focus on renewable energy may also help Google’s bid to expand its cloud computing business, he said, noting some prospective clients appear to be taking environmental impact into account. “To what degree it is a deciding factor on whether you go with Google or somebody else I can’t say, but it will likely be part of some companies’ equation,” he said. While the milestone announced Tuesday covers only Google, the company accounts for the majority of Alphabet’s energy consumption, Demasi said. Broader sustainability efforts involving other Alphabet companies are in the works, he added. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. tech giants including Facebook, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Microsoft will have to act faster to tackle online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so, the European Commission said on Sunday. The European Union (EU) executive’s warning comes six months after the companies signed up to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours, following rising concerns triggered by the refugee crisis and terror attacks. This included removing or disabling access to the content if necessary, better cooperation with civil society organizations and the promotion of “counter-narratives” to hate speech. The code of conduct is largely a continuation of efforts that the companies already take to counter hate speech on their websites, such as developing tools for people to report hateful content and training staff to handle such requests. However, a report commissioned by EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova showed that compliance with the code is far from satisfactory, the commission said. “In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40 percent of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours,” a Commission official said. “After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies.” The Commission said it may enact laws to force swifter action. “If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,” Jourova told the Financial Times. Her spokesman confirmed the comments. Jourova’s report showed an uneven pace across the 28-country bloc, with the removal rate of racist posts in Germany and France above 50 percent, but just 11 percent in Austria and 4 percent in Italy. EU justice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday. They are also expected to ask the companies to clarify issues including taking down “terrorist propaganda” and helping provide evidence to convict foreign fighters. ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"FRANKFURT/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia smartphones are poised for a comeback after former managers at the Finnish company licensed the handset brand from Microsoft and struck up partnerships with Google and phone manufacturer Foxconn. Nokia was once the world’s dominant cellphone maker but missed the shift to smartphones and then chose Microsoft’s unpopular Windows operating system for its “Lumia” range. Nokia quit smartphones in 2014 by selling its handset activities to Microsoft to focus on mobile network equipment. Microsoft continued selling Lumia smartphones under its own name but this year largely abandoned that business, too. “Consumers may be carrying different smartphones now, but are they really in love and loyal to those brands?” said Nummela in an interview. The Nokia consumer brand lives on as the badge on cheaper, entry-level “feature phones” sold mainly in Asia, India and Eastern Europe, though Microsoft invested little to market the name in recent years. Smartphones typically cost anywhere from ten to 30 times as much as these basic phones, which sell for as little as $20. “For a new entrant, having an established brand provides it with an instant on-ramp,” said mobile phone analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight, who suggested that phone vendors with weaker brands should not take the new challenge lightly. “The barriers to entry for the Android phone space are low,” said Wood. “What HMD has is the Nokia brand and management experience. The key to its success will be driving scale.” CEO Nummela, who was once responsible for Nokia’s sales and product development, does not lack ambition. “We want to be one of the key competitive players in the smartphone business,” he told Reuters. “We are not going to skip any markets in the long term,” Seiche said, adding that HMD had already set up offices in 40 locations around the world. HMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund run by Jean-Francois Baril, who was once in charge of Nokia’s world-leading supply chain management system. Other HMD managers have put in money of their own. Nummela says his team’s enduring relationships with phone service providers and retailers could help HMD quickly convince owners of Nokia feature phones to upgrade in markets like India, Indonesia and Russia. Shipments of Nokia feature phones plunged 40 percent in fiscal year 2015 and HMD must reverse that decline while trying to break back into the smartphone market, where hundreds of vendors compete by selling phones that can be hard to distinguish. “The feature phone is the essence of the business,” Wood said. “Don’t be under any illusions that this market is over.” ","

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"Social media companies are taking heat for influencing the outcomes of the U.S. presidential election and Brexit referendum by allowing fake news, misinformation campaigns and hate speech to spread. But Facebook and Twitter’s real sin was an act of omission: they failed to contribute to the data that democracy needs to thrive. While sitting on huge troves of information about public opinion and voter intent, social media firms watched as U.S. and UK pollsters, journalists, politicians and civil society groups made bad projections and poor decisions with the wrong information. The data these companies collect, for example, could have told us in real-time whether fake news was having an impact on voters. Information garnered from social media platforms could have boosted voter turnout as citizens realized the race was closer than the polls showed – and that their votes really would matter. Instead, these companies let the United States and UK tumble into a democratic deficit, with political institutions starved of quality data on public opinion. Legally, social media companies aren’t obligated to share data in the public interest. And what they can share is always shaped by users’ privacy settings, country-specific rules about selling personal information, and the particular deals companies like Facebook and Twitter make with third party businesses. But they are now the primary platforms for political conversation. As such, they should act in ways that support democratic practices, especially around sensitive political moments like elections. Facebook and Twitter have the ability to reach, and target, millions of voters. From the minute you sign up on one of these platforms, the companies use data about your behavior, interests, family and friends to recommend news and new social connections. And they sell this data to other companies for even deeper analysis on what you might buy and what you think about important social issues. By examining data about the connections you make and content you share, social media companies can make powerful inferences about whether you are likely to vote, how you are likely to vote, and what kinds of news or advertisements might encourage or discourage you to engage as a citizen. Social media firms regularly study the news consumption habits of users, producing fine-grained analysis of the causes and consequences of political polarization on its platform. To that end, only Facebook and Twitter know how pervasive fabricated news stories and misinformation campaigns have become during referendums and elections. They know who clicked on what links, how much time each user spent reading an “article,” and where the user was physically located. If the companies merged user data with other datasets – say, from credit card records or voter registration files – they may even know the user’s voting history and which political groups the user has donated to. These companies know enough about voter attitudes to serve up liberal news to liberals and conservative news to conservatives, or fake news to undecided voters. During the recent U.S. presidential election, there was a worrying amount of false information on both Facebook and Twitter, and research suggests that many users can’t distinguish between real and fabricated news. My own research on this “computational propaganda” shows that Facebook and Twitter can be easily used to poison political conversations. Trump campaigners were particularly good at using bots – basic software programs with communication skills – to propagate lies. Bogus news sites were started just to make money for their founders, but undoubtedly influenced some voters' view when manipulated images and false reports went viral. Several major U.S. tech companies have since announced steps to reign in fabricated news. In response to criticism about the spread of misinformation on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg described in a post some of the projects the company already has underway, including making it easier for users to report fake news. Facebook has also updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to this type of content. Google has said it is working to prevent websites that spread bogus news from using its advertising platform. But more can be done. While social media use has been on the rise, our systems for measuring public opinion have been breaking down. Telephone- and internet-based surveys are increasingly inaccurate. With so many people on mobile phones, consuming political content that comes to them through friends, family and Facebook, traditional polling companies no longer get a full picture of what the public knows and wants. For modern democracies to work, three kinds of polling systems need to be up and running. First, nationwide exit polls, which identify mistakes in how elections are run, helping to confirm or refute claims of fraud. For several decades exit polling was coordinated by major news outlets, but the coalition broke down in the United States in 2002 and 2005 in the UK. Today, exit polls are run haphazardly, and are more about predicting winners and outcomes than systematically checking the results. Second, democracies need a regular supply of public policy polls so that journalists, public policy makers, civic groups and elected officials can understand public opinion before and after voting day. Third, democracies need “deliberative polls” that put complex policy questions to representative groups of voters who are given time to evaluate the possible solutions. These kinds of polls engage citizens about public policy options through extended conversations with experts and each other. They lead to more informed decision-making. Companies like Facebook and Twitter manage the platforms over which most citizens in advanced democracies now talk about politics, and they could be the critical new platforms for these polling systems. They could never completely replace existing techniques for measuring public opinion. But our existing polling systems are weakening, and social media platforms have an obvious role to play. With the data at their disposal and the platforms they maintain, social media companies could raise standards for civility by refusing to accept ad revenue for placing fake news. They could let others audit and understand the algorithms that determine who sees what on a platform. Just as important, they could be the platforms for doing better opinion, exit and deliberative polling. This year, Facebook and Twitter watched as ways of measuring public opinion collapsed. Allowing fake news and computational propaganda to target specific voters is an act against democratic values. But withholding data about public opinion is the major crime against democracy.

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian media group Schibsted plans to add 200 people to its 1,800-strong technology team in the next year to further develop its online classified ads business and fend off competition from Facebook, its chief executive says. Schibsted holds market-leading positions in local classified advertising websites across Europe including Finn in Norway and Leboncoin in France, and has a big presence in Asia and Latin America. Everything from old ski clothes to cars are bought and sold on Schibsted’s sites while the company is recruiting heavily to deepen its offering in categories like real estate and jobs. Schibsted faces a test of whether it can fend off the likes of Facebook and Google, exploiting its local character in a $21 billion industry which McKinsey & Co sees growing at 10 percent annually. Facebook, which is searching for new ways to engage users, launched its “Marketplace” in October where people can buy and sell items locally, in what was seen as a step into the classified advertising market. Facebook must be taken “very seriously”, Schibsted Chief Executive Rolv Erik Ryssdal told Reuters in an interview. “So far, we think they are enlarging the total market, but we are watching very closely what they are doing,” he said. The classified ads business accounted for 38 percent of Schibsted’s revenues last year and 81 percent of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which amounted to 2 billion crowns ($239 million). The launch of Facebook’s Marketplace has weighed heavily on Schibsted shares, which have fallen 22 percent since October to trade around 177.6 crowns on Tuesday, a near 40 percent drop this year. “If Facebook is serious about this and willing to say ‘this is a game for me which I’m willing to play for the next five years’ I think they are in a very strong position to win this game,” said Thomas Schumacher, an online marketplace specialist at Digital McKinsey. With 6,800 employees in 30 countries, Schibsted dominates the classified ads market in much of Europe. South Africa’s Naspers runs Russia’s biggest classified ads site, while in the United States a range of players including letgo, eBay and start-up OfferUp compete in the market. Schibsted has been cutting costs in its newspaper division while spending more on its technology operations and recruiting in its five European technology hubs of London, Barcelona, Stockholm, Oslo and Krakow. In the past two years Schibsted has recruited a team of 100 in London. Facebook announced last month it would hire 500 new staff in Britain next year, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs there. Schibsted is investing in its mobile “boot sale” app Shpock which is available in six countries. It is also working to boost its professional content, aimed at commercial sellers, in real estate, jobs and cars - areas which it believes can generate greater revenues. Developers are working on products like messaging, automatic picture recognition and pricing tools for professionals. One Nordic fund manager with a position in Schibsted felt the Facebook threat had been overplayed as it looked like the social media giant was not planning much in the “professional” market. Ryssdal said it would require something very special to disrupt the markets that Schibsted dominates today. “Traditionally what Facebook and Google are good at is making big and scalable solutions while what we are good at is focusing on exactly what are we doing and then adapting to local markets both product-wise but also with boots on the ground,” he said.

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation, a group comprised of the leaders of a variety of major U.S. corporations including GE, GM, Boeing, Disney and IBM. Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive officer of major investment firm Blackstone Group LP, will chair the council. “My administration is committed to drawing on private sector expertise and cutting the government red tape that is holding back our businesses from hiring, innovating, and expanding right here in America,” Trump said in a statement announcing the formation of the council. Trump called Schwarzman earlier this week to ask for his help in chairing the council, according to a source familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly on the arrangements. The two men, who are not friends and have not done business together before, drafted a list of CEOs to ask to participate in the forum, and then Schwarzman asked each individual to participate. The forum could meet as frequently as monthly, the source said. Trump has said that his top priorities will include cutting regulations that affect business and lowering the corporate tax rate, positions business leaders have cheered. Presidents often convene councils of business leaders. President Barack Obama frequently met with the CEOs of large companies and often spoke before the Business Roundtable, comprised of CEOs of big corporations. In 2011, Obama convened a jobs council that was led by General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt and an export council headed by Xerox Corp CEO Ursula Burns. Obama and business leaders worked on trade, technology and immigration efforts. Some members of Trump’s council also served in advisory roles with Obama, including Bob Iger, the CEO of Walt Disney Co; Jim McNerney, former CEO of Boeing Co ; and Ginni Rometty, CEO of International Business Machines Corp. All three served on Obama’s export council and will continuing advising the next administration. Noticeably absent from the council are heads of leading U.S. technology companies such as Google’s parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc.

It will not go to 100 percent, because we will still make products, but you could easily see that the value-add comes more out of software than hardware.” Philips has repositioned itself as a health business after spinning off lighting, which has freed up capacity for acquisitions such as last year’s $1.2 billion purchase of blood vessel imaging firm Volcano. “M&A will play a more active role,” van Houten said during a visit to London, highlighting informatics, diagnostics, patient monitoring and homecare as areas for potential deals. Philips is betting on a new era of connected healthcare as smart connected devices in hospitals and at home feed data to doctors, insurers and drugmakers. But van Houten believes Philips’ existing standing with consumers can give it an edge. “Having a consumer brand helps us a lot. We will see more ambulatory care and there will be a lot of new ways to deliver healthcare ... and that means consumerism is going to play a bigger role.” The humble toothbrush may be a start. Philips already sells connected ones designed to encourage correct brushing in children and adults. In future, its toothbrushes could include a sensor to measure disease biomarkers in saliva. At the other end of the spectrum, the group is developing integrated solutions for cancer, such as a single workstation combining genomics, pathology and radiology that can give medics a complete picture of tumors. Philips’ full reinvention still has a little way to run. A sale of lighting components business Lumileds to Chinese buyers was blocked earlier this year by the United States on security grounds, although van Houten said he still hoped to clinch a deal before the end of the year.

,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden proposed rule changes for its taxis on Wednesday that may help ride-hailing services like Uber Technologies in the long term, but also recommended that profit-making ride-sharing should be illegal. A government-appointed commission said that Sweden should allow taxis to operate without meters, making it easier for drivers to use their own cars - a development that has helped firms like Uber undercut traditional services in other countries. Uber, which has faced setbacks in other parts of Europe, already offers taxi services in Sweden, but has to comply with the same regulations as other market players. It has faced protests, bans and legal action around the world including in the United States and much of Europe as its business model disrupts existing taxi services. The Swedish commission’s proposals would only allow use of unmetered cars if they are pre-booked and connected to a booking hub, which needs to collect data and make it available to the tax authorities. It also recommended that profit-making ride-sharing services, like UberPOP - recently suspended in Sweden - should be illegal. “This confirms that ride-sharing is different from driving other people at a charge,” Sweden’s infrastructure minister Anna Johansson told a press conference. Sweden, which deregulated its taxi sector almost three decades ago, decided last year to look at how to adapt its taxi and ride-sharing regulations. Uber, which launched in Europe five years ago, has faced  opposition from regular taxi companies and some local authorities who say it creates unfair competition because it is not bound by strict local licensing and safety rules. “Governments the world over have tried for decades to encourage ride-sharing,” Martin Hedevag, General Manager Uber Sweden, said in response to the Swedish commission’s proposals. “What was lacking was the technology to connect people, and an incentive for them to share their journey.” “The technology exists today but these proposals continue to prevent the real benefits of ride-sharing on a scale which can contribute to easing some of the greatest challenges facing our cities today - congestion and pollution - by helping get more people in fewer cars.” Uber is currently seeking to convince Europe’s top court that it is a digital service, not a transport company, in a case that could determine whether app-based startups should be exempt from strict laws meant for regular companies. It has been forced to suspend its UberPOP service, which relies on non-professional drivers using their own vehicles, in Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium. ","

(GOOGL) subsidiary Google has decided to do away with Content Keywords as part of its Search Console, which has come as no surprise given how outdated the feature had become. When included as part of the Search Console, the report is designed to show webmasters and hosts how Google understands their website and advise of potential hacks via Googlebot. But we're now approaching 2017, not 1997 when Webmaster Tools were a thing. Aside from the fact that the technology had gotten outdated, Google had also grown concerned about the level of confusion Content Keywords had generate with respect to how it ranks pages. Google's preferred method is Fetch and Render tool, which gives users detailed graphical analysis of what Googlebot sees when it crawls websites. Unlike what can be summed up from only keywords, the Fetch and Render tool, combined with Google’s Search Analytics report, offers a more robust method compiling data about websites and present it to site owners in a more comprehensive manner. Google, however, still considers keywords as important when it comes to how it assesses and interpret website content. In that regard, the company said: ”The words on your pages, the keywords if you will, are still important for Google’s (and your users’) understanding of your pages. While our systems have gotten better, they can’t read your mind: be clear about what your site is about, and what you’d like to be found for.” Should anyone be surprised by this move? Back in May John Mueller, Google's webmaster trends analyst, hinted that this was something the company was thinking about doing. This was the company's way of giving webmasters and SEO experts a way to prepare for what's to come.

This development ended the PIMCO fund's more than 20-year reign, according to The Wall Street Journal. While PTTRX dominated the space for some time, commanding nearly $300 billion worth of assets at one point, this legendary fund has suffered massive outflows within the last five years.

Internal corporate venture efforts are never easy in tech, but it does not appear to be precisely why Maris left, said sources. But there was apparently increasing tension, particularly with Google general counsel David Drummond, over autonomy at Google Ventures, similar to some other top Alphabet execs who have left, even if each departure was different. Since the summer, Alphabet has lost several key unit leaders: Tony Fadell, the Nest CEO; Chris Urmson, the CTO and former director of the self-driving car project; and, most recently, Google Access head Craig Barratt.

Kathleen Elkins,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Big companies take care of their interns. According to a recent poll, Facebook can pay interns up to $8,000 a month, while Snapchat has offered interns as much as $9,000 a month. Plus, many major companies also offer interns a housing stipend. The poll was conducted by Jesse Collins, who is finishing up his final semester at Purdue University and will be working for Seattle-based start-up Curalate post graduation. He asked nearly 600 new graduates and interns about offers received for start dates in 2017. He got 290 responses from new grads and 298 from interns. The findings were making the rounds on Friday after Collins, who conducted similar research last year, posted the data on Twitter and various tech community sites, including a Reddit subgroup and the Facebook page Hackathon Hackers. Collins provided CNBC with the full data set, which we've used below to highlight the salary and housing stipend per month that interns can earn at 15 major companies. Salary per month: $7,600 Housing stipend per month: $2,500 Salary per month: $6,600 Housing stipend per month: $1,000 Salary per month: $5,700 Housing stipend per month: $2,500 Salary per month: $6,900 Housing stipend per month: $1,700 Salary per month: $8,000 Housing stipend per month: $1,000 Salary per month: $7,100 Housing stipend per month: $1,500 Salary per month: $6,600 Housing stipend per month: $3,000 Salary per month: $7,800 Housing stipend per month: N/A Salary per month: $7,200 Housing stipend per month: $1,300 Salary per month: $7,500 Housing stipend per month: N/A Salary per month: $9,000 Housing stipend per month: $3,000 Salary per month: $9,000 Housing stipend per month: $1,500 Salary per month: $6,500 Housing stipend per month: $2,000 Salary per month: $7,500 Housing stipend per month: $1,000 Salary per month: $7,600 Housing stipend per month: $1,500 Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutesGlobal Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis Data also provided by © 2018 CNBC LLC.

Kathleen Elkins,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"These days, major companies don't skimp when it comes to starting salaries  and other exciting perks. According to a recent poll, companies such as Facebook, Google, Snapchat, and Twitter can offer six-figure annual salaries to new graduates — and that doesn't include stipends, stock options, and signing bonuses. The poll was conducted by Jesse Collins, who is finishing up his final semester at Purdue University and will be working for Seattle-based start-up Curalate post graduation. As of Friday, he received nearly 600 responses, 290 from new grads and 298 from interns, about offers received for start dates in 2017. (The survey is still open if you're interested in submitting your own job offer data.) The findings were making the rounds on Friday after Collins, who conducted similar research last year, posted the data on Twitter. The data in his tweet refers to the mode average, rather than the mean, so outliers and people who negotiated their salaries would not affect it. Crunching the numbers this way gives a better idea of the standard offers that these companies make, he explains to CNBC.

"Lucy Handley, special to CNBC",12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Sometimes humans simply aren't the best choice to star in an ad campaign: only an animated character will do. Cute cartoons can strum viewers' heartstrings (U.K. retailer John Lewis has used them in its Christmas ads four times in the past five years), as well as tackle difficult subjects (Melbourne's ""Dumb ways to die"" animated safety campaign won five Cannes Grand Prix in 2013). New research now aims to identify the brands that best use animation in their advertising, taking into account their design, execution, narrative idea, memorability and brand consistency. The Awesome Animation study by film (and admittedly, animation) company Gorilla Gorilla! assessed more than 220 brands from the FTSE100, Superbrands and Business Superbrands lists. Is it unsurprising that Google, Apple and Facebook come out top? They use animation to explain new developments (Facebook's Recommendations feature, Apple's Health app) and perhaps tech companies are more prone to using this style of ad creative as their subject matter can be more complex. Here are the advertisers that made it into the animated top ten. The tech giant was praised for its consistent tone of voice and the way it manages ""to balance a light-hearted touch with often detailed or complex subject matter"" when it uses animation. For example, its Project Sunroof ad explains how it created a map to show how much sunlight falls on roofs around the world, to help people work out whether it's worth them investing in solar panels. A look at Apple's YouTube channel reveals that most of its videos feature live action rather than animation to get its messages across, but in September 2016 it produced five ads for its Health app using animation. Its ""Mindfulness"" ad isn't about promoting what the app actually does – rather it explains how mindfulness can help people become ""less stressed"" and improve overall health. When Facebook launched its new ""Reactions"" feature in February 2016, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it was responding to people's desire to express ""love, awe, humor and sadness"". It created an animation starring a line-drawn orange dog to explain how the updated feature worked. Although Dropbox came fourth for its overall use of animation in ad campaigns, one of its executions was voted the best film of all the films the judges viewed. While arguably its product is less sexy than Google's, for example, (although the file-sharing site is worth $10.4bn) its ""What is Dropbox?"" animation beat all the others on the shortlist, and has been viewed nearly 7 million times on YouTube. ""Resist the siren call of short-term opportunity,"" breathes the U.K. actor Joanna Lumley in the company's ""Multi-asset investing – Sin 1: Lust"" ad execution. ""Finding immediate satisfaction can encourage impatient and short-sighted behavior,"" she continues, over an animation showing a pirate being lured by a mermaid. The ""Seven deadly sins"" campaign aimed to ""distill really complex messages,"" according to the brand's head of investment communications James Whiteman. IBM sought to use animation to simplify subjects such as online security threats, cloud data collection and new technology for cities. It has created ""5 in 5"" trend reports looking at innovations in sectors such as retail, education and healthcare, and in January 2016 produced an animated film to show how its technology maps the atmosphere to provide weather forecasts around the world. The brand – which used actor Bradley Cooper eating from a tub of ice cream to lure a beautiful woman in a 2013 advertising campaign –turned to animation in 2015 for a series of ads celebrating ""real relationships"". It worked with the U.K.'s School of Life to encourage couples to make an effort to pay more attention to each other on Valentine's Day. The U.K. food and clothing retailer used an animated film to explain the impact of its ""shwopping"" initiative, where consumers bring their unwanted clothes into its stores, for donation to charity Oxfam that sells or recycles them to raise money to help end poverty. Since 2008 it has raised £16 million ($20.35 million). Amex used animation for a July 2016 careers campaign profiling various roles at the company and aiming to position it as more of hybrid of commerce and ""digital science"" rather than simply a financial services brand. It aimed to reach a variety of audiences including college graduates and tech personnel for its innovation lab. U.K. energy company British Gas is no stranger to animated characters, having introduced Wilbur the penguin in a spot advertising insurance product HomeCare in 2015. This year, it used hand-drawn pictures of engineer Arfan in an ad explaining how he went out of his way to find a part for a boiler on a customer's wedding day.

Michelle Castillo,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Snapchat boasts one of the most popular apps among young people, growing interest among advertisers and — unlike other richly valued start-ups — is planning on going public next year. Does parent company Snap's growing digital ad business pose a threat to digital advertising leaders Facebook and Google? Not anytime soon, say ad industry experts. But it probably doesn't have to. Snap can build a lucrative and highly profitable billion-dollar ad business within the next few years, even if it doesn't rival the top players, according to analysts and several media executives. ""There's a lot of money to go around,"" said Cathy Boyle, principal analyst at eMarketer. ""The challenge for anyone outside those top five companies is how much is going to be left for all of them to share. ... There's still [ad] money to be moved from traditional channels into digital. That's where these other companies, anyone outside the top five, have the ability to compete to get those funds."" In addition to Google and Facebook, the others in the top five are Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. Snap Inc. recently filed paperwork for an initial public offering that values its company at more than $20 billion, according to Reuters. The company only comes in 18th on eMarketer's list of top global digital advertising revenue drivers in 2016, with the firm projecting it will make $370 million. For comparison, it estimates that Google will grab $63.11 billion in digital advertising revenue, while Facebook will bring in $25.94 billion. EMarketer has projected that global advertising revenue would reach $542.55 billion in 2016, while ZenithOptimedia pegged the figure at a slightly higher $579 billion. During the first half of 2016 in the U.S. alone, brands spent $32.7 billion on digital advertising, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Companies like Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent will make a considerable amount more than Snap Inc. in ad revenue this year, not to mention that they have a presence in Asian countries like China where Snapchat has yet to have a big user base. Other American companies like Microsoft, Yahoo, Twitter, Verizon and Amazon also get a large portion of digital advertising revenue. Part of Snap's current low ranking is that it is reliant on only mobile ad revenue, whereas its competitors can draw from display, search and mobile ad sales. EMarketer is predicting that Snap will make $940 million in global ad revenue in 2017. It also projects the company will bring in $1.76 billion in 2018, putting it ahead of Amazon's ad revenue. ""Depending on the marketer you speak to, I think [Snap Inc. is] definitely in the [digital ad] consideration set,"" John Sampogna, co-CEO at advertising agency Wondersauce. ""They're definitely in the conversations we're having with brands on ad spend. Snapchat tends to be more and more popular, and more importantly they understand their user."" Snapchat is especially growing in popularity as an advertising platform in developed ad markets like the U.S. and Canada. It appeals to younger, desirable audiences, and it currently boasts 150 million daily active users. Its sponsored lenses and filters, which require people to use branded materials in their posts, is a different kind of advertising that has been shown to have high engagement levels, Sampogna said. Snap said the average user plays around with a branded filter for 20 seconds. In addition, Snap only began to launch its current advertising offerings at Cannes in June 2015. (The company started offering advertising in October 2014, but those types of ads are no longer offered.) ""It's still early days,"" eMarketer's Boyle said. ""The user base has grown so quickly, and they've really introduced a lot of ad units, and improved their targeting since advertisers were critical of that."" One area Snap has been great at is allowing third-party companies to measure ad effectiveness, said Marla Kaplowitz, CEO of media agency MEC North America. Brands have been critical of Facebook recently, given the challenges with its video ads, she said. With the sound off, it makes the video advertising on Facebook more useful at building brand awareness than selling products, Kaplowitz said. However, some companies do aim for gaining name recognition with their digital campaigns over direct sales. In addition, Facebook admitted in September it had accidentally inflated the amount of time users spent viewing its videos. A view is counted when a user pays attention for just three seconds. Facebook allows advertisers to buy video according to different higher thresholds, for example, cost per thousand views (CPMs) or 10-second views. ""I do think Facebook is under a lot of scrutiny right now because of its measurements and what advertisers are actually getting,"" Kaplowitz said. ","Snapchat won't likely be a top ad player, but experts say it doesn't need to be"
Leslie Shaffer,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"Rumors swirled on social media on Tuesday that China's currency dropped sharply in overnight trade, but the purported move may have been an isolated hiccup from some providers. Some currency data providers were showing that the yuan tumbled, with the dollar fetching as much as 7.49 yuan in overnight trade. It wasn't clear if the data were indicating the offshore yuan  or the onshore currency, but the onshore currency does not trade overnight. That would have been an 8.8 percent rise for the currency pair from the onshore close of 6.8830, according to Reuters data. China's central bank does not allow the currency to move more than 2 percent from its daily fixing in onshore trade. While policymakers can not closely control offshore trade of the currency, it usually remains relatively close to its onshore counterpart. Data charts on Google and currency-data provider and money transfer service XE showed the short-lived blip. Google confirmed that the figure was a bug and that it was fixing it. In its Finance section, Google's disclaimers state that it can't guarantee the accuracy of foreign-exchange rates and advises confirming rates before making transactions. An email to XE sent outside office hours wasn't immediately returned. Dow Jones reported that U.K.-based brokerage and data provider ICAP was the source for the data. A call to ICAP's Singapore office went unanswered and it didn't immediately return an emailed request for comment. Google's data chart indicated that the data source was data provider SIX Financial Information. A call to SIX's Singapore office went unanswered and an emailed request for comment wasn't immediately returned. Analysts generally indicated to CNBC that they hadn't seen any sign of the drop. Reuters data didn't show anything close, indicating that the offshore dollar/yuan's high for the year was at 6.9650 and the onshore yuan's was at 6.9210. Sean Yokota, head of Asia strategy at SEB, told CNBC that people were sharing a screenshot on Chinese social media platform WeChat showing a mispricing in Google data showing the dollar was fetching 7.4 yuan. He noted that China's policymakers would likely want to avoid a devaluation of the currency. Indeed, analysts have recently noted that policymakers have appeared to slow the yuan's fall against the dollar as the greenback surged since the surprise U.S. election win of Donald Trump. Similarly, Richard Yetsenga, chief economist at ANZ, told CNBC that while there was a lot of chatter, it would be ""quite dramatic"" if the 7.48 figure were to turn out to be accurate, but he added that it was hard to imagine at this stage. The apparent hiccup didn't appear to affect trading in the currency on Tuesday. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan midpoint at 6.8575 against the dollar on Tuesday, suggesting a stronger yuan compared with a fix of 6.887 on Monday. In onshore trade, the dollar was fetching 6.8654 yuan at 10:23 a.m. HK/SIN, the Chinese currency's strongest against the greenback since mid-November. Offshore, the dollar was fetching 6.8691 yuan. In the wake of the Trump win, the yuan fell to nearly eight year lows against the dollar, touching its weakest since at least January 2009, during the global financial crisis, with analysts suggesting the slide had more to do with the dollar's strength. Some noted that, based on currency movements within the trade-weighted basket, policymakers appeared to be supporting the yuan somewhat. The Chinese currency likely received another fillip from a surge on Monday in the cost of borrowing the offshore yuan. Overnight Hibor, or the Hong Kong interbank offered rate, for the offshore yuan jumped to 12.38 percent on Monday from 7.16 percent on Friday. On Tuesday, the rate retraced some of the surge, to around 6.17 percent. Monday's sharp rise made it more expensive for traders to short the Chinese currency. Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA, said in a note Monday that the higher rates were discouraging short-term yuan trades. ""Dealers are in little mood to challenge state-owned banks dollar-selling flows, nor the exorbitant short-term yuan funding rates,"" signaling that the market was conceding the dollar/yuan pair's top was likely at 6.90 through year-end, he said, adding that traders were now looking to other vehicles to play a negative regional bias.

Jeniece Pettitt,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"There are at least 33 major corporations working on getting driverless cars on the road, from Google, to Ford, to Tesla, according to a CB Insights report. Now, a new player wants to join the game — a manufacturing robotics company. Pittsburgh-based Seegrid has been making vehicles drive autonomously for a dozen years. The company, founded in 2003, develops sensors and software to move industrial trucks around manufacturing facilities and distribution centers for companies like Whirlpool, Amazon, Volvo, BMW and Jaguar. Seegrid CEO Jim Rock said the technology has proven itself to be ready for the roads. ""We've done nearly 500,000 miles in actual customer production environments with no accidents,"" Rock said. Seegrid's vehicles navigate entirely proprietary stereo cameras that give the robots a depth of vision. ""It's just like the two eyes that are in human beings,"" said Jeff Christensen, Seegrid's vice president of products. ""You get a depth of field."" Autonomous vehicles use all kinds of sensors — including radar, ultrasound and cameras — but Christensen said the design leader has not yet been chosen by the industry. The primary sensor used by Google's and Uber's autonomous vehicles is Lidar, or light detection and ranging. It's the spinning contraption that you see on the top of Google's driverless cars. But Tesla, which recently announced it was adding autonomous driving hardware in all of its vehicles, ditched the pricey Lidar for cameras, which are more affordable. Telsa's cars will come equipped with eight monocular cameras going around the perimeter of the vehicle paired with radar to capture depth of field. Christensen said he applauds Telsa for using cameras as a primary sensor, but that stereo cameras would be a better choice. ""Then you can get both the image data and the ranging data from a single sensor,"" he said. Seegrid is not looking to build its own cars, but instead partner with an automaker and sell its sensor kit. The company has a prototype using a Nissan Leaf to test its sensors outside of a manufacturing setting for the first time. It jury-rigged its vision sensors into the car and has been testing it on the roads to gather data. Rock said its ""evidence grid"" software that captures and translates the data is what sets it apart from others in the industry. The prototype cannot yet drive on its own, but the company says the technology is ready and expects to have a more advanced prototype next year. The global autonomous vehicles market is expected to reach $65.3 billion by 2027, according to a report by Market Research Future.

Marguerite Ward,12082016,CNBC,12012016,"You wouldn't intentionally curb your chances of success. But unintentionally, you just might. Isabel Pesce Mattos, who goes by Bel Pesce, spent two years researching what makes people successful. The MIT educated entrepreneur who has interned at both Google and Microsoft finds that our biggest obstacles can be ourselves. In an inspiring TED talk given last year, Pesce explains the self-defeating mental tricks we play on ourselves. Today, she runs a for-profit school in Brazil that teaches people how to follow their dreams. Here are five ways to guarantee your own failure: Thinking someone got rich or became a star quickly is one of the most effective ways we kill our dreams. Take, for example, the stories we hear about a tech entrepreneur selling an app overnight for millions of dollars. That entrepreneur likely created 30 unsuccessful apps before that, Pesce says. ""Your overnight success story is always a result of what everything you've done in your life through that moment,"" the entrepreneur says. Believing the myth that someone else enjoyed instant success often makes you feel like your dreams are unrealistic or unlikely. Worse, it may make you feel that you simply have to wait for your own lucky day. Family and friends may have good or well-intentioned advice for you, but only you know what you want from your career, according to the entrepreneur. ""No one else has the perfect answers for your life,"" Pesce says. To help figure out your long-term goals, one former Google career coach has a counter-intuitive suggestion: Start fun projects either at work or in your personal life. There are a million reasons why a project, idea or a business could fall flat. But not pursuing a career dream is ultimately your fault, Pesce says.

When Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOG), released its third-quarter results in October, the company also announced a new, more aggressive share repurchase program. Alphabet's board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to about $7 billion of its Class C stock. While the repurchase program is probably a good idea, is it big enough to really make a difference? Image source: The Motley Fool. Alphabet's third-quarter announced repurchase program isn't its first. It follows a $5.1 billion repurchase program initiated in the third quarter of 2015. Interestingly, a review of how this program fared can provide some useful insights for the new program. The first thing to note about Alphabet's $5.1 repurchase program is that it was well-timed. Share repurchases have the biggest positive impact when they are executed at a lower stock price than where shares end up later on. Fortunately, Alphabet was able to purchase its shares at a discount with its $5.1 program. The stock is up about 20% since Alphabet started repurchasing shares. Further, since about half of this gain came after Alphabet had already exhausted its authorized $5.1 billion repurchases, the timing of the program was particularly keen. But because $5.1 billion is hardly a large sum given Alphabet's $521 billion market capitalization, and adding in the fact that Alphabet was averaging over a billion dollars every quarter on stock-based compensation, the net effect of these repurchases were more preventative than accretive when it came to reducing total share count. Indeed, Alphabet's Class C share count is actually higher in 2016 compared to 2015, despite the $5.1 billion repurchase program. GOOG Shares Outstanding data by YCharts. This isn't to say Alphabet's repurchase program isn't making a difference. Without these repurchases, Alphabet's share count would be even higher today. Further, since the repurchases were well timed, Alphabet essentially got more bang for its buck than it was actually spending. But this $5.1 billion repurchase program does show that Alphabet is going to need a much bigger authorization if the repurchases are going to have a meaningfully accretive impact on earnings per share. While Alphabet's new repurchase program is larger, it arguably doesn't represent the jump investors should be hoping for. Like its $5.1 billion program, the $7 billion program will likely also fail to reduce Alphabet's total share count, and it may even fail to fully take advantage of an opportunistic period. In Alphabet's third quarter alone, the company diluted shareholder ownership with $1.63 billion in stock-based compensation, up significantly from about $1.28 billion of stock-based compensation in the year-ago quarter. Assuming stock-based compensation continues to grow alongside Alphabet's expected revenue and net income growth throughout 2017, its stock-based compensation during the first twelve months of this program is likely to match or even exceed the $7 billion authorized for repurchases. Alphabet offices. Image source: Alphabet. And looking beyond the simple fact that Alphabet's share repurchase program isn't likely big enough to help reduce its share count, it's also arguable that Alphabet is simply hanging on to too much cash. In its most recent quarter, Alphabet's cash and cash equivalents hit $83 billion, up 14% from its $72.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Further, the search giant is generating significant free cash flow, or cash from operations less capital expenditures, every quarter. In its third quarter alone, Alphabet raked in $7.3 billion in free cash flow. The big question mark with Alphabet's new $7 billion repurchase program -- or any repurchase program for that matter -- is whether the timing of purchases will be right. While I'd personally argue that Alphabet's shares are still undervalued, a sell-off in the overall stock market, a recession, or unexpected competitive headwinds, could drive the stock lower and render Alphabet's conservative repurchases today great decisions in hindsight. But considering Alphabet's incredible lead in online search, paired with the company's heady cash flow, I'd bet investors would benefit more from an even larger repurchase program. Maybe Alphabet's decision to repurchase $7 billion this time around instead of $5.1 billion is the beginning of a trend that could turn into more aggressive repurchases down the road. But will Alphabet have missed a great opportunity by then? ","

    8 Easy-to-Use Budget Templates -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. You'll reach several milestone ages as you get older, and 62 is one of them. Specifically, the big change that happens when you turn 62 is that you'll be eligible for Social Security benefits for the first time. Here's what you need to know about claiming Social Security at 62 and a few things you need to consider before filling out your application. Image source: Getty Images. The most popular age for claiming Social Security benefits is -- you guessed it -- 62. If you're turning 62 in 2017 and start collecting Social Security, you can expect your benefit to be about 26% lower than it would be if you had waited until full retirement age. Your Social Security benefit depends on two main factors: your lifetime monthly average earnings and your age when you claim benefits. To calculate your lifetime monthly average earnings, each year's earnings on your Social Security work record is adjusted for inflation. The highest 35 years are averaged together and divided by 12 to determine your monthly average, which is applied to a formula. As of 2016, the Social Security benefits formula is: This formula calculates your primary insurance amount, or PIA, which is the benefit you'd be entitled to at full retirement age, which is between 66 and 67, depending on the year you were born. For those turning 62 in 2017 (born in 1955), full retirement age is 66 years and two months. For early retirement, your benefit is permanently reduced by 6 2/3% per year for up to three years before full retirement age and an additional 5% per year (5/12% per month) beyond three years. So, if you are turning 62 in 2017 and claim Social Security as soon as possible, you'll be claiming four years and two months early. Based on the reduction percentages, this translates to approximately 26% less than your benefit would be at full retirement age. You can see an estimate of your full retirement benefit, as well as an estimate of how claiming at 62 could affect it, by creating an account at www.ssa.gov and viewing your latest Social Security statement. In addition to the benefit reduction and whether or not a few extra years of benefits is worth it, there are some other things you should consider before deciding to file for benefits. For instance: This isn't an exhaustive list, and these factors should be considered along with other aspects of your life in order to decide the best Social Security age for you. Regardless of whether you plan to claim benefits at 62 or not, now that you've reached the age of eligibility, it's a good idea to learn the details of how Social Security works in order to formulate an action plan for you and your spouse. After weighing the pros and cons, if you decide that claiming your Social Security retirement benefit at 62 is the right move for you, you can apply on www.ssa.gov. This should take you about 15 minutes to do, or if you'd be more comfortable applying over the phone or in person at a Social Security office, these options are also available. You can apply for benefits to start at 62 as early as 61 years and nine months of age, and it's important to note that your benefits are paid out during the month after they're due. For example, your July Social Security benefit will be paid out in August. So, if you apply as early as possible, don't expect your first check until the month after your birthday. The good news if you change your mind after claiming your retirement benefit is that if you claim early, the Social Security Administration allows a one-time withdrawal of your application. The catch is that this do-over must be initiated within one year of claiming your benefit, and all of the money you receive from Social Security before withdrawing your application must be repaid. Obviously, this can be a large amount of money, and may or may not be practical for you to pay back all at once. Therefore, the decision of whether you should claim Social Security early or not should be taken very seriously, and the application withdrawal option should be used as a last resort. ","
      
    Turning 62 in 2017? Here's What You Need to Know -- The Motley Fool

Medical bills can be a huge burden even if you have a decent insurance plan in place. Thankfully, the IRS allows you to deduct medical expenses on your taxes. As long as you submit an itemized return, you can write off eligible deductible medical expenses that exceed a certain percentage of your income. Keeping an accurate record of your medical bills will help you know what to claim come tax time, so be sure to track all of your health-related expenses throughout the year. Image source: Getty Images. To claim the right deduction on your taxes, you'll need to know which medical expenses qualify. Generally speaking, you can deduct any out-of-pocket cost you incur for preventative care or medical treatment, including dental and vision care. In-office and prescription co-pays count as deductible medical expenses, as do medical appliances, such as hearing aids, crutches, and wheelchairs. You can also write off the cost of prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses. The IRS maintains a comprehensive list of deductible medical expenses on its website that you can consult when you prepare your taxes. Furthermore, you're allowed to deduct the expenses you incur for traveling to and from treatment centers, including mileage on your vehicle and parking. You can't, however, deduct medical expenses that your insurance provider reimburses you for. Furthermore, you can't deduct the cost of cosmetic procedures or non-prescription drugs. Though you're allowed to deduct eligible medical expenses to lower your tax liability, you can only do so if your out-of-pocket costs for the year exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income. Let's say your adjusted gross income for the year is $50,000, and you rack up $6,000 in medical bills. In that case, you'd be able to take a $1,000 medical expense deduction. Now if you're a senior looking to claim a medical deduction this year, you get a little more leeway. As long as you're 65 or older, you can claim a deduction for medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income; you don't need to reach that 10% threshold. However, this provision runs out at the end of 2016, at which point you'll only be able to deduct expenses that exceed 10% of your income. In order to claim a medical expense deduction, you must itemize on your tax return. Depending on your situation, it could make more sense to take the standard deduction rather than itemize, so be sure to run the numbers to see which scenario works out the most in your favor. Let's say you earn $50,000 a year and your effective tax rate is 25%. If you're eligible for a $2,000 medical expense deduction, you'll reduce your taxable income to $48,000, which will result in a savings of $500. But you won't get to subtract that $2,000 directly from your tax liability. Claiming deductible medical expenses could help you lower your taxes, so don't forget to save your receipts every time you shell out a co-pay or incur any sort of unreimbursed cost. Furthermore, if you use your vehicle to get to and from medical appointments, make sure to keep a detailed mileage log so you know how much to claim on your taxes. Though you're absolutely allowed to write off legitimate medical expenses as a deduction, it's important to be precise with what you claim to avoid IRS problems down the line. ","

Your bracket will depend on your income, current marital status, and whether you choose to file a joint or separate tax return. Here's a guide for determining the baseline for the tax bill you'll be calculating come 2018. Tax brackets are also known as marginal tax rates because they represent the rate you owe on your highest dollar of income. For example, the 10% tax bracket for single filers applies to your first $9,325 in taxable income for 2017. If you're a single filer, you'll only owe 10% on that portion of earnings, no matter how much you make overall. The 2017 tax brackets are the tax rates you'll pay on income earned in that calendar year, based on the tax return you'll file in 2018. For the return you'll file in 2017, you should refer to the 2016 tax brackets, which can be found here. The slight year-over-year increases are based on inflation as measured by growth in the Consumer Price Index. There are seven IRS tax brackets and four filing statuses. Here are the details about them, along with a quick way to calculate your baseline tax bill. Be aware that while there are some fractional dollar amounts in these charts, the IRS allows you to round your final calculated tax to the nearest whole dollar amount.

    Your Guide to Tax Brackets in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Timothy Green,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. The best businesses churn out cash faster than it can be used. Plenty of free cash flow (FCF) -- the amount of cash from operating activities left over after capital investments are made -- allows a company to invest in the future as well as return cash to shareholders. Dividends, buybacks, and acquisitions are all fueled by a company's free cash flow. What makes a company a cash cow? A high free cash flow margin (the percentage of revenue converted into FCF) and a high cash return on invested capital (how much FCF is generated from each dollar invested back into the business) usually indicate that a company is producing excessive amounts of cash. Here's why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) are three top cash cows. The PC market may not be on fire, but Microsoft continues to produce impressive profits. During fiscal 2016, which ended in June, Microsoft generated $25 billion of free cash flow, driven by Windows, Office, and the company's growing cloud-computing business. With revenue of $85.3 billion, that puts Microsoft's free cash flow margin at an impressive 29.3%. Image source: Microsoft. A quick look at the balance sheet shows that Microsoft doesn't quite know what to do with all of this cash. Net of debt, the company had nearly $60 billion in cash collecting dust at the end of fiscal 2016, despite paying a dividend and funding expansive share buybacks. Microsoft's cash return on invested capital is also impressive, clocking in at 19.9%. The excess cash on the balance sheet weighs this number down, but it's clear that cash invested back into the business generates an exceptional return. Microsoft is aggressively transforming into a cloud computing company,  shifting much of its software to a subscription model and rapidly growing its Azure cloud platform. Azure revenue is more than doubling each year, putting Microsoft in a strong No. 2 position behind Amazon.com's Web Services in the cloud infrastructure market. With the cloud business growing swiftly, Microsoft is making the necessary moves to retain its cash-cow status far into the future. Alphabet, despite its size, continues to grow at a double-digit pace. Revenue surged 20% year over year during the latest quarter, driven entirely by Google. Other Bets, which includes all of the company's other businesses and moonshots, remains a source of little revenue and substantial losses. Image source: Alphabet. Google's core advertising business drives incredible cash generation for the company. During the trailing-12-month period, Alphabet produced $23.5 billion of free cash flow on $85.5 billion of revenue. Free cash flow margin was an impressive 27.5%, nipping at the heels of Microsoft. Alphabet also has a mountain of cash on its balance sheet, totaling $79 billion net of debt. Cash return on invested capital is 17%, a bit lower than that of Microsoft. Google doesn't pay a dividend, but it did recently begin buying back its own shares. It certainly generates enough cash to return substantially more to shareholders in the future. Alphabet is showing no sign of slowing down, with its core Google business driving its results. Even if none of its moonshots work out, the company remains one of the biggest cash cows around. One of Disney's biggest cash-cow businesses, cable sports network ESPN, is facing an uncertain future, with a declining subscriber base and the ever-present threat of cord cutting. But the company remains an undisputed cash cow, with a broad set of business churning out billions each year. The company produced $8.4 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2016 on $55.6 billion of revenue. That's good for a free cash flow margin of about 15.1%. Image source: Disney. About half of Disney's operating income in 2016 came from its media networks, and about 87% of media network operating income came from cable networks. ESPN is the big hitter in that category, and its ongoing problems are a real concern. But other businesses are generating cash as well. Disney's parks and resorts spit out $3.3 billion of operating income during 2016, with the movie business contributing $2.7 billion and consumer products adding another $2 billion. Disney's cash return on invested capital isn't quite as impressive as Microsoft's or Alphabet's, coming in at a lower 12.5%. Still, Disney throws off enough cash to pay a decent dividend, spend billions on share buybacks, and fund acquisitions -- like Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012 -- that broaden its entertainment portfolio. ESPN represents a challenge, but Disney's cash-cow status allows it to make the investments necessary to drive long-term growth. ","

It's tough to top 1996, the first year medical marijuana was approved in a state (California), or 2012, when Colorado and Washington simultaneously became the first states to legalize the sale of recreational cannabis to adults aged 21 and up. However, in 2016 the pot industry saw residents in nine states vote on marijuana initiatives, with eight states (sorry Arizona) voting to approve their respective marijuana initiative or amendment. Following the 2016 elections, eight states (and Washington, D.C.) have recreational marijuana laws on the books, which is double where we began the year, and a whopping 28 states have now legalized medical cannabis. This year, five new states -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, North Dakota, and Arkansas -- have legalized the use of medical cannabis to treat certain ailments such as epilepsy, cancer, and glaucoma, to name a few. This rapid state-level expansion has business booming for the legal marijuana industry. Investment firm Cowen & Co. has projected that legal sales could climb from $6 billion today to $50 billion in a decade. That's great news for state and local governments that are looking for additional sources of revenue -- and an incredible opportunity for marijuana businesses. This expansion is also a big win for medical marijuana patients. Having more than half of all U.S. states legalize medical weed represents a major step forward in potential treatment pathways. Nationally, according to a 2015 CBS News poll, 84% of Americans want to see medical marijuana legalized nationwide. Yet marijuana remains a schedule 1, and therefore illicit, drug at the federal level, leaving states to pass cannabis laws individually. Furthermore, two dozen U.S. states, some of which are led by conservative lawmakers who oppose the expansion of marijuana, had neither an initiative nor a referendum, which could make it difficult for certain patients to gain access to medical marijuana. Image source: Getty Images. Of the 22 states that haven't legalized medical cannabis, some may never legalize it. However, the following three states could very well be the next to legalize medical marijuana, and one is quite the shocker. Medical cannabis supporters in Oklahoma tried diligently to get State Question 788 on the ballot prior to the November elections, but a battle in the Oklahoma Supreme Court squashed that hope. On one hand, Oklahomans have collected more 67,700 signatures in favor of putting a medical cannabis measure on the ballot to be voted on by residents. This was nearly 2,000 signatures more than was needed, and opponents didn't challenge the signatures collected. In short, it's not a question of whether a medical cannabis initiative will be voted on; it's just a matter of when. On the other hand, detailing the title of Question 788 has proven a sticky situation. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, long an ardent opponent of the expansion of cannabis, rewrote the title of the bill in such a way that the question appears to ask whether ""marijuana"" should be legalized in Oklahoma as opposed to ""medical marijuana."" Though readers would discover that medical marijuana is what's being voted on by reading further, the rewrite of the bill -- in particular the first sentence, which does not include the term ""medical"" -- is somewhat misleading, and proponents fear it could be defeated without the original title. Thus Question 788 is headed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court to decide whether the original title language can be used as opposed to Pruitt's modified title. Oklahomans may have to wait a while to find out the verdict, but a medical marijuana measure of some sorts is heading to ballots within the next two years, and it seems to have a decent shot of passing.

The Show-Me state was already one of the finalists on track to get a medical cannabis initiative on the 2016 ballot, but it wound up falling a few thousand votes short of the signatures needed when Secretary of State Jason Kander invalidated more than 10,000 signatures. Interestingly, however, Kander came out in support of using the legislative process to legalize medical cannabis shortly after the measure failed to collect enough signatures to get on the 2016 ballot. In a statement from the secretary of state's office, Kander said: While supporters of this important proposal can try to put it on the ballot again in two years, I believe it is time for the state legislature to step up. The Missouri General Assembly should pass legislation to allow medical marijuana so Missouri families that could greatly benefit from it don't have to watch their loved ones continue suffering. If the legislature is not willing to do that, they should at least put the measure on the ballot themselves in 2018 to give Missouri voters the opportunity to decide on the issue. With Kander in their corner and marijuana advocacy groups now focusing their attention on Missouri, a medical marijuana measure looks to have a good shot at being on the 2018 ballot -- and probably passing based on national sentiment toward medical pot. Image source: Pixabay. Remember that shocker I promised? Well, this is it. The Lone Star state of Texas could be in a prime position to legalize medical marijuana within the next two years. Historically, Republican-led states are a tough sell for medical or recreational cannabis. Speaking generally, Republican lawmakers take a pretty conservative approach to marijuana use, with many avoiding legalization within their respective states. Texas is a longtime Republican stronghold, so it would seem likely that medical cannabis will remain illegal. However, times could be changing. Earlier this year, Senate Bill 339 surprisingly passed in both the state's House and Senate, and Gov. Greg Abbott signed it into law. This bill allows patients suffering from a rare form of epilepsy access to cannabidiol, or CBD, the non-psychoactive component of marijuana. Furthermore, at the State Convention of the Republican Party of Texas, Republicans approved part of a platform calling for a law to ""allow doctors to determine the appropriate use of cannabis to prescribed patients."" The Texas Department of Public Safety is set to begin granting CBD permits in June 2017, and it's possible an expansion of medical marijuana's use could soon follow. Legalizing medical marijuana in Texas could also generate substantial sales on the order of $2 billion to $3 billion annually. This isn't to say that Texas is having difficulty meeting its budgetary needs, but the tax revenue generated from medical cannabis would further buoy the state's budget. A fairly recent Texas Tegna Poll found 71% support for legalizing medical pot in the state compared to just 19% opposition. The remainder were undecided. This overwhelming support, coupled with a softening legislative stance and some very large dollar figures, could push Texas to legalize medical cannabis by 2018. ","
      
    3 States That May Legalize Medical Marijuana Next (1 Is a Big Surprise) -- The Motley Fool

Huawei became the most profitable Android smartphone maker during the third quarter according to Strategy Analytics. The research firm states that the Chinese tech giant claimed 2.4% ($200 million) of all smartphone operating profits worldwide during the quarter. Image source: Huawei. That's a pretty steep drop for Samsung, which was consistently the most profitable Android device maker in previous years. Let's see how Huawei displaced Samsung, and whether or not that lead can last. Huawei's mobile division posted 74% sales growth last year and accounted for a third of the company's top line. Its smartphone shipments surged 25% during the first half of 2016 to 61 million units, crushing the average industry growth rate of 3%. That growth made it the biggest smartphone maker in China, beating out its domestic rivals Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi -- in that order. Huawei initially mimicked Xiaomi's strategies of selling high-end hardware at paper-thin margins and selling devices online instead of at brick-and-mortar locations. However, Huawei recently started manufacturing its devices in India, which reduced its production costs. Meanwhile, Chinese consumers started buying more expensive premium devices, giving Huawei more freedom to move upmarket with pricier products like the P9. Huawei's P9. Image source: Huawei. Huawei's patent portfolio (from its core telecom equipment business) gave the Chinese company the strength to expand overseas. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google also had Huawei create its well-received Nexus 6P flagship device, and Huawei partnered with German optics and camera maker Leica to create a standout dual-lens camera for its P9 flagship. That combination of higher sales, lower manufacturing costs, upmarket appeal, and overseas expansion have enabled Huawei to make a profit from its Android devices -- something that many rivals, including Xiaomi, have failed to do. Samsung mainly lost its crown to Huawei due to declining device shipments related to the Note 7 fiasco. However, the company has since stopped manufacturing the device, and most analysts expect Samsung to recover over the next few quarters. A recent Reuters/Ipsos survey also found that the debacle hadn't hurt the company's brand appeal. Therefore, a new flagship launch next year could help Samsung regain lost ground from Huawei and other rivals in China -- especially among affluent urban customers who favor status symbol devices from Samsung and Apple. Huawei is now the most profitable Android device maker, but its 2.4% operating profit share pales in comparison to Apple's whopping 91% share ($8.19 billion). That percentage is remarkable when we consider that Apple only controls around 12% of the smartphone market, according to IDC, while Samsung and Huawei respectively hold shares of 23% and 9%. Image source: Apple. Strategy Analytics director Linda Sui attributes those ""monster profits"" to ""Apple's ability to maximize pricing and minimize production."" Its overall profitability was also amplified by the fact that other vendors, like HTC and LG, had negative margins. It also demonstrates how Apple's ""walled garden"" approach of controlling its hardware and operating system shields it from market commoditization. Android users can easily switch between expensive and cheap devices without leaving Google's ecosystem, which helps Google but hurts hardware makers. Apple users, however, are ""locked in"" to the iOS ecosystem -- meaning that they lose all their digital purchases and content if they switch to Android. That advantage gives Apple tremendous pricing power, and ensures that it will stay much more profitable than its Android rivals for the foreseeable future. The Android OEM market is a brutally competitive one, and only larger companies like Huawei and Samsung can squeeze out profits with economies of scale. That's bad news for also-ran Android players like HTC and LG, which will likely keep losing money as a handful of bigger players gobble up all the profits in the market. ","

Ah, the holidays -- a time for giving, receiving, and most likely overspending. In a recent survey, 56% of Americans admitted they're planning to rack up debt this season, 16% of which expect it to take six months or more to pay off. So, just how much does the average American spend on holiday gifts? According to the American Research Group, U.S. shoppers anticipate spending an average of $929 this season. Talk to parents, though, and you might see that number climb even higher. Newly released T. Rowe Price data confirms that parents are spending an average of $422 per child on holiday gifts, with 34% of parents spending $500 or more per child. Image source: Getty Images. Worse yet, an alarming number of parents are putting their finances at risk to make their kids' holiday wishes come true. An estimated 25% are taking drastic measures such as withdrawing money from their 401(k)s, dipping into their emergency savings, or taking out payday loans in order to purchase holiday gifts. And while a fair number of parents understand the importance of creating a holiday budget, a good 58% of families fail to actually stick to one. No matter how much you earn and who you're shopping for, it's critical that you adhere to your holiday budget and avoid going overboard. Otherwise, you run the very real risk of getting in way over your head. It's one thing to reach into a savings account and pull out the money you've been stashing away all year long to pay for holiday gifts, but whipping out that credit card is a whole different story. Any time you use a credit card and fail to pay it off when your bill comes due, whether it's a $10 charge or a $1,000 charge, you're automatically signing up to throw away money on interest. And the longer you carry a balance, the more money you'll waste. Imagine you wind up spending $929 on holiday gifts this year like the average American, and that you're forced to put all of your purchases on a credit card charging 18% interest. If it takes you a year to pay off that debt, you'll wind up spending $1,022 in total -- that's almost $100 thrown away in interest. Carry that balance an extra year, and you'll waste $184 on interest charges. While there are plenty of good reasons to pay with plastic this holiday season, remember that credit cards are a dangerous thing when you don't have the money to pay them off right away. Image source: Getty Images. It's easy enough to overspend during the holidays, so rather than charge up a storm or tap into savings you shouldn't be touching, try putting a little bit of cash aside each month in advance. Granted, it's probably too late to take that approach this year, but it's something to think about going into 2017. Furthermore, if you're going to map out a holiday budget, for the love of Santa, make sure you stick to it. If you estimate that you can afford to spend $500 this holiday season and not a penny more, withdraw $500 in cash, take that amount with you when you go to shop, and leave the rest of your wallet at home.

Image source: J.M. Smucker Company. The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) released its fiscal second-quarter earnings last month. Results came in mixed, but investors have been told that 2017 and beyond will be different from times past. The company is busy working on the results of a long stretch of growth driven by acquisition over the last decade and a half, so the mixed numbers are to be expected. Second-quarter top-line sales were down 8% from the same period last year. The big drop was caused by a trio of problems including the sale of its canned milk business, further declines in the pet food business, and lower prices especially in the peanut butter and coffee divisions. However, excluding the sale of the canned milk business and subsequent loss of sales, the top line dropped by a slightly less scary 5%. While falling sales are never welcome, the company's previous outlook called for falling sales that would begin to recover during 2017. That outlook was reiterated during the last report. The bottom line was a much different story. Earnings per share were up 3% driven by cost savings and share repurchases. Smucker is looking to drive costs down further through the year by looking for synergies between the different brands in the J.M. Smucker Company stable. Based on the company's investor day held back in June, Smucker is no longer looking for sales growth, but instead is trying to return value to shareholders by increasing profits. Viewed in this light, the mixed report looks like more of a success. Even so, the slide in sales will still need to reverse course if the company wants to continue to drive profitability growth in the long term. Since the early 2000s, the food conglomerate has expanded by buying other names, including Jif peanut butter in 2002, Pillsbury baked goods in 2004, and Folgers coffee in 2008. The latest acquisition, Big Heart Pet Brands, was made in early 2015. As a result of the multiyear spending spree, net sales have grown 10% per year in the past five years. Free cash flow, or cash left over for the company after paying for normal operations and expansion efforts, has expanded from $211 million in 2011 to $1.3 billion last fiscal year. Content for the moment with the list of names under its control, Smucker is now looking for long-term average sales growth of only 3% a year, but average earnings-per-share growth of 8%. Streamlining operations, reducing debt, and reinvesting in existing brands will be the name of the game to accomplish those goals. Bearing in mind the company's long-term goals, here is a breakdown of last quarter's segment performance: Segment Sales Growth Profit Growth Factors Impacting Performance Coffee (6%) 3% Price reductions impacted sales, more than offset by overhead and commodity cost reductions. Consumer foods (13%) (7%) Adjusting for the sale of the canned milk business, sales and profit were a much friendlier -4% and 3%, respectively. Pet food (6%) 0% Profit was essentially flat despite declining sales because of overhead cost reduction. International and foodservice (3%) (7%) The smallest segment of the company was also negatively impacted by the sale of the canned milk business. At the end of the day, it is important for investors to bear in mind the reason for owning J.M. Smucker Company stock: The strategy of fueling high-octane sales growth via acquisitions is gone, replaced with a focus on overhead reduction, brand reinvestment, and value being returned to shareholders. Rather than focus on overall sales, investors should stay tuned to bottom-line profit and free cash flow generation. Data by YCharts. The company is betting specifically on pet food and coffee to provide the biggest shot in the arm, but investors will need to be patient. Smucker sees top-line declines slowing down for pet food, and shoppers can find a new premium line of pet chow called Nature's Recipe by the end of the year. Also keep an eye on continued cost reductions in coffee and food, which will help impact the bottom line over time. ","

Global consulting firm Bain & Company dethroned Airbnb from the No. 1 spot with an average rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars. It was the third time in the last nine years of the study winning first place on Glassdoor’s list. Employees at the company cited a fast-paced, dynamic work environment and supportive colleagues that help them to advance in their careers as big draws. Airbnb took a steep dive to No. 35 this year from No. 1 last year after its rating fell from 4.6 to 4.2. The drop for the home rental site can be attributed to shifts in company policies as the startup prepares for an IPO, said Allison Berry, a spokeswoman at Glassdoor. “This is a common theme as a company grows and prepares to go public — it becomes harder to access higher leadership and manage work-life balance,” she said. “It still is very highly rated.” Airbnb spokeswoman Brittany Cornejo said, “We strive to create a work environment where all of our employees feel welcome, appreciated and inspired by the work they’re doing everyday.” She added that the company is expanding some of its benefits for 2017, such as matching 401(k) contributions. Facebook came in second, with one employee surveyed citing Facebook’s “openness and diversity.” as a benefit of the company. Facebook upped its diversity efforts in 2016, but as of August only 2% of employees were black and 4% Hispanic — the same as the past two years. Women make up 33% of Facebook’s workforce, a 2% increase from 2014.

The study from job listing and recruiting website Glassdoor defined large companies as those with more than 1,000 employees. It drew on reviews from employees based on their company experience over the past year, rating compensation and benefits, culture and values, and work environment. While many of the names on the list are recognizable tech companies and corporations, the top spots aren’t limited to Silicon Valley startups — In-N-Out Burger, a West Coast fast-food chain, took the No. 7 spot due to its “great positive atmosphere,” as one employee put it. Other companies like cleaning supply company Clorox and aerospace manufacturer SpaceX made the list for the first time. In order to qualify for the study, large companies have to have at least 75 reviews in the past year.

                                   expanded its analysis of the impact of deflation beyond the “commodity cost of milk and eggs… to average unit retail price deflation,” said the company’s chief executive, Todd Vasos, on the Thursday earnings call, according to the FactSet transcript. The company found that the impact was greater in the third quarter than the second. “We estimate that the combined headwinds from the average unit retail price deflation and reduction of SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the third quarter by approximately 150 to 175 basis points and for our second quarter by approximately 100 to 115 basis points,” said Vasos. SNAP refers to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is the government’s food stamp program. Dollar General says it made price investments in approximately 450 items in about 17% of its store base during the third quarter. To improve store traffic and market share, the discount retailer made investments in labor and marketing in select areas as well. “[W]hile some of the third-quarter investments resulted in a desired performance, others did not,” said Vasos. “For instance, we invested in incremental promotional activity to drive traffic although results were mixed and did not meet our overall expectations.” Dollar General reported earnings per share of 84 cents, down from 86 cents last year and below the 93-cent FactSet consensus. Sales were $5.32 billion, up from $5.07 billion last year but missing the $5.36 billion FactSet estimate. Same-store sales were down 0.1%, also missing the FactSet consensus for a 0.6% increase.

Barbara Kollmeyer,12082016,MarketWatch,12012016,"Published: Dec 7, 2016 11:36 a.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By If you’re wondering what keeps driving this market onward to fresh highs and past one potential black/gray swan after another, there are a couple of likely contenders. Here’s how one analyst sums up the recent action, as the Dow

                                   managed its 20th record close of the year Tuesday: “With the bulk of the 2016 risk events out of the way, there is a feeling of positivity spreading through the markets, as investors look forward to a potential Santa rally,” says IG market analyst Joshua Mahoney. But if you prefer to snarl like a Grinch at such holiday cheer, then check out our chart of the day, which shows another human emotion could be pushing equities along. The pointer on the latest CNN Money Fear and Greed Index has shifted to “extreme greed” from just “greed” a week ago, and from “extreme fear” a month ago: That needle swing suggests investors are feeling confident enough to jump into riskier assets such as junk bonds, while moving out of safe-haven assets and into stocks. Granted, a lot has happened in the past month. Maybe investors should be forgiven for their gluttonous behavior as a reward for getting through some pretty rocky events — the U.S. election, the ongoing Brexit saga and the recent Italian referendum. Extreme greed has accompanied some worrying moments in financial history, such as the 1990s dot-com bust. But here’s another chart from CNN, tracking the index over the past three years. It shows investors have been greedier this year than they are today. They were even greedier in 2014, when the S&P 500 ended up 11%: How worried should we be? Our call of the day maintains that it will take more than hoggish investors to stop this market from moving higher.

Read: How Italy’s ‘no’ vote might be the ECB’s silver lining Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, weighed in on the whole “irrational exuberance” issue. He says, sure, active managers have been piling into equities and other markers show pretty bullish investors — but don’t worry too much. “We would rate the overall sentiment backdrop as a near-term concern, but by no means are we seeing the over-the-top type of euphoria seen at major peaks,” White said in a note to clients. He points to this chart, which shows no major divergences between confident consumers and the stock market. In the past, such movements have thrown up major red flags: White sees equity valuations as stretched, but not to an extreme extent. And even then, he notes that price/earnings ratios haven’t really been much of an indicator for stock market performance over the years.

Fields said Ford plans to lobby Trump to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules. They hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand, he said. “In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 per cent of the industry,” Fields said. “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 per cent.” This isn’t a formula for success, he said. “You’ve got to have customers, so obviously there would be pressure on the business if there’s not a market,” he said. The No. 2 U.S. carmaker was one of the companies that Trump singled out during his campaign for sending production to Mexico. The Republican threatened to slap a 35 per cent tariff on cars that Ford builds in Mexico and ships to the U.S. After the election, Trump phoned executive chairman Bill Ford to discuss the carmaker’s plan to move manufacturing of the Lincoln MKC sport-utility vehicle to Mexico from a plant in Louisville, Ky., Fields said. The discussion helped persuade Ford to keep building the Lincoln in the U.S. Trump influenced the decision “because of what he’s talking about in terms of his economic policies, whether it’s tax reform or otherwise,” Fields said. Ford received no incentives for keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky, though the automaker never planned to close that Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape crossover that outsells the Lincoln version 12 to 1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan and the Fusion family car in Mexico. It’s building a new $1.6 billion small-car factory in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, which will create 2,800 jobs there by 2020. Ford still plans to move its Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico from a Michigan factory. Since 2010, nine automakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, have announced investments of more than $24 billion in Mexico, where wages are 80 per cent lower than in the U.S. Annual auto output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. Ford has said it’s just the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in Mexico while it’s the top automotive manufacturer in the U.S. The company said it’s added nearly 28,000 jobs in the U.S. over the past five years. Ford employs 85,000 workers in the U.S. and 8,800 in Mexico. The day after the election, General Motors announced it would end the third shift at assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan in January. The automaker is eliminating almost 2,100 jobs because consumers prefer trucks and sport utility vehicles over the small cars built at the two factories.

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Google signed an agreement with the Cuban government on Monday granting internet users on the Communist-run island quicker access to its branded content. Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc, signed the deal with Mayra Arevich Marin, president of state telecommunications monopoly ETECSA. It grants Cubans speedy access to the Google Global Cache network, which stores content from sites like Gmail and YouTube on servers located closer to end users. In a country where public internet access is limited to slow and expensive Wi-Fi hot spots, it was not clear how the deal would actually impact service in the short term. “This deal allows ETECSA to use our technology to reduce latency by caching some of our most popular high bandwidth content like YouTube videos at a local level,” a Google statement said. “This may improve reception of cached materials, but not for example email which depends on local bandwidth,” a local telecommunications technician said, requesting anonymity for fear of losing his job. Google and ETECSA were not immediately available for comment. President Barack Obama has made improved internet access a central part of his efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, first announced two years ago. However, Cuba to date has balked at allowing U.S. companies to participate in wiring the country, citing national security concerns. Whether because of a lack of investment or concerns about the flow of information in a Communist state that monopolizes the media, Cuba has lagged behind in internet usage. Only 5.6  percent of Cuban homes had either intranet or internet access last year, according to a U.N. agency. The Google deal comes as officials in Havana and Washington are working to wrap up pending commercial accords before President Barack Obama leaves office next month. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap detente between the Cold War foes unless Cuba makes political and other concessions. Improved bilateral relations have been accomplished through executive orders circumventing trade embargo laws and can easily be reversed by Trump. The Obama administration has said it hopes increased commercial links between the two countries will make it difficult for future administrations to undo the recent warming in U.S.-Cuba relations. (Corrects figure in 9th paragraph on homes connected to internet or Cuba intranet, to 5.6 percent instead of 3.4 percent.) ","

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"Although no deals were announced, the move signals a desire to finally monetize the company’s valuable research amid fierce competition from a score of rivals all vying to be the first to launch production-ready self-driving cars. “It’s an indication of the maturity of our technology,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive, told reporters at a press conference in San Francisco. “We can imagine our self-driving tech being used in all sorts of areas.” The move shows “confidence that we are close to bringing this (technology) to a lot of people,” Krafcik said. “We’ve sort of reached an inflection point.” That came in October 2015, when one of the company’s self-driving cars gave the first fully autonomous ride in Austin, Texas, to a blind man with no one else in the car. Normally during testing, an engineer sits in the passenger seat to monitor the technology. Until now, the program has been part of secretive research unit Google X. Waymo stands for “A new way forward in mobility,” according to Krafcik. Waymo would reveal when the technology will be production-ready “soon”, he said. Krafcik reiterated that Waymo has no interest in producing self-driving cars, but rather in developing the technology to drive them. Possible applications would be in ride-sharing, transportation, trucking, logistics, and personal use vehicles, he said. Google’s goal to perfect an autonomous vehicle that requires zero human intervention stands in contrast to that of some other automakers developing partial autonomy, which requires some driver supervision. Google’s self-driving cars have driven over 2 million miles and testing now focuses on the trickiest scenarios faced by cars on surface streets. Google has expanded its program over the past year, hiring more engineers while doubling its testing centers from two U.S. cities to four. Although there have been some significant departures over the past year - Chief Technical Officer Chris Urmson left in August after leading the project from its inception - some new hires have pointed to the program’s readiness to move past its experimental stage. In July, the project appointed its first general counsel and a month later it hired former Airbnb executive Shaun Stewart as director of the project, with a mandate to commercialize the company’s self-driving technology.

,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet’s Google is racing to hire more conservatives for its lobbying and policy arm, trying to get a foothold in President-elect Donald Trump’s Washington after enjoying a uniquely close relationship with the administration of President Barack Obama. In the weeks since the Nov. 8 election, Google has ramped up efforts to hire Republican lobbying firms and in-house lobbyists to change the composition of its Washington office, according to three lobbyists with knowledge of the matter. The company also posted an advertisement for a manager for conservative outreach and public policy partnership, seeking a “liaison to conservative, libertarian and free market groups.” While the position is not new, it gives Google a chance to make a hire that reflects the new political climate. Conservatives already are represented in the office. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on the record for this article. The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group whose members include Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, had a conference call last Friday to discuss policy objectives it could agree on to present to Trump, according to a person familiar with the call. Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on several issues during the election campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption. His surprise victory alarmed many companies, which fear he might follow through on his pledges. Trump has also opposed the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” rules, ordered in 2015 by the communications regulator to reclassify broadband internet services to treat them more like public utilities. The rule is now said to be headed for a reversal. Liberal-leaning Silicon Valley bet heavily on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton winning the White House, and many technology companies have found themselves scrambling in the wake of Trump’s election. But Google, which forged deep ties to the Obama White House and was the largest corporate contributor to Clinton’s campaign, appears to have been caught especially off guard, Washington insiders said. Only 33 employees of Google and its parent company Alphabet donated $201 or more to Trump, for a total of $23,300. Clinton received donations from 1,359 Google or Alphabet employees for a total of $1.6 million. Google NetPAC, the company’s political action committee, made 56 percent of its contributions to Republicans in the 2016 election cycle, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. During Obama’s presidency, more than 250 people moved between jobs at Google or related firms and the federal government, national political campaigns and Congress, according to a report this year by the Campaign for Accountability, a watchdog group. The company notched several wins during the administration, including favorable policies on net neutrality. Google seemed poised to enjoy similar treatment under a Clinton administration. Schmidt was seen wearing a staff badge at Clinton’s election night party, a sign of their close relationship. But those ties are now something of a liability as the company tries to re-position its presence, lobbyists said. The hiring push will adjust the political makeup of Google’s Washington office, where the team of lobbyists for Congress and the agencies contains more Democrats than Republicans, according to people familiar with the operation. Such a skew is not unusual given that Democrats controlled the White House the past eight years. To be sure, conservatives are well-represented in the company’s Washington office: Susan Molinari, a former Republican congresswoman from New York, has been the top lobbyist since 2012, and Seth Webb, who worked for a former Republican speaker of the house, helps lead Congressional lobbying. But the company has tended toward moderate Republicans in past hiring. Its previous director of conservative outreach was alumnus of Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, and a number of former staffers for Sen. John McCain have passed through the office as well. But the company still has to reconcile the lobbyists it hires with its liberal-leaning existing staff. Said one lobbyist for a rival tech company, “I think they are going to have a tough time really finding the cultural fit.” ","

VR game maker Survios announced today that it has raised $50 million over a pair of funding rounds, a good chunk of which comes from MGM, who led one of the two rounds, with Lux Capital leading the other. Shasta Ventures, Danhua Capital, Shanda Holdings, Felicis Ventures and Dentsu Ventures also participated in the rounds. In 2015, MGM invested in interactive video startup Interlude, which lets users influence the outcomes of the stories they are viewing. Hollywood sees virtual reality as an opportunity to bring premium viewing and arcade-style experiences back into a theater-like setting as video-on-demand and streaming services continue to gain in popularity while fewer viewers make their way to the big screen. High-end virtual reality systems retail for roughly $1,000 and up. Survios’s title, Raw Data, runs on the HTC Vive, a device that retails for $799 and requires a high-end gaming computer to run. Consumer headset adoption has been slower than some analysts expected as prices remain high for some of the most recognizable systems. “We definitely want to see location-based entertainment networks expand as much as possible,” Survios CEO Nathan Burba told TechCrunch. “That’s a very important way to introduce people to the medium and then to be able to generate extra revenue on top of the retail releases we’re doing.” Survios’s title Raw Data has been one of the fastest grossing VR titles to date, earning more than $1 million in revenue in the month of its launch on the Steam store for the HTC Vive. The studio detailed that this funding will, among other things, allow the company to bring the title to more platforms and expand the broader universe of the title.

The protest, which began with about 60 signatures but had more than tripled within hours of publication, comes a day before several technology company executives are due to meet with the real-estate developer in New York City. “We are choosing to stand in solidarity with Muslim Americans, immigrants, and all people whose lives and livelihoods are threatened by the incoming administration’s proposed data collection policies,” reads the letter, signed by a mix of engineers, designers and business executives. It continues: “We refuse to build a database of people based on their Constitutionally-protected religious beliefs. We refuse to facilitate mass deportations of people the government believes to be undesirable.” The letter vows to not participate in creating databases of identifying information for the U.S. government on the basis of race, religion or national origin, to minimize the collection or retention of data that could facilitate such targeting and to oppose any misuse of data at their respective organizations considered illegal or unethical. Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on several issues during the campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption, and his victory last month alarmed many companies who feared he might follow through on his pledges. [nL1N1DA3VL] Those concerns have not been assuaged in recent weeks, as Trump has said he intends to nominate individuals to senior posts in his administration who favor expanding surveillance programs.

 ,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"The EU executive wants to extend some rules that now only apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet, known as “Over-The-Top” (OTT) services, according to the draft. Web services will have to guarantee the confidentiality of communications and obtain users’ consent to process their location data, mirroring similar provisions included in a separate data protection law due to come into force in 2018. Online advertisers will also face strict rules on how they can target ads at web users based on their browsing history. The phone companies have called for European Union rules specific to telecoms firms – known as the e-privacy directive - either to be repealed or extended to everyone. “If Europe wants a Silicon Valley, it needs radical regulatory simplification. We won’t get new digital services unless we overhaul e-Privacy,”  Lise Fuhr, director general of ETNO, the European telecoms operators association, said. The draft proposals would prohibit the automatic processing of people’s data without their consent. Advertisers say such automatic processing is low risk as it involves data that can not identify the user. Fines for breaking the new law will be steep at up to 4 percent of a company’s global turnover. A Commission spokeswoman declined to comment on the draft but said the aim of the review was to adapt the rules to the data protection regulation which will come into force in 2018 and simplify the provisions for cookies. Cookies are placed on web surfers’ computers and contain bits of information about the user, such as what other sites they have visited or where they are logging in from. They are widely used by companies to deliver targeted ads to users. Telecom companies, barred by current rules from using customer data to provide additional services and make more money, will be able to use customer data with their consent, according to the proposal. It would also remove the obligation on websites to ask visitors for permission to place cookies on their browsers via a banner if the user has already consented through the privacy settings of the web browser. “If browsers are equipped with such functionality, websites that want to set cookies for behavioural advertising purposes may not need to put in place banners requesting their consent insofar as users may provide their consent by selecting the right settings in their browser,” the draft said. Many have questioned the effectiveness of such cookie banners which appear every time a user lands on a website because people tend to accept them without necessarily reading what that entails. “While such banners serve to empower users, at the same time, they may cause irritation because users are forced to read the notices and click on the boxes, thus impairing internet browsing experience,” the draft said. The proposal is set to be unveiled in January and may still undergo changes. ","

 ,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"(Reuters) - Yahoo Inc warned on Wednesday that it had uncovered yet another massive cyber attack, saying data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest breach in history. The number of affected accounts was double the number implicated in a 2014 breach that the internet company disclosed in September and blamed on hackers working on behalf of a government. News of that attack, which affected at least 500 million accounts, prompted Verizon Communication Inc to say in October that it might withdraw from an agreement to buy Yahoo’s core internet business for $4.83 billion. Following the latest disclosure, Verizon said, “we will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions.” A Yahoo spokesman told Reuters that the company has been in communication with Verizon during its investigation into the breach and that it is confident the incident will not affect the  pending acquisition. Yahoo required all of its customers to reset their passwords - a stronger measure than it took after the previous breach was discovered, when it only recommended a password reset. Yahoo also said Wednesday that it believes hackers responsible for the previous breach had also accessed the company’s proprietary code to learn how to forge “cookies” that would allow hackers to access an account without a password. “Yahoo badly screwed up,” said Bruce Schneier, a cryptologist and one of the world’s most respected security experts. “They weren’t taking security seriously and that’s now very clear. I would have trouble trusting Yahoo going forward.” Yahoo was tentative in its description of new problems, saying the incident was “likely” distinct from the one it reported in September and that stolen information “may have included” names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. It said it had not yet identified the intrusion that led to the massive data theft and noted that payment-card data and bank account information were not stored in the system the company believes was affected. Yahoo said it discovered the breach while reviewing data provided to the company by law enforcement. FireEye Inc’s Mandiant unit and Aon Plc’s Stroz Friedberg are assisting in the investigation, the Yahoo spokesman told Reuters. The breach is the latest setback for Yahoo, an internet pioneer that has fallen on hard times in recent years after being eclipsed by younger, fast-growing rivals including Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc. Hours before it announced the breach on Wednesday, executives with Google, Facebook and other large U.S. technology companies met with President-elect Donald Trump in New York. Reflecting its diminished stature, Yahoo was not invited to the summit, according to people familiar with the meeting. The Yahoo spokesman said Chief Executive Marissa Mayer was at the company’s Sunnyvale, California headquarters to assist in addressing the new breach. Yahoo shares were down 2.4 percent to $39.91 in extended trading. Verizon shares were little changed from their close at $51.63. ","

 ,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will make his case directly to President-elect Donald Trump not to derail the recent U.S.-Cuba detente, the White House said on Tuesday, insisting that “turning back the clock” would be damaging to American interests and the Cuban people. Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, said the outgoing administration hopes to persuade the incoming Trump administration to preserve Obama’s policy of engagement despite the president-elect’s threat to roll back the opening with the communist-ruled island. Just weeks before Trump takes office, Obama and his aides are seeking to further cement one of his top foreign policy legacy initiatives, a breakthrough between former Cold War foes announced two years ago. But since Obama eased travel and trade restrictions through executive actions, Trump would be able to reverse them on his own if he chooses to do so. “Cuba has been and will be on the list of issues where President Obama will make his case that this is the right approach for American interests,” Rhodes told reporters on a teleconference, referring to transition talks between the two. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has vowed to “terminate”  Obama’s engagement with Cuba unless Havana gives the United States what he calls a “better deal,” including allowing broader political freedoms on the island. The Cuban government so far has refrained from commenting on Trump’s statements. “What we believe would be very damaging is any effort to turn off the opening,” Rhodes said, asserting it would hurt the Cuban people, U.S. business interests and Washington’s standing in Latin America. He said the administration has sought to make the policy “irreversible,” and suggested that Trump, a businessman-turned-politician, should consider whether it makes sense to roll it back. Rhodes, who played a key role in negotiating the opening, said a reversal would boost Cuban “hardliners” opposed to engagement as Havana heads into its own political transition. Cuban President Raul Castro has said he will step down in 2018. “Do you really want to cancel travel plans for hundreds of thousands of Americans?” Rhodes asked. “Do you want to tell businesses as diverse as our major airlines or Google or General Electric ...  that have been pursuing opportunities in Cuba that they have to terminate those activities?” Rhodes, who was also in Cuba for memorial services for late Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro this month, said Cuban officials were uncertain about Trump and would wait to see how he proceeded. The White House is planning a meeting with “stakeholders” on Cuba policy this week, he said. The administration is pressing Cuba for further economic reforms, Rhodes said, and encouraging new deals with U.S. companies before Obama leaves office. Rhodes also said there was currently an “incentive structure” for economic change following the death of Fidel Castro, a vocal critic of detente, but that no progress has been made on political reforms. U.S. critics of Cuba engagement have accused Obama of making too many concessions. But despite restoration of relations, the Republican-controlled Congress has resisted lifting the broader U.S. economic embargo. ","

 ,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc rolled out its self-driving car fleet in its hometown of San Francisco on Wednesday, but faced a backlash from state regulators who say the company needs a permit to keep the vehicles on the road. The California Department of Motor Vehicles sent a letter to Uber on Wednesday ordering the company to “cease the operations” of its autonomous cars until it applies for and receives the testing permit required by the state. Uber responded that it did not need the permit, because its cars require a person to constantly monitor and take control of the wheel, which does not meet the definition of autonomous. “For us, it’s still early days and our cars are not yet ready to drive without a person monitoring them,” Uber said in a company blog post. It was the latest in a long line of spats between Uber and regulators, and followed a fairly seamless rollout three months ago in Pittsburgh, where Uber unveiled its secretive work on autonomous cars for the first time to the public. The company started with just four self-driving cars available to Pittsburgh passengers, although it had a fleet of more than a dozen for testing. The San Francisco program will mimic the Pittsburgh pilot. Riders who request an UberX, one of the company’s budget ride options, may be matched with a self-driving Uber. While 20 other companies exploring self-driving cars, including Alphabet’s Google, Tesla Motors and Ford Motor Co, have obtained a DMV permit, Uber has not. Uber’s self-driving cars have been seen around San Francisco since at least September. In its letter to Uber, the DMV’s chief counsel said it “will initial legal action” if “Uber does not confirm immediately that it will stop its launch and seek a testing permit.” California defines autonomous vehicles as cars that have the “capability” to drive “without the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person.” Uber argues that definition does not apply to its cars, which are equipped with a driver and an engineer in the front seats to take over in situations such as a construction zone, pedestrian crossing or taking a left turn across a lane of traffic. “All of our vehicles are compliant with applicable federal and state laws,” a spokeswoman said. In a company blog post, Uber called on California to take a more “pro-technology” approach to regulating autonomous cars. “Several cities and states have recognized that complex rules and requirements could have the unintended consequence of slowing innovation,” Uber said. “Our hope is that California, our home state and a leader in much of the world’s dynamism, will take a similar view.” On Wednesday, local media aired a video of a self-driving Uber running a red light, which was captured by a bystander. Uber said the incident was because of human error - suggesting that the car was not in autonomous mode - and was not carrying passengers, and the driver had been suspended. ","

Rakesh Sharma,12152016,Investopedia,12082016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Google Daydream is Google’s attempt at virtual reality. (GOOG) The Mountain View company had earlier released Google Cardboard, a VR headset made from cardboard and fitted with biconvex lenses. The headset is extremely cheap and, in some instances, has even been distributed for free. Google’s strategy of disseminating VR to the masses was a direct contrast to that of Facebook Inc. (FB), which acquired Oculus Rift, a premium VR headset maker, for $2 billion. Much like its selling price, Oculus Rift’s headset are also expensive. Its cheapest headset retails for $599. 
While Google Cardboard is cheap, the range and quality of VR available with the device is limited. Google Daydream is a step up from Cardboard. According to Clay Bavor, vice president of virtual reality at the company, the device is about “enabling very high quality VR.” The Daydream platform consists of a headset called Daydream View, a controller, and a content platform. Unlike typical plastic VR headsets in the market, Google Daydream is made of fabric and is available in multiple colors. Fabric ensures that the headset that is a good fit, is lightweight, and does not leave marks on the bridge of the nose. The controller is used to navigate VR space and adjust options, such as volume controls, within it. Finally, the Daydream platform consists of VR content. When the platform was launched earlier this year, it had limited content. But that is expected to change in the near future as VR becomes mainstream and more content producers enter the game. (See also: NFL Makes VR Debut On Thanksgiving Day). Reviewers have generally given Google Daydream thumbs up. Tech publication Ars Technica compared the platform to a “decent meal at a moderately priced fast-casual restaurant” and wrote that the device was the simplest of any VR headset as far as out-of-the-box setup is concerned. (See also: Google Acquires Eye-Tracking Technology Startup). That said, there are a couple of drawbacks on the platform. While the headset is untethered in that it does not require a connection to a computer or a gaming console, it does require Daydream-ready Android phones with the necessary sensors and persistence display for playback. Currently, there are only three Android phones – Google Pixel, Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe, and Moto Z – which have deemed Daydream-ready. Bavor has said that the number of such phones will multiply in the future and the company is already working with Samsung and HTC Vive to make VR ready headsets. Reviewers have also pointed to the absence of positional tracking and “warping” around the edges of 3D scenes due to limited field of view. Their tests have also resulted in the Android phone becoming unusually hot after playing VR content. This is because the number of operating system processes required to run VR taxes the phone’s central processing unit (CPU).  ",What Is Google Daydream? (GOOG) | Investopedia

While PTTRX dominated the space for some time, commanding nearly $300 billion worth of assets at one point, this legendary fund has suffered massive outflows within the last five years.

However, this strength faded more recently, as the fund's returns had fallen short of 65% of its peers in the last 12 months. Investors began withdrawing significant amounts after the PIMCO fund hit its peak in April 2013, with AUM declining $70 billion through August 2014, according to MarketWatch. When co-founder Bill Gross left the fund in September, investors responded by accelerating these redemption requests. The fund lost $23.5 billion that September and $27.5 billion the following month. Gross resigned from PIMCO over disputes with other members of management, individuals familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. (For related reading, see: The Greatest Investors: William H. Gross.)

Pluralsight, based near Salt Lake City, is using the cash as part of its push beyond individual subscriptions and into big businesses, where a host of new web and infrastructure technologies as well as cyberthreats are forcing developers into a constant state of learning. ""We're covering every technology that we believe companies need to master,"" said Skonnard. He said Pluralsight has a team that's ""at different conferences around the industry every week hunting for the very best experts in the tech space."" Pluralsight last raised money in 2014, a $135 million round led by Insight Venture Partners at a valuation of close to $1 billion. The latest funding was from Insight and another existing investor Iconiq Capital. The new capital will allow the company to pay off some debt from acquisitions while maintaining a healthy amount of cash on its balance sheet as it hires more enterprise salespeople, Skonnard said. Annual revenue is $100 million to $200 million, and the company is driving toward an initial public offering, he said. Pluralsight faces plenty of competition. LinkedIn acquired Lynda.com last year for about $1.5 billion, snapping up an extensive video library of content designed to ""empower people to develop the skills needed to accelerate their careers,"" LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner said at the time. Udacity, founded by Google X co-creator Sebastian Thrun, offers what it calls nanodegree programs, while venture-backed start-ups Treehouse and Codeacademy provide online programs specific to coding. Overall, the global e-learning market is expected to grow 11 percent a year and reach close to $31 billion by 2020, according to Technavio. The top author on Pluralsight made $2 million last year through the company's revenue share model with instructors, Skonnard said. Currently, the most popular courses cover topics like Angular, an open source framework for developing web apps, and Swift, the programming language for Apple. David Liu, who started teaching Salesforce courses on Pluralsight about a year ago, said he's already made over $100,000 on the platform. That's on top of his full-time job as a technical architect at Google. Liu, who previously taught with YouTube videos, said he spends 10 to 20 hours a week for about three months putting together a three-hour course and then an hour or so a day responding to questions and inquiries from students. He expects his revenue to increase as he adds new material to the site and continues to make money from existing classes. ""My course is aimed at total beginners — people who want to learn to code but really have no business learning to code whatsoever,"" Liu said. Individuals pay $30 a month for a Pluralsight subscription, giving them access to the entire catalog. For companies, the price starts at $500 per user, though volume discounts are available. The corporate product comes with curation tools and lets companies customize learning paths for their employees. To find the right experts for all of its technical course, Pluralsight has a team of 50 people in content acquisition who are out recruiting prospects like Liu. Pluralsight had two recruiters at re:Invent, connecting with experts through social media, attending sessions and networking over Italian food at Buddy V's Ristorante in the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas. The event resulted in seven prospective authors, and Pluralsight said it expects one or two to become paid experts. ""It's truly the cream of the crop,"" Skonnard said.

 ,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Messaging services such as Microsoft's Skype and Facebook's  WhatsApp face stricter rules on how they handle customer data under new security laws due to be proposed by the European Union, according to a draft document seen by Reuters. The EU executive wants to extend some rules that now only apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet, known as ""Over-The-Top"" (OTT) services, according to the draft. Web services will have to guarantee the confidentiality of communications and obtain users' consent to process their location data, mirroring similar provisions included in a separate data protection law due to come into force in 2018. Telecoms firms have long complained that companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft and Facebook are more lightly regulated, despite offering similar services. The phone companies have called for European Union rules specific to telecoms firms – known as the e-privacy directive - either to be repealed or extended to everyone. ""This creates a void of protection of confidentiality for the users of these services,"" the draft said, referring to OTTs. ""Moreover, it generates an uneven playing field between these providers and electronic communications service providers, as services which are perceived by users as functionally equivalent are not subject to the same rules."" A European Commission spokeswoman declined to comment on the draft but said the aim of the review was to adapt the rules to the data protection regulation which will come into force in 2018 and simplify the provisions for cookies. Telecom companies, barred by current rules from using customer data to provide additional services and make more money, will be able to use customer data with their consent, according to the proposal. It would also remove the obligation on websites to ask visitors for permission to place cookies on their browsers via a banner if the user has already consented through the privacy settings of the web browser. Cookies are placed on web surfers' computers and contain bits of information about the user, such as what other sites they have visited or where they are logging in from. They are widely used by companies to deliver targeted ads to users. ""If browsers are equipped with such functionality, websites that want to set cookies for behavioral advertising purposes may not need to put in place banners requesting their consent insofar as users may provide their consent by selecting the right settings in their browser,"" the draft said. Many have questioned the effectiveness of such cookie banners which appear every time a user lands on a website because people tend to accept them without necessarily reading what that entails. ""While such banners serve to empower users, at the same time, they may cause irritation because users are forced to read the notices and click on the boxes, thus impairing internet browsing experience,"" the draft said. The proposal is set to be unveiled in January and may still undergo changes. ","WhatsApp, Skype set to come under new EU security rules: Document"
Anita Balakrishnan,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Lauded unicorn start-up Magic Leap has scrapped many of its grandiose projects in favor of a device designed like a pair of glasses, technology website The Information reported this week. The Information's interview with the CEO raises questions as to whether Magic Leap is as advanced as some people might think. Indeed, some Magic Leap's videos were not representative of the company's technologies at the time, but were created with some movie magic — a special effects company, The Information said. High-flying Magic Leap was last valued at around $4.5 billion, according to CB Insights, luring investors like Google and Andreessen Horowitz with ""mixed"" or ""cinematic"" reality. The Florida start-up envisioned overlaying interactive graphics onto the real world in a way that few other technology companies had demonstrated. But The Information's reporter also found that Magic Leap's games were more jittery and blurry than its rival, Microsoft's HoloLens. CNBC has reached out to Magic Leap for comment on the report. Still, Magic Leap openly markets its technologists as wizards, and proselytizes that mixed reality will replace phones, tablets, computers and televisions.

Nyshka Chandran,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"The current furor over ""fake news,"" while worrying in itself, could reveal valuable insights into the changing media industry, according to acclaimed futurist Mike Walsh. ""From the fake news issue, we potentially see the future of news, which is algorithms and human beings working together, where the job of humans is designing the parameters and boundary conditions that drive algorithms,"" Walsh told CNBC on the sidelines of the inaugural Global Entrepreneurship Community conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Walsh, a consultant who specializes in advising corporate leaders on dealing with disruptive technology, is a leading voice on designing businesses for the 21st century, with two books - ""The Dictionary Of Dangerous Ideas"" and ""Futuretainment"" - under his belt. News outlets needed to strike a balance between delegating jobs to automation and to humans, Walsh said, using Facebook as an example. In August, Facebook laid off employees that curated popular news on the network's ""trending topics"" section, amid accusations that the workers' selections were biased against conservative U.S. news outlets. In their place, Facebook automated trending topics, leaving algorithms to select what stories appeared. But that approach wasn't enough, Walsh warned. ""Unless you have humans monitoring them, algorithms can lead to distorted results,"" he cautioned. This was what happened to Facebook shortly after the decision to remove human curation of the ""trending"" list, as fake news stories, including one notable report that claimed Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly had been fired by the network, began surfacing on the section. During the height of the U.S. presidential election campaign, inaccurate or entirely fabricated reports were widely circulated on digital platforms and promoted on Google through the search engine's algorithm. Many believe the phenomenon influenced the U.S. election result, placing pressure on outlets such  Facebook  and Twitter — among the most popular networks for media consumption — to combat the issue. Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who declines to identify Facebook as a media company, has denied this was the case, insisting that ""this really isn't a problem,"" while Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said the issue was ""complicated."" ""We have a role and responsibility to make sure that people are seeing what they need to see and they can have easy conversations and really get to the truth, and that's complicated,"" Dorsey said. The issue was brought into sharp focus this week when an American man called Edgar Welsh opened fire in a Washington pizzeria  after reading online content that claimed the restaurant was at the center of a child trafficking ring operated by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta. The 28-year old said he was conducting a ""self-investigation"" and wanted to rescue the child sex slaves he believed might be held in the restaurant. Oxford Dictionaries marked the new news environment by choosing ""post-truth"" - relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief - as its Word of the Year for 2016. ""The future of news may not be humans collecting news, it may be an algorithm that determines truths from post-truths,"" Walsh said, adding, ""Google's probably trying to figure out that problem now."" Just hours after Walsh spoke to CNBC, the Verge reported that this month theU.S. Trademark and Patent Office published Facebook's application for Patent 0350675: ""systems and methods to identify objectionable content."" ","Futurist Mike Walsh says Facebook fake news problem shows need to balance humans, automation"
Michael Yoshikami,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"President-elect Donald Trump met on Wednesday with key Silicon Valley technology executives to discuss his administration's perspective towards the technology industry. Contrary to what many people expected, this did not turn out to be a contentious session (like the one with media executives). The message was conciliatory and focused on outlining the President-elect's pledge that he is focused on helping technology companies going forward. Some big names in the tech space have been under pressure based on the view that the new administration would negatively impact their fortunes. Given that the tech summit focused more on cooperation than condemnation, we believe the market overhang on certain names should begin to lift. Here are some of the names that we believe merit consideration from investors right now. Apple has an attractive valuation. It is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 12.9 times with a net cash balance of $150 billion. There is likely to be a huge super-cycle upgrade opportunity when iPhone released next year for 10th anniversary. The stock has been range bound but current multiples suggest a possible 10% bounce from here MasterCard is leveraging the shift from cash/check towards electronic payments (like credit cards). The company is positioned to succeed in a cashless environment as e-commerce payments continue to accelerate. It's not strictly defined as a technology company but it's very connected to the transformation of payment processes. It continues to trade at a discount to VISA on a P/E basis; parity we think makes sense. Google is a leader in online search with unmatched ability to monetize clicks and views.  It's got huge reach in a variety of businesses related to Internet, search, and advertising. For some reason investors seem to be questioning Google as a growth name. We think it still has upside as online ad revenues continue to grow. AT&T is a leading telecom provider in the U.S.  It is benefitting from the continuation of the wireless story and the shift away from cable TV (cord cutting) and towards streaming. It offers an attractive dividend yield. It's proposed merger with Time Warner is an uncertainty but it is likely to go through in a deregulation focused environment. ATT is likely to increase its reach with its recent deals and offerings. Cyclical companies have rallied strongly and it's only right to wonder if assets that have not participated in this recent bump are poised to catch up to positions that have already made strong gains. Technology and telecom companies certainly fall in this category and we believe investors should take another look at the earning streams delivered by these firms.  Compared to many cyclical companies, these stocks now actually look somewhat cheap on a relative basis and you can't say that very often. ",Trump tech summit stocks to buy—commentary
Nyshka Chandran,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"In Kuala Lumpur, a small team of Malaysian engineers is racing to make history in Southeast Asian space exploration. Independence-X is the sole team from the region to participate in the Google Lunar XPrize, a global competition in which private-sector players must land a robotic spacecraft on the Moon, have it travel 500 meters and transmit high-definition (HD) video and images back to Earth, by the end of 2017. Unlike Japan, China or India, Southeast Asia has a dearth of private space companies; Independence-X is the only one in Malaysia. ""Our aim is innovation. It's impossible to have a vision of the future without development in space technology,"" team leader Izmir Yamin said on the sidelines of the inaugural Global Entrepreneurship Community conference in Kuala Lumpur. On Thursday, CNBC was given exclusive access to images of Independence-X's spacecraft, named  'Henry.' It weighs a hefty 850 kilograms, but is only 1.4 meters tall and 2 meters wide, and comes with an HD imaging camera and a water sensor to transmit any discovery of water data. In order to foster entrepreneurship and a low-cost space economy, Google Lunar XPrize stipulates that government funding can only account for 10 percent of a team's total mission cost. Most of Independence-X's cash has come from private corporations, crowd funding donations and reward-based contributions so far, Yamin said. The competition is offering a whopping $20 million for the first team that completes the mission and $5 million for second-place winners, but the road to victory remains a long one for the Malaysian firm. In order to enter the next phase of the competition, Independence-X must secure a contract to launch Henry into orbit--something that only four out of the competition's sixteen teams have done. Among the four are SpaceIL from Israel--which announced last year that its lander will be hitching a ride on a Falcon 9 rocket constructed byElon Musk's SpaceX--and Moon Express from the U.S. The latter will be launching its lander on Rocket Lab's Electron vehicle, which boasts a battery-powered rocket engine printed on 3D parts. Independence-X said it has a launch provider in the pipeline and is working on finalizing the process with an intention of making an announcement in January. ""I feel both worried and confident at the same time as this is the first attempt of its kind in Southeast Asia,"" Yamin remarked. ""We admit SpaceIL is one of the toughest competitors, but we're going to do our best to make the mission cost-effective and reliable.""

Lyanne Alfaro,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Ask Luis Von Ahn why he decided to become an entrepreneur and he will tell you that the career actually chose him. When he was a professor at Carnegie Mellon in 2005, he developed a program that websites could use to distinguish humans from robots. CAPTCHA became so popular that school officials urged Von Ahn to turn the program into something more. ""At some point the university was kicking the project out because it had too many users and they just said, 'You can't be in the university, you have to do something about it,'"" he says. ""I had to turn it into a company."" In 2006, he received a prestigious six-figure MacArthur Fellowship, otherwise known as the ""Genius Grant,"" which also recognized his work with CAPTCHA. In 2011, when, the entrepreneur estimates, his CAPTCHA system was digitizing two-and-a-half million books a year, he launched his new initiative, the free tool for language learners, Duolingo. Though he never planned for entrepreneurship to be his career path, Von Ahn does appreciate the fortuity. He came from a family of business people. In Guatemala, his parents owned one of the largest candy producers in the country, Tropical Candy. Today, there are 1.2 billion people around the world learning a new language. 150 million of them, aged seven to 95, are now using Von Ahn's website Duolingo to do that learning for free. But reaching this milestone has been no easy feat. Here are some of the challenges Von Ahn has needed to overcome. 1. Growing a following In April 2011, Von Ahn gave a TED talk about how collaboration online could be used for the greater good. He recounted how CAPTCHA has helped digitize books and how he hoped to use his Duolingo to help millions of people learn a new language at no cost. ""That talk got watched by two million people,"" he says, ""and that was luck that it coincided [with the company's launch]."" As the company continues to launch new features, he hopes to attract even more followers, but he says that's one of the most difficult parts of growing his company: Getting, and retaining, an audience. 2. Managing from within Prior to becoming a job creator himself, Von Ahn didn't give much thought to how companies like Google treated their employees. But as his company continued to grow, he realized it was crucial to keep his company organized and his workers happy. ""I hadn't thought to spend time on how to organize all the people,"" he says. Proper management has become increasingly important at Duolingo. 3. Hiring the right people As most companies do, Duolingo started small. Perhaps one of the biggest mistakes that Von Ahn says he made early on was making the wrong hires, and choosing inexperienced people. Employees were expected to assume different roles and recent graduates were tapped even though they sometimes lacked the proper background for their roles. Ultimately, he learned that choosing individuals with the right experiences and skills was crucial. Making mistakes, the entrepreneur says, is the way that he gained the skills he needed to grow the company. And Duolingo does keep expanding, as well as launching new features. Its latest?

"Evan Niu, CFA",12152016,Fool,12082016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Google. When Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unveiled its fancy new Pixel phone in October, which overall looks like a strong smartphone, there was one bizarre anachronism associated with the device: it was launching as a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exclusive. Well, at least in terms of distribution, as Big Red was the only U.S. carrier that would sell the Pixel at its retail store, even though technically the device is supported on all four major carriers. Android Police reported earlier this week that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is planning on rolling out Pixel displays at its retail locations. But here's the rub: The Un-carrier will only be displaying the Pixel, and won't be actively selling the device. What gives? T-Mobile sales reps will reportedly encourage interested customers to purchase the device directly from Google's online store. T-Mobile has been offering a Pixel promotion for a couple months, giving $325 to anyone that brings a Pixel to T-Mobile's network. The promotion value is spread out over two years via monthly bill credits, which is T-Mobile's way of making sure customers stick around. ""Verizon is spending millions to convince people that Google's Pixel is 'only on Verizon' and it is just not true,"" a T-Mobile spokesperson told FierceWireless. ""The Pixel works great on T-Mobile with unlimited high-speed data and a faster, more advanced LTE network. Buy one from Google or buy one from Verizon and bring it on over."" It goes without saying that this is an inconvenient solution for T-Mobile customers, who would much rather just buy the device directly from T-Mobile in a seamless transaction. Instead, customers have to buy the device from somewhere else, and then jump through all the hoops to get the promotion. T-Mobile is obviously interested in carrying the Pixel, but its hands are probably tied for the time being due to Verizon's exclusivity. Scoring an exclusive means exactly that. Verizon is the only carrier allowed to distribute Pixel for now, so the real question is how long the exclusivity window lasts. Once the exclusivity expires, I would imagine more carriers will look to sign on with Google to sell the Pixel at its retail stores, which is easily the most important distribution channel in the smartphone market -- as well as potentially the biggest limiting factor for Pixel. Considering the broader shift away from carrier exclusives, it's hard to imagine Verizon's exclusivity window lasting more than three to six months, which importantly should cover the busy holiday shopping season. T-Mobile's push to display the Pixel but not to officially sell the Pixel likely skirts the exclusivity, which Verizon probably doesn't take too kindly. In any event, there's a very good chance that the Pixel sees wider carrier availability once Verizon's exclusivity has ended, which will probably be in early to mid-2017. ","

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) wants to put satellites in space, and it's found a space start-up to help get it there. Just to be clear, this is a different project from the one that saw Google invest $1 billion into SpaceX in the hopes of getting 4,425 broadband internet satellites into orbit. This time around, Google parent company Alphabet has an entirely different project in mind. Space photography. Google has sketched out a plan for what its Terra Bella satellites will look like. Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet calls its latest project Terra Bella, and it requires orbiting more than a dozen satellites around the Earth to ""search for patterns of change in the physical world to help address global economic, environmental, and humanitarian challenges."" In the first stage, Terra Bella's satellites will go into orbit and begin taking snapshots of the Earth. Next, Alphabet will take this data and apply to it ""the world's most advanced deep learning computing resources ... to uncover signals that drive the global economy."" What exactly will Alphabet be looking for? The company provides a few examples. Snapshots of traffic at the Port of Long Beach might give insight into ""operational inefficiencies"" and ""supply chain bottlenecks"" that could hurt the global economy if left unaddressed. Peeking at mining activity in Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia might help Alphabet to forecast metal supplies and movements in the global commodities markets. Both ideas have clear potential for monetization -- selling the processed data to companies that could use it -- which will help make Terra Bella financially viable for Alphabet. Speaking of finances, Alphabet notes that in developing Terra Bella, it's created a whole new class of small, sub-100-kilogram satellites capable of taking ""rapid response, high-resolution imagery"" (including ""the first-ever commercial high-resolution video of Earth from a satellite"") and costing just ""a fraction of the cost of traditional imaging satellites."" At least seven such sats are already in orbit today. Getting this far necessitated Terra Bella attracting about $91 million in venture capital, then selling itself to well-heeled Alphabet for $500 million (a sale that took place in 2014). As for how much more it will cost Alphabet to complete the project, that's not 100% certain. In the meantime, as those two companies put the final touches on their launch systems, Alphabet has chosen to go a different route with its next batch of Terra Bella satellites. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to speak with Curt Blake, president of privately held Spaceflight, Inc. Spaceflight operates as a sort of space ""freight forwarder,"" buying up spare capacity on other companies' rockets -- or even buying entire rockets -- and then reselling slots aboard these rockets to companies like Alphabet, which have small satellites they want to put in orbit. What Blake told me is that the company's very first ""dedicated rideshare mission,"" consisting of multiple slots that will be carried by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2017, will carry a batch of Terra Bella satellites. So the short answer to the question: ""How much will it cost Alphabet to get Terra Bella operational?"" appears to be: ""Not much."" A few million dollars to build the satellites. A few million more to put 12 or more of them in orbit. And then? Alphabet can sit back and enjoy an endless stream of revenue from an operational, eye-in-the-sky satellite imaging constellation forever after. ","

Image source: Getty Images. The best businesses churn out cash faster than it can be used. Plenty of free cash flow (FCF) -- the amount of cash from operating activities left over after capital investments are made -- allows a company to invest in the future as well as return cash to shareholders. Dividends, buybacks, and acquisitions are all fueled by a company's free cash flow. What makes a company a cash cow? A high free cash flow margin (the percentage of revenue converted into FCF) and a high cash return on invested capital (how much FCF is generated from each dollar invested back into the business) usually indicate that a company is producing excessive amounts of cash. Here's why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) are three top cash cows. The PC market may not be on fire, but Microsoft continues to produce impressive profits. During fiscal 2016, which ended in June, Microsoft generated $25 billion of free cash flow, driven by Windows, Office, and the company's growing cloud-computing business. With revenue of $85.3 billion, that puts Microsoft's free cash flow margin at an impressive 29.3%. Image source: Microsoft. A quick look at the balance sheet shows that Microsoft doesn't quite know what to do with all of this cash. Net of debt, the company had nearly $60 billion in cash collecting dust at the end of fiscal 2016, despite paying a dividend and funding expansive share buybacks. Microsoft's cash return on invested capital is also impressive, clocking in at 19.9%. The excess cash on the balance sheet weighs this number down, but it's clear that cash invested back into the business generates an exceptional return. Microsoft is aggressively transforming into a cloud computing company,  shifting much of its software to a subscription model and rapidly growing its Azure cloud platform. Azure revenue is more than doubling each year, putting Microsoft in a strong No. 2 position behind Amazon.com's Web Services in the cloud infrastructure market. With the cloud business growing swiftly, Microsoft is making the necessary moves to retain its cash-cow status far into the future. Alphabet, despite its size, continues to grow at a double-digit pace. Revenue surged 20% year over year during the latest quarter, driven entirely by Google. Other Bets, which includes all of the company's other businesses and moonshots, remains a source of little revenue and substantial losses. Image source: Alphabet. Google's core advertising business drives incredible cash generation for the company. During the trailing-12-month period, Alphabet produced $23.5 billion of free cash flow on $85.5 billion of revenue. Free cash flow margin was an impressive 27.5%, nipping at the heels of Microsoft. Alphabet also has a mountain of cash on its balance sheet, totaling $79 billion net of debt. Cash return on invested capital is 17%, a bit lower than that of Microsoft. Google doesn't pay a dividend, but it did recently begin buying back its own shares. It certainly generates enough cash to return substantially more to shareholders in the future. Alphabet is showing no sign of slowing down, with its core Google business driving its results. Even if none of its moonshots work out, the company remains one of the biggest cash cows around. One of Disney's biggest cash-cow businesses, cable sports network ESPN, is facing an uncertain future, with a declining subscriber base and the ever-present threat of cord cutting. But the company remains an undisputed cash cow, with a broad set of business churning out billions each year. The company produced $8.4 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2016 on $55.6 billion of revenue. That's good for a free cash flow margin of about 15.1%. Image source: Disney. About half of Disney's operating income in 2016 came from its media networks, and about 87% of media network operating income came from cable networks. ESPN is the big hitter in that category, and its ongoing problems are a real concern. But other businesses are generating cash as well. Disney's parks and resorts spit out $3.3 billion of operating income during 2016, with the movie business contributing $2.7 billion and consumer products adding another $2 billion. Disney's cash return on invested capital isn't quite as impressive as Microsoft's or Alphabet's, coming in at a lower 12.5%. Still, Disney throws off enough cash to pay a decent dividend, spend billions on share buybacks, and fund acquisitions -- like Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012 -- that broaden its entertainment portfolio. ESPN represents a challenge, but Disney's cash-cow status allows it to make the investments necessary to drive long-term growth. ","

Self-employed workers can take advantage of numerous tax breaks available to business owners, but that flexibility comes at the cost of owing self-employment tax. Whereas employees only pay the employee share of payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, self-employed workers have to pay the employer half as well, boosting the maximum tax rate to 15.3%. Although a wage limit of $118,500 applies to the Social Security portion of self-employment taxes in 2016, the 2.9% Medicare portion is unlimited. In addition, an additional 0.9% Medicare tax can also apply for high-income taxpayers. That can make it tough to figure out how much you'll owe, but this self-employment tax calculator can do the heavy lifting for you. Let's look more closely at self-employment taxes and how this calculator can help you.  * Calculator is for estimation purposes only, and is not financial planning or advice. As with any tool, it is only as accurate as the assumptions it makes and the data it has, and should not be relied on as a substitute for a financial advisor or a tax professional. Self-employment taxes are designed to make sure that the federal government gets the full amount of payroll taxes it's owed. For regular workers, your employer withholds money for Social Security and Medicare tax from your paycheck at the rate of 7.65%, and it pays a matching 7.65% from its own money for its share of payroll taxes. But since self-employed people don't have employers, you have to pay the entire 15.3% amount from your profits, which are defined as your net earnings less the employer portion of self-employment taxes. The full 15.3% tax only applies up to the wage base limit for Social Security, which is $118,500 in 2016. Above that level, only the 2.9% self-employment Medicare tax applies. However, there's also a 0.9% Medicare surtax for single filers with income over $200,000 or joint filers above $250,000. Image source: Getty Images. The calculator for calculating self-employment tax is deceptively simple. Just put in your self-employment income, any income you earn from regular employment, and your filing status. The calculator does the rest. A more complex example shows how regular work and self-employment coordinate. Say you still make $30,000 from self-employment, but you also earn $125,000 from your regular day job. For the Social Security portion of self-employment taxes, the $125,000 in regular job income counts against the $118,500 limit, leaving you with no self-employment tax for the Social Security portion. However, the taxable self-employment earnings of $27,705 are still subject to Medicare taxes, working out to self-employment tax of $803 and a $402 deduction against your income tax liability. That said, if you do owe substantial self-employment tax, remember to make estimated tax payments on a quarterly basis. Otherwise, the IRS can hit you with penalties on your annual tax return if you didn't pay as much as you were supposed to throughout the year. Self-employment tax can be a big burden, and the tax bill can be larger than you expect. By knowing what the amount is beforehand, you can plan for self-employment tax and avoid any nasty surprises at tax time. ","

Dan Caplinger,12152016,Fool,12082016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Workers who earn $20,000 per year are well below the wage base limit for Social Security, which is more than six times that amount in 2017. That means these workers have payroll taxes withheld on all of their income. The amount is 6.2% of their wages, or $1,240 per year. Your employer pays another $1,240 directly for their share of your Social Security payroll tax. All of your earnings go toward your work history for purposes of calculating your benefit. Unless you worked in a state or local government job in which the employer didn't participate in the Social Security program, then you'll get credit for the full $20,000 earned. The size of your final Social Security check will depend on your entire work history, not just what you're making now. For instance, if you've always made $20,000 per year, then you'll get less from Social Security than you would if you earned a greater amount for a long period in the past. Your benefits are calculated based your entire career, and the Social Security Administration factors up to 35 top-earning years into its benefit formula. For these purposes, let's assume that a person earned the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $20,000 throughout an entire career. That's too tidy to be realistic, but it gives you a good baseline from which you can make personal adjustments. In this example, your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) would be $1,667 per month. The SSA's benefit formula for someone retiring in 2017 takes 90% of the first $885 in monthly earnings and then adds in 32% of earnings between $885 and $5,336. If your AIME is $1,667, then here's how your benefit would be calculated: 90% of first $856 = $770.4032% of the remaining $811 = $259.52$770.40 + $259.52 = $1,029.92 Therefore, if you retire at full retirement age, which is 66 and two months for someone turning 62 next year, then you'll get about $1,030 as your monthly benefit. Notice something important about the result. Social Security does a reasonably good job of replacing work income for low-income individuals. Low-income workers get more than three-fifths of the money they earned during their career in the form of Social Security benefits. That leaves a sizable income gap for them to fill, but it's better than the roughly 25% to 40% of pre-retirement income that Social Security will replace for middle-income and high-income individuals. Finally, if you didn't work throughout your entire life, then your benefit will be lower -- but not necessarily as much lower as you would expect. If you earned $20,000 for half a career, then your average monthly earnings will be $833. In this case, your Social Security payment will be a full 90% of that amount, or almost $750 per month, if you retire at full retirement age. That's almost three-quarters of what you'd get from a full career of work at that pay rate. Low-income individuals tend to have the least financial flexibility in retirement, and Social Security is often the only reliable income source a retiree has. By making the best possible choices on Social Security, you can take maximum advantage of the program and avoid mistakes that plague some retirees who don't spend as much time and effort considering the right strategy for themselves.

    How Much Will I Get From Social Security if I Make $20,000? -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. As the AI era continues to unfold, the idea of a future driven by artificial intelligence can evoke mixed emotions. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder and Chairman Bill Gates referred to AI as the ""holy grail"" in computer science. On the other hand, and taking a far more apocalyptic perspective, Tesla CEO Elon Musk likened the development of artificial intelligence technologies to ""summoning the demon."" Regardless of our feelings on the matter, artificial intelligence is set to play an increasingly prominent role in our day-to-day lives. Let's examine nine statistics that speak to how artificial intelligence is set to become one of the most important technology trends of our lifetimes. In a survey of corporate executives, 32% of respondents said voice recognition software like Apple's Siri, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Assistant, and Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa is the most used type of AI tech in their workplace. Many of these voice-powered AIs still leave something to be desired in terms of accuracy, and it was surprising that voice assistants outnumbered big data in overall popularity with businesses. Bye bye, call centers and wait times. According to researcher Gartner, AI bots will power 85% of all customer service interactions by the year 2020. Given Facebook and other messaging platforms have already seen significant adoption of customer service bots on their chat apps, this shouldn't necessarily come as a huge surprise. Since this use of AI can help reduce wait times for many types of interactions, this trend sounds like a win for businesses and customers alike. Also from Gartner, digital customer assistants will be able to ""mimic human conversations, with both listening and speaking, a sense of history, in-the-moment context, timing and tone, and the ability to respond, add to and continue with a thought or purpose at multiple occasions and places over time."" Said another way, digital assistants will know and interact with you like a friend does today, or at least they'll try to. These 4 tech giants already have significant cloud computing businesses, a trend researcher IDC sees as likely to continue. By the start of the next decade, Amazon.com, Alphabet, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft will control the majority of the market for AI software applications. According to a study from leading consultancy McKinsey, the impact of self-driving cars will be tremendous, saving an estimated 300,000 lives per decade by reducing fatal traffic accidents. This is expected to save $190 billion in annual critical care and triage costs. Less miraculous (but still awesome), autonomous automobiles will also save their users as much as 50 minutes each day by allowing them to focus on other tasks while commuting. In a potentially apocalyptic turn for members of the media reading (or writing) this, AI-powered software will write as much as 20% of business content in a mere two years' time according to Gartner. Areas like ""shareholder reports, legal documents, market reports, press releases, articles and white papers"" are among the writing forms most likely to be automated. In a research report to its investors, Bank of America argued that the rise of AI will lead to cost reduction and new forms of growth that could amount to $14-$33 trillion annually, in what it calls ""creative disruption impact,"" and that's just the tip of the iceberg in some expert's view. According to Alphabet director of engineering Ray Kurzweil, machines will be smarter than us by 2029 (insert Terminator joke here). Kurzweil doesn't necessarily see this as being a negative, though. Among many other ""bold"" predictions about our futures, he believes people will start living forever around the year 2029. Whether that's the result of some Matrix-like scenario coming to fruition isn't immediately clear, but obviously leading experts in the field believe major changes to our social fabric are only a little more than a decade away. Researching this article, I found all manner of predictions for how much AI will impact our daily lives, everything from imminent nuclear winter to global immortality waiting around the corner. So while it's certainly easy to get wrapped up in the litany of predictions, it's perhaps most useful to simply keep in mind that AI should have a major economic impact from which investors can undoubtedly benefit from today.

    9 Artificial Intelligence Stats That Will Blow You Away -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,12152016,Fool,12082016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. There are plenty of headlines about how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming everything from smartphones to our cars, but understanding how exactly to benefit from AI as an investor can be a little harder. To help you get started in your AI investments, here are five things you should know before jumping into the space. Markets and Markets estimates that AI will be worth $16 billion in the U.S. by 2022. The research firm expects AI to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 62.9% between 2016 and 2022. If you look at the entire global AI market, Tractica estimates that it will skyrocket from $643 million this year to $36.8 billion by 2025. No, I'm not talking about an intellectually superior robot army (although that would indeed be a risky situation), but rather the more practical problems facing the segment. AI systems are going to make mistakes, and that could cost companies -- and people -- a lot. For example, the BBC reported earlier this year that a company created medical AI software to learn which patients with pneumonia were at a higher risk of death. But something went wrong along the way: It inadvertently classified patients with asthma as being at lower risk. This was because in normal situations, people with pneumonia and a history of asthma go straight to intensive care and therefore get the kind of treatment that significantly reduces their risk of dying. That's an extreme case, but there have been other recent problems. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) learned how AI can backfire when it took its conversational Twitter chatbot, Tay, live earlier this year. After just a few hours of being online and interacting with some people -- who could have used some more intelligence of their own -- Tay started spewing out racist and hateful phrases it learned from its conversations. Microsoft was forced to take Tay down just 16 hours after it went online. These might be isolated problems for AI right now, but they represent one major hurdle for  companies -- AI will eventually make our lives better, but it still has a long way to go. AI is already being implemented into medical devices, cars, mobile devices, and industrial equipment, but there are two main segments where we'll likely see the most growth: natural language processing (NLP) and the healthcare industry. Most of the focus of AI will be in NLP, which is making computers, smartphones, and connected devices understand what humans are saying, and the context it's being said in. NLP can be a major part of how we interact with AI software, which is why Google and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have focused so much on the technology in their Google Home and Echo smart home speakers. But the healthcare industry is expected to benefit the most from AI in the near future. Markets and Markets estimates it'll be the fastest growing AI segment over the next six years as companies use AI to for disease diagnosis, patient care, and discovering new drugs. Artificial intelligence is a slightly more complicated segment to invest in because it's not like companies are selling AI the way a company might sell smartphones. Instead, they develop their AI platforms in order to perfect their other technologies. Two companies that are doing this right now are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon. NVIDIA is best known for its graphics processors for the gaming market, but its GPUs are also being used to power complex machine learning systems, including its DGX-1 supercomputer. The company released DGX-1 earlier this year. The computer processes information similar to a human, using neural network systems running in the company's Pascal chip architecture. NVIDIA says that DGX-1 is 12 times faster than deep learning supercomputers. The company sells the supercomputer to companies and researchers, but will also use it as a cloud-based computer for its Drive PX 2 semi-autonomous driving system. Drive PX 2 collects 1.8 million points of data per second, and the company said that some of that information will then be uploaded to DGX-1 to help driverless cars learn how to drive. NVIDIA's DGX-1, Drive PX 2, and powerful GPUs are all examples of the company's AI opportunities in the driverless car and datacenter space. And they're already being implemented by other companies. Google and Facebook power their own AI technologies with NVIDIA's GPUs, and 80 automakers and automotive suppliers are already using the company's Drive PX 2 computer. NVIDIA brings in just 12% of its total revenue from its datacenter segment right now -- which includes sales of GPUs for cloud-based and machine learning -- but it's one of the company's fastest growing business segments. Datacenter revenue grew by nearly three times on a year-over-year basis in fiscal Q3 2017, and NVIDA's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang believes deep learning will ""usher in the next era of computing."" NVIDIA isn't the only one betting on AI, of course. Amazon has stepped firmly into the space and says it has thousands of people dedicated to AI for its businesses. The company just released several new AI services to developers at its re:Invent conference last month, including an image recognition platform and a text-to-speech service. But the biggest announcement was that Amazon was opening up its Lex AI software, which is essentially the brains behind its Alexa virtual assistant. Amazon Web Services Chief Evangelist Jeff Bar wrote in a blog post that Lex will allow developers to ""build chatbots and other types of web & mobile applications that support engaging, lifelike interactions."" Amazon's AI systems integrate well with its AWS, making it a natural fit for developers to host the AI platforms on. Amazon's been wisely releasing new platforms to developers that build on top of the company's AWS in order to lock in users, and it's paying off. AWS brought in $3.2 billion in the third quarter -- a 55% increase year-over-year -- and could bring in nearly $12 billion for the entire year. Not all of this comes from AI hosting, of course, but the company sees AI as an opportunity for both its own internal products (like Echo) and its hosting services over the long term. Artificial intelligence hardware and software are growing fast, but they're still in their early stages. That means that investors will need to be patient as they watch their AI investments bring in returns. As I mentioned above, it will be a bit harder to measure the AI market compared to other more tangible technology investments. But make no mistake, AI is being integrated into everything from our cars to medical devices -- and it'll soon be a normal part of our everyday lives. ","

Image source: Xactly Corp. Shares of Xactly Corp. (NYSE:XTLY) were down 18.5% as of 11:30 a.m. EST Friday after the enterprise cloud-based incentive compensation solutions company released solid fiscal third-quarter 2017 results but followed with weaker-than-expected forward guidance. Quarterly revenue grew 25% year over year, to $23.9 million, including 22% growth in subscription revenue, to $18.5 million, and 39.3% growth in professional services revenue, to $5.5 million. On the bottom line, that translated to an adjusted net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.06 per share, narrowed from an adjusted net loss of $5.1 million, or $0.18 per share in last year's fiscal Q3. By comparison, analysts' consensus estimates called for slightly lower revenue of $23.8 million and a wider adjusted loss of $0.13 per share. Xactly also touted ""key enterprise wins"" across multiple verticals including manufacturing, telecom, consumer goods, healthcare, software, and construction. And the company grew its total subscribers 22% year over year, to 287,000. ""Companies choose our solutions because we enable them to drive employee behavior, "" stated Xactly founder and CEO Chritopher Cabrera. ""In particular, Xactly Insights gives customers the actionable data they need to drive higher business performance."" ""The third quarter marked another quarter of solid revenue growth and significant improvement on the bottom line,"" elaborated Xactly CFO Joseph Consul. ""The operating leverage we are demonstrating gives us confidence to achieve our target of positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year."" For the current quarter, however, Xactly anticipates revenue of $23.6 million $24.4 million, which should translate to an adjusted net loss of $4.0 million to $3.2 million, or a loss per share in the range of $0.13 to $0.10. Analysts, on average, were looking for a loss at the lower end of Xactly's guidance but on higher revenue of $25.9 million. Finally, for the full year, Xactly now expects revenue of $94.8 million to $95.6 million and an adjusted net loss of $11.1 million to $10.3 million, or $0.36 to $0.33 on a per-share basis. Here again, Wall Street was looking for higher full-year revenue of $96.9 million and a wider adjusted net loss of $0.43 per share. Of course, the market's reaction might seem overblown when you consider Xactly's bottom-line guidance was technically ahead of expectations. But in these early stages of its long-term story, Xactly's primary focus should be growing revenue and taking market share as it consciously eschews profitability. So when unprofitable, fast-growing businesses like Xactly fall short to that end, it should be no surprise to see shares endure a sharp pullback as a result. ","

You don't need a suit and tie or a ticket to Wall Street to start making investments. In fact, online brokers such as Vanguard and Capital One make it possible to open a brokerage account and bring Wall Street to your living room. Selecting a broker is an important step, so let's compare how Capital One and Vanguard stack up on criteria that are important for do-it-yourself investors. Vanguard and Capital One both offer low-cost commissions on everything from stocks to options and ETFs. Here's how their standard published commissions compare. Broker Stocks/Options ETFs Mutual Funds Vanguard Stocks: $7 per trade Options: $20 + $1 per contract $7 per trade $35.00 per purchase Capital One $6.95 per trade + $0.75 per contract $6.95 per trade $19.95 per purchase Data source: company websites. There's one thing you should know about commissions: You might pay much less than the standard rate. Vanguard cuts commissions for investors who have at least $50,000 in its ETFs and mutual funds. Capital One's Sharebuilder program allows you to make trades that are not time sensitive for just $3.95, while its PortfolioBuilder option can be used to buy a whole portfolio of stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds for a flat rate of just $18.95. Signing up for a new account can have its perks. Commission-free trades and cash bonuses are plentiful for investors who want to open an IRA account, for example. If funds are more your style, you'll be pleased to find that Vanguard and Capital One offer funds that you can buy and sell without paying a commission. Broker Commission-Free ETFs NTF Mutual Funds Vanguard 55 ETFs (All Vanguard ETFs) Thousands (including Vanguard mutual funds) Capital One Not available 400+ Data source: company websites. Depending on your needs, you can make a case for either broker. Vanguard has a bigger collection of commission-free ETFs and no-transaction-fee (NTF) mutual funds. But if a particular fund isn't on its ""good"" list, then you'll pay a higher commission to buy and sell than you would at Capital One. We'll cut to the chase: Vanguard and Capital One have no minimum account requirements. If you can scrape together some pocket change, you have enough money to open up a brokerage account with Vanguard or Capital One (or both!). Truthfully, practical minimums are a little bit higher than a single dollar. You'll want to deposit enough money to buy at least one share of a stock, ETF, or mutual fund to make an investment. You can get started with just pocket change at Vanguard and Capital One. Image source: Getty Images. We at The Motley Fool believe that investors do best when they think and invest for the long haul. Therefore, we don't do much trading and don't really have an opinion on the bells and whistles that are part of many trading platforms. If long-term investing is your style, you'll find that Vanguard and Capital One make it simple enough to log in to make the infrequent trade. As the ""quality"" of a trading platform tends to be more of a subjective opinion than an objective comparison, we'll leave this up to you. Want to go global? You're in luck. Investors who want to invest in foreign companies can invest in American depositary receipts (ADRs) through Vanguard or Capital One. However, if you want to trade directly on foreign stock exchanges, Vanguard has the advantage. Its clients can trade on international markets through Vanguard's block-trading desk, but it comes at a higher cost -- you'll pay a $50 fee on top of a commission. Capital One doesn't allow for trading directly on international stock exchanges. Access to research and investment ideas is a great perk of having a brokerage account. Vanguard and Capital One both deliver here with screening and portfolio analysis tools. Vanguard offers access to Standard and Poor's, Thomson Reuters, and First Call news and research. Capital One provides investors with ample third-party research, and uses data from Morningstar to keep you informed about your investments. Depending on your personal needs, either broker could be a great fit for its research capabilities. Mobile apps enable you to trade from anywhere as a Vanguard or Capital One customer. Here's how each brokers' users and clients rated their mobile capabilities on iOS and Android (as of Dec. 6, 2016). Broker Apple App Store Google Play Vanguard 2.0 stars 4.0 stars Capital One 2.5 stars 3.0 stars Data source: relevant app stores. Long-term investors will find plenty to like as customers of either broker. Vanguard offers international stock trading, and more commission-free funds, but its standard commissions are higher than Capital One. Capital One's Sharebuilder and PortfolioBuilder options might be advantageous for some investors, but fund investors might want a bigger selection of fee-free funds. Ultimately, the decision comes down to what's important to your investment process. To be clear, The Motley Fool doesn't endorse any particular broker. But we can make picking a broker a little easier. See our Broker Center, which compiles important features and limitations of some of the most popular brokers. If you'd like to invest in an IRA, see current special offers for IRA accounts, many of which include cash bonuses and commission-free trades as an incentive to sign up. ","

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) made headlines on Monday with the introduction of Radeon Instinct, a line of GPU accelerators aimed specifically at deep learning systems. The company has offered products targeting data centers and high-performance computing for years with its FirePro graphics cards. But Radeon Instinct, along with the MIOpen open-source software that AMD announced alongside the new products, marks a shift in the company's strategy. Image source: AMD. Radeon Instinct will come in three flavors. The MI6 is based on AMD's Polaris GPU architecture, which powers the mainstream gaming graphics cards the company launched earlier this year. This card is aimed at neural network inference, where a trained neural network is used for an application. The MI8 is based on AMD's old Fiji architecture, featuring greater processing power and memory bandwidth, but a quarter of the memory. This card is also likely aimed at inference. The MI25 is the big daddy of the bunch. Built around AMD's upcoming Vega GPU architecture, which will power the company's high-end gaming graphics cards next year, the MI25 offers a whopping 25 TFLOPs of half-precision floating-point performance. This card is aimed at neural network training, a more computationally intensive process than inference. For comparison, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) P100 Tesla GPU clocks in at 21.2 TFLOPS in the best-case scenario, using the company's homegrown NVLink technology instead of standard PCIe. Radeon Instinct products are expected to begin shipping during the first half of 2017. This news comes about one month after AMD scored a big data center win, with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google announcing that it would integrate the company's FirePro graphics cards into its cloud platform. Despite this apparent momentum, AMD remains far behind NVIDIA in the data center market generally and the A.I. acceleration market specifically. With additional competition from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)and even Google itself, it won't be smooth sailing for AMD. NVIDIA has been talking about deep learning for years. The company's data center business is booming thanks to that early focus, closing in on a $1 billion annual run rate after tripling revenue year-over-year during the third quarter. Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs are already offered by most of the major cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud. AMD's GPUs are absent from all three. Google will be adding NVIDIA's GPUs to its cloud platform along with AMD's, so while that announcement was a big win for AMD, it was also a win for NVIDIA. According to an analyst at Nomura, NVIDIA enjoys an 80% share of the accelerator market. A vast amount of software has been ported to run on NVIDIA's GPUs, ranging from computational finance to scientific simulations, creating switching costs for those already using its products. The market for A.I. acceleration is still in its infancy, meaning that AMD is not incapable of catching up. But NVIDIA has a clear lead. Intel has been trying to break into the accelerator market for years with its Xeon Phi line of products. The most recent, Knights Landing, has the advantage of acting as the main processor as well, offering customers potential costs savings. Intel stated earlier this year that it was aiming to move 100,000 units in 2016, a number that would make the product a major force in the accelerator market. Intel is planning to launch a version of Xeon Phi, Knights Mill, aimed specifically at deep learning. Knights Mill will also feature the ability to act as the main processor when it launches next year, giving NVIDIA some serious competition in the A.I. acceleration market in addition to AMD's upcoming products. Image source: Intel. Google may pose a threat to all three companies in the long run. The search giant announced earlier this year that it had designed an application-specific-integrated-circuit in an effort to accelerate deep learnings tasks. Google is reportedly using more than 1,000 of the Tensor Processing Units in its data centers already. In the same way that a GPU is more efficient than a CPU at graphics processing because it's designed at the hardware level for the kind of math involved, Google's TPU is more efficient than a GPU for inference because it's designed at the hardware level for that task. Google claims that its TPUs provide and order-of-magnitude improvement in performance per watt compared to GPUs. AMD is playing catch up when it comes to deep learning. Like NVIDIA, AMD is betting that GPUs are the future of A.I. acceleration. But ASICs like Google's TPU could upend both companies' long-term plans. If other cloud computing vendors move to design their own custom chips for deep learning, the GPU vendors could be left out in the cold. AMD's Radeon Instinct is the company's first real attempt at going after NVIDIA in the A.I. acceleration market. If the company can price the cards competitively, it could be a very profitable endeavor. But the threat of Intel is looming, and the potential for custom chips to eventually displace GPUs is very real. AMD investors should be happy that the company is taking deep learning seriously. But they also shouldn't get ahead of themselves. ","

Therese Poletti,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 14, 2016 4:02 p.m. ET Alphabet spins autonomous-car efforts into new unit called Waymo, but will still bury finances in ‘Other Bets’ category By Alphabet Inc. has changed its self-driving cars business, creating a separate entity called Waymo that plans to sell autonomous technology instead of building its own cars, but Google’s parent company won’t change the way it hides the effort’s finances. At a small press event in San Francisco on Tuesday, executives described Waymo as graduating from the Google X research lab, where driverless technology has been in the works for eight years.

Alphabet does not plan to share how much revenue Waymo brings in nor how profitable it is, however. Google’s parent company confirmed Tuesday that Waymo’s financial results will be lumped in with all its other non-Google businesses, in a bucket called “Other Bets.” Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat has cautioned investors on the company’s conference calls that the Other Bets business results need to be viewed over a “long horizon” because the results can be erratic, or “lumpy” in corporate speak, because they are considered “early stage.” In Alphabet’s most recent quarter, it reported that “Other Bets” reaped $197 million in revenue—primarily from Nest, Google Fiber and Verily—but with an operating loss of $865 million. Waymo is expected to start up a ride-hailing service with self-driving cars by the end of 2017, through its partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV

The ride-hailing business is currently dominated by Uber Technologies Inc., which already has an established rival in Lyft Inc. Uber already has self-driving cars giving rides to customers in Pittsburgh, and Lyft is working with GM on autonomous driving. Alphabet’s increasing rivalry with Uber led to venture exec David Drummond stepping down from Uber’s board last August, where Google had a seat because its venture arm is one of the many investors in Uber. In fact, the biggest prize for Alphabet in this venture may not be money. As in its hardware effort, the real potential is for the ad and search giant to get more data on consumers, Kelley Blue Book analyst Karl Brauer noted. In fact, Brauer contended that partnerships with traditional auto makers have been troublesome for Alphabet because of disagreements about which company will control drivers’ data. . “The personal data generated by self-driving automobiles will offer a wealth of marketing opportunities, creating a secondary business model that goes beyond personal transportation services,” Brauer said. Even though Google’s self-driving car project is seen as the farthest along of all efforts in self driving cars, Waymo’s new direction seems unlikely to generate much in direct revenue for now. With the competition steadily growing in all sectors of this potential market, it could be blocked from any financial success for a long while, and investors won’t know for sure as long as Alphabet keeps it in the “Other Bets” category.

The luxury home furnishings company said it faced a number of hurdles during the third quarter, which has got analysts worried about uncertainty on the horizon. “Restoration Hardware highlighted a soft start to Q4 driven by the election, a delay in getting its source book to customers, and its decision to remove seasonal/holiday merchandise from its store,” said UBS in a note published Friday. “As such, its outlook implies Q4 comps will decline about 20%, showing how much volatility it’s seeing in the trends.” UBS rated Restoration Hardware

Sales totaled $549.3 million, up from $532.4 million for the same period last year and ahead of the $528.0 million FactSet consensus. Adjusted earnings per share were 20 cents, beating the 16-cent FactSet consensus. Same-store sales dropped 6% versus the 12.8% decline FactSet forecast. But the company lowered its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, now expecting a range of $562 million to $592 million and adjusted EPS in the range of 60 cents to 70 cents. The FactSet consensus is for sales of $588.0 on earnings of 68 cents per share. Restoration Hardware shares closed down 18.1% in Friday trading. See also: Restoration Hardware hit by business-model changes Sales that would’ve been booked in the fourth quarter are shifting to the first quarter of next year, according to a statement from Restoration Hardware Chief Executive Gary Friedman. Sales of the company’s holiday collection have been weaker than expected. “While we are clearly disappointed in our fourth quarter outlook, we believe we are making the necessary investments and changes to position our business for the long-term,” Friedman said. “As we cycle these investments and changes, we expect sales to reaccelerate, operating margins to expand, and to generate free cash flow in 2017.” Analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a Friday note that they’re maintaining their hold rating “given the volatility and multiple moving pieces.” “While the near-term is certainly rough for Restoration Hardware we note that the company decided 2016 was a take-your-medicine type of year, which is precisely what is driving the volatility including several significant estimate reductions,” the note said. “But the other side of that coin is both easier compares for 2017 and the potential for investments/initiatives to turn from headwinds to tailwinds.” Read also: Home Depot could be the surprise winner of the holiday season Even with these easier comparisons, it’s unclear how high-end retail will perform in 2017, analysts said. Deutsche Bank lowered its price target to $35 from $40. Cowen & Company also lowered its price target to $30 from $33 on the lack of visibility on comparisons and margin expansion as the company tries to drive positive free cash flow. Cowen rates Restoration Hardware shares market perform. Barclays says it’s also staying on the sidelines after the downward guidance revision, rating the stock equal weight with a $50 price target. However, analysts “believe that potential turnaround is imminent.” See also:  5 things not to buy at Lowe’s and Home Depot One positive area that UBS analysts identified is the company’s Grey Card membership that launched earlier this year. Restoration Hardware has about 260,000 members, with each spending about $1,800, according to analysts. Restoration Hardware said it’s signing up between 5,000 and 8,000 members per week. “The key is the degree to which it can retain these members and drive up spend per member,” UBS said. “New products should help, but the lifetime value of these customers won’t be known for a while. This leaves greater than average uncertainty in projecting its intermediate-term financial performance.” Restoration Hardware shares are down 62% for the last 12 months while the S&P 500 index

Stu Woo,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 10, 2016 2:01 p.m. ET By LONDON -- Telecommunications giant Vodafone Group PLC has a mantra: Be No. 1. Or No. 2. U.K.-based Vodafone, the world's second-biggest mobile carrier by subscribers, is trying to keep that position by having the most -- or second-most -- customers in each of its 26 countries. ""It's not really about being the leader,"" Chief Executive Vittorio Colao told analysts last month. Vodafone believes the top two players in telecom markets -- and it doesn't matter if they are first or second -- are able to differentiate themselves through superior networks and services. By focusing investments in these two areas, the leading operators can justify higher prices. ""The gap versus No. 3s is not only stable, but even increasing,"" Mr. Colao said, adding ""it's about really creating a two-tier market."" Even after a $130 billion windfall from the 2014 sale of its Verizon Wireless stake, Vodafone has so far eschewed big, global expansion. Under Mr. Colao, a 55-year-old Italian reserve military officer who took over as CEO in 2008, the company left the consumer U.S. market and has plowed investment into Europe and the developing world instead. Vodafone's biggest competitors are typically formerly state-owned fixed-line giants still catching up in the mobile age. It earned GBP41 billion ($50 billion) in revenue for the last full fiscal year and ranks below only China Mobile Ltd. in terms of global subscribers. Over two years, Mr. Colao spent about $24 billion across his empire, which is concentrated in Europe, Africa and India, to expand high-speed mobile networks, the pillar of its marketing campaigns. Vodafone also spent about $20 billion in 2013 and 2014 to buy major cable operators in Germany and Spain, and it is expanding its wired cable and internet network so it can sell the telecom industry's Holy Grail: a ""quad-play"" package that offers mobile, landline telephone, cable and internet services on one bill. The results so far are mixed: Vodafone said last month that its plan was paying off in parts of Europe, but proving much more expensive than anticipated in India. Overall, Vodafone's organic revenue, which excludes foreign-exchange movement, grew 2.2% in the third quarter of 2016, outperforming the average 1.6% growth of major Europe-based telecom firms, according to Raymond James analyst Stephane Beyazian. Leading the way over the past six months was Germany, with 2.3% organic growth, and Italy, at 1.7%. But Vodafone's organic revenue declined 2.7% in its home market of the U.K. -- where it is the No. 3 mobile operator behind BT Group PLC, which operates the EE brand, and Telefónica SA's O2. Mr. Colao blames the shortfall partly on billing problems and customer-service complaints related to a new computer system. Even more costly has been defending its No. 2 status in India. New mobile carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., funded by India's richest man, has offered free service for at least a month to get new customers. Vodafone wrote down the value of its India business by EUR5 billion ($5.3 billion) earlier this month, citing the competition. ""It is very hard to compete with someone who gives stuff for free,"" Mr. Colao said. Vodafone was formed in Newbury, England, in 1984 and spun off from military and electronics conglomerate Racal Electronics Group in 1991. It was one of the world's first mobile-focused telecom companies, and obtained licenses in a hodgepodge of countries early in the cellphone era and via two big deals. It merged with AirTouch Communications, a San Francisco-based mobile carrier with world-wide holdings, in 1999. The next year, it acquired Mannesmann AG, a German telecommunications business with European operations. In 1999, Vodafone merged its U.S. mobile operations with those of Bell Atlantic Corp., with the latter renaming itself Verizon Communications Inc. They called their joint venture Verizon Wireless, with Verizon owning 55% and Vodafone the other 45%. Verizon Communications had long tried to buy out Vodafone's shares, but the two didn't reach an agreement until 2013. The sale closed in 2014. Vodafone gave back $84 billion from the sale to shareholders -- the largest single return in modern corporate history. A chunk of the remainder went to pay taxes and reduce debt. The rest of those funds helped bankroll Vodafone's two-year network-improvement program. The project, which mostly wrapped up this past spring, focused on expanding Vodafone's fourth-generation mobile network, or 4G, in Europe and both its fourth- and third-generation networks in emerging markets such as India. For years, Vodafone and John Malone's Liberty Global PLC have publicly flirted with the idea of a combination. The two companies expect to complete a merger of their operations in the Netherlands later this year, creating a 50-50 joint venture. Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference last month, Mr. Colao and Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said the Dutch tie-up wasn't necessarily indicative of future deals. But Mr. Colao kept the door open. ""We see the world the same way,"" Mr. Colao told investors, describing Mr. Fries. ""Is this the first trial of something bigger? Not necessarily....But of course it helps to know each other.""

I’m sorry. I’m so nervous,” Smith, 69, said, covering her face and asking the orchestra to start over. The audience at Stockholm’s Concert Hall clapped as the singer regained her composure and finally got through Dylan’s 1962 song from his second album, “The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan.” Dylan, 75, declared that he would not attend the prestigious awards in November, telling the Swedish Academy that “other commitments make it unfortunately impossible.” See: It’s not about the awards: What we can learn from Bob Dylan and his Nobel Prize However, a statement from Dylan was read aloud by the United States ambassador to Sweden, Azita Raji, at the ceremony. “I’m sorry I can’t be with you in person, but please know that I am most definitely with you in spirit and honored to be receiving such a prestigious prize,” it reads, according to Rolling Stone. “If someone had ever told me that I had the slightest chance of winning the Nobel Prize, I would have to think that I’d have about the same odds as standing on the moon,” it says. The statement ends with Dylan thanking the academy for considering whether his songs are truly considered literature and “for providing such a wonderful answer.” Don’t miss: Bob Dylan was also a brilliant economist Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at a separate ceremony in Oslo, Norway, for reaching a deal to end a five-decade-long conflict with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

                                   the operator of a chain of for-profit colleges, will forgive $30.35 million in student loans over claims the company misled prospective students about their ability to get jobs after graduation. The loan forgiveness, which covers all unpaid student loans made through DeVry between Sept. 1, 2008 and Sept. 30, 2015, is part of a larger settlement with the Federal Trade Commission totaling $100 million. The deal doesn’t include any federal student loans made to students who attended the school during the period of the lawsuit. The deal, which covers tens of thousands of students, according to the FTC, includes a $49.4 million payment to the FTC that the agency will distribute to students harmed by the misleading marketing. DeVry will also forgive $20.25 million owed to the school by students for items like tuition, books and lab fees. The company agreed to provide students with any transcripts or diplomas that were withheld over the unpaid bills. The loan forgiveness will happen automatically and DeVry will notify the students eligible for relief as well as their credit bureaus. The FTC will begin sending refunds from the $49.4 million pot in 2017 and will identify students who qualify from DeVry’s records and contact them about the refund. The FTC sued DeVry last year, alleging the company touted a job placement rate of 90% without evidence to back it up. The agency uncovered evidence that DeVry considered a server at the Cheesecake Factory

As part of the deal, DeVry agreed that any time the company makes a claim about job placement rates of a class of students, it has to save documentation related to that claim, including files related to the students or graduates. “DeVry often presents itself as a better actor in the sector, but what this settlement shows is that they are not immune to the pressures of the sector to bring students in the door and to generate revenue,” said Elizabeth Baylor, the director of postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. DeVry neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The company is “pleased this matter is reaching a resolution,” Ernie Gibbles, a DeVry spokesman, wrote in an emailed statement. “At no time has the academic quality of a DeVry University education been question.” The deal comes as the Obama administration looks to cement its legacy as a tough enforcer in the higher education space, specifically for-profit colleges. Earlier this year, the Department of Education banned ITT Technical Institutes from access federal financial aid to enroll new students, amid multiple probes into the school’s dealings with students and investors. Suffering a cash crunch, the company filed for bankruptcy weeks later. Corinthian Colleges also collapsed last year amid financial pressures resulting from additional requirements placed on the school by the Department in order to receive federal financial aid. DeVry avoided a similar fate after agreeing in October to reserve $68 million to settle claims brought by the Department that the school used misleading advertisements. The agency required the company to set aside the money to continue receiving access to federal financial aid. DeVry’s access to federal student aid also isn’t impacted by the FTC settlement, the company said in a statement. The deal marks the second roughly $100 million settlement reached by a federal government agency with a for-profit college this year. But the eye-popping number likely won’t affect DeVry’s ability to operate, given that DeVry collected more than $1 billion in financial aid during the 2014 to 2015 school year, according to Baylor. What’s more, the actual cost of the settlement to DeVry is much lower than the $100 million touted by the FTC. In securities filings, the company said it expects to record a pretax charge of between $52 and $55 million as a result of the deal. “The settlement will cost DeVry much less than $100 million, since the corporation has long known that many students would never be able to repay the private student loans that were pushed on them,” Rohit Chopra, the former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in an email. “DeVry’s stock has surged since Election Day, and their recent legal settlements won’t stop the flow of federal funds into company coffers.” As of 3 p.m. Thursday, DeVry’s stock was up 2.69% from Wednesday’s close. DeVry and other companies in the higher education sector have seen their stocks rise in the wake of the election, amid indications that a Trump administration will be friendlier to for-profit colleges and other industry players. The deal doesn’t cover federal loans owed by students who attended DeVry during the period of the suit. Federal student loan borrowers who believe they were wronged by their schools can apply to the Department of Education as a part of a process known as borrower defense to have their loans wiped away. Often lawsuits can serve as evidence of wrongdoing for purposes of federal student loan forgiveness, but because the judgment doesn’t specify any particular illegal conduct it could make it difficult for borrowers to rely on it to claim loan forgiveness. It also appears that a Donald Trump administration will be friendlier to for-profit colleges, which may mean that borrowers petitioning for forgiveness will have a tougher time. “There are indications from the incoming Trump administration that they will be pretty strict about issuing students relief,” Baylor said. The Department of Education didn’t indicate whether the FTC settlement would help DeVry students with federal loans in their pleas for forgiveness. When the Department announced its own deal with DeVry, the agency said it planned to continue its own investigations into the institution. Any resulting findings could help borrowers in their efforts to pursue forgiveness. “We are pleased that today’s settlement delivers both financial relief to former students and puts in place protections for current and future DeVry students,” Ted Mitchell, the undersecretary of education, said in a statement.

Rex Nutting,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 12, 2016 8:06 a.m. ET No, Mr. Trump: The unemployment rate isn’t really 42%, and there aren’t 95 million people out of work By As we consume more and more information through unfiltered internet sites and social-media networks, all of us have become more susceptible to getting fooled by propaganda, which is what people really mean when they talk about the problem of “fake news.” One particularly pernicious kind of propaganda is based on “fake statistics,” which give a gloss of truth and scientific certainty to the misleading information spread by propagandists. There are a lot of “fake statistics” bandied about in service of some ideology or another, but I’d like to focus on just one example in which I have expertise from my work covering the monthly employment report over the past 20 years: The idea that there are 95 million Americans who are out of work but not counted as unemployed. This statistic pervades the conservative discourse about our economy (or at least until Jan. 20). The implication of this statistic is that the government and media are lying to us. Instead of an economy that’s slowly improving as President Barack Obama has been telling us, our economy is actually a catastrophic failure, unable to provide any work for nearly 100 million people. Also by Rex Nutting: America is full of slackers and deadbeats who won’t work Our president-elect, Donald Trump, seems to believe this fake statistic. His newly named economic adviser, Gary Cohn, does too, as do many other Republican politicians. Even trained economists and well-respected market strategists use the 95 million figure as a short-hand way of saying the economy sucks, despite the 4.6% unemployment rate, or the 14 million people who’ve gotten a job over the past seven years as we crawled out of the Great Recession. Google “95 million unemployed” and you’ll find that dozens of right-wing news sites regularly report on and comment on the fact that a record 95 million adults are not in the labor force. We’ve heard it over and over on Fox,CNBC,Breitbart,ZeroHedge, LifeZette,CNS News and many more. You’ll find it on MarketWatch, as well. This is the perfect fake statistic, because it’s absolutely true. And completely meaningless. It obscures more than it reveals. It takes a valid observation about the economy, that too many people still can’t find a good-paying job, and buries it in a mountain of ideological propaganda. It is true, according to the Labor Department’s surveys, that there are about 95 million civilian, noninstitutionalized residents over 16 who are not in the labor force, which means they are neither working at a job nor looking for one. It’s reported every month, right in this table. But this fact doesn’t prove what Trump and the rest say it proves: that the economy is a disaster because it has failed to provide jobs for 95 million people, or that 95 million Americans are lazy. Trump and Breitbart News won’t tell you the whole truth, which is that the vast majority of these 95 million people have chosen not to work. They don’t want a job, or they don’t need a job. What do we know about the 95 million? Quite a lot, actually. In addition to the monthly survey, every year the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics ask a big sample of Americans about whether they worked last year, and if not, why not. Steve Hipple, a labor economist for the BLS, provided me with the latest raw, unpublished data, for 2015. These data aren’t exact, but they do give us a rough idea of the situation. Read Hipple’s article on the 2014 data. Of the 87 million people who were out of the labor force for the entire year of 2015: • 39 million were retired. They are enjoying the real American dream, which is to stop working before they drop dead on the job. They deserve a break from a lifetime of toil. They already made America great. They don’t deserve to be shamed by right-wing pundits who think they should get out of the “cozy hammock” of welfare and get a job. • Then there are 16 million people who aren’t in the labor force because they are in school, learning the skills they need to get more than a minimum-wage job. They deserve our support because they are the ones who will make America great in the future. • And what about the 13 million people who aren’t in the labor force because they are at home with the kids, or caring for elderly parents or a disabled adult? Isn’t family what makes America great? If people choose to contribute by raising the kids, who are Donald Trump or Breitbart to say that they are doing the wrong thing? • And then there are 16 million people who say they didn’t look for work in 2015 because they are disabled or were too sick to work. Undoubtedly, some of them are goldbricking, but many have legitimate ailments, especially considering how physically demanding many jobs are. For most Americans, going to work means lots of standing, walking, lifting, climbing and bending. The typical worker in America is on his or her feet for an average of 4 ½ hours a day, and needs to be able to lift a 30-pound load. Half of the men between 25 and 54 who are out of the labor force report taking pain medication daily. • That leaves about 3 million people who said they’re weren’t looking for a job for “other reasons,” including believing that looking for a job is hopeless. Read Frank J. Lysy’s excellent blog post on the 95 million. Most of the 95 million are doing OK, thank you very much. A fraction — maybe a tenth — would be working if the labor market were stronger and wages were higher. Especially in the small towns and rural counties of the deindustrialized Midwest and South, some of the people who are retired, or in school, or watching the kids, or self-medicating with booze, TV and opiates would make a different choice if they could: They’d choose to work. Along with the 7 million people who are officially counted as unemployed (because they are actively looking for work), the 6 million to 10 million or so people who have given up on work do represent a failure of the economy. All told, about 13 million to 17 million people are involuntarily unemployed, which “takes a toll on life satisfaction, self-esteem, physical health and mortality,” as Obama has said. It’s tragic. But our economy isn’t failing 95 million people, as Trump and Breitbart claim; it’s failing 17 million. That’s a big number, big enough that we don’t need to exaggerate it for political purposes. The “real” unemployment rate is closer to 10% than it is to 30%, or to Donald Trump’s 42%. Don’t worry, though. On Jan. 20, Trump and his propagandists will surely start telling us how great everything is. Just look how low the unemployment rate is!

Jeremy C. Owens,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 9, 2016 10:46 a.m. ET Opinion: Recent actions of Facebook and Tesla CEOs show weak boards beholden to executives instead of shareholders By A company’s board of directors is supposed to act in the best interests of shareholders, but that doesn’t always seem to be the case in Silicon Valley, where some chief executives are capable of driving boards to act in their own interests. The latest example of worrisome corporate governance in the tech mecca comes from Facebook Inc.

                                   , where new information shows that the relationship between one board member and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has gotten far too cozy. Bloomberg News reported revelations Thursday on recently unsealed documents in a shareholder lawsuit that contends Facebook’s recent stock split with a new class of nonvoting stock are tantamount to “granting Zuckerberg billions of dollars in equity, for which he will not pay anything.” The plan, announced in April along with Facebook’s barn-burning first-quarter earnings, was a move by Zuckerberg to retain his control of the company despite plans to deposit almost all his Facebook stock in a philanthropic LLC, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. It is a fraught decision for a board to approve a new class of stock that will not have voting privileges and ensure Zuckerberg retains control no matter what he may do in the future. Zuckerberg seems to have had an ace in the hole, though: board member and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. Documents in the lawsuit showed texts in which Andreessen was advising Zuckerberg and helping him prepare for questions from a Facebook special committee of the board that reviewed the three-way stock split. Andreessen, one of the three members of that committee, even coached Zuckerberg via text message during one board call. Facebook’s three-way stock split was not well-received by corporate governance experts and some investors, but it was approved by Facebook shareholders after the board’s seal of approval. “Facebook is confident that the special committee engaged in a thorough and fair process to negotiate a proposal in the best interests of Facebook and its shareholders,” Facebook said in an emailed statement. Zuckerberg is also chairman of the board, which counts Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Jan Koum — co-founder and CEO of WhatsApp, an app that Zuckerberg acquired for $16 billion plus incentives — among its members in addition to Andreessen. Together, that group makes up exactly half of the eight-member board, a voting bloc that could ensure Zuckerberg gets his way. This is certainly an issue beyond Facebook, which was really just stealing from Google’s playbook. Now called Alphabet Inc.

                                    MX:SCTY Musk had a number of conflicts of interest in the deal for SolarCity, a solar installer for which he was the principal investor, chairman and cousin of the two founders who act as its top executives. A strong, independent board would have had some serious questions about the deal and how it could be in Musk’s favor while possibly not in Tesla’s, and Musk rightly recused himself from board discussions. Musk — also chairman at Tesla — had no need to worry that the board would decide in his favor, though, considering how many had a vested interest in seeing SolarCity propped up by a larger entity. Tesla board members included Antonio Gracias, who was also a SolarCity board member; Brad Buss, the former chief financial officer for SolarCity; and Steve Jurvetson, whose venture-capital firm invested in SolarCity. Another Tesla board member is Elon Musk’s brother, Kimbal Musk. The Tesla-SolarCity deal divided Wall Street and even the two largest independent shareholder-advisory services, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass Lewis & Co. While ISS described the deal as “reasonable” and a “necessary step,” Glass Lewis called it a “thinly veiled bailout” for SolarCity. In its recommendation against voting for the deal, Glass Lewis cited the board’s review, saying it was “hastily managed by a board room rife with conflicts and seemingly limited interest in moderating the apparently ardent strategic and financial preferences” of Elon Musk. Still, Tesla shareholders approved the deal. Now, Tesla will deal with its own consolidated shareholder lawsuit, which could make a compelling case. As in Facebook’s case, Musk and Tesla are not alone in this kind of maneuver. At the same time Tesla was fighting to ensure the SolarCity merger, Oracle Corp.

Despite objections from one of NetSuite’s largest institutional shareholders, Oracle’s $9.3 billion deal for the cloud software developer would also eventually go through. Forward-thinking executives like Zuckerberg and Musk draw investors to Silicon Valley companies, but building a new “old-boy network” through their boards could also drive them away. Instead of doing what they want and paying off those who dissent through shareholder lawsuits, tech companies’ founders and top executives should start actually constructing boards to do what they are supposed to do.

Jeremy Page,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 14, 2016 10:34 p.m. ET China had promises not to militarize disputed islands in South China Sea By BEIJING — China has installed antiaircraft guns and other weapons on all seven of the artificial islands it has built in a disputed part of the South China Sea, according to a U.S. think tank’s analysis of recent satellite imagery. Late Wednesday, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative said China had installed the weapons despite President Xi Jinping’s pledge not to militarize the islands in the Spratly archipelago, where Beijing’s territorial claims are contested by several other governments. AMTI’s report, published on its website, comes after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump suggested this month he would challenge China on trade and the status of Taiwan, and accused Beijing of building a “massive military complex” in the South China Sea. China’s island-building over the last three years has raised fears in the U.S. and among its Asian allies and partners that Beijing plans to use its expanding military power to enforce its territorial claims and take control of one of the world’s busiest shipping routes.

Rachel Koning Beals,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 9, 2016 3:11 p.m. ET Gold at 10-month low as market digs in for expected Fed rate hike By Gold futures finish Friday at their lowest levels since February, marking their fifth weekly loss in a row, as the dollar firmed in anticipation of an interest rate hike at next week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Market-based indicators put the odds of a Fed rate hike next week at nearly 100%. The move would be central bank’s second postcrisis rate hike. The first occurred nearly a year ago at the Fed’s December 2015 policy meeting. Higher interest rates typically cause the dollar to strengthen, which often weighs on commodities like gold that have prices denominated in dollars. Financial markets are anxiously awaiting the details of that December 13-14 meeting, including a peek at the central bank’s “dot plot,” which sketches out members’ predictions for interest rates and growth measures over the coming months. It is the pacing of the reversal of easy monetary policy next year that’s captured the markets’ attention lately, strategists say.

Prices marked their lowest finish since early February, and lost roughly 1.1% for the week, according to FactSet data based on the most-active contracts. That was longest stretch of consecutive weekly losses this year. “Near term, the outlook for gold still depends on the dollar, and the inverse relationship may fade slightly due to positioning into the Fed next week,” said Tyler Richey, co-editor of The 7:00’s Report. “Bottom line, if the dollar rally continues, so will the golden selloff.” Read: New rules for gold investing may open the market to 1.6 billion Muslims On Friday, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index

Strength in the buck can undercut demand for commodities, including gold, making them less attractive for holders of other currencies, and higher interest rates tend to lift the dollar and increase demand for higher-yielding alternatives to nonyielding gold. With the Fed meeting looming, the dollar-positive monetary policy gap between the U.S. and other economic powerhouses becomes more obvious. The European Central Bank on Thursday announced it will extend its quantitative-easing program until December 2017 and possibly beyond that, which sent the euro lower against the dollar. The central bank, however, will reduce its bond-buying firepower after March. The bank did hold pat on interest rates, as expected. As global bond yields adjust to less-easy monetary policy, gold has been increasingly reactive to yield moves.

                                   has been hovering near 16-month highs, after a sharp advance in November following the U.S. elections. Yields have risen along the range of bonds, but especially at the shorter-dated end, as the Fed is widely expected to raise its short-term rates by a quarter point when it concludes the two-day meeting next Wednesday. Fed-funds futures, a popular tool for traders to bet on U.S. interest-rate policy, indicate an above-90% probability for such a move. As for gold’s response to the Fed, “an upside correction may materialize amid profit-taking on short positions as traders entertain the possibility that the central bank envisions a shallower tightening path than what has been priced in after the U.S. president election,” said Ilya Spivak, currency strategist with Daily FX. What’s more, the general appetite for assets seen as risky has lowered demand for haven gold. The Dow Jones Industrial Average

The equities rally attracts “risk capital that might otherwise find a home in gold,” said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"(Reuters) - The families of three men killed at Orlando’s Pulse gay nightclub have sued Twitter Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc in federal court, accusing the companies of providing “material support” to the self-radicalized gunman. The gunman, 29-year-old Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people and wounded 53 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State militant group before police fatally shot him after the June attack, officials said. The lawsuit was filed on Monday in Detroit federal court by the families of Tevin Crosby, Javier Jorge-Reyes and Juan Ramon Guerrero, who were killed during the massacre. Similar lawsuits in the past have faced an uphill fight because of strong protections in U.S. federal law for the technology industry. The three families claim Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Facebook “provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts they use to spread extremist propaganda, raise funds and attract new recruits.” The suit alleges the “material support has been instrumental to the rise of ISIS and has enabled it to carry out or cause to be carried out, numerous terrorist attacks.” Facebook said on Tuesday there is no place on its service for groups that engage in or support terrorism, and that it takes swift action to remove that content when it is reported. “We are committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook,” it said in a statement. “We sympathize with the victims and their families.” Twitter declined to comment. In August, the company said it had suspended 360,000 accounts since mid-2015 for violating policies related to promotion of terrorism. Representatives of Google could not immediately be reached. The three companies plus Microsoft Corp said this month they would coordinate more to remove extremist content, sharing digital “fingerprints” with each other. Technology companies are protected from many lawsuits under Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which says website operators are not liable for content posted by others. Monday’s lawsuit claims that the companies create unique content by combining ISIS postings with advertisements to target the viewer. It also says they share revenue with ISIS for its content and profit from ISIS postings through advertising revenue. The families in the case in Michigan, where one of the victims is from, are seeking damages and for the court to rule that the sites have violated the Anti-Terrorism Act in the United States. ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"SAN FRANCISCO/TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd said it is in talks to supply vehicles for Alphabet Inc’s Waymo to test self-driving technology, in the latest instance of a carmaker teaming up with a tech firm to supplement its own automation efforts. The talks, which come just one week after Waymo became an independent company, could see Honda become the tech firm’s second partner after Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV agreed in May to add the technology to its minivans. The moves illustrate how carmakers, faced with the high cost of developing autonomous driving tech in-house, are separating into those going it alone, such as General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, and those teaming up to spread the costs. Honda already has tie-ups with tech startups, notably with Southeast Asian ride-hailing service Grab. It has been working alone to develop cars which can drive themselves on highways by 2020 while stressing vehicles will always require drivers. But it said was interested in the approach of Google’s self-driving car project - now Waymo - to develop fully autonomous, driverless cars. “There’s only so much technology a company can develop while focusing on one specific approach,” Honda spokesman Teruhiko Tatebe told Reuters. “By approaching it from multiple angles it’s possible to come up with new innovations quicker.” At the same time, technology firms such as Waymo have started to form partnerships with automakers to finally get their technology - seven years in the making in the case of Waymo - into more vehicles. “You’ve got Google, which is engaging with another automaker to apply its technology into different vehicles and different platforms,” said senior analyst Jeremy Carlson at researcher IHS Automotive. “From Honda’s perspective, you get a close-up look at some of the most capable technology in the industry today.” Honda has been developing automated driving functions and ways to connect vehicles to the internet, as well as artificial intelligence to enable vehicles to “think” while driving. With Waymo, Honda said it may provide vehicles modified to accommodate the startup’s software - as Fiat Chrysler has done with its Chrysler Pacifica minivans. It also said there was potential for “close” cooperation between Honda and Waymo engineers. A Waymo representative said the company was “looking forward to exploring opportunities to collaborate with Honda.” ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"In the class action lawsuit filed on Tuesday in California state court in San Francisco, the employee, identified only as “John Doe,” says Google’s employment agreements are illegally broad and violate various state labor laws. The plaintiff says the confidentiality agreements that all Google employees are required to sign essentially bar workers from saying anything about the company, even to each other. The agreements define confidential information as “without limitation, any information in any form that relates to Google or Google’s business that is not generally known,” according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit says the agreements violate state laws that provide that employers cannot bar workers from discussing their wages or disclosing information to government agencies. A spokesperson for Mountain View, California-based Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, said in a statement that the claims were “baseless,” and said the agreements were designed to protect sensitive business information and not to bar employees from discussing working conditions. “We’re very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information,” the spokesperson said. Google is facing similar claims from an unidentified employee in proceedings before the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, which recently struck down confidentiality agreements and other employment contracts that could discourage workers from discussing concerns at T-Mobile USA Inc, DirectTV and a number of other companies. In the lawsuit, the plaintiff says that to enforce its policies, Google forces workers to spy on each other through a program called “Stopleaks” that requires them to report the disclosure of confidential information. Employees can be fired or sued for violating employment agreements or failing to report leaks, according to the lawsuit. “Google continues to insist that Googlers refrain from plainly communicating with others that Google is violating the law or endangering consumers,” the complaint says. Plaintiffs in court cases are rarely allowed to proceed anonymously absent extraordinary circumstances. The Google worker says that being identified could harm his reputation at the company and his future job prospects. The plaintiff is seeking to represent all current and former Google employees who signed the agreements. The lawsuit says the company has about 65,000 workers. The case is Doe v.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"(Reuters) - Virtual assistants are set to pummel virtual reality headsets in the fight for consumer dollars this holiday season, while smartwatches drive wearable sales. Drones may fly under the radar, though. Interviews with nearly two dozen analysts indicate high hopes for holiday electronics sales, but estimates of what will be the hit have changed. After dubbing virtual reality as the “next mega tech theme” in a May 2015 industry report, brokerage Piper Jaffray will cut its 2016 estimate for sales of VR headsets by 65 percent to 2.2 million units in an as yet unpublished report. “With high-end VR for a family of four one might be looking at $10,000,” said Lee. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz estimated nearly 10 million to 12 million Amazon Echo and Google Home virtual assistants could sell during the holidays. “Personal assistants are going to blow VR out of the water,” he said. Google launched its $129 Home assistant in time for the holidays, but the $39.99 price of the Echo Dot-a miniaturized version of the original- and a list of features two years in the making give the Echo the edge this year, said Tractica analyst Mark Beccue. “I saw one feature in a hackathon where you list items in the fridge then Alexa tells you here’s what you can make for dinner tonight,” he said. Fitness devices are losing ground, in market share terms, to multipurpose watches, said Forrester analyst Julie Ask. “There are plenty of drones that are $100, $150, that would be more in competition with virtual reality than anything else in terms of appeal for the same age groups,” said Atherton Research analyst Jean Baptiste Su. Oppenheimer’s Uerkwitz put drones in the same basket as virtual reality, given price and limited use: “probably going to underperform” the competition. ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"(Reuters) - Yahoo Inc’s secret scanning of customer emails at the behest of a U.S. spy agency is part of a growing push by officials to loosen constitutional protections Americans have against arbitrary governmental searches, according to legal documents and people briefed on closed court hearings. The order on Yahoo from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) last year resulted from the government’s drive to change decades of interpretation of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment right of people to be secure against “unreasonable searches and seizures,” intelligence officials and others familiar with the strategy told Reuters. The unifying idea, they said, is to move the focus of U.S. courts away from what makes something a distinct search and toward what is “reasonable” overall. The basis of the argument for change is that people are making much more digital data available about themselves to businesses, and that data can contain clues that would lead to authorities disrupting attacks in the United States or on U.S. interests abroad. While it might technically count as a search if an automated program trawls through all the data, the thinking goes, there is no unreasonable harm unless a human being looks at the result of that search and orders more intrusive measures or an arrest, which even then could be reasonable. Civil liberties groups and some other legal experts said the attempt to expand the ability of law enforcement agencies and intelligence services to sift through vast amounts of online data, in some cases without a court order, was in conflict with the Fourth Amendment because many innocent messages are included in the initial sweep. “A lot of it is unrecognizable from a Fourth Amendment perspective,” said Orin Kerr, a former federal prosecutor and George Washington University Law School expert on surveillance. “It’s not where the traditional Fourth Amendment law is.” But the general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Robert Litt, said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday that the legal interpretation needed to be adjusted because of technological changes. “Computerized scanning of communications in the same way that your email service provider scans looking for viruses - that should not be considered a search requiring a warrant for Fourth Amendment purposes,” said Litt. He said he is leaving his post on Dec. 31 as the end of President Barack Obama’s administration nears. Reuters was unable to determine what data, if any, was handed over by Yahoo after its live email search. The search was first reported by Reuters on Oct. 4. [nL2N1CA1OW] Yahoo and the National Security Agency (NSA) declined to explain the basis for the order. The surveillance court, whose members are appointed by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, oversees and approves the domestic pursuit of intelligence about foreign powers. While details of the Yahoo search are classified, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters it was aimed at isolating a digital signature for a single person or small team working for a foreign government frequently at odds with America. The ODNI is expected to disclose as soon as next month an estimated number of Americans whose electronic communications have been caught up in online surveillance programs intended for foreigners, U.S. lawmakers said. [nL1N1EB1SU] Upstream surveillance allows the NSA to copy web traffic to search data for certain terms called “selectors,” such as email addresses, that are contained in the body of messages. ODNI’s Litt said ordinary words are not used as selectors. The Fourth Amendment applies to the search and seizure of electronic devices as much as ordinary papers. Wiretaps and other surveillance in the internet age are now subject to litigation across the United States. But in the FISC, with rare exceptions, the judges hear only from the executive branch. Their rulings have been appealed only three times, each time going to a review board. Only the government is permitted to appeal from there, and so far it has never felt the need. The FISC’s reasoning, though, is heading into public courts. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Dec. 5 cited FISC precedents in rejecting an appeal of an Oregon man who was convicted of plotting to bomb a Christmas tree lighting ceremony after his emails were collected in another investigation. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are fighting the expansion of legalized surveillance in Congress and in courts. On Dec. 8, the ACLU argued in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that a lawsuit by Wikipedia’s parent group against the NSA should not have been dismissed by a lower court, which ruled that the nonprofit could not show it had been snooped on and that the government could keep details of the program secret. The concerns of civil libertarians and others have been heightened by President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of conservative Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas to be director of the CIA. Pompeo, writing in the Wall Street Journal in January, advocated expanding bulk collection of telephone calling records in pursuit of Islamic State and its sympathizers who could plan attacks on Americans. Pompeo said the records could be combined with “publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database.” Yahoo’s search went far beyond what would be required to monitor a single email account. The company agreed to create and then conceal a special program on its email servers that would check all correspondence for a specific string of bits. Trawling for selectors is known as “about” searching, when content is collected because it is about something of interest rather than because it was sent or received by an established target. It is frequently used by the NSA in its bulk upstream collection of international telecom traffic. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an appointed panel established by Congress as part of its post-9/11 expansion of intelligence authority, reported in 2014 that “about” searches “push the program close to the line of constitutional reasonableness.” A glimpse of the new legal arguments came in a FISC proceeding last year held to review NSA and FBI annual surveillance targets and four sets of procedures for limiting the spread of information about Americans. Judge Thomas Hogan appointed Amy Jeffress, an attorney at  Arnold and Porter and a former national security prosecutor, to weigh in, the first time that court had asked an outside privacy expert for advice before making a decision. Jeffress argued each search aimed at an American should be tested against the Fourth Amendment, while prosecutors said that only overall searching practice had to be evaluated for “reasonableness.” Hogan agreed with the government, ruling that even though the Fourth Amendment was all but waived in the initial data gathering because foreigners were the targets, the voluminous data incidentally gathered on Americans could also be used to investigate drug deals or robberies. “While they are targeting foreign intelligence information, they are collecting broader information, and there needs to be strong protections for how that information is used apart from national security,” Jeffress told Reuters. ODNI’s Litt wrote in a February Yale Law Review article that the new approach was appropriate, in part because so much personal data is willingly shared by consumers with technology companies. Litt advocated for courts to evaluate “reasonableness” by looking at the entirety of the government’s activity, including the degree of transparency. Litt told Reuters that he did not mean, however, that the same techniques in “about” searches should be pushed toward the more targeted searches at email providers such as Yahoo. Although speaking generally, he said: “My own personal approach to this is you should trade off broader collection authority for stricter use authority,” so that more is taken in but less is acted upon. This position strikes some academics and participants in the process as a remarkable departure from what the highest legal authority in the land was thinking just two years ago. That was when the Supreme Court’s Roberts wrote for a majority in declaring that mobile phones usually could not be searched without warrants. After prosecutors said they had protocols in place to protect phone privacy, Roberts wrote: “Probably a good idea, but the Founders did not fight a revolution to gain the right to government agency protocols.” With little evidence that the Supreme Court agrees with the surveillance court, it remains possible it would reverse the trend. But a case would first need to make its way up there. (The story corrects Kerr’s law school affiliation in seventh paragraph) ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian government aims to pass a law in the spring of next year to allow testing of self-driving vehicles on Norwegian roads, it said on Thursday. Norway is one of the largest markets for Tesla Motors electric vehicles, thanks to generous government subsidies. Tesla said in October its new models will come with hardware, including cameras and a radar, to enable them to be fully-self driving. The move to permit testing of self-driving vehicles is also aimed at giving a competitive edge to Norwegian technology companies as the country seeks to diversify away from the offshore petroleum sector, hit by a plunge in global oil prices. Other companies exploring self-driving cars include Alphabet’s Google, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Ford Motor Co. Norway’s Ministry of Transport and Communications said the government was sending out a proposal for consultation on a new law with the aim of getting a bill passed by parliament in the spring of 2017. “The objective of the bill is to facilitate the testing of self-driving vehicles on Norwegian roads ... within the framework of traffic safety while protecting the integrity of personal information,” it said in a statement. Self-driving vehicles will be introduced gradually, and only technologically mature systems would be approved for testing, it added. The roll-out of self-driving cars faces a bumpy start in some countries due to lack of regulation and public scepticism about their safety. Uber stopped testing its self-driving cars in San Francisco this week, after California authorities revoked the registration of 16 of its self-driving cars because they had not received the proper permits. Uber said it was not obliged to have a permit because its vehicles require continuous monitoring by a person in the car. ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the summer of 2013, Yahoo Inc launched a project to better secure the passwords of its customers, abandoning the use of a discredited technology for encrypting data known as MD5. It was too late. In August of that year, hackers got hold of more than a billion Yahoo accounts, stealing the poorly encrypted passwords and other information in the biggest data breach on record. Yahoo only recently uncovered the hack and disclosed it last week. The timing of the attack might seem like bad luck, but the weakness of MD5 had been known by hackers and security experts for more than a decade. MD5 can be cracked more easily than other so-called “hashing” algorithms, which are mathematical functions that convert data into seemingly random character strings. In 2008, five years before Yahoo took action, Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute issued a public warning to security professionals through a U.S. government-funded vulnerability alert system: MD5 “should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.” Yahoo’s failure to move away from MD5 in a timely fashion was an example of problems in Yahoo’s security operations as it grappled with business challenges, according to five former employees and some outside security experts. Stronger hashing technology would have made it more difficult for the hackers to get into customer accounts after breaching Yahoo’s network, making the attack far less damaging, they said. “MD5 was considered dead long before 2013,” said David Kennedy, chief executive of cyber firm TrustedSec LLC. “Most companies were using more secure hashing algorithms by then.” He did not name specific firms. Yahoo, which has confirmed it was still using MD5 at the time of the attack, disputed the notion that the company had skimped on security. “Over the course of our more than 20-year history, Yahoo has focused on and invested in security programs and talent to protect our users,” Yahoo said in a statement to Reuters. “We have invested more than $250 million in security initiatives across the company since 2012.” The former Yahoo security staffers, however, told Reuters the security team was at times turned down when it requested new tools and features such as strengthened cryptography protections, on the grounds that the requests would cost too much money, were too complicated, or were simply too low a priority. Partly, that reflected the internet pioneer’s long-running financial struggles: Yahoo’s revenues and profits have fallen steadily since their 2008 peak while Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook Inc and others have come to dominate the consumer internet business. “When business is good, it’s easy to do things like security,” said Jeremiah Grossman, who worked on Yahoo’s security team from 1999 to 2001. “When business is bad, you expect to see security get cut.” To be sure, no system is completely hack-proof. Hackers have managed to break into passwords that were encrypted using more advanced technologies than MD5. Other Internet companies, such as LinkedIn and AOL, have also suffered security breaches, though none nearly as large as Yahoo’s. “This could happen to any large corporation,” said Tom Kellermann, a former World Bank security manager and security industry executive. Kellermann, now CEO of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures, said he was not surprised that it had taken Yahoo several years to identify the massive attacks. “Hackers often have a capacity to burrow deeper than we thought into a system and remain for years,” he said. Reuters could not determine how many companies besides Yahoo were using MD5 in 2013. Google, Facebook and Microsoft Corp did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to another former security veteran at Yahoo, even when the company was growing quickly, security sometimes took a back seat as the company focused on system performance to keep up with the growth. Then, when growth stalled, senior security staff left for other companies and the chances of getting approval for expensive upgrades dropped further, the person said. “Any changes to the user database took forever because they were understaffed, and it’s an ultra-critical system - everything depends on it,” said the former Yahoo employee. Yahoo declined to comment on details of its security practices, but said it routinely conducted drills to test and improve its cyber defenses and highlighted campaigns such as a “bug bounty” program in which it pays hackers to find security flaws and report them to the company. Last September, Yahoo disclosed a 2014 cyber attack that affected at least 500 million customer accounts, the biggest known data breach at the time. Following last week’s news of the even bigger 2013 breach, U.S. federal investigators and lawmakers said they are scrutinizing Yahoo’s security practices, and Verizon Communications Inc is seeking to renegotiate a July deal to buy Yahoo’s internet business for $4.8 billion. The former Yahoo employees said the company’s security problems began before the arrival of Chief Executive Marissa Mayer in 2012 and continued under her tenure. Yahoo had suffered attacks by Russian hackers for years, two of the former staffers said. In 2014, Yahoo hired a new security chief, Alex Stamos, and one of the security crews he led - known internally as ‘The Paranoids’ - thought they were making headway against the hackers, former employees said. In 2015, when the security crew discovered a hidden program attached to Yahoo’s email servers that was monitoring all incoming messages, their first thought was that the Russian hackers had come back. It turned out that the program had been installed by Yahoo’s email engineers to comply with a secret surveillance order requested by a U.S. intelligence agency, as Reuters previously reported. Stamos and some of his staff left Yahoo soon after that, creating further disruptions to security operations. This week, in addition to disclosing the 2013 hack, Yahoo said someone had accessed its proprietary computer code to learn how to forge “cookies,” which would allow hackers to access an account without passwords. Yahoo said it connected some cookie-forging activity to the same state-sponsored actor it believed was responsible for the 2014 data theft. “They burrowed in and got access to everything,” said Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security firm Trail of Bits. On Thursday, Germany’s cyber security authority criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt adequate encryption techniques and advised German consumers to switch to other email providers. Yahoo told Reuters it was committed to keeping users secure by staying ahead of new threats. “Today’s security landscape is complex and ever-evolving, but, at Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure.” ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"(Reuters) - Mark Zuckerberg on Monday introduced the world to “Jarvis”, an artificial intelligence system the Facebook chief created in his spare time, which can choose and play music, turn on lights, and recognize visitors, deciding whether to open the front door. Jarvis, named after the virtual assistant in the Iron Man movies, could be a step toward a new product, Zuckerberg wrote, although he cautioned that the system he had created in 100 hours over the last year was customized for his house. (Zuckerberg post: bit.ly/2h4tuN7) Zuckerberg announced results of the project, a personal challenge he set for himself this year, as digital home assistants by Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc compete for holiday sales and are expected to outsell popular emerging gadgets such as virtual reality headsets and drones. Creating Jarvis proved humanity is “both closer and farther off” from an AI breakthrough than we imagine, Zuckerberg wrote. Computers are getting very good at pick out patterns, such as face recognition, but it is difficult to teach them new things, he wrote. “Everything I did this year — natural language, face recognition, speech recognition and so on — are all variants of the same fundamental pattern recognition techniques,” he wrote. “But even if I spent 1,000 more hours, I probably wouldn’t be able to build a system that could learn completely new skills on its own.” By the end of the year, Jarvis was able to respond to text and voice commands and it could run music, air conditioning, doors, and other systems. It could recognize visitors, start a toaster and even shoot t-shirts from a cannon in his closet. With more effort to broaden Jarvis’ use beyond Zuckerberg’s own house, the experiment “could be a great foundation to build a new product,” he wrote. A dearth of internet-connected devices, lack of common standards for connected devices to communicate and challenges related to speech recognition and machine learning were all obstacles, he said. At the same time, he said challenges lead to eureka moments. Adjustments made to help Jarvis recognize context in commands ultimately helped the system respond to less specific requests in a better fashion, such as asking the system to “play me some music”. “I’ve found we use these more open-ended requests more frequently than more specific asks. No commercial products I know of do this today, and this seems like a big opportunity,” he wrote. ","

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"(Reuters) - High up in western Europe’s tallest skyscraper, an office layout shows how the power balance in London’s property market is shifting in favor of booming tech companies and away from finance firms which may shrink in London after the Brexit vote. Some employees of digital marketing agency Jellyfish work from hot desks at The Shard, gathered around a long pine table suggestive of a trendy coffee shop, enjoying views of St Paul’s Cathedral. Edged by a bar with a screen displaying train times, floor-to-ceiling whiteboards, cozy sound-proofed booths and a tap dispensing barista-style coffees, the design encourages staff to work together. “We wanted to be taken seriously, not just frittering client money away with crazy guys on roller skates, so this is a serious space,” said the company’s Chief Creative Officer Mark Deeprose. Jellyfish’s offices are one sign of how fast-growing tech firms are calling the shots in the London property market, outshining the finance sector which accounts for around 8 percent of British GDP and has long been the cornerstone of the capital’s property scene. Property developers are ditching the marble fittings, suspended ceilings and tight rows of desks associated with the grand old banks, replacing them with more spacious irregular offices finished with the brickwork, colorful furniture and exposed wires beloved of tech companies. Since Britons voted on June 23 to leave the European Union, some financial services companies have threatened to move operations to other European capitals over fears that Brexit may prevent them serving EU clients. “Immediately after Brexit no one was doing anything but once we got into August and September, all of the tech firms just seemed to say, well, we’re moving on,” said James Roberts, chief economist at property consultant Knight Frank. For ASOS’s expanded and redeveloped London headquarters, it has used software to map how its people use the building to encourage different units to work together. It will also have a quiet library, and a concierge service to help employees with their needs outside work. “(Tech) is an active sector at the moment and we’re seeing developers beginning to acknowledge this within the way that they’re building,” said Simon Calvert, senior director of advisory and transaction services at property firm CBRE CBG.N. But the growth in tech may not be enough to fill new commercial property space. The City of London warns that up to 10 percent of jobs in London’s financial district may be lost if Britain fails to secure adequate EU access after Brexit. At the same time, London office construction has reached its highest level since 2008, according to Deloitte. It has amended an existing planning consent at a site in Paddington, west London, to introduce features such as sun terraces, a rooftop basketball court and collaborative work spaces that position the building more towards the TMT (technology, media and telecommunications) sectors. “We’ll adapt tactically, but we’re confident that’s good for the longer term,” CEO Chris Grigg said, after the firm in November posted a fall in the value of its office portfolio which gets 17 percent of its rent from banks and finance firms and 7 percent from TMT. Harry Badham, who heads the UK development team at AXA IM – Real Assets, said the 22 Bishopsgate site would aim to attract tech clients with a plan to offer space for an incubator workshop for start-ups where they would charge lower rent. Luring established tech clients requires not just space with an industrial, retro vibe, but also flexible rental deals, said Andrew Sell, commercial director at Real Estate Management (UK), which handles The Shard. “Whereas before there was an aversion from the owners to have lease breaks, we recognize it’s really important for the tech sector because their rate of growth is colossal,” he said. “Ten years ago maybe the banks’ model was rack it, stack it and squeeze them in,” he said. “(But) the banks are going to be competing with the Googles for these digitally-enabled people, they are going to need to have that (tech-friendly) environment,” he said.

,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. intelligence community will soon disclose an estimate of the number of Americans whose electronic communications have been caught in the crosshairs of online surveillance programs intended for foreigners, U.S. lawmakers said in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. The estimate, requested by members of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, is expected to be made public as early as next month, the letter said. Its disclosure would come as Congress is expected to begin debate in the coming months over whether to reauthorize or reform the so-called surveillance authority, known as Section 702, a provision that was added to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 2008. “The timely production of this information is incredibly important to informed debate on Section 702 in the next Congress— and, without it, even those of us inclined to support reauthorization would have reason for concern,” said the letter signed by 11 lawmakers, all members of the House Judiciary Committee. The letter was sent on Friday to National Intelligence Director James Clapper. It said his office and National Security Agency (NSA) officials had already briefed congressional staff about how the intelligence community intends to comply with the disclosure request. Clapper’s office confirmed the letter had been received but declined further comment. The lawmakers termed their letter an effort to “memorialize our understanding” of the intelligence community’s plan to provide an estimate in real numbers, not percentages, as soon as January that can be shared with the public. The government has long held that calculating the number of Americans subject to Section 702 surveillance might be technically impossible and would require privacy intrusions exceeding those raised by the actual surveillance programs, which were originally intended to counter foreign espionage. Intelligence officials have said that online data about Americans is “incidentally” collected under Section 702, due to a range of technical and practical reasons. Critics have assailed such collection as back-door surveillance of Americans without a warrant. Section 702 will expire on Dec. 31, 2017, absent congressional action. It enables two internet surveillance programs called Prism and Upstream that were revealed in a series of leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden more than three years ago. Prism gathers messaging data from Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook , Microsoft, Apple  and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance. Upstream allows the NSA to copy web traffic flowing along the internet backbone located inside the United States and search that data for certain terms associated with a target. Clapper, who is stepping down next month, suggested in April that providing an estimate of Americans surveilled under Section 702, a figure some have said could tally in the millions, might be possible, while defending the law as “a prolific producer of critical intelligence.” Republicans James Sensenbrenner, Darrell Issa, Ted Poe and Jason Chaffetz signed the letter, in addition to Democrats John Conyers, Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hank Johnson, Ted Deutch, Suzan DelBene and David Cicilline.

Based on regulatory filings, the company has saved $3.6 billion in worldwide taxes by making a maneuver known as the “Double Irish With A Dutch Sandwich.” A report in Bloomberg broke down Google’s strategy for decreasing its tax commitments. The Mountain View company established Google Netherlands B.V, a Dutch subsidiary without employees, back in 2004. The main purpose of this subsidiary is to route Google’s profits to and from its Irish subsidiaries, which are located in a low-tax jurisdiction and are responsible for Google’s IP outside the United States. Money from the Netherlands office is routed to Bermuda, which has zero corporate income tax. Google moved $15.5 billion to this company in 2015. In 2014, that figure was approximately $12 billion. (See also: How Big Corporations Avoid Tax Bills). According to the Bloomberg report, Google’s effective income tax rate outside the United States was 6.5 percent in 2015 and the company routed $58.3 billion of its profits to the Bermuda tax haven. Google's income tax outside the U.S. was 6 percent in 2014. In a statement, Google said that it complies with tax laws “in every country that we operate.” To be sure, the company’s elaborate ruse to avoid taxes is the result of a prohibitive income tax at home. President-elect Donald Trump has offered a flat taxation rate of 10% to technology companies to make it easier for them to repatriate their profits back home. In the meanwhile, Google’s tax strategy is sure to draw the attention of EU Commissioner Margarethe Vestager, who hinted earlier this year that the company could be the organization’s next target after Apple Inc. (AAPL). (See also: After Apple, EU Takes Aim At Amazon). According to a study conducted earlier this year, tax evasion by corporate entities cost the EU between $54.5 billion and $76.4 billion. Governments in France and Spain have already conducted raids on Google’s offices. The idea of a “Google Tax” is also spreading across the world. For example, Indonesia has asked the company to pony up back taxes or pay as much as $223 million in fines. India introduced a measure aimed at levying tax on technology behemoths, such as Google and Facebook Inc. (FB), earlier this year.

(GOOG) The Mountain View company had earlier released Google Cardboard, a VR headset made from cardboard and fitted with biconvex lenses. The headset is extremely cheap and, in some instances, has even been distributed for free. Google’s strategy of disseminating VR to the masses was a direct contrast to that of Facebook Inc. (FB), which acquired Oculus Rift, a premium VR headset maker, for $2 billion. Much like its selling price, Oculus Rift’s headset are also expensive. Its cheapest headset retails for $599. 
While Google Cardboard is cheap, the range and quality of VR available with the device is limited. Google Daydream is a step up from Cardboard. According to Clay Bavor, vice president of virtual reality at the company, the device is about “enabling very high quality VR.” The Daydream platform consists of a headset called Daydream View, a controller, and a content platform. Unlike typical plastic VR headsets in the market, Google Daydream is made of fabric and is available in multiple colors. Fabric ensures that the headset that is a good fit, is lightweight, and does not leave marks on the bridge of the nose. The controller is used to navigate VR space and adjust options, such as volume controls, within it. Finally, the Daydream platform consists of VR content. When the platform was launched earlier this year, it had limited content. But that is expected to change in the near future as VR becomes mainstream and more content producers enter the game. (See also: NFL Makes VR Debut On Thanksgiving Day). Reviewers have generally given Google Daydream thumbs up. Tech publication Ars Technica compared the platform to a “decent meal at a moderately priced fast-casual restaurant” and wrote that the device was the simplest of any VR headset as far as out-of-the-box setup is concerned. (See also: Google Acquires Eye-Tracking Technology Startup). That said, there are a couple of drawbacks on the platform. While the headset is untethered in that it does not require a connection to a computer or a gaming console, it does require Daydream-ready Android phones with the necessary sensors and persistence display for playback. Currently, there are only three Android phones – Google Pixel, Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe, and Moto Z – which have deemed Daydream-ready. Bavor has said that the number of such phones will multiply in the future and the company is already working with Samsung and HTC Vive to make VR ready headsets. Reviewers have also pointed to the absence of positional tracking and “warping” around the edges of 3D scenes due to limited field of view. Their tests have also resulted in the Android phone becoming unusually hot after playing VR content. This is because the number of operating system processes required to run VR taxes the phone’s central processing unit (CPU).  ",What Is Google Daydream? (GOOG) | Investopedia

The Google toilet locator app, launched in the states of Delhi and Madhya Pradesh, at the moment helps people find access to clean public restrooms. The app, launched on Thursday, will also have a wide range of features such as cleanliness ratings, the style of toilet and if it requires a fee to use. The app enables users to type words such as ""toilet"" or ""lavatory"" or Hindi words like ""swachh"" and ""shulabh"" meaning clean to access the closest restrooms in the area, media reports say. ""When you search for 'public toilet' on Google Maps in an area where the service is available, you'll see a list of restrooms near you, including the respective address and opening hours,"" Sanket Gupta, product manager Google Maps India, said at a launch event in Delhi.

Access to safe and healthy sanitation is a major problem that India is facing with a number of official surveys pointing to almost 70 percent of Indian households with no access to toilets. As a result, people are forced to defecate in open spaces. The toilet locator from Google aims to provide better access in such situations. However, critics of this app have said that the use of this service is subject to good network coverage and people knowing how to use maps on smartphones, especially as most of those with no access to proper sanitation are based in rural areas.

""My favorite way to brainstorm creatively, whether it's about values or setting goals for the new year, is through mind maps,"" Blake tells CNBC. To make one, write down the year at the center of a piece of paper, and then draw spokes with different themes that are important to you. For example, your spokes could be business, personal life, health and fitness, fun, or skill building. From each of those themes, draw additional spokes to connect the themes to ways you want to improve or experiment in that area. Blake recommends you ask yourself: ""What's important to me about that? And what does success look like?"" For example, in ""personal life,"" you could write, ""Meet up with a friend at least once a month"" or ""Take a music class."" The visual trick works because it helps you see the different ways you can improve, Blake writes in her book ""Pivot: The Only Move That Matters Is Your Next One.""

Jenny Blake, a career strategist who has helped more than 1,000 people at Google advance at work, says that trying to solve a problem immediately can sometimes do more harm than good. ""One of the biggest mistakes that I see managers making is immediately jumping in to give advice or trying to troubleshoot in the middle of a career conversation,"" Blake says, ""rather than really [asking] open ended questions."" According to Blake, 75 percent of complicated or tough conversations should be listening and only 25 percent should be giving advice. ""Great leaders and managers make listening a priority,"" Blake tells CNBC. ""Not just any listening, active listening."" Like Ron Swanson from NBC's ""Parks and Recreation,"" who often offers just the right amount of sage advice after lending a sympathetic ear. By taking a step back and listening, you get a better sense of the problem. You can then make better decisions. To get a better sense of what your team members need, Blake recommends asking these open ended questions in one-on-one meetings: What's working best in your role? What strengths are you most excited about developing? When do you feel most in the zone? An independent survey of 3,100 workers, ranging from junior employees to CEOs, found that great leaders foster a culture of respect and motivation. Listening, Blake says, is one of the easiest ways to foster that type of environment. For more great advice, check out Blake's book ""Pivot: The Only Move that Matters is Your Next One.""

Abigail Hess,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"The same principles that make someone a good improv comedian can also be applied to your professional life, where they can actually help you succeed. Companies like Ford, Google, Cisco, American Express, Hilton, Kaiser Permanente and Deloitte, and universities like Harvard, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania, have all embraced improv comedy as a tool to build strong teams. I have been doing some form of improv since I was 13, and have coached, practiced, and performed improv for most of my adult life. The skills I have learned may not have turned me into a comedy legend, but they have made me a better employee. Here are three improv rules that helped me in my professional career and can help you too. 1. ""Yes, and …"" The principle: It isn't fun to watch people disagree on stage. The word ""No"" is a slammed door: It stops the action and can frustrate both other performers and the audience. Improv coaches everywhere preach that, instead of ""No,"" you should try to say ""Yes, and …"" That means that you listen to the ideas of your partner, agree with at least some of their premise, and then contribute your own thoughts. For instance, if your scene partner says, ""Hey sis, Mom says we need to clean the house,"" you don't say, ""I'm not your sister. We are strangers at the beach!"" That would brings your scene to a halt. Instead, you say, ""Great, sis, I'll get the mop."" This is not to say that you should accept every idea, no matter how outlandish, but the principle of ""Yes, and …"" helps performers find common ground so that they can go on to discover funny things together. How you can apply it to get ahead at work: Bosses generally don't like to hear the word ""No"" any more than audiences or fellow comedians do. ""Shark Tank"" investor Barbara Corcoran lists ""lots of enthusiasm"" as one of the traits she values most in an employee, even more than the right resume, and science has shown that appearing positive and likable will help get you hired. If your boss asks, ""Can you get me the quarterly report?"" and she's mistaken, don't say, ""No, that's not the report you want."" Instead, say, ""Yes, and I'll also bring our notes from the quarterly meeting. That might be helpful, too."" Colleagues also appreciate when you treat their ideas with respect, even if you have other, competing suggestions. If a colleague says, ""I think we should market our product using cartoon,"" and you disagree, instead of arguing, you could say, ""Yes, and we could also test an animated campaign against a traditional print one."" By showing you value other ideas, you can help build your team's forward momentum. Affirming other people can go a long way both onstage and in the workplace.  2. Support your teammates The principle: Some improvisers try to make themselves look good by making others look bad.This is both mean and only funny for so long. Improv is much more successful and sustainable when everyone on your team is hilarious. How you can apply it to get ahead at work: If you oversee a team, give them the tools they need to succeed. Their victory will be yours, too. The ability to develop talent is always in high demand. Showing off your team's success will demonstrate that you are a leader deserving of more management opportunities. Also, when team members are confident and productive, you won't have to micromanage and will have more time to accomplish your own goals. And when your teammates and subordinates are doing well, they can support you in return when you need help. If you undercut everyone around you, you won't have anyone to turn to in an emergency. 3. Show. Don't tell. How you can apply it to get ahead at work: Showing what you can do instead of simply talking about it can bring your career to life, too. In the workplace, no one will be impressed if you just claim you'll tackle a project: You have to deliver. Following through will show your colleagues and superiors that you're the kind of dependable, driven person who gets things done. You can also use this rule to hold yourself accountable. If you talk to your friends, family, or colleagues about getting something done, use your word as a way to motivate yourself. Have you pledged at holiday parties for several years in a row that you're going to start your own business? This rule can remind you that maybe it's finally time to make it happen.

Michael Yoshikami,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"President-elect Donald Trump met on Wednesday with key Silicon Valley technology executives to discuss his administration's perspective towards the technology industry. Contrary to what many people expected, this did not turn out to be a contentious session (like the one with media executives). The message was conciliatory and focused on outlining the President-elect's pledge that he is focused on helping technology companies going forward. Some big names in the tech space have been under pressure based on the view that the new administration would negatively impact their fortunes. Given that the tech summit focused more on cooperation than condemnation, we believe the market overhang on certain names should begin to lift. Here are some of the names that we believe merit consideration from investors right now. Apple has an attractive valuation. It is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 12.9 times with a net cash balance of $150 billion. There is likely to be a huge super-cycle upgrade opportunity when iPhone released next year for 10th anniversary. The stock has been range bound but current multiples suggest a possible 10% bounce from here MasterCard is leveraging the shift from cash/check towards electronic payments (like credit cards). The company is positioned to succeed in a cashless environment as e-commerce payments continue to accelerate. It's not strictly defined as a technology company but it's very connected to the transformation of payment processes. It continues to trade at a discount to VISA on a P/E basis; parity we think makes sense. Google is a leader in online search with unmatched ability to monetize clicks and views.  It's got huge reach in a variety of businesses related to Internet, search, and advertising. For some reason investors seem to be questioning Google as a growth name. We think it still has upside as online ad revenues continue to grow. AT&T is a leading telecom provider in the U.S.  It is benefitting from the continuation of the wireless story and the shift away from cable TV (cord cutting) and towards streaming. It offers an attractive dividend yield. It's proposed merger with Time Warner is an uncertainty but it is likely to go through in a deregulation focused environment. ATT is likely to increase its reach with its recent deals and offerings. Cyclical companies have rallied strongly and it's only right to wonder if assets that have not participated in this recent bump are poised to catch up to positions that have already made strong gains. Technology and telecom companies certainly fall in this category and we believe investors should take another look at the earning streams delivered by these firms.  Compared to many cyclical companies, these stocks now actually look somewhat cheap on a relative basis and you can't say that very often. ",Trump tech summit stocks to buy—commentary

Jane Wells,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"Gregg and Evan Spiridellis grew up as brothers in New Jersey sharing a sense of humor but seemingly little else. Gregg worked on Wall Street and received an MBA from Wharton. Evan became an artist and independent filmmaker. Nearly 18 years ago, they went into business together, investing $5,000 each, renting a friend's garage and doing something that seemed crazy: They started an internet business sending animated videos over phone lines. ""All of our files had to be under 100K, which is a tenth of one megabyte,"" said Evan. ""That's smaller than your average banner ad on a website, by the way,"" added Gregg. They called the business JibJab, a name Gregg came up with. ""We wanted it to be two syllables so it sounded punchy and fun."" Gregg was always on the lookout for opportunities, and while he was at Wharton, he discovered Flash. ""There was something about it,"" he said. ""Seeing a piece of animation or a cartoon streaming over a phone line triggered something in my head."" He called his brother and suggested that instead of making films the traditional way, ""now we could actually make something with just a few thousand dollars' worth of equipment and distribute it all around the world."" ""It didn't take a ton of convincing,"" Evan said. ""He showed me the opportunity, and I saw it."" Bypassing the media middleman to put content online soon made the brothers famous. ""This became a really hot space,"" said Gregg. Hollywood directors like Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg wanted to create entertainment for the internet. ""Because we had been doing it for, like, six weeks, we were experts."" JibJab started making money producing projects for studios like Disney and Sony, using the profits to build their own business (one of their earliest characters was a crotchety Kris Kringle they named Nasty Santa). ""We caught the beginning of a wave,"" said Gregg, ""a wave that ultimately crashed in 2001."" To avoid going under after the internet bubble burst, the Spiridellis brothers decided to turn Nasty Santa into a physical toy. They learned that Spencer Gifts was having an event where people could pitch products. Evan made a Nasty Santa drawing, and Gregg went online to find manufacturers (searching with Alta Vista, because this was pre-Google). They asked manufacturers to bid on making the doll. ""We said we have an order for 5,000 units,"" Evan recalled. ""Meanwhile, we had no order!"" The day before the retail event, several Nasty Santa mockups arrived, and they chose their favorite to take to Spencer Gifts. ""We got an order for 5,000!"" said Gregg. ""They said, 'Can you ship that FOB Hong Kong?' And I said, 'Sure, absolutely!' I walked out of there and I called my friend, and was like, 'Do you know what FOB Hong Kong is?'"" Gregg learned it meant ""freight on board."" Nasty Santa hit the market in 2001, and by 2002, Spencer Gifts expanded it from one line of products to 12. JibJab moved to Los Angeles, downsized from 13 employees to just Gregg and Evan, and scraped by. ""We just set up shop here,"" said Gregg. ""We started making more toys, and we started doing children's books, and kept investing in the internet but at a much slower pace."" Just when the brothers thought perhaps entertainment would never make money on the internet, they hit pay dirt. In 2004, they created a political animation for the election called ""This Land,"" a parody of George W. Bush and John Kerry. ""It just blew the socks off of everything that we had done before,"" said Gregg. ""We went within a week from wondering if we're going to have to go out and get real jobs, to being on the set of 'The Tonight Show,' the 'Today' show,"" said Evan. They started making money by charging people to download their videos, then Trivial Pursuits and Topps trading cards called. Evan said Gregg got an idea the night before appearing on ""Today"" that they should sell DVDs of their videos. ""So he set up a Yahoo store, designed a cover, and printed it on the Epson overnight!"" They slipped the cover into an empty CD case and held it up on the air during an interview with Matt Lauer. ""We were very upfront about it on the website,"" said Gregg. ""It said, 'We will ship it to you in six to eight weeks,' because we figured that in six to eight weeks we could figure this out."" In a single day they sold $100,000 in DVDs. Since then, the company has raised $17.9 million in funding and hired 70 employees, with hundreds of artists under contract. JibJab has a million subscribers to its personalized e-card service, cards that often involve stop-action photography and can cost as much as $100,000 for one card. The company has expanded into messaging, emojis, and now a television program called ""Ask the StoryBots."" Gregg said they've been successful because they've always tried to identify and exploit new channels of communication. But the brothers also insist on doing things their way. For example, JibJab spent millions of dollars of its own money producing ""Ask the StoryBots"" without knowing whether anyone would buy it. ""We did the dumbest thing that anyone could ever do in Hollywood, and that was finance your own show,"" Gregg said. ""We knew we'd sell it."" They did. To Netflix. On YouTube, StoryBots videos have more than 300 million views. Last year JibJab revenues were ""well over"" $20 million. Next, the brothers are thinking of expanding into augmented reality, where characters pop up in an environment along the lines of ""Pokemon Go"" (""without kids running into the street""). It's been a long road to success, but worth it. ""When I was in investment banking ... I was passionate about what I was doing,"" said Gregg. ""But when I look back, there were a lot of people who were 35 and looked 85 and had lots of money but no time."" They've turned down many opportunities along the way, opportunities that might have made them bigger faster, but the brothers have no regrets. ""Our job is to make people laugh,"" said Evan. ""We get to make stuff that we love, no one really gets to tell us what to do, and hopefully we bring a little happiness into the world.""

 ,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"The European Commission has charged Facebook with providing misleading information during its takeover of the online messaging service WhatsApp, opening the company to a possible fine of 1 percent of its turnover. However, the statement of objections sent to Facebook will not affect the EC's approval of the $22 billion merger in 2014, the Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. Facebook becomes the latest Silicon Valley target of EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has demanded Apple pay back $14 billion in taxes to Ireland and hit Google with two market abuse investigations. The issue regards a WhatsApp privacy policy change in August when it said it would share some users' phone numbers with parent company Facebook, triggering investigations by a number of EU data protection authorities. The Commission said Facebook had indicated in its notification of the planned acquisition that it would be unable reliably to match the two companies' user accounts. ""The Commission's preliminary view is that Facebook gave us incorrect or misleading information during the investigation into its acquisition of WhatsApp,"" said Vestager. The EU executive said it took the preliminary view that the technical possibility of automatically matching Facebook users' IDs with those of WhatsApp already existed in 2014 when Facebook sought EU approval for the merger. The Commission — which approved the transaction without conditions — said it did not only rely on the information about the possibility of matching user accounts when reviewing the deal. Facebook has until Jan. 31 to respond. If the Commission's concerns are confirmed it can impose a fine on the U.S. company of up to 1 percent of turnover, or about $179 million based on 2015 revenues. Companies fined can appeal to the European Court of Justice, which has overturned some penalties in the past. ""We respect the Commission's process and are confident that a full review of the facts will confirm Facebook has acted in good faith, a Facebook spokeswoman said. ""We've consistently provided accurate information about our technical capabilities and plans, including in submissions about the WhatsApp acquisition and in voluntary briefings before WhatsApp's privacy policy update this year,"" she added. The company will continue to cooperate and give the information officials need to resolve their questions, she said. Facebook informed the Commission of the planned change in January. In response to separate concerns from EU data protection watchdogs Facebook has agreed to stop sharing WhatsApp users' information with Facebook for the purposes of improving Facebook products and advertising experiences. The watchdogs wrote to the company last week asking for more information about the privacy policy change. ",EU charges Facebook with misleading information during WhatsApp takeover

Cheang Ming,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"The solution to the deluge of fake news online could in fact be smarter technology, according to SAP National Security Services, a U.S.-based subsidiary of enterprise software provider SAP. Mark Testoni, president of SAP National Security Services, told CNBC's ""Squawkbox"" that artificial intelligence and algorithms that identify patterns will allow social media companies, such as Facebook, to better identify fake news sites and the users who create such content. ""That's where technology offers great hope,"" he added. While fake news is not a new phenomenon, the spread of false information online has been exacerbated through the use of, ironically, algorithms. Algorithms used by Facebook and Google were criticized after they inadvertently boosted the circulation of fake news stories on the internet during the U.S. presidential election cycle this year. Testoni also said that these algorithms are already in existence and can be repurposed to target fake news sources. Algorithms that allow advertisements to target specific internet users across different websites are an example of this technology that can be used in recognizing fake news, he said. ""We've seen improvement in some cases already. Clickbait was a big issue over the last year, which is in the same area as (fake news). And through some of the algorithms, some of that has been significantly reduced,"" Testoni added. However, technology alone cannot stave off the fake news epidemic. Consumers also need to do their research to ensure that the information they are reading online is accurate, Testoni said. ""We have to be critical consumers and when we read things, we have to not only hope that others are doing fact-checking but we need to take a critical eye and do some verification on our own,"" he added.

Image source: Google. When Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unveiled its fancy new Pixel phone in October, which overall looks like a strong smartphone, there was one bizarre anachronism associated with the device: it was launching as a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exclusive. Well, at least in terms of distribution, as Big Red was the only U.S. carrier that would sell the Pixel at its retail store, even though technically the device is supported on all four major carriers. Android Police reported earlier this week that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is planning on rolling out Pixel displays at its retail locations. But here's the rub: The Un-carrier will only be displaying the Pixel, and won't be actively selling the device. What gives? T-Mobile sales reps will reportedly encourage interested customers to purchase the device directly from Google's online store. T-Mobile has been offering a Pixel promotion for a couple months, giving $325 to anyone that brings a Pixel to T-Mobile's network. The promotion value is spread out over two years via monthly bill credits, which is T-Mobile's way of making sure customers stick around. ""Verizon is spending millions to convince people that Google's Pixel is 'only on Verizon' and it is just not true,"" a T-Mobile spokesperson told FierceWireless. ""The Pixel works great on T-Mobile with unlimited high-speed data and a faster, more advanced LTE network. Buy one from Google or buy one from Verizon and bring it on over."" It goes without saying that this is an inconvenient solution for T-Mobile customers, who would much rather just buy the device directly from T-Mobile in a seamless transaction. Instead, customers have to buy the device from somewhere else, and then jump through all the hoops to get the promotion. T-Mobile is obviously interested in carrying the Pixel, but its hands are probably tied for the time being due to Verizon's exclusivity. Scoring an exclusive means exactly that. Verizon is the only carrier allowed to distribute Pixel for now, so the real question is how long the exclusivity window lasts. Once the exclusivity expires, I would imagine more carriers will look to sign on with Google to sell the Pixel at its retail stores, which is easily the most important distribution channel in the smartphone market -- as well as potentially the biggest limiting factor for Pixel. Considering the broader shift away from carrier exclusives, it's hard to imagine Verizon's exclusivity window lasting more than three to six months, which importantly should cover the busy holiday shopping season. T-Mobile's push to display the Pixel but not to officially sell the Pixel likely skirts the exclusivity, which Verizon probably doesn't take too kindly. In any event, there's a very good chance that the Pixel sees wider carrier availability once Verizon's exclusivity has ended, which will probably be in early to mid-2017. ","

Chris Neiger,12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) added a new company under its umbrella in late 2016 when Google spun out its self-driving car project into its own entity, called Waymo, which stands for ""a new way forward in mobility."" The newly created company is more than just a name change for Google's well-known autonomous vehicle ambitions. It's a step forward for the company to start earning money from all the research and testing it's been doing for years. Here are three things you should know about Alphabet's new company. Image source: Waymo. Waymo CEO (and former Hyundai executive) John Krafcik has said since Waymo's inception that the company will pursue options to use its hardware and software in things like ride-sharing, trucking, and public transportation and is looking at licensing the tech to automakers. That last part isn't much of a surprise considering that Google announced in2016 that it's working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) to test its technology in 600 of the automaker's Pacifica minivans. In April of 2017, Waymo announced it was opening up its first ride-sharing services for public testing in Phoenix. The initial rollout allows hundreds of people to sign up to use Waymo's vehicles for their everyday driving needs. Krafcik wrote in a blog post that, ""Rather than offering people one or two rides, the goal of this program is to give participants access to our fleet every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area that's about twice the size of San Francisco."" Krafcik said in 2016 that, ""I think we've been really clear that we're not a car company. We're not in the business of making better cars, we're in the business of making better drivers."" That's just as well, considering that building a car for public use that lacks a steering wheel and pedals would be a regulatory nightmare in the U.S., as well as in many other countries. But Waymo says it's still committed to hands-free automation. The goal for the company is to pair its hardware and software with automakers' cars to create a fully autonomous driving experience. Alphabet clearly believes that its self-driving technology is ready for public services, and that means Waymo will be looking to earn some revenue soon, even if there aren't any immediate profits. The driverless car market is estimated to be worth $77 billion by 2035, but Alphabet likely won't see any major financial benefits for some time, as the cost to develop the tech and come up with a viable commercial plan will likely exceed any revenue gains for a while. Investors can expect to see a lot more public testing of Waymo's technology before a commercial service launches. But for all the hype around autonomous cars over the past few years, it appears Waymo is truly leading the pack when it comes to bringing self-driving cars to the masses. ","

Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) shares rallied about 13% this year on the strength of its turnaround efforts, easily outperforming the Dow Jones U.S. Retail Index's 3% gain. But now that the stock is hovering in the $70s, investors might be wondering if the retail giant will split its stock soon. Let's look back at Wal-Mart's stock split history to see if that could happen in the coming year. Image source: Getty Images. Wal-Mart went public in 1970 at $16.50 per share, and has split 11 times since then. If you had bought 100 shares of Wal-Mart for $1,650 back then, you would own 204,800 shares today -- which would be worth about $16 million.

Wal-Mart has only split its stock above the $70 level twice -- once in 1983 and again in 1999. This means that if Wal-Mart continues rallying, the stock might undergo another two-for-one split. Stock splits make a stock look ""cheaper,"" but its valuation doesn't change -- it simply cuts individual shares into smaller pieces which are presumably easier to buy in even lots. That might generate more trading volume from short-term traders, but it doesn't have a meaningful impact on its long-term growth. Warren Buffett hated stock splits because he believed that they attracted short-term investors instead of long-term ones. That's why Berkshire Hathaway has never split its Class A shares, which cost over $247,000. Wal-Mart's e-commerce rival Amazon trades at about $980 per share, but the stock hasn't been split since 1999. Yet Amazon's 1,300% return over the past decade has crushed Wal-Mart's 70% gain -- indicating that splits have very little to do with long-term price appreciation. Instead of focusing on stock splits, Wal-Mart investors should follow more meaningful developments, like the billions of dollars it's invested in wage hikes, better employee training, and e-commerce expansion. Reports indicate that those efforts are paying off -- analysts have praised its cleaner and more organized stores, employees are more satisfied with their career growth options, and customers are finally returning. Wal-Mart is also countering Amazon with price-matching strategies, membership plans for free shipping, curbside pickup, and the expansion of its digital ecosystem with upgraded apps and its acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet.com. It's also challenging the growth of big dollar store chains like Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) with more Neighborhood Markets. Despite all that progress, Wal-Mart's growth remains sluggish. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise just 2% and 1% this year. However, Wal-Mart trades at 18 times earnings, which is slightly lower than its industry average of 19 for discount stores, and its forward dividend yield of 2.6% is higher than the S&P 500's current yield of 2%. Investors should focus on these facts and figures -- not stock splits -- to gauge Wal-Mart's strength as a long-term investment. Investors should know that a low stock price doesn't make a stock ""cheap."" That can only be determined through key numbers like price-earnings and price-sales ratios. Therefore, if you didn't like Wal-Mart at $78, then don't buy it if a split reduces its price to $39. Likewise, if you think Wal-Mart is a great buy but only have enough to buy 50 shares, don't wait for it to split just so you can buy an even lot of 100 shares. ","

The easy answer is that the limit for IRA contributions set by the IRS is $5,500 for the 2017 tax year, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution allowed if you're over 50. However, there's a little more to the story. Specifically, your ability to contribute might be limited, and you don't need to contribute the entire amount during 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Inflation has been relatively low in recent years, so it shouldn't be a big surprise that the IRA contribution limits have not changed since the 2013 tax year. 2017 will be the fifth consecutive year where IRA contributions are capped at $5,500, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution allowance for savers age 50 and above. Year IRA Contribution Limit Catch-Up Contribution Limit 2017 $5,500 $1,000 2016 $5,500 $1,000 2015 $5,500 $1,000 2014 $5,500 $1,000 2013 $5,500 $1,000 2012 $5,000 $1,000 Data source: Internal Revenue Service. You can make your IRA contribution for 2017 as a lump sum, or you can contribute a little at a time. One suggestion is to make equal monthly contributions, or have your IRA contributions automatically debited from your bank account to coincide with your paychecks. For example, if you're under 50 and get paid every two weeks, an IRA contribution of $211.54 per paycheck would translate to $5,500 for the year. If you get paid at a different frequency, simply divide $5,500 (or $6,500) by the number of paychecks you'll get in 2017. There are two basic types of IRA: traditional and Roth. You can read a full discussion of how to choose the best IRA for you here, but for now, the important difference are the tax implications of each account type. In addition to the tax benefits, there are some other compelling reasons to choose a Roth IRA. For example, Roth contributions may be withdrawn penalty-free at anytime, and there is no required minimum distribution rule like with other retirement accounts. The downside is that the ability to contribute directly to a Roth IRA is subject to income limitations. Here they are for 2017, broken down by tax filing status: Tax Filing Status AGI Limit for Full Contribution Partial Contribution Allowed No Contribution Single/head of household $118,000 $118,000-$132,999 $133,000 or more Married filing jointly $186,000 $186,000-$195,999 $196,000 or more Married filing separately $0 $0-$9,999 $10,000 or more Data source: IRS. All figures are adjusted gross income (AGI). It's also worth noting that if you can't directly contribute to a Roth IRA, you can still contribute to a traditional IRA and convert your IRA to a Roth. This is known as the ""backdoor"" Roth contribution method. Unlike a Roth IRA, everyone can contribute to a traditional IRA, regardless of income. However, not everyone qualifies for the tax deduction, which is the biggest incentive to contribute to a traditional IRA in the first place. The good news is that if you're not eligible to participate in a retirement plan at work, your ability to take a traditional IRA deduction is not limited unless your spouse is covered by an employer's plan. In this case, if your combined AGI is less than $186,000, you can take a full IRA deduction. If you earn more than this, but less than $196,000, you are eligible for a partial deduction. On the other hand, if you are eligible for a retirement plan at work, your ability to take a traditional IRA deduction is limited to significantly lower income levels. Tax Filing Status Deduction Phase-Out Range Single/head of household $62,000-$72,000 Married filing jointly $99,000-$119,000 Married filing separately $0-$10,000 Data source: IRS. Finally, a nice feature of the IRS's laws regarding IRA contributions is the extended time window to make contributions. You can make contributions for a given tax year anytime before that year's regular tax deadline in April. For example, the deadline to file a 2016 tax return is April 18, 2017, so you can make IRA contributions for the 2016 tax year until that date. The point is that while the $5,500 contribution limit is an ""annual"" maximum, you actually have about 15 and a half months to make your contributions for any given year. So, even if you're reading this in early 2017, you can still take advantage of the tax benefits of IRA investing for both the 2016 and 2017 tax years. ","

Even though 2016 hasn't ended yet, the Social Security Administration has already come out with its calendar telling benefit recipients when they'll get Social Security payments in 2018. When you're retired, you have time to think well into the future, and knowing when you can expect to get your Social Security checks is something you'll want to know long before those checks ever come. Below, we'll look at the general rule that governs these payments so you can be prepared for the indefinite future. Image source: Getty Images. The SSA makes payments on a regular schedule that is really quite simple. The starting point for when your payment will arrive in your bank account depends on your birthday. Specifically, if you were born during the first 10 days of the month, then your payments will come on the second Wednesday of that month. For those born between the 11th and the 20th of any given month, the payment should be made on the third Wednesday. Finally, those born on the 21st or after within a given month receive their benefit on the fourth Wednesday of the month. Below, you'll find the calendar that shows this graphically. The blue box represents the second Wednesday, while the third Wednesday is a gray box and the fourth Wednesday is a red box. Image source: SSA. However, you'll see a couple of other dates indicated on the calendar above. First, those who receive Supplemental Security Income, which is a program for low-income Americans, typically receive their payments on the first day of the month. If that day is a weekend or holiday, however, then they'll get the payment on the business day immediately preceding the first of the month. That's indicated on the calendar by a red circle. In addition, a special rule governs those who receive both Social Security and SSI payments, or those who started receiving Social Security before May 1997. For them, all payments are made on the third day of the month. If that's a weekend or holiday, then the payment is made the preceding business day. The calendar represents those payments with a blue outlined box. Finally, note that the dates above apply to benefits that are directly deposited into your bank account. In March 2013, a new law required all Social Security or SSI recipients to receive electronic payments. In very rare circumstances, the Treasury Department will grant exceptions to those who request waivers. If that applies to you, then you can expect to wait longer to receive your paper Social Security check than these dates suggest. For the vast majority of Social Security recipients, however, the above schedule will tell you when you should expect to receive your money. If you don't see your benefits hit your bank account on time, then a call to your financial institution or to the Social Security Administration is smart to make sure all your information is in order.

Minimum wage laws have been a major political issue recently. Proponents of higher wages argue that they're necessary to provide for basic living expenses, and many have called for increases to as much as $15 per hour. Opponents, meanwhile, point to the potential impact of higher labor costs on the businesses that employ the most minimum wage workers. State legislatures have responded across the nation, and currently, 21 states are slated to put 2017 minimum wage increases into effect at some point during the coming year. Let's look at the list to see what stands out among these minimum-wage boosts. State 2016 Minimum Wage 2017 Minimum Wage Alaska $9.75 $9.80 Arizona $8.05 $10 Arkansas $8 $8.50 California $10 $10.50 Colorado $8.31 $9.30 Connecticut $9.60 $10.10 Florida $8.05 $8.10 Hawaii $8.50 $9.25 Maine $7.50 $9 Maryland $8.75 $9.25 Massachusetts $10 $11 Michigan $8.50 $8.90 Missouri $7.65 $7.70 Montana $8.05 $8.15 New Jersey $8.38 $8.44 New York $9 $9.70 Ohio $8.10 $8.15 Oregon $9.75 $10.25 South Dakota $8.55 $8.65 Vermont $9.60 $10 Washington $9.47 $11 Not all changes take effect on Jan. 1, and minimum wages can be higher in certain locations and/or for certain industries. Data source: CNN. Economic Policy Institute. The first thing that you'll see from the list above is that not all minimum wage increases are very significant. Four states -- Alaska, Florida, Missouri, and Ohio -- are raising their minimum wages by just $0.05 per hour, while two more -- Montana and South Dakota -- are seeing just a $0.10-per-hour boost. New Jersey splits the difference with a $0.06-per-hour rise. These increases all have ties to changes in the rate of inflation, with most states choosing to link their minimum wages to rises in one of the Consumer Price Index data series. Most of the states that use these systems round the increase to the nearest nickel, but New Jersey stands out with precise wage rates to the penny. On the other hand, some states are making truly massive increases to the minimum wage all at once. Arizona will see the biggest boost, with a rise of $1.95 per hour adding nearly 25% to the labor costs of minimum wage employers. Boosts of $1 or more per hour will also take place in Massachusetts and Washington state. Image source: Getty Images. Moreover, many states are in the process of multiyear increases to the minimum wage. Arizona's move is just the first in a series that will push the wage to $12 per hour by 2020. California has even more ambitious plans, with annual increases of $0.50 next year to be followed by $1 per hour raises in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, bringing the state to the $15 mark. New York State's $0.70 per hour move is just the first in a series of five hikes that will lift minimum wages there to $12.50 per hour. Even so, there are still a large number of holdouts among the states. Five states have no minimum wage laws at all, relying on the federal minimum wage to cover their workers. Another 15 states either have outdated minimum wage laws that are less than the current $7.25 per hour federal amount or match the federal law exactly. In those areas, it's likely to take federal legislation to move the needle for minimum wage workers. Although calls to raise the minimum wage at the federal level have gotten louder in recent years, labor activists have been much more successful in spurring local action in states where the political environment is friendlier to the cause. For those who earn the minimum wage, any boost to pay can be a game changer, and those who live in the states listed above will celebrate the pay raises they get. Nevertheless, the debate over whether minimum wage increases are positive or negative for the economy as a whole is likely to continue not just in 2017 but for years to come. ","
      
    2017 Minimum Wage Increases: These 21 States Are Paying Workers More -- The Motley Fool

"Evan Niu, CFA",12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Estimote's vision of future retail stores covered in iBeacons. Image source: Estimote. In 2013, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled a technology that had the potential to revolutionize brick-and-mortar retail: iBeacon. The protocol was built on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and promised to enable micro-location tracking in a way that offered far more accuracy than traditional GPS or the assisted GPS in modern smartphones. We're talking about being able to tell what specific aisle a customer is perusing, and being able to market to that customer accordingly. At the time, Apple was rumored to be working on mobile payments -- what we now know as Apple Pay -- and the idea of micro-locations combined with mobile payments was like a futuristic dream for retailers. Imagine offering a targeted coupon or discount to a customer based on micro-location and then prompting them to pay on the spot with a smartphone. Third-party companies like Estimote even sprouted up to make and sell beacons using iBeacon. Following a pilot program, Macy's said in 2014 that it would roll out beacon technology nationwide. Major League Baseball uses beacons to make ballparks more interactive in numerous ways. Even a few local grocery stores tried deploying them for the same retail reasons. So, what happened? For starters, Apple hasn't really done much over the years to promote the protocol in a meaningful way. In fact, it never really did. iBeacon was little more than a footnote during WWDC 2013, and wasn't even mentioned during WWDC 2014. The lack of meaningful support or promotion from Apple certainly didn't help, which may be attributable to the company shifting its developmental focus on near-field communication (NFC), which Apple Pay is built on. NFC and iBeacons aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, but like most technologies, supporting numerous protocols adds to costs for those interested in commercial deployments. Apple has seemingly ceased ongoing development and support as well. For instance, in its iBeacon for Developers page, the Getting Started (link opens PDF) guide is from 2014. It's also not as if Apple ever made any iBeacons directly, although all iOS devices are capable of becoming an iBeacon transmitters; it just detailed and released the protocol, leaving the fate of the technology in the hands of third parties. This lack of ongoing support and development also means that some of the initial challenges largely went unaddressed. In order to use iBeacons, users need to 1. download a retailer's app, 2. allow the app's notifications to be enabled, 3. make sure Bluetooth is turned on, and 4. enable location services for that app as well. After that, the interaction should add value to the customer's experience in some way. Most iBeacon deployments failed in some or all of these areas. Many users turn off one or more of those functionalities in order to improve battery life, for example. iBeacons also never integrated with the plethora of enterprise IT systems that companies use for point-of-sale (POS), inventory tracking, loyalty programs, marketing campaigns, or other types of analytics. That either severely limits the value from the perspective of a retailer or significantly adds to the costs of deployment if the retailer needs to build a system from scratch. Cybersecurity is only getting more complex, and iBeacons had weak security and privacy controls in place. It's entirely possible that these weaknesses could have been overcome, but that's up to Apple. It's also not as if there's much competition in micro-location technologies that would spur Apple into action. Alphabet's Google released Eddystone in 2015, its own BLE-based beacon protocol, but like with Apple, it's pretty low on the priority list. You'd think that Google would take it more seriously, since beacons are primarily positioned as supplementary marketing tools. Last I checked, Google's business is still built on advertising. Mobile chip giant Qualcomm released its own Gimbal platform shortly after Apple in 2013, but has since spun it off into a separate company. Beacon technologies aren't quite dead, though. Target deployed a pilot program just last year in 50 locations. But unless the major platform operators really get behind the technology, all pilot programs will likely suffer the same unfortunate fate. ","

You can argue over which brand of handgun you like, but when it comes to features, there is little room for argument. Most shoppers are looking for a gun that is compact, lightweight, and accurate. And for good reason: People want to arm themselves with handguns that are easily concealable and can fill the role of a personal defense weapon. GunBroker.com, the world's largest online auction house for firearms and accessories, identifies the five best-selling firearms on its site for every month over the first six months of the year. While it lists the leaders in every major category of firearms sold (breaking them down between new and used), for our purposes here, I limited the selection to the five best-selling new semiautomatic pistols, likely the most popular category of firearms in the country. Image source: Getty Images. It should be noted that GunBroker.com does not list specific numbers for guns sold or total dollar values. In order to estimate their relative popularity, I compiled all the monthly lists and assigned them values according to their rank on the list (first was worth five points; second, four points; and so on) and their number of appearances. Then, I calculated the totals for each model and arranged them from most points to least. Here is my approximate list of most popular handguns: Fourth place (tie): Glock G43 and Springfield XD-S. The Glock and Springfield Armory models each garnered the same number of points. Major gunmakers such as Smith & Wesson (NASDAQ:AOBC), Beretta, and Kel-Tec have competing models on the market, but the G43 was launched as an easily concealable, single stack 9mm pistol. By comparison, the Springfield XD-S is also a single stack, but the 3.3-inch model has the benefit of coming in 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP versions. Both models, priced at $500 or more, fall on the pricier end of the spectrum. Third place: Sig Sauer P938. The P938 is a 9mm hammer-fired, single-action pistol with aluminum alloy frame and steel slide. Its light weight and small package make it ideal for concealed carry. It features a single-action only trigger, but coupled with its full-size tritium SigLite Night Sights, the P938 handles like a much larger pistol, such as the M1911. The platform, though, is a big brother to the popular Sig Sauer P238 pistol (chambered in .380). It carries an even heftier MSRP of $819. Second place (tie): Glock G19 and Smith & Wesson M&P Shield. While the Smith & Wesson had more first-place votes than any of the other guns listed here, the G19 also received numerous second and third-place mentions, and that helped it make up the difference. The G19 was designed for concealability and despite its compact form factor, the weapon features a 15-round capacity, compared with just seven or eight rounds in competing single stack handguns. It retails for around $600. Smith & Wesson's M&P Shield immediately rocketed to the top of the charts upon its introduction in 2012, and the company quickly built over one million units. Smith & Wesson claimed its Shield was ""the best-selling personal protection and self-defense pistol"" on the market. Originally offered in 9mm and .40, Smith & Wesson added a .45 model to the lineup this year. These pistols start at around $450. First place: Ruger LCP. The LCP from Sturm, Ruger (NYSE:RGR) was everyone's either first or second choice for a new semiautomatic handgun, and rightly so. Since its introduction in 2008, the .380 ACP pistol has been wildly popular, though its sights and trigger pull are routinely panned. While there were always improvements that could be made, Ruger seems to have addressed virtually all of them with the LCP II. LCP, which stands for ""lightweight compact pistol"", was designed for concealed carry. It more than lives up to the task, and that is why it has proven to be a top choice for those looking for a personal defense weapon, not to mention its price: The LCP can be had for as little as $260. As each of these top sellers makes clear, the biggest driver of demand is self-defense as concealability remains the primary attribute buyers are looking for in their firearms. Major media outlets continue to report on civil unrest following the Presidential election, so we may not have seen the end of the gun sales boom that occurred during the Obama administration -- or the growing interest in compact, concealed carry weapons.

    The 5 Best-Selling Handguns in America All Have 1 Thing in Common -- The Motley Fool

Travis Hoium,12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. GoPro Inc's (NASDAQ:GPRO) stock has fallen so far over the past year that management has to be thinking about what the company's future looks like, and competitors may be wondering if an acquisition might make sense. In many ways, a buyout could be a win-win for GoPro and a potential buyer. GoPro comes with no debt and a great brand, and the right buyer could make GoPro's products more usable for consumers. Looking at the landscape for cameras, drones, and action sports, Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ:GRMN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and DJI are three logical buyers for the company. Image source: Getty Images. Garmin is one company that's tried to move into GoPro's market with its own action camera. The move makes some sense given Garmin's position as a standard in GPS and watches for athletes, but it's still a stretch, and there's no indication the company is going to gain significant market share. Buying GoPro would give Garmin a great brand and leading market position in cameras, but it could also integrate well into its other products. Smartwatches are now able to connect with GoPro cameras (although it's a difficult process), and Garmin could integrate its own smartwatches with GoPro cameras. For action sports users in particular, it would make a lot more sense to push a physical button on a watch to take a picture than trying to tap a touch screen on an Apple Watch. Garmin's watches and GoPro's cameras are going after the same customer base, and if they had some integration, there could be a lot of cross-selling opportunities. And that makes Garmin a good fit for GoPro. GoPro is trying, and failing, to do a lot of the things Apple does well on its own platform. GoPro is trying to make it easier to transfer content from cameras to the cloud, edit photos and videos, and share them. Why not sell to Apple, a company that does all of those things extremely well? The acquisition could follow along the lines of Beats by Dre, which was an adjacent market for Apple but fit nicely with its focus on music. GoPro would augment the focus on photos and video but bring a more action-oriented product to the lineup. It would also be interesting to see what Apple could do with GoPro's products and technology. Apple has been rumored to be working on virtual reality, and GoPro has a leading VR capture camera setup in its lineup. Drones could even be of interest, although GoPro hasn't done particularly well in the drone business. Apple doesn't make a lot of acquisitions, but the strong brand of GoPro and products that line up well with the company's photo and video focus could be a nice fit. And the $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion check Apple would have to write for the company wouldn't even make a dent in its balance sheet. When GoPro came out with a drone, it was taking aim at DJI, the world's drone leader that designed GoPro out of its drones a couple of years ago. But GoPro's drone (literally) crashed, and DJI's position on top of that market has been solidified. Where DJI doesn't have a big presence is in stand-alone cameras, but it would like to get there. DJI has built a suite of camera and stabilization products aimed at high-end photographers and videographers, but they're not very mass market. Adding GoPro's products, and the brand, could open up a new set of customers and fill out the product line. DJI could also choose to wait for GoPro to continue stumbling, but the risk is that GoPro will eventually build a drone system that's a real competitor to DJI. That may not be a risk worth taking. Given GoPro's struggles to generate consistent revenue and earnings and the competitive pressures on all of its product lines, it may be time for GoPro to consider looking at a buyout. The company would be an attractive asset for some purchasers, and it may take the pressure that comes with being a public company off of its operations, opening up new opportunities for innovation. Time will tell if management eventually agrees. ","

Tax season is rapidly approaching, and taxpayers across the nation will soon look for any tax breaks they can find. Claiming dependent exemptions is a smart way to reduce your taxable income, because for each exemption, you get a $4,050 reduction on the 2016 tax return you'll file early in 2017. But there are sometimes complicated rules you have to follow in order to claim dependents properly. Below, we'll look at those rules and how you can make the most of the favorable tax provisions governing dependents. Image source: Getty Images. By contrast, the qualifying relative rules are broader in some ways and narrower in others. No age limit applies, and eligible relatives include parents, grandparents, and other more extended family relationships than what's covered under the qualifying child rules. Unrelated household members can also qualify, although they must live with you year-round, which isn't required for most relatives. To be a dependent, the person must have income of less than $4,050 in 2016 for you to claim an exemption. The person must still be a U.S. citizen or resident, and you must provide more than half of the person's financial support for the year. In most cases, it makes sense for taxpayers to claim dependents if they meet the legal tests. That's because dependents typically have minimal income and therefore pay less in tax than those providing support, and so the tax break is worth more to the person providing support. However, that isn't always the case. For example, take a 23-year-old married child who is in school and whose spouse has a substantial income from work. The parents of the child might be able to claim the child as a dependent if they met the relevant tests for support. However, doing so would prevent the child from filing a joint return, and that could result in much higher tax liability for the child's spouse on a separate return. It might save the whole family more if the parents gave up the dependent exemption and let the child file jointly with the child's spouse. The $4,050 reduction in taxable income per dependent can reduce your tax by hundreds or even thousands of dollars. However, some taxpayers don't get to take the full exemption amount. Specifically, the dependent exemption provision phases out for taxpayers who have adjusted gross income above a certain level. The table below lists the phaseouts for various filing statuses. Filing Status Phaseout Begins Above This Income Level Single $259,400 Married Filing Jointly or Qualifying Widow(er) $311,300 Head of Household $285,350 Married filing separately $155,650 Data source: IRS. For every $2,500 you make above that amount -- or $1,250 for those who are married filing separately -- you lose 2% of your total exemption for dependents. That means that once you're $125,000 above the threshold, you won't get to take any exemption at all. High-income taxpayers therefore get essentially no benefit from claiming dependents on their taxes. Last, keep in mind that if you're divorced and have children, there will be some hoops to jump through in order to make the dependent exemptions work out the way you've agreed to. Typically, the custodial parent is the one who gets to claim dependent exemptions on children. However, the IRS allows divorced parents to treat children as dependents of the noncustodial parent if the custodial parent signs a special form, IRS Form 8332. The noncustodial parent must then attach that form to the tax return for the year. In general, it makes sense to claim as many dependents as you're entitled to claim. By knowing the rules, however, you can plan your taxes in a way that will produce the greatest savings -- regardless of how many dependents you decide to claim. ","

Sue Chang,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 9:09 a.m. ET The latest developments come at a time when President-elect Donald Trump has made it plain that he will play hardball with China By If there were any questions as to how far China will go to bolster its claim to the South China Sea, the world got another clue this week that leaves no doubt that Beijing is playing for high stakes. A series of satellite images released by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative show that China has bulked up its military presence on the Spratly Islands by installing large antiaircraft guns and close-in weapons systems. The AMTI, which had been tracking the construction of the structures since this summer, concluded that these facilities at Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi Reefs are more evolved point-defense fortifications that are already installed at Gaven, Hughes, Johnson, and Cuarteron Reefs. Here are some of the images of those installations: Fiery Cross Reef Mischief Reef Subi Reef “These gun and probable CIWS emplacements show that Beijing is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,” said AMTI in a statement on its website. The think-tank believes the weaponry will be the “last line of defense” against cruise missiles launched by the U.S. Gaven Reef Hughes Reef Johnson Reef Cuarteron Reef “They would back up the defensive umbrella provided by a future deployment to the Spratlys of mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) platforms, such as the HQ-9 deployed to Woody Island in the Paracel Islands,” said the AMTI. China’s activities in the disputed region are a direct contradiction of President Xi Jinping’s pledge to refrain from militarization in the archipelago. They also raise concerns that Beijing will increasingly resort to military force to bolster its territorial claims and control a key shipping route that accounts for $5 trillion of international trade annually, according to The Wall Street Journal. Adm. Harry Harris, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, said Wednesday that the U.S. won’t allow the region to be shut down by China “no matter how many bases are built,” the newspaper reported. “We will cooperate where we can and be ready to confront where we must,” he said. At his disposal is the formidable U.S. Pacific Fleet which includes 200 ships and submarines, more than 1,000 aircraft and 140,000 personnel. The latest developments come at a time when President-elect Donald Trump has made it plain that he will play hardball with China. Trump has already broken with tradition by accepting a congratulatory call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan earlier this month. In the days since, Trump had indicated that the once tamper-proof One-China Policy, which essentially treats Taiwan as a renegade province of China, will likely be reviewed, if not overhauled. Beijing lashed out in an editorial in the state-backed Global Times, calling Trump naive and warned that China could go as far as to provide military assistance to U.S.’s enemies. “China needs to be fully armed and prepared to take a Sino-U. S. roller coaster relationship together with Trump. And many others in the world will probably also need to fasten their seat belts,” said the newspaper.

The loan forgiveness, which covers all unpaid student loans made through DeVry between Sept. 1, 2008 and Sept. 30, 2015, is part of a larger settlement with the Federal Trade Commission totaling $100 million. The deal doesn’t include any federal student loans made to students who attended the school during the period of the lawsuit. The deal, which covers tens of thousands of students, according to the FTC, includes a $49.4 million payment to the FTC that the agency will distribute to students harmed by the misleading marketing. DeVry will also forgive $20.25 million owed to the school by students for items like tuition, books and lab fees. The company agreed to provide students with any transcripts or diplomas that were withheld over the unpaid bills. The loan forgiveness will happen automatically and DeVry will notify the students eligible for relief as well as their credit bureaus. The FTC will begin sending refunds from the $49.4 million pot in 2017 and will identify students who qualify from DeVry’s records and contact them about the refund. The FTC sued DeVry last year, alleging the company touted a job placement rate of 90% without evidence to back it up. The agency uncovered evidence that DeVry considered a server at the Cheesecake Factory

As part of the deal, DeVry agreed that any time the company makes a claim about job placement rates of a class of students, it has to save documentation related to that claim, including files related to the students or graduates. “DeVry often presents itself as a better actor in the sector, but what this settlement shows is that they are not immune to the pressures of the sector to bring students in the door and to generate revenue,” said Elizabeth Baylor, the director of postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. DeVry neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The company is “pleased this matter is reaching a resolution,” Ernie Gibbles, a DeVry spokesman, wrote in an emailed statement. “At no time has the academic quality of a DeVry University education been question.” The deal comes as the Obama administration looks to cement its legacy as a tough enforcer in the higher education space, specifically for-profit colleges. Earlier this year, the Department of Education banned ITT Technical Institutes from access federal financial aid to enroll new students, amid multiple probes into the school’s dealings with students and investors. Suffering a cash crunch, the company filed for bankruptcy weeks later. Corinthian Colleges also collapsed last year amid financial pressures resulting from additional requirements placed on the school by the Department in order to receive federal financial aid. DeVry avoided a similar fate after agreeing in October to reserve $68 million to settle claims brought by the Department that the school used misleading advertisements. The agency required the company to set aside the money to continue receiving access to federal financial aid. DeVry’s access to federal student aid also isn’t impacted by the FTC settlement, the company said in a statement. The deal marks the second roughly $100 million settlement reached by a federal government agency with a for-profit college this year. But the eye-popping number likely won’t affect DeVry’s ability to operate, given that DeVry collected more than $1 billion in financial aid during the 2014 to 2015 school year, according to Baylor. What’s more, the actual cost of the settlement to DeVry is much lower than the $100 million touted by the FTC. In securities filings, the company said it expects to record a pretax charge of between $52 and $55 million as a result of the deal. “The settlement will cost DeVry much less than $100 million, since the corporation has long known that many students would never be able to repay the private student loans that were pushed on them,” Rohit Chopra, the former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in an email. “DeVry’s stock has surged since Election Day, and their recent legal settlements won’t stop the flow of federal funds into company coffers.” As of 3 p.m. Thursday, DeVry’s stock was up 2.69% from Wednesday’s close. DeVry and other companies in the higher education sector have seen their stocks rise in the wake of the election, amid indications that a Trump administration will be friendlier to for-profit colleges and other industry players. The deal doesn’t cover federal loans owed by students who attended DeVry during the period of the suit. Federal student loan borrowers who believe they were wronged by their schools can apply to the Department of Education as a part of a process known as borrower defense to have their loans wiped away. Often lawsuits can serve as evidence of wrongdoing for purposes of federal student loan forgiveness, but because the judgment doesn’t specify any particular illegal conduct it could make it difficult for borrowers to rely on it to claim loan forgiveness. It also appears that a Donald Trump administration will be friendlier to for-profit colleges, which may mean that borrowers petitioning for forgiveness will have a tougher time. “There are indications from the incoming Trump administration that they will be pretty strict about issuing students relief,” Baylor said. The Department of Education didn’t indicate whether the FTC settlement would help DeVry students with federal loans in their pleas for forgiveness. When the Department announced its own deal with DeVry, the agency said it planned to continue its own investigations into the institution. Any resulting findings could help borrowers in their efforts to pursue forgiveness. “We are pleased that today’s settlement delivers both financial relief to former students and puts in place protections for current and future DeVry students,” Ted Mitchell, the undersecretary of education, said in a statement.

Shawn Langlois,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 17, 2016 1:52 p.m. ET Infowars fired back with a chart of its own By Patent attorney Vanessa Otero recently fanned the flames of the fake news debate when she re-posted a chart on Facebook breaking down various sources by reliability and political viewpoint. “We are living in a time where we have more information available to each of us than ever before in history. However, we are not all proficient at distinguishing between good information and bad information,” she wrote when she first introduced the chart. “This is true for liberal, moderate, and conservative people. I submit that these two circumstances are highly related to why our country is so politically polarized at the moment.” Since then, her illustration has been shared thousands of times across social media and even landed on one of the “news” sites she labeled as “utter garbage.” Here’s her chart: Otero received plenty of kudos for her work, but she was also hammered with some of that armchair internet criticism we’ve come to expect. “LOL this chart is a complete joke. None of mainstream is accurate they are all paid off shills with an agenda that report what they are told by their masters... not journalists they are fictionalists” — Michele Ellen. “CNN, and MSNBC should be falling of the left side of the paper” — Bert Proulx. “Wow; if you put NYT and WaPo in the center, then your whole chart is off! Better move them a little more to the left!” — Harry Habrams. Then there’s Infowars, which didn’t take too kindly to its position on the chart. This is how the right-wing website responded: “We’ve created our own news chart depicting how most leftist mainstream media sites promote tyranny, while the conservative ‘garbage’ sites on the previous map actually promote liberty and freedom.” Here’s the result of the Infowars effort: In the face of the backlash, Otero explained her thought process, and even offered a blank version that everybody could edit as they see fit. “I respectfully submit that if you make your own, you should be able to place at least one source in each of the vertical columns, because they exist, and at least one in each of the horizontal rows, because they also exist,” she wrote. “If you have just a couple sources that you think are in the middle but none exist either to the right or left of them, or up or down from them, you may be on the wrong track.” Take this quiz: Can you pick out the fake news stories that duped millions of people this year?

The blast in the central Anatolian city of Kayseri happened at around 8:45 a.m. and targeted a civilian bus carrying troops on weekend leave from a nearby commando base, Turkey’s armed forces said in a statement. At least 56 people, including 48 servicemen, have been injured in the attack, Turkish officials said. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but officials said the terrorist attack bore the hallmarks of last Saturday’s attack in Istanbul that killed 37 policemen and seven civilians outside the stadium of Istanbul’s Besiktas soccer team. Kurdish militants claimed responsibility for the twin bombings. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Kurdish separatists were utilizing all their resources to undermine Turkey, without explicitly blaming them for the Kayseri assault. A spokesman for the outlawed Kurdish insurgency’s political arm didn’t have an immediate comment. The back-to-back attacks highlight the heightened security threats facing Turkey.

The cars are not self-driving individually or collectively, and in fact, they’re just like regular cars, Anthony Levandowski, vice president of the advanced technologies group at Uber, stressed in a conference call Friday. For that reason, Levandowski suggested Uber will continue to defy an order by the California Department of Motor Vehicles to cease the company’s autonomous car pilot program in San Francisco and seek a permit to test self-driving vehicles in the state. Uber expanded its self-driving pilot to San Francisco on Wednesday, proclaiming on its blog, “San Francisco, your self-driving Uber is arriving now.” Still, Levandowski said that its cars do not fit the DMV’s definition of self-driving because the cars are “not capable of driving without active physical control or monitoring.” The cars’ technology operates like Tesla Motors Inc.’s

The Uber cars deployed in San Francisco have a driver sitting in the drivers seat, with their hands on the wheel and ready to take over if necessary, as well as an engineer sitting next to them to monitor the system. Uber launched a similar program in Pittsburgh in September. “We believe they are no different from any other car on the road today,” Levandowski said. Levandowski said the cars are still on the road in San Francisco and picking up passengers. “The cars are on the road today and I don’t want to speculate what will happen in the future,” he said. See also: Uber drivers go to war against self-driving cars Levandowski said the company had been in talks with the DMV and plans to continue talking with the regulators. The DMV has asked Uber to “immediately” take its self-driving cars off public roads and seek a permit. If not, the California Attorney General’s office said it would seek injunctive relief “and other appropriate relief.” As The Wall Street Journal reported, Uber may be wary of the permit as it requires companies to file accident reports and reports of how many times humans had to take the wheel. Levandowski said the company plans to provide some disclosure “as the technology improves,” and that Uber is not seeking the permit because the permit does not apply to their actions.

Yaron Steinbuch,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 8:54 a.m. ET ‘Self-reporting is critically important,’ says ‘Miracle on the Hudson’ pilot Sully Sullenberger By Thousands of commercial pilots worldwide are likely clinically depressed — some even suicidal — but don’t seek treatment for fear of being grounded and losing their wings, according to a new study. The Harvard study was conducted in the wake of the 2015 Germanwings tragedy in the French Alps, in which a mentally ill co-pilot deliberately crashed his plane, killing himself and 149 others. Researchers found that 426 of 3,278 pilots surveyed last year — about 13% — were likely suffering from depression. Seventy-five pilots reported having suicidal or self-destructive thoughts within two weeks of taking the survey, according to the study, published Wednesday in Environmental Health. Using those numbers, researchers estimated that about 18,000 pilots are depressed and 5,600 have been suicidal, out of the roughly 140,000 flying worldwide — half of whom fly in the United States. Airline pilots may be grounded if they report experiencing depression, depending on whether or not they are being treated, according to the study’s lead author, Alex Wu. “That is a strong disincentive [to report], if that directly influences their career,” he said, according to Boston.com. “Underreporting of mental-health symptoms and diagnoses is probable among airline pilots due to the public stigma of mental illness and fear among pilots of being grounded,” the study says. “Miracle on the Hudson” pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger said pilots who are not fit to fly should remain out of the cockpit. “But we need to make pathways for them to come back to work when their issues are resolved,” the retired US Airways captain, whose father took his life after a battle with depression, told CBS News. “It’s likely given these statistics, I probably have flown with someone who had thoughts. They just didn’t share them with me,” Sullenberger said. “Self-reporting is critically important.” Despite the findings, public confidence in airline pilots should not take a hit, the authors said. Read: 5 places deal-savvy travelers should visit in 2017 “Flying is safe and this study doesn’t change that,” senior study author Joseph G. Allen told the LA Times. The Federal Aviation Administration has not called for routine psychological evaluations, saying there is no proof it would improve safety, CBS News reported. But a US advisory panel has recently called for heightened measures to spot and treat mentally ill pilots to prevent the kind of breakdowns that led to the Germanwings disaster, a source told The Washington Post.

Tonya Garcia,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 21, 2016 8:23 a.m. ET Panera is one of a number of food companies taking supply-chain measures to improve the lives of chickens By It’s an age-old question: Which came first, the chicken or the egg? In the case of animal welfare issues, the answer is easy: the egg. But more food companies are turning their attention to chickens, adopting policies intended to improve the lives of the birds used in their products. “Companies have been helping shift the egg industry to cage-free production for several years, and now they’re starting to set policies around how birds in the chicken-meat industry are treated,” said Matthew Prescott, senior director of food policy at the Humane Society of the United States.

The broiler chicken policy, which is aligned with the Global Animal Partnership’s standard, calls for, among other things, more space and improved environments for the birds. See also:  This is why Americans are overweight and broke The move has drawn applause from the ASPCA Farm Animal Welfare Program. “Panera’s new welfare standards aim to improve the lives of chickens by addressing the core issues of genetics, living conditions, and end-of-life handling,” the organization said in a statement. “A joint effort across the supply chain from the livestock industry to food companies, retailers and consumers will be necessary in order to end the widespread systematic suffering of farm animals.” Nearly 8.5 billion broiler chickens are raised in the U.S. for meat, according to the ASPCA. “The majority of these birds have been bred to suffer — growing so large so quickly that their musculoskeletal system cannot keep up, leading many to collapse and lie in their own waste with open sores,” the ASPCA says. After a life in cramped conditions, they’re then slaughtered in ways that can be inhumane, the group continues. In addition to chickens, Panera said that, in 2016, 100% of the poultry in its sandwiches and salads was raised without antibiotics, 100% of the bacon, ham and other pork products in its sandwiches and salads have been raised without antibiotics or gestation crates, and 95% of the beef in its food is grass-fed and free-range. Panera Bread announced in November 2015 that it would be converting exclusively to cage-free eggs by 2020.

They have been essential partners over the years and we respect the investments they will need to make as we work together to find economically viable and sustainable models that lead to higher welfare birds.” In addition to Panera, Pret A Manger, a restaurant chain with more than 70 U.S. locations, has announced a commitment to using the Global Animal Partnership standard for the chicken in its food.

Joseph E. Stiglitz,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 19, 2016 10:40 a.m. ET Higher interest rates will lead to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs, warns Joseph Stiglitz By NEW YORK (Project Syndicate) — As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump fills his cabinet, what have we learned about the likely direction and impact of his administration’s economic policy? To be sure, enormous uncertainties remain. As in many other areas, Trump’s promises and statements on economic policy have been inconsistent. While he routinely accuses others of lying, many of his economic assertions and promises — indeed, his entire view of governance — seem worthy of Nazi Germany’s “big lie” propagandists. Trump will take charge of an economy on a strongly upward trend, with third-quarter GDP growing at an impressive annual rate of 3.2% and unemployment at 4.6% in November. By contrast, when President Barack Obama took over in 2009, he inherited from George W. Bush an economy sinking into a deep recession. And, like Bush, Trump is yet another Republican president who will assume office despite losing the popular vote, only to pretend that he has a mandate to undertake extremist policies. The only way Trump will square his promises of higher infrastructure and defense spending with large tax cuts and deficit reduction is a heavy dose of what used to be called voodoo economics. Decades of “cutting the fat” in government has left little to cut: federal government employment as a percentage of the population is lower today than it was in the era of small government under President Ronald Reagan some 30 years ago. With so many former military officers serving in Trump’s cabinet or as advisers, even as Trump cozies up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and anchors an informal alliance of dictators and authoritarians around the world, it is likely that the U.S. will spend more money on weapons that don’t work to use against enemies that don’t exist. If Trump’s health secretary succeeds in undoing the careful balancing act that underlies Obamacare, either costs will rise or services will deteriorate — most likely both. During the campaign, Trump promised to get tough on executives who outsource American jobs. He is now holding up the news that the home heating and air conditioning manufacturer Carrier will keep some 800 jobs in my home state of Indiana as proof that his approach works. Yet the deal will cost taxpayers $7 million, and still allow Carrier to outsource 1,300 jobs to Mexico. This isn't a sound industrial or economic policy, and it will do nothing to help raise wages or create good jobs across the country. It is an open invitation for a shakedown of the government by corporate executives seeking handouts. Read: The real message behind the Carrier deal isn’t those 800 jobs Similarly, the increase in infrastructure spending is likely to be accomplished through tax credits, which will help hedge funds but not America’s balance sheet: such programs’ long track record shows that they deliver little value for money. The cost to the public will be especially high in an era when the government can borrow at near-zero interest rates. If these private-public partnerships are like those elsewhere, the government will assume the risks, and the hedge funds will assume the profits. The debate just eight years ago about “shovel-ready” infrastructure seems to be a distant memory. If Trump chooses shovel-ready projects, the long-term impact on productivity will be minimal; if he chooses real infrastructure, the short-term impact on economic growth will be minimal. And backloaded stimulus has its own problems, unless it is managed extremely carefully. If Trump’s pick for U.S. Treasury Secretary, the Goldman Sachs and hedge-fund veteran Steven Mnuchin, is like others from his industry, the expertise he will bring to the job will be in tax avoidance, not constructing a well-designed tax system. The “good” news is that tax reform was inevitable, and was likely to be undertaken by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and his staff — giving the rich the less progressive, more capital-friendly tax system that Republicans have long sought. With the abolition of the estate tax, the Republicans would finally realize their long-held ambition of creating a dynastic plutocracy — a far cry from the “equality of opportunity” maxim the party once trumpeted. Large tax cuts and large expenditure increases inevitably lead to large deficits. Reconciling this with Trump’s promise to reduce the deficit will probably entail a return to Reagan-era magical thinking: despite decades of proof to the contrary, this time the stimulus to the economy brought by tax cuts for the rich will be so large that tax revenues will actually increase. This story doesn’t end well for Trump’s angry, displaced Rust Belt voters. Unhinged budgetary policies will induce the Federal Reserve to normalize interest rates faster. Some see incipient inflation (given the low unemployment rate); some believe the long period of ultralow interest rates has distorted capital markets; and some want to “replenish their ammunition,” so that the Fed can lower interest rates should the economy slow down again. Trump has argued that the Fed should raise interest rates. The Fed, which took the first step toward normalization in early December, will almost certainly deliver — and Trump will soon regret what he wished for. There’s a good chance that the monetary contraction will outweigh the fiscal stimulus, curbing the Obama growth spurt currently underway. Higher interest rates will undercut construction jobs and increase the value of the dollar, leading to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs — just the opposite of what Trump promised. Meanwhile, his tax policies will be of limited benefit to middle-class and working families — and will be more than offset by cutbacks in health care, education, and social programs. If Trump starts a trade war — by, say, following through on his vow to impose a 45% tariff on imports from China and to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico — the economic impact will be even more severe. Trump’s cabinet of billionaires could continue to buy their Gucci handbags and $10,000 Ivanka bracelets, but ordinary Americans’ cost of living would increase substantially; and without components from Mexico and elsewhere, manufacturing jobs would become even scarcer. Read: How ‘Art of the Deal’ explains Trump’s actions as president-elect To be sure, a few new jobs will be created, mainly in the lobbying shops along K Street in Washington, D.C., as Trump refills the swamp that he promised to drain. Indeed, America’s bog of legal corruption is likely to reach a depth not seen since President Warren G. Harding’s administration in the 1920s. And there really is no silver lining to the cloud that now hangs over the U.S. and the world. As bad as his administration will be for America’s economy and workers, its policies on climate change, human rights, the media, and ensuring peace and security are likely to be no less damaging for everyone else.

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s Constitutional Council has ruled against a fiscal measure dubbed the “Google tax”, which was aimed at making it tougher for multinational companies to minimise their tax payments in France. The council’s ruling on Thursday comes as the government seeks to make France more attractive for foreign businesses after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. The “Google tax” targeting multinationals that use different countries’ tax regimes to reduce tax liabilities had initially been included in France’s 2017 budget law, but the government has since said it has reservations about the plans. The council also validated a widening of a planned financial transactions tax, making it applicable to intra-day transactions from 2018, though it could be challenged by the new government and parliament after next year’s elections. It also validated part of the government’s plan for French people to be taxed at source from 2018, meaning that their employers would deduct income tax payments from their pay. At present, French workers are responsible for declaring their income and settling their tax bills themselves. ","

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian government aims to pass a law in the spring of next year to allow testing of self-driving vehicles on Norwegian roads, it said on Thursday. Norway is one of the largest markets for Tesla Motors electric vehicles, thanks to generous government subsidies. Tesla said in October its new models will come with hardware, including cameras and a radar, to enable them to be fully-self driving. The move to permit testing of self-driving vehicles is also aimed at giving a competitive edge to Norwegian technology companies as the country seeks to diversify away from the offshore petroleum sector, hit by a plunge in global oil prices. Other companies exploring self-driving cars include Alphabet’s Google, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Ford Motor Co. Norway’s Ministry of Transport and Communications said the government was sending out a proposal for consultation on a new law with the aim of getting a bill passed by parliament in the spring of 2017. “The objective of the bill is to facilitate the testing of self-driving vehicles on Norwegian roads ... within the framework of traffic safety while protecting the integrity of personal information,” it said in a statement. Self-driving vehicles will be introduced gradually, and only technologically mature systems would be approved for testing, it added. The roll-out of self-driving cars faces a bumpy start in some countries due to lack of regulation and public scepticism about their safety. Uber stopped testing its self-driving cars in San Francisco this week, after California authorities revoked the registration of 16 of its self-driving cars because they had not received the proper permits. Uber said it was not obliged to have a permit because its vehicles require continuous monitoring by a person in the car. ","

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"(Reuters) - High up in western Europe’s tallest skyscraper, an office layout shows how the power balance in London’s property market is shifting in favor of booming tech companies and away from finance firms which may shrink in London after the Brexit vote. Some employees of digital marketing agency Jellyfish work from hot desks at The Shard, gathered around a long pine table suggestive of a trendy coffee shop, enjoying views of St Paul’s Cathedral. Edged by a bar with a screen displaying train times, floor-to-ceiling whiteboards, cozy sound-proofed booths and a tap dispensing barista-style coffees, the design encourages staff to work together. “We wanted to be taken seriously, not just frittering client money away with crazy guys on roller skates, so this is a serious space,” said the company’s Chief Creative Officer Mark Deeprose. Jellyfish’s offices are one sign of how fast-growing tech firms are calling the shots in the London property market, outshining the finance sector which accounts for around 8 percent of British GDP and has long been the cornerstone of the capital’s property scene. Property developers are ditching the marble fittings, suspended ceilings and tight rows of desks associated with the grand old banks, replacing them with more spacious irregular offices finished with the brickwork, colorful furniture and exposed wires beloved of tech companies. Since Britons voted on June 23 to leave the European Union, some financial services companies have threatened to move operations to other European capitals over fears that Brexit may prevent them serving EU clients. “Immediately after Brexit no one was doing anything but once we got into August and September, all of the tech firms just seemed to say, well, we’re moving on,” said James Roberts, chief economist at property consultant Knight Frank. For ASOS’s expanded and redeveloped London headquarters, it has used software to map how its people use the building to encourage different units to work together. It will also have a quiet library, and a concierge service to help employees with their needs outside work. “(Tech) is an active sector at the moment and we’re seeing developers beginning to acknowledge this within the way that they’re building,” said Simon Calvert, senior director of advisory and transaction services at property firm CBRE CBG.N. But the growth in tech may not be enough to fill new commercial property space. The City of London warns that up to 10 percent of jobs in London’s financial district may be lost if Britain fails to secure adequate EU access after Brexit. At the same time, London office construction has reached its highest level since 2008, according to Deloitte. It has amended an existing planning consent at a site in Paddington, west London, to introduce features such as sun terraces, a rooftop basketball court and collaborative work spaces that position the building more towards the TMT (technology, media and telecommunications) sectors. “We’ll adapt tactically, but we’re confident that’s good for the longer term,” CEO Chris Grigg said, after the firm in November posted a fall in the value of its office portfolio which gets 17 percent of its rent from banks and finance firms and 7 percent from TMT. Harry Badham, who heads the UK development team at AXA IM – Real Assets, said the 22 Bishopsgate site would aim to attract tech clients with a plan to offer space for an incubator workshop for start-ups where they would charge lower rent. Luring established tech clients requires not just space with an industrial, retro vibe, but also flexible rental deals, said Andrew Sell, commercial director at Real Estate Management (UK), which handles The Shard. “Whereas before there was an aversion from the owners to have lease breaks, we recognize it’s really important for the tech sector because their rate of growth is colossal,” he said. “Ten years ago maybe the banks’ model was rack it, stack it and squeeze them in,” he said. “(But) the banks are going to be competing with the Googles for these digitally-enabled people, they are going to need to have that (tech-friendly) environment,” he said.

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"(Reuters) - California Attorney General Kamala Harris on Friday filed new criminal charges of pimping and money laundering against the chief executive and controlling shareholders of the website Backpage.com, reviving a case that was dismissed by a judge earlier this month. The new charges against Backpage.com CEO Carl Ferrer and controlling shareholders Michael Lacey and James Larkin include 26 counts of money laundering and 13 counts of pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping. While the pimping charges appear similar to those filed by Harris against the trio in October and later dismissed, the money laundering allegations are new. Backpage, the second-largest U.S. online classified ad service after Craigslist, has faced scrutiny from the U.S. Senate as well as civil lawsuits over allegations that the site facilitates sex trafficking, especially of children. But efforts to prosecute the company have been blocked by a federal law that shields website operators from responsibility for content posted by third-parties. The complaint filed Friday alleges that the defendants created multiple corporate entities to launder money and circumvent the refusal of financial institutions to process Backpage transactions because of overtly sexual material, the Attorney General’s office said in a press release. It also alleges that the defendants created other sites to increase the company’s prostitution-related revenue and developed content for those sites by using victims’ photographs or information without their knowledge. Representatives for Backpage could not immediately be reached for comment. The latest action, like other lawsuits involving Backpage.com, will be closely watched by the technology industry. The federal shield for content liability is considered critical for web companies ranging from Google and Facebook to eBay and Airbnb, but it has come under fire from some lawmakers and judges. One civil lawsuit against Backpage was filed in 2012 in Washington State by three young teenagers who alleged they were raped multiple times after being advertised on the site. The girls, the oldest of whom was 15, sued Backpage for claims including sexual exploitation of children, alleging its posting rules were intended to instruct pimps how to post trafficking ads that evade law enforcement. Backpage argued it has rules to prevent unlawful posts, and some free speech advocates filed briefs in support of its position. The Washington state Supreme Court disagreed, ruling last year that the lawsuit could go forward. Earlier this year, however, a similar trafficking case involving children against Backpage in Massachusetts was dismissed by a federal appeals court, which said the free speech principles embodied in the Communications Decency Act were paramount. Harris, a Democrat, was recently elected to the U.S. Senate and will take office in January. ","

,12292016,Reuters,12222016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When six executives of Platinum Partners, including founder Mark Nordlicht, were arrested on Monday on federal charges of running a more than $1 billion hedge fund fraud, people who had long alleged they were harmed by the New York-based firm felt some vindication. But the possibility that each defendant might face prison terms has done little to soothe their continued anger over losses that may never be recouped. One such person is Houston-based energy entrepreneur John Hoffman. In the charges, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged what Hoffman had long believed - that Platinum, with the help of a seventh man also arrested, Jeffrey Shulse, had illegally profited from the failure of Hoffman’s company, Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations LLC. Hoffman said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that he did not expect to recover anything and that his involvement with Platinum had cost him the company he founded and at least $500,000 in legal fees. He also described stress-related health problems and difficulty fundraising for a new energy venture. Hoffman expressed anger that thousands of Gulf Coast-area families were stiffed: mostly the small businesses that were never paid for work on Black Elk’s oil and gas drilling platforms before it went bankrupt amid lower oil prices and Platinum’s alleged corporate cash grab. All six Platinum executives pleaded not guilty and an attorney for Shulse told Reuters he plans to do the same. A spokesman for Platinum declined to comment for this article, and the firm has not offered any public comment. A person familiar with Platinum’s thinking told Reuters in April that the firm always acted within the limits of the law despite its aggressive investment approach. Launched in 2003, Platinum was known as a high-performing hedge fund manager that backed struggling companies and employed esoteric investment strategies such as litigation finance and high-interest consumer loans. (Reuters Special Report: reut.rs/1TRovwx) The government charges on Monday included allegations of over-valuing assets and misleading clients on the health of the firm. The government demanded that the hedge fund return money that was allegedly illegally taken from clients and Black Elk bondholders, and pay related penalties. That appears to complicate an already messy stew of competing claims for a relatively small pot of assets, which include funds already in supervised liquidation and bankruptcy. Others seeking money from Platinum include approximately 600 clients whose money was frozen, and creditors and shareholders of its now-bankrupt or struggling portfolio companies, according to a variety of lawsuits against Platinum Marc Powers, an attorney for a Platinum fund investor with BakerHostetler in New York, said it was too early to speculate on how much would be recovered from Platinum, including its hedge funds, executives, and allegedly improperly favored firm clients. But he added that it was unlikely his client and others would be made whole based on the number of claims and the facts of the case. “It clearly doesn’t look good for any of the victims,” Powers said. Robert McIver, a small business owner in Glasgow, Scotland, said he invested nearly $2 million with Platinum starting in 2013 after he searched on Google for top-performing hedge funds. “From looking at the numbers, Platinum was doing great. There was no reason to suspect anything,” McIver said in a phone interview on Wednesday along with his attorney, Powers. McIver gave Platinum money from his company, Aerial Services Scotland Ltd, and a significant part of his and his wife’s savings. “We had a plan to retire in about five years. That’s all ruined now,” he said. At least one person owed money by Platinum for a fund investment said he expected to recover a small portion of his assets. The person estimated that there would be several hundred million dollars left of the reported $1.3 billion following the liquidation process, based on plans such as L-3 Communications Holdings’s proposed $117.5 million purchase of assets from bankrupt explosives detection equipment maker Implant Sciences Corp, a Platinum holding. “The funds still have material value,” said the person, who requested anonymity because he did not want to be associated with Platinum. Houma, Louisiana-based Shamrock Energy Solutions LLC was one of about 285 creditors to put in claims for $1.2 billion when Black Elk went bankrupt. “Obviously we are excited with the fact that justice will finally prevail,” Rene Breaux, Shamrock’s chief financial officer, said by telephone on Wednesday. “But we are very sad in the fact that we are going to have to eat about a $1 million because we got taken advantage of.” A lawyer for Shamrock, Scott Scofield, said he would be “stunned” if unsecured Black Elk creditors like his client got more than 20 percent of their money back. For California Bay Area energy entrepreneur Michael Petras, Monday’s arrests brought some sense of vindication. Petras has warned regulators about Platinum for years after the collapse of the business he launched with Gary Mole, Franklin Power Company. Mole went on to found Glacial Energy Holdings, which became a Platinum holding. Petras has long contended that Mole destroyed Franklin to create Glacial and then conspired with Platinum to cheat him out of the millions of dollars he was owed. Reuters could not verify his claim. Platinum declined to comment and Mole did not respond to a request for comment. Starting in 2012, Petras made a detailed series of briefings and complaints about alleged wrongdoing, especially tax evasion, by Glacial and Platinum, with the New York Attorney General, the Internal Revenue Service, the SEC, the Department of Justice and various state public utility commissions, Petras said. In September 2015, Mole was arrested and charged with tax evasion by the New York Attorney General. Mole pleaded not guilty. The government’s charges this week included some of what Petras told them about Platinum’s involvement with Black Elk. Petras said by phone on Wednesday that his obsessive work on Platinum had taken a personal and financial toll, but he expressed pride at having done “a public service.” “The only disappointment I have is it took so long and the only regret I have is that the value I was entitled to I will never likely recover,” he said.

Rakesh Sharma,12292016,Investopedia,12222016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs This might be Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google’s (GOOG) favorite sandwich. Based on regulatory filings, the company has saved $3.6 billion in worldwide taxes by making a maneuver known as the “Double Irish With A Dutch Sandwich.” A report in Bloomberg broke down Google’s strategy for decreasing its tax commitments. The Mountain View company established Google Netherlands B.V, a Dutch subsidiary without employees, back in 2004. The main purpose of this subsidiary is to route Google’s profits to and from its Irish subsidiaries, which are located in a low-tax jurisdiction and are responsible for Google’s IP outside the United States. Money from the Netherlands office is routed to Bermuda, which has zero corporate income tax. Google moved $15.5 billion to this company in 2015. In 2014, that figure was approximately $12 billion. (See also: How Big Corporations Avoid Tax Bills). According to the Bloomberg report, Google’s effective income tax rate outside the United States was 6.5 percent in 2015 and the company routed $58.3 billion of its profits to the Bermuda tax haven. Google's income tax outside the U.S. was 6 percent in 2014. In a statement, Google said that it complies with tax laws “in every country that we operate.” To be sure, the company’s elaborate ruse to avoid taxes is the result of a prohibitive income tax at home. President-elect Donald Trump has offered a flat taxation rate of 10% to technology companies to make it easier for them to repatriate their profits back home. In the meanwhile, Google’s tax strategy is sure to draw the attention of EU Commissioner Margarethe Vestager, who hinted earlier this year that the company could be the organization’s next target after Apple Inc. (AAPL). (See also: After Apple, EU Takes Aim At Amazon). According to a study conducted earlier this year, tax evasion by corporate entities cost the EU between $54.5 billion and $76.4 billion. Governments in France and Spain have already conducted raids on Google’s offices. The idea of a “Google Tax” is also spreading across the world. For example, Indonesia has asked the company to pony up back taxes or pay as much as $223 million in fines. India introduced a measure aimed at levying tax on technology behemoths, such as Google and Facebook Inc. (FB), earlier this year.

Spriha Srivastava,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"Google has teamed up with the Indian government to develop a toilet locator app that enables users to find public washrooms in order to combat the nationwide problem of open defecation and urination. The Google toilet locator app, launched in the states of Delhi and Madhya Pradesh, at the moment helps people find access to clean public restrooms. The app, launched on Thursday, will also have a wide range of features such as cleanliness ratings, the style of toilet and if it requires a fee to use. The app enables users to type words such as ""toilet"" or ""lavatory"" or Hindi words like ""swachh"" and ""shulabh"" meaning clean to access the closest restrooms in the area, media reports say. ""When you search for 'public toilet' on Google Maps in an area where the service is available, you'll see a list of restrooms near you, including the respective address and opening hours,"" Sanket Gupta, product manager Google Maps India, said at a launch event in Delhi. ""For instance, if you're travelling on the national highway 8 in Gurugram, locating a public toilet can be challenging and most often the only option is going to nearby restaurants and cafes. Having this information handy can make things much easier."" Access to safe and healthy sanitation is a major problem that India is facing with a number of official surveys pointing to almost 70 percent of Indian households with no access to toilets. As a result, people are forced to defecate in open spaces. The toilet locator from Google aims to provide better access in such situations. However, critics of this app have said that the use of this service is subject to good network coverage and people knowing how to use maps on smartphones, especially as most of those with no access to proper sanitation are based in rural areas. ""What if you have no internet connection? What if you don't know how to use Google Maps? Unfortunately this is one thing that you can't plan in advance so there are a number of factors that you are dependent on,"" 21-year old Vikas told CNBC via email. Meanwhile, as part of an awareness campaign, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has recruited 28 people to wear funny mascot outfits to stop people from defecating and urinating in public. The mascots, who wear masks and yellow costumes, have been instructed to blow a whistle if they spot anyone in the act. According to government statistics, over five million people in Delhi defecate in the open. Another set of data from the government's slum development agency, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which has been entrusted with the task of making the city open defecation free, reported recently that there are 259 open defecation spots in Delhi.

Michael K. Farr,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.  In addition, the current dividend yield is an attractive 2.4 percent. ",Top 10 stocks for 2017—commentary
Arjun Kharpal,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"For investors looking to start 2017 with a bang, Netflix and Facebook might be the stocks to buy out of the so-called FANGs. The FANG stocks are Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. But Jim Cramer, who originally coined the term, changed the acronym to FAAA after he booted Netflix from the list, added Alibaba and acknowledged Google's change to Alphabet. For the purpose of the article, using data analytics platform Kensho, CNBC looked at the performance of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet and Alibaba if you bought them on the last trading day of December and sold the stock on the last trading day in January. The data focused on this particular trading period over the past five years to see what trends appeared. The average return, if you did hold these stocks over this period, is listed below. There was significant stock appreciation in four out of the last five years for this New Year period, according to the Kensho data. This helped Netflix to be the best-performing FANG stock for this timeframe. Typically, the fourth quarter of the year is one of the strongest for Netflix, with earnings in that period beating market consensus in 2011 to 2015. This often helps the stock rally and if history is anything to go by, this could help the stock, according to analysts, particularly as the company is continuing to push aggressively into new markets and ramping up content spend. In January, Netflix announced it was available in 190 countries, and recently announced its intention to spend $6 billion on content next year. It also became the top grossing app on Apple's iPhone this month and introduced an offline mode to boost the attractiveness of its mobile offering. There has been some concern that Netflix will struggle to grow its domestic subscriber base, but the video streaming service topped analyst estimates in its latest third-quarter earnings to help absolve some of those fears. Still, the factors that could help Netflix find more growth are also areas which could hold Netflix back. ""I think the competitive environment is getting very stiff, Amazon is investing heavily in original content … Netlfix has been lucky to have the string of hits but you have players with deep pockets and the potential to outbid Netflix for some content. That is the concern we have on Netflix,"" Neil Doshi, senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, told CNBC by phone. ""They haven't really shown much in the way of some of the new countries like Japan and India, these are very big markets and our concern if you can't get these right, it could limit the total addressable market."" Facebook has only traded four times in the period rather than five because it only went public in May 2012. So it's worth bearing this in mind when considering that over the New Year period, the stock is up over 8.5 percent. The social network has consistently beaten Wall Street estimates and shown strong growth, particularly as it has pivoted to mobile and video formats. This has helped its ad revenue drive higher and investors are happy. But the company warned in November that ad revenue growth will slow ""meaningfully"" in 2017 as it reaches maximum ""ad load"". This means it will be difficult for Facebook to cram more ads into the News Feed. ""Facebook's biggest quarter of the year tends to be Q4 and on a quarterly basis we are expecting over 20 percent revenue growth for the quarter. Facebook will be a solid performer in the period,"" Neil Campling, head of global technology, media, telecom research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, told CNBC by phone. Campling said that Facebook is starting to monetize the photo sharing service Instagram which it owns and this should help it continue growing. But not all analysts are convinced. Trip Chowdhry, managing director of equity research at Global Equities Research, said that he doesn't ""see any bang in FANG"" stocks generally and ""this is as good as it gets"" for Facebook which will struggle to gain more user engagement. Amazon has a tepid January on average with shares up around 1 percent. It might be surprising that given the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in November as well as the Christmas shopping period, investors might be bullish. But usually, the impact hasn't been priced in by the end of January. Investors are cautious on Amazon because they are investing heavily in new territories such as India as well as new sectors like grocery shopping. ""We don't have good insight to what's happening there if you think about areas where they are investing … I think if they are able to show good leverage on their margin side then I think the stock will show good appreciation in 2017,"" Doshi told CNBC, adding that its cloud division Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a ""bright spot"". AWS has shown very strong growth and is seen as a key part of Amazon's future. Google carried out a stock split in 2014, and has both Class A and Class C shares trading publicly. Class C shares have only been trading for the past two years, however, both sets of shares are roughly flat over the period defined. It seems investors are cautious in January over Alphabet. ""Alphabet is more tied to the ad cycles and there is nothing to suspect that Q4 will be strong, but early in the year, expectations are to set conservatively,"" Campling said. At the same time, Alphabet is investing heavily in areas from artificial intelligence to driverless cars and this is something that investors will be watching closely. Alibaba was the worst-performing stock of the New Year period and much of this is cyclical. ""Perhaps the reason why there is less attraction in January is simply because it is not affected by the western holiday season, but more focused around the Chinese new year in February,"" Campling said. Alibaba's biggest shopping period happens in November during an event known as Singles Day. And the effect of this is priced in, Campling added. Like Amazon, Alibaba is making big strides in the cloud. Last month, the Chinese e-commerce giant announced plans to increase the number of data centers it has. In its latest fiscal quarter ended September 30, Alibaba reported revenue from its cloud computing division that increased 130 percent year-on-year to $224 million. This outpaced the growth seen by Microsoft, Google, and Amazon's cloud units, and is seen as a bright spot for the company. ",Here are the best FANG stocks to own to start the new year with a bang
Anita Balakrishnan,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"After another record-busting holiday season, Amazon is set to speed past any hurdles from the new administration, technology watchers told CNBC. ""Amazon has been on fire,"" Venky Ganesan, who focuses on consumer and enterprise investments for Menlo Ventures, told CNBC's ""Squawk Alley"" on Wednesday. ""When [President-elect Donald Trump] comes into office and they look at it, they will realize that Amazon is good for America and Amazon's success is good for America,"" Ganesan said. ""You want to make America great and you want to put America first? You do that by supporting innovation and entrepreneurship and job creation, and Amazon does all of those."" Amazon's shares have risen nearly 1,400 percent since president Barack Obama took office in 2009, and hit an all-time high right before the election, as online shopping became ubiquitous. Being both a dominant channel for e-commerce and a pre-eminent cloud services provider leaves Amazon well-positioned for being the stock of the new administration as well, said Ganesan, who has portfolio companies that sell products on Amazon. While Amazon's light tax burden has been contested by red and blue states alike, Amazon has long had friends on Pennsylvania Avenue. A former Obama administration staffer has helmed Amazon's global affairs, and Obama had reportedly considered an Amazon distribution center as the site of a tax reform announcement. Trump, meanwhile, has been critical of Amazon's tax policies, He has also towed a hard line against China, where many Amazon sellers manufacture and trade goods. ""Believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems,"" Trump said at a rally in February, though his tax plan actually proposes cutting taxes for large corporations. ""They're going to have such problems."" Amazon is also a leader in data science and machine learning, Ganesan said. Evercore ISI analyst Ken Sena gave Amazon as the firm's top internet pick for next year 
. ""Amazon has shown a greater willingness to essentially take to market a lot of the advances we've seen within cloud,"" Sena told ""Squawk on the Street"" on Wednesday. ""I think if we look at something like natural language understanding, Google is probably furthest ahead of anyone in that area, but if we look at what Google has offered through Google cloud in that area, it really doesn't stack up to Amazon."" Sena said applying artificial intelligence will make new opportunities for companies like Amazon going forward, and create efficiency like matching supply and demand. ""Whether you're looking at it from the standpoint of sort of near-term practical business implications, or you're thinking longer term, in terms of addressable markets and disruption, I think everyone needs to focus on this area,"" Sena said. ","Trump will realize 'Amazon is good for America,' venture capitalist says"
Anita Balakrishnan,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"Facial recognition, computer vision and artificial intelligence may sound like creepy technology buzzwords, but they are quickly becoming a part of everyday brick-and-mortar shopping. Marketers hope these technologies can reveal what you are thinking in the crucial period between entering the store and making a purchase — that means recording everything you do and analyzing that data. Companies like Amazon already have granular data on what consumers look at, click on, and add to their carts before making a final purchase online — but when it comes to store purchases, like food, companies know less about us. That's why companies from Apple to Google have been helping retailers fill in the gaps, using shoppers' smartphone data. ""One of the things that marketers have been trying to do is get beyond the data of our keystrokes,"" said Daniel Newman, principal analyst at Futurum Research. ""Whether its cookies tracking you through a retail website or what we're talking to a friend about on Facebook."" Concerns about tracking shoppers in-store intensified this month when Amazon debuted a new automated concept store, Amazon Go. A patent filed in 2014 by the company showed how an automated checkout store could work: Cameras and other technologies would follow individual shoppers — and could identify them by their skin tone — and analyze their behavior throughout the store. It's unclear if this is the system behind Amazon Go. The company declined to comment for this story. It comes after retailers' apps have spent years trying to track users with a different technology: geolocation ""beacons"" that ping your smartphone as you visit stores. Beacons are tiny gadgets, positioned throughout the store, that can communicate with your smartphone to match your identity to your location. ""One of the side benefits of Amazon doing this in their announcement is it's going inspire retailers and consumers of what can happen when you merge technology and brick and mortars,"" said Rob Murphy, vice president of marketing at Swirl, a marketing technology company. ""This is pretty interesting and compelling, it doesn't matter if it's Amazon. I think just the very fact that they've been able to do that is going to inspire retailers to use beacons to do better experiences."" Data on your location in stores has been ""the shiny object of marketers' dreams,"" said David Bairstow, a vice president of product management at Skyhook, which helped Apple build its location services in the early iPhone days. If you've ever gotten a notification from Google to review a restaurant near where you are, or you have the app of a retailer on your phone, chances are high you've interacted with a beacon, Bairstow said. The ""dream"" is having the level of detail and knowledge to text a user a coupon while they're in the store for something they've been eyeing either on the shelf or online. Most marketers interviewed by CNBC don't see either beacons or Amazon Go as ""creepy."" But in a survey of more than 2,000 adults last year, nearly 40 percent of smartphone owners said they weren't interested in participating in beacon technology. Eight percent said they participate, 9 percent said it ""sounds great"" and they would ""love"" to participate, and the remainder was divided, according to Epsilon research cited by eMarketer. Jay Stanley of the American Civil Liberties Union's ‎speech, privacy and technology project said these technologies may test the line between ""big data"" and the personal data of individuals. ""I think the bigger issue is how people will feel knowing that every movement is being monitored and more importantly, what else is being done with the technology,"" Stanley said. ""It could be pretty powerful micro-monitoring of people's behavior on video."" While most retailers have cameras in their stores now, few have Amazon's data-crunching infrastructure to match footage to individual users, said Marc Janssens, head of retail for Fujitsu Americas, which makes many self-checkout machines. ""All of them have access to that technology. The biggest problem is legacy. The camera right now is just used for surveillance, one step away to use for analytics,"" said Janssens. ""Not everyone is Wi-Fi enabling their store, especially grocers, due to the cost of it and legacy of current system."" Stores like Macy's, American Eagle Outfitters and Sephora  have adopted beacon technology, but it hasn't caught on that widely. Nearly a quarter of retailers had implemented beacons as of February, according to Retail Systems Research cited by eMarketer. Another quarter of retailers had no plans to implement them. To get really in-depth data, retailers may need 50 or even 100 beacons in a store, and sophisticated software, which is simply too much overhead for many stores, Bairstow said. Plus, without cameras, it's hard to know what is drawing people to a location. ""It's still really hard to convert 'dwell time,' since I may be standing somewhere because I got a phone call, not because I'm more interested in that sweater,"" Bairstow said. New technology may make it easier to spread adoption of customer-tracking technology. Janssens said communicating with users' smartphones no longer requires Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and instead of downloading an app, some beacon features are now embedded in smartphone operating systems. The hardware for beacons is also becoming more subtle, integrated into light fixtures and Wi-Fi routers, said Murphy. Amazon's ideas may push that further. ""Some people talk about 'the last mile'... in retail, Bluetooth signals are really about the last aisle,"" Murphy said. ""They are typically the level of what department, what section, that's the 'aisle' level. The Amazon technology is at the item level. Every individual item in the store."" Janssens said that laws in the U.S. around privacy are much looser than in Europe, where technology like beacons or computer vision would be nearly impossible to implement. He said that laws around ID in Europe go back to World War II, but that younger generations are more comfortable with sharing identifying information with the world, especially through social media. ""I think it's more cultural. I'm not from the U.S. originally but I've lived here for 35 years. In Europe, even a tenth of what we do in America you couldn't do there,"" Janssens said.

Cheang Ming,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"The solution to the deluge of fake news online could in fact be smarter technology, according to SAP National Security Services, a U.S.-based subsidiary of enterprise software provider SAP. Mark Testoni, president of SAP National Security Services, told CNBC's ""Squawkbox"" that artificial intelligence and algorithms that identify patterns will allow social media companies, such as Facebook, to better identify fake news sites and the users who create such content. ""That's where technology offers great hope,"" he added. While fake news is not a new phenomenon, the spread of false information online has been exacerbated through the use of, ironically, algorithms. Algorithms used by Facebook and Google were criticized after they inadvertently boosted the circulation of fake news stories on the internet during the U.S. presidential election cycle this year. Testoni also said that these algorithms are already in existence and can be repurposed to target fake news sources. Algorithms that allow advertisements to target specific internet users across different websites are an example of this technology that can be used in recognizing fake news, he said. ""We've seen improvement in some cases already. Clickbait was a big issue over the last year, which is in the same area as (fake news). And through some of the algorithms, some of that has been significantly reduced,"" Testoni added. However, technology alone cannot stave off the fake news epidemic. Consumers also need to do their research to ensure that the information they are reading online is accurate, Testoni said. ""We have to be critical consumers and when we read things, we have to not only hope that others are doing fact-checking but we need to take a critical eye and do some verification on our own,"" he added.

Nyshka Chandran,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"What was television like before episodic narratives? The development of serialized content transformed traditional entertainment media and virtual reality (VR) startups are now hoping it will do the same for their market. Warrior9 is a Singapore‐based video and VR production house developing what it calls the first animated science-fiction VR series. Called 'The PhoenIX,' the show is set in space and employs a range of technologies such as motion-capture, the process of incorporating human movement into a three-dimensional model, to document mankind's race for survival against an unknown enemy. Unlike conventional animation, motion-capture experienced in VR injects a stronger dose of realism by making viewers feel like they are actually in 'The PhoenIX,' floating in space or caught in the middle of a frenetic dogfight. ""The majority of VR non-gaming content currently comprises of short films and videos. There are few things to keep you coming back. We would watch something amazing in VR like [animated film] 'Allumette' from Penrose Studios and then go hunting for something else,"" chief creative director Abhi Kumar told CNBC, explaining why his team chose to focus on episodes, instead of one-off experiences. Production of the first season—consisting of nine episodes—will wrap by end 2017 and in the meantime, a teaser will be released next month. Warrior9 hopes to make the series available on as many headsets as possible, including the mobile-friendly Google Cardboard and higher-end devices like Razer's OSVR. As VR increasingly penetrates the mainstream consciousness, with more hardware available on the market, ""the technology required to pull off such an ambitious project has finally gotten to the point where you no longer need a huge studio to create engaging visuals to go along with the story,"" noted Race Krehel, The PhoenIX's lead VR animator. Innovative storytelling is set to be the next frontier for VR, with more investors throwing their support behind content players, not just hardware makers. ""I'm very optimistic about the opportunity that content developers (in all forms, from art to culture to entertainment) will have in the VR future,"" explained Mario Valle, ‎co-founder and managing partner at Altered Ventures, a VC fund specializing in VR and augmented reality (AR). Narratives will be one of the reasons why the VR industry will shine, he added. Jaunt China, a joint venture of Silicon Valley-based Jaunt, is also focused on episodic material. Launched this year in partnership with Shanghai Media Group and China Media Capital, two of China's largest media companies, it already has several projects in the pipeline but is unable to disclose any details. ""Episodic narratives did change the game for TV…. I suspect VR will take a similar form but we may not be there yet as the art of VR storytelling is still being defined, the technologies are still being developed and the platforms are still in infancy,"" explained James Fong, CEO of Jaunt China. Because major streaming and television companies such as Netflix   and HBO have yet to announce their entry into serialized VR content, early entrants are blessed with both advantages and challenges. For Fong, running time and viewing habits are among the biggest obstacles. Most VR content is around 10–15 minutes, which isn't much time to remind audiences of backstories, develop fresh plots and a riveting ending, he said. Meanwhile, the popular trend of binge watching is hard to do in VR as people tend to get uncomfortable with tethered head-mounted displays or mobile phones encased in Cardboard after 20–30 minutes, he continued. But episodic stories are just the tip of the iceberg for the disruptive technology. Going forward, the element of interaction  could take consumer experiences to a whole other level. ""The focus will be on more narrative VR content and incorporating some form of interactivity within the narrative itself.  For example, one of the ideas that we're looking at is a 'choose your own adventure' story, where viewers can decide the outcome of key pivotal events in the storyline,"" said Warrior9's Kumar. More intricate storylines are another possibility, according to Fong. ""I believe audiences want to be amazed and mesmerized by master VR storytellers but this time, they want the storytellers to create the entire story for them to experience, enjoy and discover."" ",Episodic virtual reality content could transform consumer entertainment
"Lucy Handley, special to CNBC",12292016,CNBC,12222016,"From the Brexit campaign to Beyoncé's Super Bowl masterstroke, CNBC takes a look over the past 12 months in marketing. This didn't mean that one of the world's largest advertisers had slashed its ad budgets to zero, it meant the consumer goods giant would move away from basing budgets on previous years' spend and would instead make all departments justify their expected expenses. Its 2015 annual report stated: ""With growth…set to remain constrained for some time to come, it is even more important that we bear down on all spending areas."" Being booked to perform at the Super Bowl is great exposure for celebrities, but Beyoncé used this year's half-time show as just one piece of her marketing effort for her Formation song and tour. She released the song the day before the sporting event – her first in 14 months - and then announced her world tour with an ad that aired just after her performance. Super Bowl broadcaster CBS charged around $5 million for a 30-second ad spot at the event, but as Beyonce was a paid performer, it's unlikely she had to stump up the cash. Brands made big plays at this year's South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, with CNBC's Michelle Castillo hailing it ""the place to be for top so-called experiential marketing"". Visa, Spotify and Gatorade respectively showed off the future of digital payments, had a house party and let people make their own sports drinks, while McDonald's used VR goggles to transport people inside a Happy Meal box, where they could create their own artworks. The world's 13-largest brand, with a valuation of $80 billion, according to Millward Brown's BrandZ study, changed its packaging design to feature red discs across its four main drinks, with various colors featuring on each: regular (red), Zero (black), Light/Diet (silver) and Life (green). This is a Big Deal in marketing, because ""packaging is our most visible and valuable asset,"" according to a statement from chief marketing officer Marcos de Quinto, and is a further element of the brand's new global ""Taste the feeling"" global strapline, which replaced ""Open happiness"" in January 2016. On May 24, the European Commission ruled that the deal to create the world's largest brewer would not hurt consumer prices, paving the way for the $107 billion takeover, which shareholders backed in September. Euromonitor suggested that the biggest gain for AB InBev would be SAB Miller's African presence, where it sells lager brand Skol and local variants Hero and Balimi. While Britain's vote to leave the E.U. sparked a stock market crash, the resignation of the British prime minister David Cameron and a global fallout, the Brexit campaign was arguably impressive for its marketing simplicity, with ""Vote leave"" a snappier strapline than ""Britain stronger in Europe"". Added to this, the word ""Brexit"" became part of the vernacular much more easily than ""Bremain"". The game that ended up   distracting drivers,   luring armed robbery victims and   taking over the world was launched on July 6 and went on to make $200 million in net revenue globally in its first month. In marketing terms, it was also hailed as a transformer of retail's fortunes, as it can be used by shops to get people into malls, said analysts, while the game itself provides a potentially lucrative platform for marketers. The jury was out, with the   BrandAgility Index from PR firm Waggener Edstrom listing Samsung as the 'winner', based on online mentions by consumers, while Coca-Cola was cited by social media analyst   Sysomos as top of the list. Whichever marketing campaign triumphed, sponsors including GE, Dow, Samsung and P&G will have had to justify their $200million-plus outlay for four-year global contracts. Under Armour was also hailed as the ""best case study"" by   experts sourced by Reuters for its sponsorship of 250 sportspeople at the games, rather than shelling out to be an official Worldwide Olympic Partner. September came around and with it the launch of the iPhone 7 in San Francisco, but over on the other side of the Atlantic, a much smaller marketing story was bubbling up. Mysterious model Louise Delage clocked up nearly 65,000 Instagram followers in around a month, chilling on a yacht with a glass of wine, posing on a beach with a beer and drinking champagne in a bath. At the end of the month, French charity Addict Aide revealed that it was actually a fake account, to highlight alcohol addiction. The campaign got widespread press coverage and nearly a million views on YouTube. WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell has called Google a ""frenemy,"" but this year he estimated the marketing group would spend $5.6 to $5.7 billion on ads with the site, by far its biggest spend on behalf of its clients, compared with $4 billion in 2015. ""Number two would be Murdoch, around $2.25 billion,"" he told CNBC at London's Festival of Marketing in October, referring to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp brands. Google and Facebook are set to continue their dominance of online ad budgets, taking 71 percent of media money by 2020, according to OC&C Strategy Consultants. Trash bag maker Hefty advertised across major political news sites in the days ahead of the election in a bid to bring ""relief"" from the political ads that Americans ""hate,"" according to a report in the New York Times. ""It's kind of like everybody's sick of this conversation and the low trashy depths that this election has gone to,"" said Jason Peterson, chief creative officer of Havas North America, which runs Hefty's advertising. It wasn't the only brand trying to sooth emotions during the presidential campaigns; painkiller Excedrin used the message ""Debates bring headaches; Excedrin brings fast headache relief,"" during the final TV debate. YouTube released its most watched ads of the year on December 7, with Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Arnold's Fight"" ad for smartphone game Mobile Strike the most watched of the year. One of five ads on YouTube's list that was first aired at the Super Bowl, it has now had nearly 103 million views. Eighty-one percent ""watch time"" of the five Super Bowl ads on the list was via smartphone, with more than 205 million combined views. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Justina Crabtree,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"The holiday shopping season is well underway, though both crowds in-store and an onslaught of e-mails trumpeting the latest deals can quickly eclipse shoppers' festive cheer. Thankfully, CNBC is on hand to run through the top ways retailers could make the shopping experience a little easier – or more exciting – in the coming year. The beacon and geolocation technology that catapulted Nintendo's ""Pokemon GO"" game to success this summer could help stores better connect with consumers. ""In retail, discounting has become so ubiquitous … that it has lost all meaning,"" said Catherine Cottney, manager of trends at market research firm Mintel. But, building on the ""Pokemon GO"" spirit of ""urgency and playfulness,"" retailers would do well to introduce location and time sensitive discounts ""in response to everything from the weather to political or cultural events to engage consumers through some unscheduled serendipity,"" Cottney said in a press release detailing key European consumer trends for the coming year. Helping to facilitate consumers' potential to ""catch"" the best deals is Swirl, a Boston-based firm which provides in-store mobile marketing technology for retailers. One of the company's mission statements is to help retailers ""take advantage of proximity marketing,"" Rebecca Schuette, director of marketing at the firm, told CNBC via telephone. Shoppers could – via ""audience providers"" such as Facebook or Twitter – receive personalized messages and offers based on their proximity to a particular branch, Schuette detailed. This is enabled by geo-location technology built into smartphones. Android is leading the way, with ""Google the first major audience partner implementing this on a massive scale,"" Schuette explained. Swirl's clients include iconic department store Lord & Taylor and hipster clothing retailer Urban Outfitters. According to Schuette, 2016 was the year stores ""moved from pilot schemes to national implementation,"" a process which looks set to have legs in the coming year. Consumers are turning from hard cash to new payment options in larger than ever numbers. With alternative payment options set to become more efficient and innovative in 2016, ""it'll just be a movement of the wrist,"" Cottney told CNBC via telephone. Mintel's research found that 30 percent of U.K. consumers already feel comfortable about a completely cashless society, whilst 29 percent of those surveyed said that it was more convenient to make purchases using a smartphone above other payment methods. U.K.-based salad outlet Tossed was among the first of its kind to launch completely cashless stores earlier this year. Founder Vincent McKevitt told CNBC that ultimately, ""people like interacting with computers,"" adding that during its first day of operation, one of his cashless outlets served 400 customers with only one person being turned away for not having an alternative form of payment. ""Our phones are still our number one piece of tech,"" he explained, ""they won't be gone for a long time."" Wearable technology is capitalizing on the growing appetite for cashlessness however, with FitBit working on embedding such technology into its devices. But, with payments potentially requiring a little less thought in the future, the market gap for platforms which enable better money management is also widening. Take Monzo, for instance, a mobile spending platform which incorporates a Mastercard value-added card and smartphone app. Users receive push notifications when purchases are made, which can be categorized as, say, alcohol or eating out. ""I like how Monzo tracks my spending without any extra effort,"" one user told CNBC. While the idea may seem like simple common sense, interest in the platform has been significant. Bailey Kursar, head of marketing at Monzo, told CNBC via telephone that the VC-funded start-up has a waiting list of 10-20 thousand people at any given time. ""People are amazed by its functionality,"" she said, adding that the firm intends to launch a current account next year and expects 100,000 of customers to be using this by the end of 2017. Taking money management to a new extreme, however, is Pavlok, a firm which links its smartphone app to a wristband – with the power to electric shock users each time they indulge in a bad habit such as overspending. The company's website claims that more than 30,000 have been sold. 2017 will be the year ""people increasingly speak to brands as easily and informally as they would with their friends,"" Cottney said in Mintel's press release. Employment of platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Snapchat and WhatsApp could enable them to better integrate with consumers' lives. According to Mintel's research, 59 percent of Italian consumers surveyed said that they would like to be able to contact consumer service through an instant messenger. In other European countries including France, Germany and the U.K., the popularity of similar platforms fell at roughly a quarter of those asked. Shop Direct, the U.K.-based online retailer behind littlewoods.com and very.co.uk, launched the Very Assistant earlier last month, a chatbot within its app designed to respond to customers' queries in a question and answer messaging format. The company intends to develop this into an Artificial Intelligence-fueled platform for release next year. Jonathan Wall, Shop Direct's eCommerce director, told CNBC via telephone that the company's focus was ""helping customers to find products in a personalized way."" Demonstrating consumers' hunger for personalized communication, Wall said that the Very Assistant has been used over 75,000 times since its launch, and the company's iOS app has risen from a 4.5 star rating to a full 5 star score. In a similar vein, earlier this year Dutch airline KLM enabled customers to receive crucial flight details via Facebook Messenger, whereas even General Electric and Goldman Sachs are on Snapchat. By way of explaining the trend, Mintel finds that 43 percent of consumers in the Republic of Ireland, as well as 41 percent in Northern Ireland, said that raising issues with a company via social media is more effective than contacting it directly. ""Brands (can) offer consumers more reassurance,"" Cottney said, though she also added that they may face issues maintaining the ""highest expectations yet"" of customer service.

Anita Balakrishnan,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"Picking a bushel of bananas at the grocery store or throwing your trash in the nearest bin are banal tasks for most people. But for Candice Jordan, who is visually impaired, the ability to do these tasks independently has brought tears to her eyes. Jordan is one of 200 blind or visually impaired people who is testing Aira, an app that connects users to visual interpreting services. ""I guess I would describe it as magical,"" Jordan said. ""Now, I can walk into a mall and instead of having to find a security guard, or find a kiosk desk, I can walk into the mall, click on Aira and say, 'Hi, what stores are in my vicinity, what stores do you see?'"" Here's how Aira works: The visually impaired user opens the app or presses a button on their glasses, which calls one of 15 trained agents. With the help of a special dashboard, an agent can see the users' surroundings either through smart glasses or a phone camera. The agent can then verbally walk the user through what's around them and answer questions. The users have an hourlong information session with agents when they adopt Aira. These sessions help personalize instructions (does the user prefer ""slightly to the right"" or ""2 o'clock"") and preferences (instead of reading a whole menu verbatim, the agent will know if Jordan loves seafood or is allergic to peanuts.) Aira can also order from Amazon, give reviews from Yelp and hail Ubers. Jordan said Aira's agents have given her the freedom to do things she could never do with a cane alone, or even with her guide dog, Austria. Jordan recently traveled to Washington, D.C., where she said she was able to move beyond getting from point A to point B and enjoy Aira's description of the trees, sights and sounds of the area. Aira also allowed Jordan to do much simpler tasks and enjoy small conveniences and serendipitous moments that she hasn't had since she lost her vision at age 21. Instead of putting all her trash in her backpack on her recent trip, the agent mentioned a trash can in Jordan's field of vision, something that would have been needlessly time consuming to find with a cane. When walking through New York City's Penn Station, Aira was able to guide her through a crowd that Austria would have shied from. And instead of sending a courier or store associate to get her bananas, she can now pick herself the ripest bunch. ""I didn't even know that basil came in a tube now, until the agent described everything on the shelf,"" Jordan said. The real-time streaming conversation with the agents is something that couldn't have existed five years ago, but works now thanks to advances in wearable technology and wireless bandwidth, said Aira CEO Suman Kanuganti. The company has done about 2,000 sessions with blind people, and is already working on a Siri-like artificial intelligence to help supplement the service as it scales. Eventually, artificial intelligence and computer vision will be able to use indoor navigation technology to map out a users' most common routes, and even automatically guide users to the curb when they hail a car, Kanuganti said. With advisors such as Google's John Lee, Aira is backed by venture capital firms like Lux Capital and Arch Venture Partners, and individuals like Benchmark's Scott Belsky. It is also exploring the possibility of getting Aira covered by insurance. The company is in the process of raising more funding. Kanuganti said Aira may expand some day to help other groups like the elderly or those with autism. Kanuganti said he's inspired to keep pushing Aira forward thanks to visually impaired friends who inspired the company, including serial entrepreneur Larry Bock, who invested in Aira before he died this year. ""Fundamentally approaching day-to-day stuff that we take for granted an applying that information is not something that companies are doing. That's where our investors get excited,"" Kanuganti said.

Image source: Google. Google is the dominant online search engine nearly everywhere in the world except China. China just so happens to be the largest internet population in the world, but censorship laws in the country prevent the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company from operating how it would like to there. In its absence, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has built a commanding position, modeling itself off of the global leader in search. Investors may look to Baidu for the significant growth opportunities that still lie ahead for it as China transitions from 3G mobile internet speeds to 4G and more consumers come online. But the steady growth of Google and its larger global presence may present a better buy right now. Let's take a look at how they compare. Baidu is a much smaller company than Alphabet with a market capitalization of $57 billion compared to $555 billion. And it was growing revenue relatively quickly as it rapidly brought on more advertising customers and its active user count increased. However, over the last year, revenue growth slowed to a crawl as it has gone back and validated all of its advertisers, weeding out some bad apples. Last quarter, Baidu's total revenue declined 0.7% year over year. If you exclude the impact of Qunar, the online travel search engine it sold its stake in earlier this year, revenue grew a modest 6.7% year over year last quarter. Over the trailing 12 months, Baidu's revenue grew just 3%. Baidu does expect revenue growth to return next year as it finishes validating its advertisers. Still, the company has experienced slowing revenue growth for several years now. By comparison, Alphabet's revenue grew 14% over the last year. In fact, the company's revenue growth is accelerating. During the third quarter, Alphabet reported 23% revenue growth on a constant currency basis, up from 21% growth the year before. Most importantly, Alphabet's revenue growth has remained relatively steady over the last several years even as it's become one of the largest revenue generators in the world. Google's parent company is also better at turning its revenue into profits. Alphabet's profit margin through the first nine months of 2016 was 22%. Baidu posted a profit margin of just 14%. Again, Baidu has the potential to improve margins if and when its current investments in its varied market opportunities pay off. Sales, marketing, general, and administrative expenses amounted to 32% of Baidu's revenue in the third quarter. Alphabet, by comparison, spent just 20% of revenue on SG&A expenses last quarter. Analysts currently expect Baidu to grow earnings per share 33% next year. That's slightly better than expectations for Alphabet, which is anticipated to grow 19%. But where analysts expect Alphabet to continue growing at a fairly steady 19% clip over the next five years, they see Baidu's earnings declining an average of 2% per year over the next five years. Despite the poor long-term outlook for Baidu, investors are still giving it a premium price. Shares currently trade for 29 times next year's earnings expectations. By comparison, Alphabet shares trade for just 19 times next year's earnings expectations. Baidu's sales are slightly discounted to Alphabet's with a price-to-sales ratio of 4.7, compared to 5.3 for Alphabet. But with Baidu's slowing sales growth, the discount ought to be much bigger. The relatively cheap valuation of Alphabet combined with its steady revenue growth and higher profit margin make it a better buy right now than Baidu. Baidu has a lot of potential, but as it transitions out its advertiser validation, it needs to prove it can attract more legitimate advertisers to its platform and grow their average spend. Alphabet just needs to keep doing what it's doing. ","

In a new report from consumer research company Nielsen, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) dominance stands out in a list of 2016's most popular mobile apps in the U.S. But the list also highlights some key takeaways about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Here's a look at the Nielsen's top 10 apps of 2016, along with four observations. Image source: Getty Images. In line with Facebook's recent impressive global growth in monthly active users, the world's largest social network's user base continued to grow handsomely in the company's home U.S. market. Facebook's average monthly active users (MAUs) in the U.S. during 2016 increased 14%, according to Nielsen. Facebook's Messenger also performed exceptionally, raking in 28% year-over-year growth and coming in second only to Facebook's own native app. Messenger's success follows a year of big investments in the messaging app, including live video, messaging bots, and business integrations. Messenger's 28% growth in U.S. MAUs doesn't necessarily come as a surprise, considering Facebook's global Messenger MAUs increased from 700 million in the third quarter of 2015 to over 1 billion by July. Instagram. Image source: Instagram. And Facebook's Instagram was a smash hit in 2016, too. Coming in at number eight on Nielsen's list, the photo- and video-sharing app saw its U.S. MAUs increase 36%. Further, not only was Facebook's growth notable, but both Facebook and Messenger's 146 million MAUs and 130 million MAUs, respectively, were still well ahead of third-place YouTube's 114 million MAUs. Google parent company Alphabet continues to shine in terms of the quantity of Google-branded apps making it into Nielsen's top 10, highlighting Alphabet's robust ecosystem of apps for simultaneously serving its customers and generating data for its advertisers. Alphabet's YouTube, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Play, and Gmail all made Nielsen's top-10 list. While streaming music company Spotify continues to outperform Apple Music when it comes to paying members across the globe, Apple Music is winning in the U.S. when it comes to unique monthly visitors to the streaming music app. In a nod to the continued success of Apple's streaming music service, Apple Music was number nine on Nielsen's list, clocking a notable 20% year-over-year uptick in monthly active users. Spotify didn't make the list. This data reflects recent updates about Apple Music from the tech giant. The streaming service's paying subscribers recently surpassed 20 million, Apple said earlier this month. This is up considerably from 10 million in January. Amazon mobile app. Image source: Amazon. Thanks to its monstrous 43% growth in monthly active users, Amazon's shopping app made a surprising entrance to Nielsen's top-10 list this year. The app's inclusion in Nielsen's top 10 apps shows how successfully the company has been riding the e-commerce wave in the wake of rising mobile adoption. Amazon's own data about global usage of its shopping app during the peak holiday season points to a similar trend. Shopping on the company's free mobile Amazon app increased by 56% during this important period, according to an update from the company this week. These observations reinforce how Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon consistently earn customer attention. ","

Staying relevant through constant innovation and disruption is more important in the tech industry than in arguably any other sector. By investing heavily in research and development (R&D), these companies are making expensive bets on the future and what technology and trends will lead it -- along with their own sales and profits. Image source: Getty Images. To compile this list, we looked at the total dollar amount that publicly traded tech companies have each spent on R&D over the past year. There are many companies investing heavily in R&D, both by real dollar amount and also relative to their own market cap., but here are the six companies that stood out as shaping the future based on how much they have invested, and will probably continue to do so, to be the ones at the forefront of future development. Data source: Capital IQ It's not surprising that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) tops the list as the biggest investor in the in the world in terms of R&D spend. Alphabet's willingness to spend heavily on research into areas such as self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and wearable technology such as Google Glass and connected clothing shows how the company is working to assure it has a place in the world far beyond the internet search that currently makes up the vast majority of its revenue. Alphabet's recent restructuring to make Google one segment of the overall company was specifically designed to allow the company to continue making audacious moonshot bets. Alphabet's self-driving car project, now called Waymo. Image source: Alphabet/Waymo. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced that it will release a device to compete in the smart-home space. Powered by its Cortana voice-enabled artificial intelligence platform, this device will compete directly with similar products such as Google Home.

It's yet to be seen how Microsoft's recent acquisition of LinkedIn will fully play out, but you can expect that it links up with some of the areas Microsoft has been investing heavily in already. Intel, Oracle, and Cisco Systems are each working hard to keep their industry-dominating positions from younger and more fast-paced companies within the microprocessor, graphic chip, and computing network space. These three behemoth companies have been building and developing infrastructure for cloud computing, internet security, and other digital-age network services that require new technology far beyond what their own technology could handle in years past. Building and preparing for these big growth trends in such a fast-moving segment of the IT industry will like drive higher R&D spending in these companies for years to come. Finally, there's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). This company has been the focus of much analysis in the past few years for not releasing enough new and astonishing tech, so much so that many of those analysts have questioned if Apple's growth days are behind it. However, the company is one of the biggest investors in R&D, seemingly going after the connected-car market, artificial intelligence, or other long-term investments such as building much more comprehensive software platforms. What makes Apple especially interesting is that it's by far the wealthiest company on the list by total cash value, which was a record of nearly $238 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in its most recent quarter. That's more than double the cash of second-place Microsoft, with $117 billion. If those numbers don't already look massive enough, they could get bigger in the coming years. Apple's $238 billion in cash? The vast majority of that amount is stored offshore, where Apple is holding it because the company doesn't want to pay the around 35% corporate tax to repatriate it back to the United States. As part of a tax system overhaul, President-elect Donald Trump has said he seeks to lower this corporate tax rate and could even provide a special 10% tax for companies that are seeking to repatriate a huge chunk of cash back to the States. The richest companies in the U.S., then, including many of the companies in the preceding list, would probably then repatriate much of that cash and could put the money to work in increased R&D spending. Like much of the potential changes coming to corporate tax or other policy, there's no telling when this might happen, what the final numbers will be, how much each of that overseas cash each company would bring back, or what the companies will do with the money. Still, either way, these companies and many like them are likely to continue spending heavily on researching and developing the next wave of new technology that will drive their industries in the years ahead -- something that long-term investors won't want to miss.

    6 Tech Companies Investing Billions in Their Future -- The Motley Fool

The easy answer is that the limit for IRA contributions set by the IRS is $5,500 for the 2017 tax year, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution allowed if you're over 50. However, there's a little more to the story. Specifically, your ability to contribute might be limited, and you don't need to contribute the entire amount during 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Inflation has been relatively low in recent years, so it shouldn't be a big surprise that the IRA contribution limits have not changed since the 2013 tax year. 2017 will be the fifth consecutive year where IRA contributions are capped at $5,500, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution allowance for savers age 50 and above. Year IRA Contribution Limit Catch-Up Contribution Limit 2017 $5,500 $1,000 2016 $5,500 $1,000 2015 $5,500 $1,000 2014 $5,500 $1,000 2013 $5,500 $1,000 2012 $5,000 $1,000 Data source: Internal Revenue Service. You can make your IRA contribution for 2017 as a lump sum, or you can contribute a little at a time. One suggestion is to make equal monthly contributions, or have your IRA contributions automatically debited from your bank account to coincide with your paychecks. For example, if you're under 50 and get paid every two weeks, an IRA contribution of $211.54 per paycheck would translate to $5,500 for the year. If you get paid at a different frequency, simply divide $5,500 (or $6,500) by the number of paychecks you'll get in 2017. There are two basic types of IRA: traditional and Roth. You can read a full discussion of how to choose the best IRA for you here, but for now, the important difference are the tax implications of each account type. In addition to the tax benefits, there are some other compelling reasons to choose a Roth IRA. For example, Roth contributions may be withdrawn penalty-free at anytime, and there is no required minimum distribution rule like with other retirement accounts. The downside is that the ability to contribute directly to a Roth IRA is subject to income limitations. Here they are for 2017, broken down by tax filing status: Tax Filing Status AGI Limit for Full Contribution Partial Contribution Allowed No Contribution Single/head of household $118,000 $118,000-$132,999 $133,000 or more Married filing jointly $186,000 $186,000-$195,999 $196,000 or more Married filing separately $0 $0-$9,999 $10,000 or more Data source: IRS. All figures are adjusted gross income (AGI). It's also worth noting that if you can't directly contribute to a Roth IRA, you can still contribute to a traditional IRA and convert your IRA to a Roth. This is known as the ""backdoor"" Roth contribution method. Unlike a Roth IRA, everyone can contribute to a traditional IRA, regardless of income. However, not everyone qualifies for the tax deduction, which is the biggest incentive to contribute to a traditional IRA in the first place. The good news is that if you're not eligible to participate in a retirement plan at work, your ability to take a traditional IRA deduction is not limited unless your spouse is covered by an employer's plan. In this case, if your combined AGI is less than $186,000, you can take a full IRA deduction. If you earn more than this, but less than $196,000, you are eligible for a partial deduction. On the other hand, if you are eligible for a retirement plan at work, your ability to take a traditional IRA deduction is limited to significantly lower income levels. Tax Filing Status Deduction Phase-Out Range Single/head of household $62,000-$72,000 Married filing jointly $99,000-$119,000 Married filing separately $0-$10,000 Data source: IRS. Finally, a nice feature of the IRS's laws regarding IRA contributions is the extended time window to make contributions. You can make contributions for a given tax year anytime before that year's regular tax deadline in April. For example, the deadline to file a 2016 tax return is April 18, 2017, so you can make IRA contributions for the 2016 tax year until that date. The point is that while the $5,500 contribution limit is an ""annual"" maximum, you actually have about 15 and a half months to make your contributions for any given year. So, even if you're reading this in early 2017, you can still take advantage of the tax benefits of IRA investing for both the 2016 and 2017 tax years. ","
      
    IRA Contribution Limits in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Minimum wage laws have been a major political issue recently. Proponents of higher wages argue that they're necessary to provide for basic living expenses, and many have called for increases to as much as $15 per hour. Opponents, meanwhile, point to the potential impact of higher labor costs on the businesses that employ the most minimum wage workers. State legislatures have responded across the nation, and currently, 21 states are slated to put 2017 minimum wage increases into effect at some point during the coming year. Let's look at the list to see what stands out among these minimum-wage boosts. State 2016 Minimum Wage 2017 Minimum Wage Alaska $9.75 $9.80 Arizona $8.05 $10 Arkansas $8 $8.50 California $10 $10.50 Colorado $8.31 $9.30 Connecticut $9.60 $10.10 Florida $8.05 $8.10 Hawaii $8.50 $9.25 Maine $7.50 $9 Maryland $8.75 $9.25 Massachusetts $10 $11 Michigan $8.50 $8.90 Missouri $7.65 $7.70 Montana $8.05 $8.15 New Jersey $8.38 $8.44 New York $9 $9.70 Ohio $8.10 $8.15 Oregon $9.75 $10.25 South Dakota $8.55 $8.65 Vermont $9.60 $10 Washington $9.47 $11 Not all changes take effect on Jan. 1, and minimum wages can be higher in certain locations and/or for certain industries. Data source: CNN. Economic Policy Institute. The first thing that you'll see from the list above is that not all minimum wage increases are very significant. Four states -- Alaska, Florida, Missouri, and Ohio -- are raising their minimum wages by just $0.05 per hour, while two more -- Montana and South Dakota -- are seeing just a $0.10-per-hour boost. New Jersey splits the difference with a $0.06-per-hour rise. These increases all have ties to changes in the rate of inflation, with most states choosing to link their minimum wages to rises in one of the Consumer Price Index data series. Most of the states that use these systems round the increase to the nearest nickel, but New Jersey stands out with precise wage rates to the penny. On the other hand, some states are making truly massive increases to the minimum wage all at once. Arizona will see the biggest boost, with a rise of $1.95 per hour adding nearly 25% to the labor costs of minimum wage employers. Boosts of $1 or more per hour will also take place in Massachusetts and Washington state. Image source: Getty Images. Moreover, many states are in the process of multiyear increases to the minimum wage. Arizona's move is just the first in a series that will push the wage to $12 per hour by 2020. California has even more ambitious plans, with annual increases of $0.50 next year to be followed by $1 per hour raises in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, bringing the state to the $15 mark. New York State's $0.70 per hour move is just the first in a series of five hikes that will lift minimum wages there to $12.50 per hour. Even so, there are still a large number of holdouts among the states. Five states have no minimum wage laws at all, relying on the federal minimum wage to cover their workers. Another 15 states either have outdated minimum wage laws that are less than the current $7.25 per hour federal amount or match the federal law exactly. In those areas, it's likely to take federal legislation to move the needle for minimum wage workers. Although calls to raise the minimum wage at the federal level have gotten louder in recent years, labor activists have been much more successful in spurring local action in states where the political environment is friendlier to the cause. For those who earn the minimum wage, any boost to pay can be a game changer, and those who live in the states listed above will celebrate the pay raises they get. Nevertheless, the debate over whether minimum wage increases are positive or negative for the economy as a whole is likely to continue not just in 2017 but for years to come. ","
      
    2017 Minimum Wage Increases: These 21 States Are Paying Workers More -- The Motley Fool

Medicare covers more than 57 million Americans, providing the healthcare coverage they need. Every year, though, the cost of Medicare typically goes up, and the program passes through those increases to its participants in the form of higher premiums, deductibles, and other expenses. Below, we'll look at the changes that are slated to take effect for Medicare in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Most Medicare participants get hospital insurance coverage under Part A without paying a premium. However, for those who didn't collect enough credits for paying Medicare taxes during their career and don't have a qualifying spouse, Medicare charges a monthly premium of up to $413 per month. That's $2 higher than the maximum amount for 2016. In addition, deductibles and coinsurance payments for hospital coverage under Part A will also go up in 2017. The table below describes the amounts for the initial deductible, as well as the coinsurance amounts depending on length of stay. Type of Cost 2017 Cost (Change From 2016) Hospital deductible $1,316 (up $28) Coinsurance for days 61-90 of hospital stay $329 (up $7) Coinsurance for days 91 and beyond of hospital stay using lifetime reserve days $658 (up $14) Coinsurance for skilled nursing facility stays $164.50 (up $3.50) Data source: Medicare.gov. Medical care coverage under Medicare Part B will also see cost increases in 2017. The deductible that you have to pay on doctors' visits and other outpatient services goes up to $183 per year in 2017, climbing $17 from 2016. In addition, unlike Part A, Part B always comes with a monthly premium. The standard Part B premium amount is slated to go to $134 per month in 2017, up $12.20 from the corresponding amount of $121.80 in 2016. The complication, though, is that most participants didn't pay $121.80 in 2016, and they won't pay $134 in 2017 either because of a special rule linking Social Security and Medicare. In 2016, there was no cost-of-living increase for Social Security recipients, and the hold-harmless provision of Medicare therefore kicked in and prevented an increase from the 2015 Part B monthly premium of $104.90 for those who had their premiums taken directly from their Social Security checks. That makes up more than two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries, but the remaining roughly 30% saw their premiums go up to $121.80. Finally, those who are considered high-income individuals have to pay more than the standard amount in Part B premiums. The chart below gives the premiums for various income levels in 2017: Data source: Medicare.gov. These figures are up between $17 and $38.80 per month from 2016 levels. Moreover, higher-income individuals aren't eligible for the hold-harmless provision, and so even if they have their Medicare premiums taken directly from their Social Security benefits, they'll still end up having to pay the higher amounts. For retirees living on a fixed income, any additional cost for Medicare can be hard to deal with. Even though rules like the hold-harmless provision protect some Medicare recipients, everyone who relies on Medicare will have to plan for at least some potential cost increases that will hit their pocketbooks in 2017.

Estimote's vision of future retail stores covered in iBeacons. Image source: Estimote. In 2013, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled a technology that had the potential to revolutionize brick-and-mortar retail: iBeacon. The protocol was built on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and promised to enable micro-location tracking in a way that offered far more accuracy than traditional GPS or the assisted GPS in modern smartphones. We're talking about being able to tell what specific aisle a customer is perusing, and being able to market to that customer accordingly. At the time, Apple was rumored to be working on mobile payments -- what we now know as Apple Pay -- and the idea of micro-locations combined with mobile payments was like a futuristic dream for retailers. Imagine offering a targeted coupon or discount to a customer based on micro-location and then prompting them to pay on the spot with a smartphone. Third-party companies like Estimote even sprouted up to make and sell beacons using iBeacon. Following a pilot program, Macy's said in 2014 that it would roll out beacon technology nationwide. Major League Baseball uses beacons to make ballparks more interactive in numerous ways. Even a few local grocery stores tried deploying them for the same retail reasons. So, what happened? For starters, Apple hasn't really done much over the years to promote the protocol in a meaningful way. In fact, it never really did. iBeacon was little more than a footnote during WWDC 2013, and wasn't even mentioned during WWDC 2014. The lack of meaningful support or promotion from Apple certainly didn't help, which may be attributable to the company shifting its developmental focus on near-field communication (NFC), which Apple Pay is built on. NFC and iBeacons aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, but like most technologies, supporting numerous protocols adds to costs for those interested in commercial deployments. Apple has seemingly ceased ongoing development and support as well. For instance, in its iBeacon for Developers page, the Getting Started (link opens PDF) guide is from 2014. It's also not as if Apple ever made any iBeacons directly, although all iOS devices are capable of becoming an iBeacon transmitters; it just detailed and released the protocol, leaving the fate of the technology in the hands of third parties. This lack of ongoing support and development also means that some of the initial challenges largely went unaddressed. In order to use iBeacons, users need to 1. download a retailer's app, 2. allow the app's notifications to be enabled, 3. make sure Bluetooth is turned on, and 4. enable location services for that app as well. After that, the interaction should add value to the customer's experience in some way. Most iBeacon deployments failed in some or all of these areas. Many users turn off one or more of those functionalities in order to improve battery life, for example. iBeacons also never integrated with the plethora of enterprise IT systems that companies use for point-of-sale (POS), inventory tracking, loyalty programs, marketing campaigns, or other types of analytics. That either severely limits the value from the perspective of a retailer or significantly adds to the costs of deployment if the retailer needs to build a system from scratch. Cybersecurity is only getting more complex, and iBeacons had weak security and privacy controls in place. It's entirely possible that these weaknesses could have been overcome, but that's up to Apple. It's also not as if there's much competition in micro-location technologies that would spur Apple into action. Alphabet's Google released Eddystone in 2015, its own BLE-based beacon protocol, but like with Apple, it's pretty low on the priority list. You'd think that Google would take it more seriously, since beacons are primarily positioned as supplementary marketing tools. Last I checked, Google's business is still built on advertising. Mobile chip giant Qualcomm released its own Gimbal platform shortly after Apple in 2013, but has since spun it off into a separate company. Beacon technologies aren't quite dead, though. Target deployed a pilot program just last year in 50 locations. But unless the major platform operators really get behind the technology, all pilot programs will likely suffer the same unfortunate fate. ","

GoPro Inc's (NASDAQ:GPRO) stock has fallen so far over the past year that management has to be thinking about what the company's future looks like, and competitors may be wondering if an acquisition might make sense. In many ways, a buyout could be a win-win for GoPro and a potential buyer. GoPro comes with no debt and a great brand, and the right buyer could make GoPro's products more usable for consumers. Looking at the landscape for cameras, drones, and action sports, Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ:GRMN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and DJI are three logical buyers for the company. Image source: Getty Images. Garmin is one company that's tried to move into GoPro's market with its own action camera. The move makes some sense given Garmin's position as a standard in GPS and watches for athletes, but it's still a stretch, and there's no indication the company is going to gain significant market share. Buying GoPro would give Garmin a great brand and leading market position in cameras, but it could also integrate well into its other products. Smartwatches are now able to connect with GoPro cameras (although it's a difficult process), and Garmin could integrate its own smartwatches with GoPro cameras. For action sports users in particular, it would make a lot more sense to push a physical button on a watch to take a picture than trying to tap a touch screen on an Apple Watch. Garmin's watches and GoPro's cameras are going after the same customer base, and if they had some integration, there could be a lot of cross-selling opportunities. And that makes Garmin a good fit for GoPro. GoPro is trying, and failing, to do a lot of the things Apple does well on its own platform. GoPro is trying to make it easier to transfer content from cameras to the cloud, edit photos and videos, and share them. Why not sell to Apple, a company that does all of those things extremely well? The acquisition could follow along the lines of Beats by Dre, which was an adjacent market for Apple but fit nicely with its focus on music. GoPro would augment the focus on photos and video but bring a more action-oriented product to the lineup. It would also be interesting to see what Apple could do with GoPro's products and technology. Apple has been rumored to be working on virtual reality, and GoPro has a leading VR capture camera setup in its lineup. Drones could even be of interest, although GoPro hasn't done particularly well in the drone business. Apple doesn't make a lot of acquisitions, but the strong brand of GoPro and products that line up well with the company's photo and video focus could be a nice fit. And the $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion check Apple would have to write for the company wouldn't even make a dent in its balance sheet. When GoPro came out with a drone, it was taking aim at DJI, the world's drone leader that designed GoPro out of its drones a couple of years ago. But GoPro's drone (literally) crashed, and DJI's position on top of that market has been solidified. Where DJI doesn't have a big presence is in stand-alone cameras, but it would like to get there. DJI has built a suite of camera and stabilization products aimed at high-end photographers and videographers, but they're not very mass market. Adding GoPro's products, and the brand, could open up a new set of customers and fill out the product line. DJI could also choose to wait for GoPro to continue stumbling, but the risk is that GoPro will eventually build a drone system that's a real competitor to DJI. That may not be a risk worth taking. Given GoPro's struggles to generate consistent revenue and earnings and the competitive pressures on all of its product lines, it may be time for GoPro to consider looking at a buyout. The company would be an attractive asset for some purchasers, and it may take the pressure that comes with being a public company off of its operations, opening up new opportunities for innovation. Time will tell if management eventually agrees. ","

Before you can make an investment, you'll need to open a brokerage account to place your trades. The choices are numerous, but today we'll compare two popular brokerages, E*Trade and Robinhood, so that investors can better understand how their services might match up with their investment portfolios. One broker, Robinhood, offers free stock trading, but the other, E*Trade, offers more access to other types of investments. Let's take a deeper look. Cost is but one consideration when deciding on a broker. We put together the table below to show you how E*Trade and Robinhood compare on the basis of commission costs for various types of trades. Broker Stocks/Options ETFs Mutual funds E*Trade $6.95 per trade + $0.75 per options contract* $6.95 per trade* $19.99 per purchase (some are commission free) Robinhood Commission free (free options trading launches in 2018) Commission free Not available Source: Company websites. *Note that E*Trade customers can qualify for commissions as low as $4.95 per trade ($0.50 per options contract) if they place more than 30 trades per quarter. The differences in trading costs are pretty big, due to the fact that E*Trade charges commissions on each trade and Robinhood does not. However, E*Trade also offers access to more types of investments (options and mutual funds) that are not available to Robinhood customers. If price is of particular importance, continue on. The gap in commissions isn't as large as it may seem. Investors can generally avoid some commissions and transaction fees by buying and selling ETFs and mutual funds that are designated as commission-free or no-transaction-fee (NTF). Broker Commission-free ETFs NTF Mutual funds E*Trade 157 (WisdomTree, Deutsche Bank, and Global X) 4,400+ Robinhood All ETFs None Source: Company websites. Notably, Robinhood doesn't charge a commission on any trades, and that also applies to ETFs. However, it doesn't offer the ability to invest in mutual funds. E*Trade waives commissions on a select list of ETFs in addition to no-transaction-fee investments on more than 4,400 mutual funds. Ultimately, depending on the funds you want to invest in, either broker may win out in this category. You don't need to be rich to open a brokerage account. Robinhood does not have a minimum initial deposit requirement, whereas E*Trade requires that its customers deposit at least $500 to get started. Realistically, investors may want to start with more than the bare minimum. For practical purposes, to actually make an investment, you'll need to have enough capital to buy at least one share of a stock, ETF, or mutual fund and cover the commission cost. Furthermore, we should note that brokerages often reward their customers for making larger deposits. Learn more about special offers for IRA accounts, as well as traditional brokerage accounts. These bonuses and commission-free trades can be worth as much as $2,000 or more, so it pays to see if you qualify. We at The Motley Fool firmly believe in the principles of making long-term investments for years, rather than days or weeks. For long-term investors like us, the important thing is that we can just make a trade when we need to, and virtually any trading platform can handle that basic requirement. Much like debates over the best superheroes, we tend to think personal preference and opinion underlie preference for a trading platform. There is just one important difference between E*Trade and Robinhood that may be important to you: Robinhood is a mobile-only platform, which may be a roadblock for people who don't have, or do not want to use, a smartphone or tablet to manage their investments. Image source: Getty Images. If you want to diversify your portfolio with foreign stocks, E*Trade and Robinhood both allow for some limited investments in international companies. E*Trade customers can trade American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), but the brokerage does not allow for trading directly on foreign markets. Robinhood allows investors to trade certain foreign-domiciled securities. Its clients can buy ""securities of companies domiciled in Canada and Israel that trade above $5,"" according to its website. Of course, both brokerages allow you to buy and sell ETFs that hold foreign stocks, and E*Trade offers access to mutual funds. If you prefer funds to individual stocks, the ability to access international stock exchanges might not be an important difference between these two brokers. Generally speaking, we tend to think that investors can benefit from having access to proprietary and third-party research. In the worst case, many services are a free benefit, so there isn't anything to lose from research that you don't use. E*Trade offers analyst reports from S&P Capital IQ, Morningstar, and Thomson Reuters, just to name a few benefits it offers its clients. Robinhood doesn't currently offer research capabilities, which is a trade-off that comes with getting completely free stock trades. If the ability to trade on a mobile device is important to you, you'll be pleased to find that both brokerages have that capability. Here's how each broker's users and clients rated their iOS and Android apps (as of 1/9/2018). Broker Apple App Store Google Play E*Trade 3.3 stars 3.9 stars Robinhood 4.8 stars 4.6 stars Source: Relevant app stores. Depending on your needs, either broker could be a good pick. Robinhood has a clear advantage on trading costs given its no-commission business model, but it doesn't currently offer research or the ability to trade options or invest in mutual funds. E*Trade offers plenty of free research and access to mutual funds, but you'll pay a commission on most trades. To be clear: The Motley Fool doesn't endorse any particular broker, but we can help you find the broker that is the best fit for you.

    E*Trade vs. Robinhood: Does Free Stock Trading Win Out? -- The Motley Fool

The case for lithium stocks seems simple enough. The world is adding new portable electric devices at an incredible pace. Just about every major automaker has at least announced plans for introducing an electric vehicle to the market within a matter of years. A little company called Tesla is moving forward on construction of a Gigafactory that will produce an enormous number of batteries for autos and home-scale energy storage -- it expects to produce as many lithium-ion batteries in 2018 as were manufactured on the whole planet in 2013. Phones, laptops, power tools, wearables, drones -- it seems everything and anything is taking advantage of advances in lithium-ion technology. That means lithium stocks belong in your portfolio, right? As is usually the case, the details of the market make this simple argument a little more complicated. Here are a few things investors will want to consider before throwing money at the companies supplying this headline-grabbing metal. Image source: Getty Images. Everyone thinks of batteries when they think of lithium. However, while that is by far the fastest-growing use for the metal, batteries only account for about one-third of the total lithium market. They only became the largest category of consumption last year, when they moved ahead of ceramics and glass. Image source: USGS. Counterintuitively, global production of lithium ore hasn't grown all that much in recent years, although mining companies are planning on major output increases in the near future. The U.S. Geological Survey concluded that 2013 output topped out at 34,000 metric tons, then fell to 31,700 metric tons in 2014. Production of raw ore is estimated to have grown by just 500 metric tons in 2015. Sluggish production growth is not a matter of scarcity. Global output could triple and known reserves would still last about 135 years. The question is whether or not lithium suppliers can keep up (more on that below) with rising demand. This should be the focus of investors interested in lithium stocks. There are plenty of tiny, zero-revenue stocks out there claiming to have vast reserves of untapped lithium ore. These are the crazy Uncle Joes of the market. Smile, nod, and then turn your attention to the suppliers with real market share. Albemarle Corp. (NYSE:ALB), Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM), and FMC Corp. (NYSE:FMC) own a combined 70% of the global lithium market. China's Tianqi Lithium owns another 16%. These diverse specialty chemical companies buy up the rights to unmined lithium and convert it into more refined grades that are suitable for downstream customers, such as battery manufacturers. These companies are only real way to gain exposure to the market. There is no reliable pure play lithium stock. Why not? Mining lithium is an awfully slow and laborious operation. Image source: Outotec. To put it another way: Uncle Joe isn't going to make it in lithium mining. The process is long and expensive, which prevents suppliers from responding rapidly to shifts in demand. Only large companies such as Albemarle, SQM, and FMC have the financial power to withstand volatility, diversify their supply chains, and make the necessary investments to create high grade lithium materials for industrial customers. Of course, market volatility has worked in their favor in the last year. Now that I've convinced you to stay away from microcap lithium stocks, you're ready to load up on the blue chips. After all, the growing demand for batteries and the sluggish rises in raw ore output (a year-over-year increase in output of just 500 metric tons) must give the four major market players the upper hand in negotiating supply deals with battery manufacturers, right? Sort of. ALB data by YCharts. It goes without saying that lithium is pretty important in lithium-ion batteries. But, counterintuitively, the lithium does not have a significant impact on the cost of lithium-ion batteries. In fact, it's actually the smallest mass and cost component of the battery cells. Earlier this year, two researchers at Carnegie Mellon University did a study that played around with the price of lithium carbonate (raw lithium ore), using a base price of $7.50 per kilogram. Dropping the price to $0 and increasing it to $25 per kilogram -- an increase of 233% -- changed the cost of batteries by less than 10%. In other words, there isn't much bargaining power to gain from keeping the market undersupplied, but the lengthy production process for lithium has kept supply lagging behind demand in the last several years. That has resulted in rising prices, which have been a boon for the Big Four in 2016. Here's how lithium contributed to the finances of Albemarle and FMC for the first nine months of 2016: Metric Albemarle FMC Revenue, lithium $689.9 million* $193.5 million % of total revenue 34.8%* 8% Income, lithium $186.3 million (net income)* $48.9 million** % of total income 32.6% (net income)* 12.1%** *Includes other materials. **Income before taxes. Source: SEC filings. In its financial reports, Albemarle lumps lithium sales in with other advanced materials it sells, but lithium is clearly driving the segment. The year-over-year sales increase for the segment was all from favorable conditions in the lithium market, which offset declining revenue from other products. FMC has seen a significant leap in lithium sales compared to 2015, too, and has announced major expansion plans to increase output before the end of the decade. Keep in mind that the lengthy production process is a double-edged sword. If demand for raw lithium suddenly craters, perhaps in a global economic downturn or from the emergence of new mining technology, then major suppliers will be nearly two quarters behind the market's appetite. A similar scenario could unfold if other major mining or chemical companies decide to invest in production or the overall supply chain. Either case could crash prices and the income statements of lithium stocks in one fell swoop. That doesn't appear likely at the moment, but similar scenarios have played out many times in commodities markets when no one saw it coming in advance. (See: fertilizers, crude oil, and the like.) Investors will want to take the issues outlined above into consideration before making a decision to gain exposure to lithium, either directly through a supplier such as Albemarle or indirectly through an ETF. In the end, the lithium market is more complex than most people realize. I'm firmly in the camp that thinks lithium stocks are simply the flavor the week for Mr. Market and do not represent a long-term buying opportunity. Perhaps when supply chains mature and prices reach more of an equilibrium, I'll reconsider my position. But for now, lithium stocks do not belong in my portfolio. ","

Jim Santos,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 29, 2016 11:39 a.m. ET For one couple, it began as an escape from the cold — and then it became their home By Just four years ago, taking an early retirement on a Pacific beach in South America was not part of my plan. Yet here I am, 58 years old, retired and living happily with my wife, Rita, on the southern coast of Ecuador. We are living healthier lifestyles at a fraction of our previous expense, and, best of all, our retirement nest eggs remain untouched. When we first started looking at Ecuador, it was mostly as a place to escape East Coast winters. We were based in Maryland at the time but could work anywhere that had internet and cellphone service, so we traveled a lot. Every place we went — Hawaii, the Caribbean, Italy — we played the “Could We Live Here?” game. But there was always something that just did not fit. Ecuador began to grow on us practically from the moment we arrived, on an exploratory trip in February 2013. We were drawn to Salinas, a coastal resort city on the Santa Elena Peninsula. The climate here is moderate year round. The Humboldt current brings cool breezes and an abundance of sea life. Temperatures rarely exceed 90 degrees or drop below 70. Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, and the constitution guarantees foreigners the same property rights as citizens. We also liked that it is in the same time zone as the Eastern U.S., which, at the time, made it easier to conduct business remotely. The clincher came when we started looking at property prices. Good-quality beachfront condo units with three or four bedrooms in Salinas were available for less than $250,000. Single-family homes of the same size just a block or two from the Pacific Ocean were listed between $175,000 and $200,000. By the second month after our arrival, we had purchased a four-bedroom, four-bath apartment in a modern oceanfront high-rise, with great amenities, security and 24/7 staff, for just $220,000. And within weeks, we had stopped thinking of Salinas as a winter getaway and started considering it our new home. Living here has brought some profound changes. After a year and a half, our expenses had dropped so much that there was no reason for me to continue in my job as a computer and networking professional. Our living expenses averaged $1,500 a month, compared with $6,000 when we lived in the U.S. I support myself now as a freelance writer, not because we need the income but because I enjoy doing it. We have no car, no mortgage and pay less than $300 a year in property taxes. We earn some income from a house we continue to own in the U.S. But not only are we not touching my 401(k) or our IRAs; we can still afford to contribute to them. We walk to the bank, market, restaurants and convenience stores. In fact, we spend most of our lives in the fresh air, as restaurants have outdoor seating, our produce, fish and meat markets are open-air, and shops tend to set their merchandise out on the sidewalks as well. For longer trips, an excellent bus system will get us anywhere in the peninsula for 30 cents (15 cents for those over 65), and cabs charge $2 or $3 to most of the places we need to reach. In addition to fresh seafood, we are blessed with a year-round growing season. Our mercado daily features a bounty of fresh fruits and vegetables priced so low that between the two of us, we cannot carry home more than $20 in groceries. Fresh eggs, dairy products, chicken, pork and beef (all raised without steroids) are also to be found there. Evenings, we enjoy getting together in small groups with our expat and Ecuadorean friends for dinner and conversation. There is an active and growing expatriate community in Salinas and the neighboring towns. There are expat bars and restaurants, poker nights, book clubs, groups that do charity work and so on. Rita and I are part of a subset that tries to live more like the locals. Also read:  10 of the best places in the world to retire So far we’ve been very pleased with the health-care system. If your health is generally good, fees for most services are so low you may opt—as we have—to pay for health care on an as-needed basis. A visit to the doctor’s office runs between $20 and $60. Last year, I had arthroscopic shoulder surgery in nearby Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, at the Hospital Clínica Kennedy, a fully equipped, modern hospital—one of the best in Ecuador. My total costs for the procedure, which included consultations and follow-up visits, sonogram, MRI, X-rays, cardiogram, two surgeons, an anesthesiologist and an overnight hospital stay: $6,000. A state-sponsored health plan available to Ecuadoreans and expats alike costs less than $80 a month for a married couple. Under this plan, care is free if you use the state-sponsored hospitals and clinics. But this can mean longer waits for an appointment, little choice in doctors, and less-modern facilities. Private health-insurance plans offer more flexibility for $200 to $500 a month for a married couple. But if you are over 65, most of these private insurers will not cover you. Nothing is perfect, and Ecuador is no exception. Expats usually must stick to bottled water, and we wash our produce and meats in antibacterial wash before eating. You also don’t have to travel far to get to villages where you will see pigs and goats looking for food along the mostly dirt roads. Be willing to learn some Spanish, and to roll with the differences in lifestyles. We have found that Ecuadoreans generally are not too concerned with punctuality, for example. Working with the local utility companies can be time-consuming and frustrating, as any change involves a personal visit or three. But our impression is that many people here love to celebrate life, loudly. During high season in Salinas it is not uncommon to hear music and parties all night long. For us, the best part of living here is the adventure of travel. We have taken several road trips, armed only with shaky GPS maps and our even shakier Spanish. Everywhere we go, from the fish markets of Manta on the coast to the capital city of Quito, high in the Andes, the people are friendly. Soon, we will be adding the Galápagos Islands to our list of great Ecuadorean destinations. There is more of South America we want to see as well. We are walking 50 miles or more a week to get in shape for a trip next year to Cusco, Peru. There we will hike the Inca Trail to the fabled ancient ruins of Machu Picchu, considered by many to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Jim Santos is a writer in Salinas, Ecuador.

Sally French,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 27, 2016 2:59 p.m. ET Fisher, who died Tuesday at 60, had more than 90 acting credits to her name By Carrie Fisher, most famous for playing Princess Leia in the “Star Wars” movie franchise, died Tuesday at the age of 60, according to a family statement. Fisher had been hospitalized Friday following a heart attack suffered aboard a flight from London to Los Angeles. Carrie Fisher was born in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Oct. 21, 1956 to parents actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher. Fisher’s breakout role came in 1977, when the 19-year-old starred as Princess Leia in the first installment of George Lucas’s “Star Wars,” opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. Fisher reportedly beat out other big names for the role, including Glenn Close and Meryl Streep. “I got to be the only girl in an all-boy fantasy, and it’s a great role for women,” Fisher said of Princess Leia in a 2016 interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. “She’s a very proactive character and gets the job done. So if you’re going to get typecast as something, that might as well be it for me.” The same year as “Empire Strikes Back,” Fisher appeared as a vengeful ex-lover in “The Blues Brothers.” In 1983, Fisher appeared in the final installment of the originally trilogy as Princess Leia in “Return of the Jedi.” Fisher appeared in one scene of “Return of the Jedi” wearing the now iconic and controversial metal bikini “Slave Leia” costume. “I had a lot of fun killing Jabba the Hutt,” Fisher said at a press conference in 2015. “They asked me on the day if I wanted to have a stunt double kill Jabba. No! That’s the best time I ever had as an actor. And the only reason to go into acting is if you can kill a giant monster.” In 2015, an action figure of Leia wearing the costume with a chain around her neck had some parents outraged. Fisher said to the Wall Street Journal, in response to the controversy: “What am I going to tell my kid about why she’s in that outfit? Tell them that a giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn’t like it. And then I took it off. Backstage.” Fisher played a major supporting role in the classic romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally” in 1989. Fisher has more than 90 acting credits to her name, including appearances in “Scream 3,” “Sibling Rivalry,” “Soapdish,” “Hook” and “Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle.” In 2001, Fisher played a nun in the comedy film “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.” Fisher is seen here with her mother, actress Debbie Reynolds, on Jan. 25, 2015, in Los Angeles, when Reynolds received a Screen Actors Guild lifetime achievement award. Fisher confirmed she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in “The Force Awakens” in a 2013 interview. A representative for Fisher said she was joking at the time, but it did in fact come to fruition with an announcement in January 2014. “I’d like to wear my old cinnamon buns hairstyle again but with white hair. I think that would be funny,” Fisher said in an interview with TV Guide. Fisher was often seen at events with her French bulldog, Gary.

Sally French,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Maryland patients are several months away from being able to legally obtain medical cannabis to treat chronic conditions. But scammers are already trying to make a buck off of patients desperate for the relief they seek from the drug, according to regulators and industry officials. There are reports that companies are selling “marijuana cards” or offering exams to “preapprove” patients for medical cannabis. Neither is a legitimate practice, officials say. “They are telling patients that they have the ability to preapprove them for the medical cannabis program, and that is a lie,” said Darrell Carrington, executive director of the Maryland Cannabis Industry Association. “There is no such thing as preapproval.” The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission, which regulates the industry, has issued preliminary licenses for companies to grow, process and dispense cannabis in the state. But none of the businesses have received final licenses or begun operation. No physicians have the ability to issue certifications for legal medical cannabis. “We know there are already attempts at fake patient identification cards being promulgated,” Patrick Jameson, executive director of the commission, said in a statement. “This type of fraudulent activity preys against the most vulnerable people in society and we will do everything possible to stop this behavior. Only patient identification cards issued by the Commission are legitimate. At this point no ID cards have been issued.” The state commission has received about 20 inquiries from potential patients reporting questionable claims by cannabis businesses, according to Vanessa Lyon, a commission spokeswoman. Carrington said he is frustrated that companies are trying to dupe sick patients. “They’re taking advantage of them because people are so desperate for the medication,” he said. It is already a struggle for the emerging cannabis industry to win over skeptics. Dishonest operators don’t help, Carrington said. “Groups that are operating nefariously and preying on people’s hopes and desires do a huge disservice,” he said. Maryland’s medical cannabis system will not involve written prescriptions. And while the commission will offer patient identification cards, they won’t be required. Doctors and patients will be required to join an online registry that will be monitored by state regulators. Doctors will use the system to issue online certifications for patients to use cannabis. Doctors are able to join the registry now. The patient registry won’t open until sometime in early 2017, Lyon said. A doctor’s certification for cannabis will be good for 120 days, and patients will be able to obtain only a 30-day supply of the drug at a time. Licensed dispensaries will check the state database before selling the drug. Licensed dispensaries will verify a patient’s identity, either through government identification such as a driver’s license or an optional patient identification card issued by the cannabis commission. All transactions will be monitored by the state commission. It will be late 2017 at the earliest before any medical cannabis is available to Maryland patients, Lyon said. None of the growers or processors have received final licenses or begun operation. The same is true for dispensaries, as state officials just issued preliminary licenses to them this month. A number of factors will influence the timing of when legal medical cannabis will be available to patients. All of the growers, processors and dispensaries will have to be up and running, with all of the challenges facing any new business. State lawmakers could change the rules governing the medical cannabis program during the next General Assembly session, which begins Jan. 11. And there are multiple lawsuits that have been filed over the licensing process that have yet to be resolved. “We’re not there yet,” Carrington said. “We’re close. We’ll get there soon.” — Baltimore Sun ",Officials warn of medical cannabis scammers - The Washington Post
Sally French,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 28, 2016 9:00 a.m. ET Dec 28, 2016 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- Company Releases Recap Report of Activities in 2016 and Announces Excitement for Coming Year SAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwired - December 28, 2016) - Medical Marijuana, Inc.

In addition, HempMeds® supported Hope4Harper's nonprofit efforts to raise funds for research and awareness of CDKL5. HempMeds Mexico With a focus on International expansion, Medical Marijuana, Inc. established its subsidiary HempMeds® Mexico after its flagship THC-free product RSHO-X™ became the first cannabis product to be allowed for import into the country by COFEPRIS. The historic first-ever import permits were awarded to two Mexico girls: Alina Maldonado Montes de Oca and Maria Paula Acevedo Cardos on February 1, 2016. Since the first import permit was granted, COFEPRIS has allowed for the importation of RSHO-X™ for treatment of multiple medical indications, including chronic pain and diabetic neuropathy -- and HempMeds® Mexico's operation have expanded to accommodate more than 150 patients in Mexico. Dr. Carlos Aguirre, a Mexican physician, conducted and released a study of patients using RSHO-X™ and other CBD products that rendered extremely positive results, including an average seizure reduction of 67% within his patient population with zero negative side effects. In October, HempMeds® Mexico hosted the country's first-ever Doctors Symposium entitled, ""Cannabidiol, usos medicos y terapeuticos, 1er congreso nacional"" in Mexico City aimed at educating medical professionals on the benefits of CBD and the proper way to prescribe it. Renowned Mexican physician Dr. Saul Garza Morales spoke at the event on the benefits of CBD. After partnering with nonprofit CBD advocacy group Por Grace, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto credited Raul Elizalde, the organization's founder, and his daughter Grace and families like them for ""changing his mind and the course of the country's cannabis policies based on science and human rights."" The Senate voted 98-7 a few weeks later on a bill to allow space to medical cannabis in their country. HempMeds® Mexico's RSHO-X™ remains the only cannabinoid product COFEPRIS has approved for importation into the country. In addition to serving Mexico, HempMeds® Mexico expanded its distribution into other Latin American countries such as Argentina, Chile, and Colombia where it attended the first-ever ExpoMede Weed in Medellin, Colombia. Additionally, the company began importing its product RSHO-X™ into Paraguay which was covered by media giant Associated Press and many national TV outlets. Since the historic, first-ever approval for a US-based cannabis product to be imported into Mexico, that development has been covered by literally hundreds of media outlets globally.

Kannaway Kannaway, the Company's premier lifestyle marketing brand and subsidiary company, spent the year refreshing and relaunching its world-renowned brand that all began with a March 29 announcement of its new executive team with Bradley J. Tayles being named President and newly appointed CEO, Blake Schroeder. The two new additions brought years of experience and a fresh outlook on the industry. Throughout the year, Kannaway introduced multiple new products, including Kannaway Premium Hemp Oil and Kannaway Pure CBD, which have taken the CBD market by storm. With the new management at the helm, the company added a stock incentive program for its brand ambassadors' as well as launched new trainings aimed at helping affiliates find success with the company. With the goal of reaching the masses, Kannaway became bilingual in its marketing offerings and hosted three regional events across the country, as well as its first-ever national event in San Diego in November called ""Genesis."" The event attracted hundreds of participants and featured announcements including: updates to the compensation plan, new packaging and brand materials, release of a new corporate video, and a complete website redesign. Finally, the company experienced a more than 400% growth in monthly revenue at year-end compared to April of this year and forecasts are looking even more positive for 2017. HempMeds Brasil Continuing its international expansion efforts, Medical Marijuana, Inc. subsidiary HempMeds Brasil™ continued to offer its world-renowned CBD product RSHO™ as the first-ever cannabis product approved by ANVISA for importation into the country. The company, under new management this year, was able to offer two new products to Brazilian citizens, RSHO-X™ and a liquid version of its famed RSHO™ product line, all while decreasing importation time to only three days from order to arrival. The company also continued to be instrumental in creating access to medical cannabis in Brazil, where they work with thousands of families in need of help gaining legal access to RSHO™ to help with many conditions including; Epilepsy, Parkinson's, Chronic Pain and Cancer. Since the historic 2014 court case, the company has repeatedly attracted national media attention after the government approved CBD for import for multiple medical indications and also started subsidizing the payments under the government health care system. You can find a full report of the many media success stories throughout the year HERE. Meanwhile in 2016, the court cases of consumers in Brazil fighting for access to RSHO™, and an open letter that Medical Marijuana, Inc. CEO, Dr. Stuart Titus, wrote to Brazilians in August, continued to make headlines in 2016.

                                   in which The Company owns 22,143,650 common shares or about 40%, had the most exciting year in the company's history beginning with the announcement of dermatological clinical research on cannabigerol (CBG) for treatment of psoriasis and eczema that was covered by Forbes. Soon after that groundbreaking announcement, AXIM® announced that they had received the necessary funding to continue its clinical research program on its proprietary method of chewing gum as a delivery mechanism for CBD and other cannabinoids, which was recently covered by Fox Business. Included in their program pipeline is breakthrough invention MedChew Rx™, the world's first patented cannabinoid controlled-release chewing gum, which is on pace to be fully registered by the EMA and FDA by the end of 2018. Featured by Reuters global news agency, MedChew Rx™ will change the way that medicine is delivered to patients worldwide. Directly compared to a sublingually delivered cannabis-based product currently on the market for multiple sclerosis (MS) in the Reuters article, the potential economic impact for MedChew Rx™ is estimated at $4.8 billion USD -- for spasticity and pain associated with MS. Shortly thereafter the company announced that it had entered the gum into a PK/PD study and received medical ethical committee approval from the University of Wageningen to begin human clinical trials using its product CanChew® Plus for treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). As a part of their intellectual property portfolio, the company announced that it has received an extension of its patent from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and USPTO to include the delivery mechanism of all cannabinoids through chewing gum. In addition to that extension, the company was assigned the patent on its proprietary method of THC extraction that rendered the purest form of THC known in the field. Additionally, the company significantly expanded its IP and TM portfolio and formulated numerous potentially blockbuster preparations, which will be investigated in the coming months and years. Finally, AXIM® added multiple world-class specialists to its advisory board and delighted investors and shareholders by releasing its product pipeline through 2020. AXIM was voted one of 5 top-performing biotech stocks for 2016 by Fox Business News. Kannalife Sciences Portfolio company Kannalife Sciences is a late-stage biotechnology company involved with the pharmaceutical development of new therapeutic compounds based on cannabinoids. KannaLife has garnered a licensing agreement with the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) for two indications: (1) Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) and secondly for traumatic head injury, known as (2) Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Hepatic encephalopathy is the occurrence of confusion, altered level of consciousness, and/or coma as a result of liver failure. CTE is a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head. Conducting their research under this US government license, Kannalife continued to make headlines with the announcement of a patent on a new CBD-like compound, named KLS-13019. The interest of this was to advance a therapeutic candidate for serious neurological disorders. While CBD is effective for these disorders there are limitations that where modified and designed for greater ""drug likeness."" KLS-13019 was found to be 50-fold more potent and greater than 400-fold safer than CBD and exhibited a profile consistent with improved oral bioavailability. This discovery of the body of science behind KLS-13019 was published by the American Chemical Society. Kannalife also made headlines in March after receiving the first-ever DEA permit granted to a US-based company to import pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol to continue their feasibility studies to help treat HE and CTE. The company's NIH license to research a treatment for CTE was also featured in a major article by Sports Illustrated. About Medical Marijuana, Inc.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk called the move a “no-brainer” for SolarCity, but it is a risky proposition for Tesla, especially given the other items on the company’s agenda. Related: Next for Tesla and SolarCity: The lawsuits The Silicon Valley auto maker is on the verge of launching its first electric car targeted at the masses, expects to bring its Nevada “Gigafactory” to full production by 2018 and wants to sell half a million cars within two years. All these efforts arrive against a backdrop of concerns about a brewing recession, a White House viewed as not exactly friendly to solar energy nor electric cars, and a declining market for SolarCity’s bread-and-butter business, residential solar. See: What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry Musk has said it was a mere “accident of history” that Tesla and SolarCity ended up separate companies in the first place. Musk is chairman and largest shareholder of both companies, and SolarCity was founded and is run by his cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive. Musk threw a lot of his weight behind convincing shareholders that a merger was a positive move for both companies. Product integration—solar power, stationary battery storage and electric cars—is a must to win over customers and the move will add to Tesla’s balance sheet, he has said. But Wall Street wasn’t convinced about the merger, and with good reason. SolarCity’s business plan seems to be faltering, and the company is struggling to find new sources for debt, so Tesla may have to start radically changing the company it just bought as it makes big changes in its own business. See more: Tesla’s SolarCity deal offers ‘zero value,’ Morgan Stanley says SolarCity was one of the companies that popularized leasing, rather than owning, solar-power systems—the pitch was that, for little to no money down, homeowners could install solar power and pay less per month than their power bills. Paying for those systems, however, meant that the company buried itself in debt that is still on the books, and is now having trouble finding new buyers. Related: White is about to be replaced as the most popular car color SolarCity’s model may have run dry, though: GTM Research expects 2017 to be the year the solar market will flip to mostly outright ownership, through cash sales or loans. GTM sees leased, or third-party owned, systems making up about 54% of the market this year; by next year, that share is expected to drop to 45% and progressively fall to under 30% five years from now. Financing and loans for solar power have become more prevalent, and costs for going solar have fallen, helping to speed up the trend toward ownership. SolarCity has increased the number of sales it makes with cash or loans in recent quarters, signaling a willingness to change. More generally, though, the solar market is starting to slow down after years of high double-digit gains—on average, the market has grown more than 50% every year in the past four years. But as the market becomes more saturated, it’s not the same high growth of a new industry, said Nicole Litvak, an analyst with GTM Research. She expects growth of around 10% to 15% in the coming years. SolarCity is still the No. 1 residential installer, with a market share of around 30%.

                                   , with about 6%. However, the three top residential solar companies have seen growing competition from local, privately held installers, Litvak said. For a time, building an integrated solar company—one handling everything from financing to seeking clients to the actual installation—was considered the goal. Now more companies are questioning whether vertical integration is the best model, with many outsourcing financing and customer acquisition in the belief that it saves costs, particularly as solar becomes more prevalent, she said. That could be an advantage of a SolarCity under Tesla, as SolarCity products could be marketed at Tesla stores. Some of the cachet that Tesla products have would also rub off on SolarCity products; earlier this year, Tesla unveiled solar tiles it promised would beat solar panels in look, price and efficiency, although Tesla has not yet said how much the tiles would cost. The batteries to come out of Tesla’s Gigafactory are expected to be efficient and plentiful, lowering costs on the automotive and stationary business sides. Read also: This is what Tesla needs to charge for its solar tiles to be competitive For SolarCity, the merger was seen as a way to access money much more easily. Wall Street, however, is less sanguine about how the deal would benefit Tesla. And one of the key concerns is how a pivot to solar power would sap attention away from the company’s core electric-car business in a potential slowdown. “We haven’t seen Tesla go through a recession as a public company yet,” said David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar. It’s possible that if a slowdown does hit, many of those who reserved a Model 3, the all-electric sedan Tesla hopes to sell late next year for about $35,000, will not go ahead with the purchase, Whiston said. Related: Elon Musk’s ‘master plan’ for Tesla Tesla has said it received 373,000 reservations for the sedan within a week of opening the preorders earlier this year, but it hasn’t updated that number since. Musk has given Model 3 suppliers a July deadline to have their parts all ready to go, with production starting in the fall. “They’ve got to nail that launch, no snags,” Whiston said. See also: Elon Musk’s pedestal is crumbling, exposing Tesla’s risks Dealing with the integration of SolarCity and the Model 3 launch would be too much for most executives, but Musk also faces continuing questions about Tesla’s “Autopilot” feature and its suite of advanced driver assistance systems, while also running another startup, the privately held Space X Corp., which merely hopes to take humans to Mars. The question for 2017 is if Musk can accomplish all these tasks, and which will be pushed back if he does not. Tesla shares are poised to end the year about 13% in the red. That contrasts with a gain of more than 10% for the S&P 500 index.

The 90-year-old queen, who missed the traditional Christmas church service near her Sandringham estate due to her “heavy cold,” used the message to praise those who had offered inspiration through the year. She included medalists from this year’s Paralympic and Olympic Games in Rio and even those who work with her grandson Prince William, a helicopter pilot in the East Anglican Air Ambulance service. But in the prerecorded message she said it’s not necessary to win medals or save lives to be brave, calling out countless charities that worked throughout the year and ordinary people who perform neighborly deeds.

It follows President Obama’s historic visit, in May, to Hiroshima, where a memorial honors the more than 90,000 who died from the atomic bombing in 1945 that hastened the end of World War II. Those reciprocal gestures of reconciliation, in which neither leader apologized, come 75 years after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that killed over 2,000. That victor and vanquished from a distant war became strategic partners is a triumph of post-war American diplomacy. Vietnam For those who remember the Vietnam War, it was an “Alice in Wonderland” moment in which an American president was in Hanoi delivering a speech beneath a huge banner of Ho Chi Minh. Obama was 15 in 1975, when the conflict ended with the unification of the north and south. Unsettled by China’s offshore maritime claims, communist Vietnam has opened the former U.S. base at Cam Ranh Bay to visits from U.S. navy ships. Vietnam wants to buy weapons from the United States, and Hanoi is a top destination for U.S. corporate investment in the region. Secretary of State John Kerry said in Hanoi that Americans and Vietnamese “refuse to let our past define our future.” Vietnam, he said, “a former adversary, is now a partner with whom we have developed increasingly warm, personal and national ties.” Cuba In December 2014, Obama announced steps to normalize U.S. relations with Cuba, the island nation that has been under a U.S. trade embargo since 1960. In 2015, the State Department said Cuba would no longer be designated a country that sponsors terrorism. Restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba were removed and in March 2016 Obama visited Cuba, the first visit by an American president since 1928. Receiving an enthusiastic welcome from large crowds in Havana, Obama said on Cuban television that “it is time for us to look forward to the future together,” for the Cuban and American people … to make a journey “together as friends, and as neighbors.” Obama’s efforts at reconciliation with Cuba are popular with the business community but opposed by many Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump. Only Congress can lift the embargo and that action is unlikely in 2017. Elusive aims In 2009, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, an honor previously accorded, among others, to Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin. The 2009 citation praised the American president for “strengthening international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.” In the case of Obama, the peace prize was premature and, given subsequent events, probably undeserved. As his eight years in office near an end, the big successes Obama hoped for were elusive. There has been no reconciliation with the Muslim world, the reset in U.S. relations with Russia failed, and the nuclear agreement and rapprochement with Iran is fragile and likely to reversed by Trump. While Obama did wind down U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, the inability to halt the deadly civil war in Syria and the flight of refugees into Europe constitute a huge failure. Despite those shortcomings, Obama registered important foreign policy victories. U.S. relations with Japan, Vietnam and Cuba have been significantly strengthened and are likely to be judged positively in the years ahead. Want news about Asia delivered to your inbox?

It emphasized that it does not relate to Nellix or its Ovation aortic treatment.

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google quickened the pace of its push into virtual and augmented reality this week as its hardware partners announced new devices featuring the company’s technology at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’s head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. “We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it’s for,” Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit. “By having options for both, they can cover the full potential market,” said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.

As a federal contractor, Google must agree to permit the federal government to inspect and copy records and information relevant to its compliance with the equal employment laws administered by OFCCP. The company has provided hundreds of thousands of records over the last year to comply with the OFCCP’s current audit, a Google spokesperson told Reuters. “However, the handful of OFCCP requests that are the subject of the complaint are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we’ve made this clear to the OFCCP, to no avail,” the spokesperson said. The OFCCP said it would ask the court to cancel all of Google’s current government contracts and to debar the company from entering into future contracts if it failed to comply. ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s Constitutional Council has ruled against a fiscal measure dubbed the “Google tax”, which was aimed at making it tougher for multinational companies to minimise their tax payments in France. The council’s ruling on Thursday comes as the government seeks to make France more attractive for foreign businesses after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. The “Google tax” targeting multinationals that use different countries’ tax regimes to reduce tax liabilities had initially been included in France’s 2017 budget law, but the government has since said it has reservations about the plans. The council also validated a widening of a planned financial transactions tax, making it applicable to intra-day transactions from 2018, though it could be challenged by the new government and parliament after next year’s elections. It also validated part of the government’s plan for French people to be taxed at source from 2018, meaning that their employers would deduct income tax payments from their pay. At present, French workers are responsible for declaring their income and settling their tax bills themselves. ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"The expanding alliance between Ford and Amazon, announced on Wednesday at the CES tech show in Las Vegas, underscores the importance to both automakers and internet commerce companies of connecting consumers on the move to a richer array of digital services. Don Butler, Ford’s executive director of connected vehicle and services, told Reuters the technology represented the “deepest integration of any OEM (carmaker) inside a vehicle with Alexa.” The two companies are talking about how to take the Alexa partnership further, according to Butler. “Digital assistant is one tool that is increasingly prevalent in the industry,” he said. Ford’s move follows its October announcement that it would use Alexa in three of its vehicle models by the end of 2016 to allow drivers to communicate with their smart home devices, such as heaters, lights or security systems. Automotive personal assistants are being studied by every major automaker, according to Gartner research director Michael Ramsey, who said: “There’s a lot of vetting going on.” Nineteen percent of the 160 million cars that use Nuance’s technology over the past 15 years have come out just in the past year, said Fatima Vital, Nuance’s senior director of marketing automotive. Currently, personal assistants are enabled using either phones as their mode of connectivity, such as at Ford, or through modems built directly into vehicles, as GM and the German automakers have done. Ford plans to have 10 million vehicles in North America and 20 million globally equipped with embedded modems by 2020. Ford cars will talk with Alexa through a new mobile app connected to SmartDeviceLink, an open-source platform that allows developers to create apps compatible with all automakers within the system, avoiding the need to adapt them to the specifications of each carmaker individually.

U.S. stocks have surged over the past two months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will stimulate the economy with tax cuts and infrastructure spending and slash regulations in the financial industry. “The market is picking up where it left off since the Trump presidency,” said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital. “What you are seeing is the market moving up in anticipation of fiscal expansion.” However, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near the never-before-reached 20,000 mark, some investors warned that additional strong gains would be unlikely in the short term. They want to see evidence that Trump’s campaign-trail promises will be approved by Republican lawmakers concerned about widening the federal budget deficit. “The president-elect can’t just wave a magic wand,” said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. “He has to deal with Congress, and Congress hasn’t proved to be able to agree with itself.” Oil prices hit an 18-month high before turning negative and falling more than 2 percent.

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"(Reuters Health) - Alternative medicine practitioners like homeopaths and acupuncturists may claim to treat allergies or asthma, but a study in Canada found that many there offer remedies that are unproven or even dangerous. “Complementary and alternative medicine continues to grow in popularity - particularly in the areas of allergy and asthma - despite ongoing controversies,” said lead author Timothy Caulfield, research director of the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta. “Both asthma and allergies can be a serious health condition,” Caulfield told Reuters Health by email. “These kind of public representations can be misleading and may lead to inappropriate care.” The researchers write in BMJ Open that government data from 2008 found that more than 70 percent of Canadians use complementary and alternative medicine. In the U.S., they say, people spent over $30 billion on complementary and alternative medicine in 2012 alone. Caulfield and colleagues sought to investigate alternative medicine practitioners’ marketing claims, including those of chiropractors and acupuncturists. They also investigated claims made by homeopaths, who use diluted plant and mineral tinctures as treatments, and naturopaths, who use a combination of various alternative medicine remedies to treat illness. The study team performed Google searches in March and April of 2016 and identified 392 websites of alternative medicine clinics located in 10 of Canada’s largest cities. The researchers checked to see if the websites mentioned allergy and food sensitivities or asthma, and if they claimed to be able to diagnose or treat the conditions. Overall, alternative medicine websites were more likely to advertise that they could treat allergy or asthma rather than diagnose it. More than half the sites claimed to treat allergy or asthma, while only a quarter claimed to diagnose allergy and about 3 percent claimed to diagnose asthma. Naturopaths were most likely to make a claim about diagnosis or treatment, with 85 percent making claims about allergies and 64 percent about asthma. A majority of acupuncturists, 68 percent, and homeopaths, 60 percent, made claims about diagnosing or treating allergies, while around half of both groups claimed to diagnose or treat asthma. Chiropractors were the least likely to make claims about allergy or asthma, with a third of websites mentioning allergy and 38 percent mentioning asthma. Many of the testing methods and treatments advertised on the alternative medicine websites do not have any research evidence to support them, the researchers write, and only two treatments mentioned are proven to work. Some advertised treatments, including spinal manipulation and injection of hydrogen peroxide, may actually cause harm to patients, the researchers write. The researchers also noted that some websites cited medical treatments like antibiotics and vaccinations as a cause of allergies and asthma. “Allergies including asthma affect a high proportion of children and adults resulting in a high burden of disease and uncommon but preventable deaths,” said David Osborn, a clinical associate professor at the University of Sydney who studies allergy treatments. “It is unethical to advertise products that do not work or may do harm, particularly if claims of benefit are being made, which they frequently are,” Osborn, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health by email. Osborn added that patients often will not research whether advertised treatments actually work. “From the medical point of view, we are highly concerned about the use of unproven and potentially harmful tests and treatments,” Osborn said. The researchers say new policies may be needed to protect the public. “People should be very skeptical of the marketing information found on these websites,” Caulfield said. “Seek out independent, science-based information!” SOURCE: bit.ly/2haYHhB BMJ Open, December 16, 2016.

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Canadian rapper Drake helped music streaming services explode in 2016, rising by 76 percent in the United States to overtake digital sales of music for the first time in history, Nielsen Music said on Thursday. Americans used on demand streaming platforms, such as Apple Music, Google Play, Spotify, Pandora and Amazon Music, to listen to 431 billion songs in 2016, led by hip hop and R&B artists like Drake, The Weeknd, Kanye West and Rihanna, Nielsen said in its 2016 U.S. year-end report. Some six songs, including New York rapper Desiiigner’s “Panda” and Rihanna’s “Work,” surpassed 500 million total on demand streams in 2016, compared with just three that hit that mark in 2015. The growth in streaming was more than enough to offset declines in other formats, particularly digital sales, leading to an overall 3 percent increase in music consumption compared with 2015, the report said. “The music industry continues to grow at a healthy rate, and 2016 showed us that the landscape is evolving even more quickly than we have seen with other format shifts,” said David Bakula, senior vice president of industry insights at Nielsen Music. Drake, 30, was by far the biggest beneficiary. The singer had the most digital song sales, the most streams - more than 5.4 billion - by a huge margin, and the most heavily consumed album of the year with “Views.” But the “Hotline Bling” singer had competition from Britain’s Adele and rock star Prince. Adele’s 2015 release “25” was the best-selling album of 2016 for the second straight calendar year with total sales of 1.7 million units. It was also the best-seller for 2015. Prince became the best-selling artist in terms of album sales, selling more than 2.2 million units following his death in April at age 57 of an accidental painkiller overdose. The day after his demise, Prince sold over 1 million digital songs and more than 200,000 digital albums. His catalog was tightly controlled on streaming services. Among other bright spots for 2016, physical album sales became a larger share of total album sales than the prior year for the first time in a decade, the report said. Vinyl continued an 11-year upward trend, reaching sales of 13 million in 2016 - the largest number since 1991. ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Whenever potential buyers have approached Tel Aviv-based Fiverr, the technology firm has said no; like a growing number of Israeli start-ups, it has enough backing from private investors to stay independent for longer. Traditionally, many of Israel’s numerous tech companies have sold out at an early stage to global giants like Cisco, IBM and Microsoft. Only a few - such as cyber security leader Check Point Software - have reached a significant size. But now start-ups are using a sharp rise in private investment to pursue growth, often aiming for eventual stock market flotations. With founders looking longer term rather than trying to make quick money, acquisitions of Israeli technology firms fell in 2016 to their lowest level in six years. Fiverr, backed by large venture capital funds including California-based Accel and Bessemer, is among those hoping to follow the Check Point model. Its online marketplace allows freelancers to offer services ranging from logo design to cartoons, and translations to psychic readings. Asking prices range from $5 to $10,000. A consumer-oriented company focused on the U.S. market, Fiverr raised $60 million in November 2015, bringing its total funding to date to $110 million. “Fiverr should be a multi-billion dollar business. This is why we aren’t looking to be acquired,” Chief Executive Micha Kaufman told Reuters. “Eventually a company like ours will go public.” Fiverr declined to disclose the company’s current valuation or name the would-be buyers that have approached it in the past couple of years. Israel’s high tech industry is well established, using skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors. Tax breaks and government funding have encouraged start-ups, and also drawn in entrepreneurs from abroad. But acquisitions of Israeli high-tech companies more than halved last year to $3.5 billion, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Stock market listings in the sector are also dwindling as investors increasingly prefer bigger tech companies. After eight initial public offerings valued at $3.4 billion in 2015, only two IPOs totaling $44 million took place in 2016 - one in London and the other in Tel Aviv. Instead, private investment is rising. In the first nine months of 2016 Israeli start-ups raised $4 billion, up 27 percent from a year earlier, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Centre (IVC), which has forecast a record year in 2016. Investment in more established late stage companies surged 47 percent to $1.6 billion in the first nine months, IVC said. The Aleph VC fund said four of its 12 companies have declined offers from would-be buyers in the hundreds of millions of dollars. “I’m seeing for first time that many founders are saying no to M&A. It’s a good thing,” Aleph partner Eden Shochat said. “These bigger companies create pockets of knowledge ... which is required to build an industry.” Aleph was structured to allow 12 years for investors to cash in, instead of the seven years typical for the venture capital sector, he said. Accel, which has just opened an Israeli office, said it can invest $50 million in a growth stage company and has raised a fifth fund of $500 million to invest in Israel and Europe. “The fact that money is available has clearly impacted the level of exits,” Accel partner Philippe Botteri said. Adam Fisher, a partner who manages Bessemer’s Israel office, expects this trend of holding out to continue as long as growth funding, especially from new sources such as China, is abundant. Fisher believes the availability of growth capital also has disadvantages. The risk is that generously-funded companies may be less efficient than those running on a shoestring. Moreover, rejecting an offer to hold out for more money limits the number of potential buyers, while an IPO may also not be possible if stock market investors consider a firm has yet to grow big enough for a flotation. Gone are the days of the tech boom in the late 1990s when relatively small firms listed on the U.S. Nasdaq market. “Startups often need growth financing to reach the current IPO threshold of $100 million revenue run rate, but by no means does that imply that growth financing will create an IPO candidate,” Fisher said. Despite the country’s reputation as a center for innovation, many global buyers prefer the more established markets of the United States and Europe. Rubi Suliman, high-tech leader for PwC Israel, said there are still not enough buyers who are familiar and comfortable enough with Israeli high-tech to drive a wave of deals. “When potential buyers are relatively scarce, deal prices are expected to go down,” he said. Taking the IPO route could also prove difficult for Israeli firms in certain business areas. Some of the largest private companies in revenue terms are in the online advertising sector, which public markets have turned against. The valuation of Israeli adtech firm Matomy, for example, has nearly halved since it went public in London in 2014. With Facebook and Google owning much of the distribution and profit from selling ads directly to the advertiser, the pie for adtech firms is much smaller, said Nir Blumberger, Accel’s Israel-based venture partner and a former corporate development executive at Facebook. Amounts made by investors exiting adtech firms through sales or IPOs fell to $238 million in 2016 from about $600 million in 2015, according to IVC and the Meitar law firm. In cyber security technology, the need for firms’ services is growing but a proliferation of start-ups means competition is stiff. Cyber start-ups raised more funds last year than in 2015, but exits nearly halved to $660 million, IVC data shows. “I still foresee this will be a big area for M&A and IPOs in the future but it will take a while to be built into a revenue stream,” said Shochat. A third group is automotive tech, boosted by the success of Mobileye which makes driver warning systems aimed at preventing accidents. Investment in start-ups nearly doubled in 2016 to $680 million though exits brought in only $190 million. Investors caution that companies in this sector require a lot of money over a very long period. (This story was refiled to add “venture” to title in 28th paragraph) ","

The Department of Health and Human Services paid the company $352,200 last year to place HealthCare.gov ads on third-party websites and Google search results.

Billionaire hedge fund leaders, executive officers, and other top figures in the world of finance may seem to know the answers to questions about the market and investing, and with good reason, as they have the wealth themselves to prove it. It is for this reason that investors of all types turn to billionaires for ideas on where to put their money, which stocks to follow, and how to read the market and the economy for clues about what will happen next. Here are some of the top-seached fund managers on Google: Warren Buffett, leader of Berkshire Hathaway and one of the wealthiest people on the planet, has long held a reputation for being a savvy, sagacious investor. His company has grown exponentially in the past decades, and Buffett's views on investments are taken as the gold standard by many industry experts. He is the leading investor among Investopedia reader searches. The controversial investor George Soros comes in next on the list of reader searches. Soros is most famous for shorting the British pound in late 1992, an action that in one day earned him somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion. Besides that single event, however, his Quantum Fund brought in staggering returns for years under his leadership. Carl Icahn, famed activist investor and leader of Icahn Enterprises, makes headlines for his bold moves investing in large stakes of companies around the world. With a reputation as a stubborn and even combative investor who takes over companies, Icahn's investment opinions hold so much sway within the finance world that the term ""Icahn lift"" was coined to refer to the rise in price of a stock after Icahn buys it. Though Bill Ackman's Pershing Square has seen its share of trouble in recent months, Ackman remains one of the most popular investors by search. The billionaire investor has taken controversial opinions on companies such as Herbalife (HLF), and though not all of his campaigns have been successful, his overall track record is impressive and he commands respect throughout the industry. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, has a record of more than 40 years of success in growing the biggest hedge fund in the world. Bridgewater has a stellar record of returns throughout its history and has weathered recent market turmoil better than many other hedge funds, making Dalio a go-to for investors everywhere. Chair of BP Capital Management, billionaire energy investor T. Boone Pickens rounds out the list.

North American energy companies raised the $57 billion during a two-year period by selling shares of stock through so-called follow-on offerings, the Journal said. While some of the firms that participated in these transactions filed for bankruptcy protection, many of them stayed in business. The activity surrounding these follow-on offerings peaked in February 2016, when oil prices fell to as low as $26 per barrel. That month, oil and gas producers were able to raise $7.4 billion by selling shares of stock to investors. Many investors purchased these shares in February because they believed oil prices had hit rock bottom. Ultimately, their bets that oil prices would push higher proved accurate, with futures contracts for the commodity enjoying their biggest annual gain since 2009, MarketWatch reported. One major development boosting oil prices has been expectations that major oil producers, including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, will follow an agreement designed to limit output.

Players such as Stratasys will continue to focus on improving gross margins and optimizing cost structure. Data from HP Inc. and venture-capital-backed Carbon should also shed light on industry trends in 2017. Back in May, the PC and printing giant launched its first 3D-printing products, leveraging its Multi Jet Fusion technology. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based tech giant says its polymer 3D printers are 10 times faster and twice as cost-efficient as 3D printers currently on the market. Another new market player, Carbon, launched its three-year subscription offering for its M1 3D printers in April. The Google Ventures (GOOG) and GE-backed company indicates that its printers, powered by Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP) 3D printing technology, are 25 to 100 times faster than leading 3D-printing technologies.

Josh Lipton,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Apple reported Thursday that developers raked in $20 billion on its App Store in 2016, a 40 percent jump since 2015. That suggests Apple reaped at least $8 billion in revenue from its App Store, an analyst said. ""2016 was an amazingly great year for the App Store,"" Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, told CNBC. ""We continue to advance what is available for developers to create. And our catalog of apps grew 20 percent to 2.2 million."" Schiller said the biggest drivers for the App Store included games such as ""Pokemon Go,"" which was the most downloaded app in 2016; ""Super Mario,"" which was the most downloaded app on Christmas and New Year's days; and subscription-based apps, such as Netflix, Hulu and Time Warner's HBO Go. The tech giant said its biggest day of sales on the App Store was on Jan. 1, 2017, when customers spent a record $240 million. The top grossing markets included the U.S, U.K., Japan and China, which saw 90 percent year-over-year growth. Investors pay close attention to the performance of the App Store, as Apple now emphasizes its role as a services company. The broad smartphone market is maturing, and the tech giant is highlighting recurring revenue streams that do not depend on new device sales. Some research suggests that the best days of growth in the apps market may have come and gone. Schiller disputed that, pointing to his store's recent performance. ""I will let the success of the App Store speak for itself,"" he said. ""The App Store is bigger than ever and growing faster than ever. There is a lot of success ahead for developers."" Based on Apple's traditional cut of 30 cents for every dollar that moves through the store, the revenue generated by the app sales totaled about $8 billion to $9 billion for Apple last year, according to Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. Digital stores represent big battlegrounds between Apple and rival Google. According to App Annie, which provides market data for the app economy, Google Play's worldwide downloads were 115 percent higher than Apple's App Store downloads in the third quarter, which is the latest data available. However, Apple maintained its advantage in revenue. In the third quarter, App Store revenue was 100 percent higher than Google Play's. ",App Store developers earned $20 billion in 2016
Anita Balakrishnan,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"An unlikely player just emerged to take on heavyweights such as Amazon in the artificial intelligence space. Nvidia debuted a new product, Spot, that takes on Amazon's Alexa. Spot is ambient and thus can hear commands from far away, using Google Assistant to respond to spoken requests. ""Whereas [Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg has incredible programming skills and can spend a year to build an AI for his home, I've decided we should build it for all of you,"" Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said on Wednesday. One of the most exciting times in computing history has been fueled by the unexpected industry of video games, led by Nvidia, Huang said in a keynote address at technology conference CES in Las Vegas. ""We are going through unquestionably the most exciting times in the computer history that we've ever witnessed,"" Huang said. On Wednesday, the company deepened its reach into gaming with several announcements. Its gaming platform, GeForce, will now be available on Facebook and a cloud-based PC platform. The company also announced high-definition streaming deals with Netflix, Amazon, Google Play and YouTube. But Huang said the company's impactful technology is its BB8 self-driving cars. Nvidia is working with Audi for a car that should be in production by 2020. ""We believe the car itself should also be an AI co-pilot,"" Huang said. Once known as a niche video game processor company, Nvidia has seen its share price rise more than 220 percent in the past year. Part of the reason is that the Nvidia's processing power has suddenly combined with artificial intelligence to create the ""big bang"" of deep learning in the industry, Huang said. ""[Deep learning] allows software to write software,"" Huang said. Because of the hefty computing requirements of creating true-to-life video game graphics, Nvidia has been able to capitalize on the demand for virtual reality, self-driving cars, and even tasks like facial recognition or writing photo captions. Indeed, Nvidia showed off some of its cutting-edge technology using the highly anticipated new game, ""Mass Effect Andromeda,"" due out this March. ""This market is ... fueled by the amazing production value of video games that continue to come out,"" Huang said. ""Gaming is no longer just about games. It's now the world's largest sporting event."" ",Nvidia's stock popped 220% in a year. Now it's taking on Amazon
Michael K. Farr,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.  In addition, the current dividend yield is an attractive 2.4 percent. ",Top 10 stocks for 2017—commentary
Anita Balakrishnan,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Mark Zuckerberg's splashy new smart home technology, Jarvis, has garnered attention for playful features like a T-shirt cannon. The hacked-together artificially intelligent assistant is a unique personality programmed by Zuckerberg. But in order to ""talk"" to appliances, Zuckerberg's DIY project got some pretty high-end help. Jarvis is actually built on top of an elite smart home technology by Crestron. Custom electronics are ubiquitous in the homes of ""the 1 percent,"" and major technology companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, said John Clancy, Crestron's vice president of residential. Crestron already powers a home of Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and many pricey homes in President-elect Donald Trump's properties, according to its website. Each system starts at a few thousand dollars and can go into the millions, especially when the cost of high-end TVs and speakers are included, Clancy said. Zuckerberg made an iPhone app for Jarvis this year to connect the smart devices and phones around his home. Zuckerberg said in a blog post he used Crestron to provide a way for Jarvis to speak to his lights, thermostat and doors. Clancy said Crestron would normally be able to power many of Jarvis' features through its own apps, but instead created an API that would let Zuckerberg build his own ""front end"" in his preferred programming language, Python. Clancy said Zuckerberg and his wife ""wanted the reliability of the proven system and also the ability to customize on their end, tied to his Jarvis service."" Clancy declined to say how much Zuckerberg may have paid Crestron for the services, though he said it was probably not a normal rate, since Facebook is a big Crestron customer and they ""helped him out."" Zuckerberg's engineering did add some powerful new features that Clancy said he expects will be in high demand. For one, Zuckerberg's artificial intelligence went beyond fixed phrases or hitting buttons, since it has the ability to learn. Plus, Facebook's facial recongition technology and ability to text with Facebook Messenger are unique, Clancy said, not to mention the voice by Morgan Freeman. Unlike an off-the-shelf consumer product like Google Home or Apple HomeKit, Crestron manufactures all the devices in its ecosystem and has government-facility level cybersecurity. Crestron can also integrate with devices like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri. Because the systems are high-end and bespoke, Crestron has been able to build automated systems for clients that run ""dog walking scenarios,"" trigger self-playing pianos or turn the lights blue when a Yankee game starts, said Clancy. The touch screens and switches can also be matched to users' decor, according to Clancy, who installed and integrated internet of things systems himself for 23 years in NYC penthouses before stepping into his current role. ""Regular IoT products have limits,"" Clancy said. ""All our products together are limitless."" For instance, Branson's devices are optimized for the taxing Caribbean environment, according to Crestron's website, while a Hoboken, NJ condo that formerly belonged to New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning could control the music playing in the shower. While Zuckerberg's primary reason for building Jarvis was a resolution to get more familiar with Facebook's latest engineering, he's already sold some more billionaires on the idea. ""Hey, Mark. Can Jarvis secretly order a hamburger and have it delivered to the back door? Asking for a friend...,"" Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates commented on Zuckerberg's Facebook page. ""I think I can build that for you, Bill,"" Zuckerberg responded. Still Crestron doesn't expect Zuckerberg to start stealing away clients any time soon, Clancy said. ""Very few of these very large homes — or in NYC, where I was focused, very expensive apartments — are built without a control system,"" Clancy said. ""We have kind of a unique ability to customize to a very high level."" ",The company that helps power Mark Zuckerberg's Jarvis and the homes of 'the 1%'
Anita Balakrishnan,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Apple is about to face its biggest challenge yet: Its most formidable Chinese rival, Huawei, just launched a high-end phone in the U.S. on Thursday. The Huawei Mate 9 will be available in the U.S. through Best Buy  and Amazon on Friday for $599.99, according to Richard Yu, the director and CEO of Huawei's consumer business group. The world's No. 3 smartphone maker by volume hopes to become No. 2 within one or two years, Yu said  — that means knocking down Apple or Samsung. ""We never hide our ambition,"" Yu said at a speech at technology trade show CES in Las Vegas, adding: ""We have a vision to make the world's best smartphone."" Huawei shipped 33.6 million smartphones worldwide in the third calendar quarter, according to IDC estimates, behind Apple's 45.5 million and Samsung's 72.5 million. Now, the company will be infiltrating Apple's biggest market, American smartphones. Yu took aim at Apple several times during his speech, noting the cheaper Mate 9 is thinner than the iPhone 7, has a longer battery life and faster charging. Huawei was also the first phone to sport dual cameras, like the iPhone 7's, Yu said. The Mate 9 also has help from Apple's rivals, with integration of Google's virtual reality platform, DayDream, and Amazon's artificially intelligent assistant, Alexa. ""'Genius' is no longer in the domain of a chosen few,"" the Mate 9's promotional video said, showing a picture of a lightbulb. Apple, of course, is known for its Genius Bar and recently introduced an ad featuring bursting lightbulbs. Of course, there are big shoes to fill. Both Apple and Samsung are expected to put enormous effort into their next generation handsets. For Apple, the 10th anniversary of the iPhone could be a a chance to revive sluggish sales growth; for Samsung, its a chance to recover from its recall of the Galaxy Note 7. Still, executives from Google and Amazon both told the audience there is even more to come in partnership with Huawei, including a Google augmented reality feature and more Alexa features. Huawei is also aiming to be the world's biggest spender in research and development, Yu said, and has poured resources into its own chips, machine learning and artificial intelligence, to conserve power and keep the Android platform from slowing down over time. After being a relatively obscure employee-owned telecom provider a few years ago, Huawei's worldwide sales grew 23 percent in the third calendar quarter, a period where Apple and Samsung saw sales fall, IDC estimates. Yu is part of the reason why. ""Our company is a different management style than other companies,"" Yu said. ""We call it collective wisdom. We are not only diligent…we are also flexible.""

Linda Dimyan,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Corporate culture apparently pays off, as stocks of companies with happy employees have been outperforming the market throughout the bull run. Since 2009, companies named on Glassdoor's ""Best Places to Work"" list collectively have topped the S&P 500 by more than 100 percent. The list is meant to recognize leading companies based on overall employee job satisfaction, sentiment toward career opportunities, compensation, work-life balance and approval of company leadership. Since the annual list has been issued in 2009, more than 150 U.S. companies have been recognized from a variety of industries including retail, technology, manufacturing, energy, media and entertainment. In order to qualify for consideration on the list, at least 75 employees of a company must submit reviews on a scale from 1 to 5. The average score this year was 3.3. The economic link between employee satisfaction and the company's productivity, sales and reputation also exists by contrast. A portfolio of the 30 lowest-rated public companies on Glassdoor broadly underperforms the market by nearly 30 points. ""No matter how we looked at the numbers, Best Places to Work winners were also great financial investments,"" said Glassdoor's chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain. Companies that have repeatedly shown up on Glassdoor's Top 10 over the past five years are: Bain & Company, Facebook, LinkedIn, Boston Consulting Group, Google-parent Alphabet, Adobe, Nestle Purina PetCare and In-N-Out Burger. Bain has been in the top five since the list's inception in 2009 and has been the number one winner three times. Clorox, Forrester Research, Keller Williams Realty, Microsoft and Lululemon all made the list for the first time this year. The top three publicly traded companies on the list for 2017 with their stock price appreciation since Jan. 1, 2009, through Dec. 1 of this year are Google (392.4 percent), Adobe (349.7 percent) and Facebook (201.1 percent). In comparison, the S&P 500 rose 153.59 percent during the same period. According to Glassdoor, there were consequential labor market trends in 2016 that could reshape company culture in the New Year. In today's hiring market, Glassdoor points out that employers are focused on creating attractive compensation packages. Health insurance, vacation and paid time off, and 401(k) plans are key for employee satisfaction.  ",The key to good stock performance is to keep your workers happy
David Reid,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"British dentists are calling for an end to ""cake culture"" in the workplace as they claim the sugary treats are contributing to health problems such as obesity, tooth decay and diabetes. The Faculty of Dental Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in London put out a statement Tuesday identifying the workplace as one of the main places where people consume a lot of sugar each day. Professor Nigel Hunt, Dean of the Faculty of Dental Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons said the culture of sweet treats was, to a point, understandable. ""Managers want to reward staff for their efforts, colleagues want to celebrate special occasions and workers want to bring back a gift from their holidays. While these sweet treats might be well meaning, they are also contributing to the current obesity epidemic and poor oral health,"" he said in a press release Tuesday. Hunt called for company bosses to foster a healthier environment. ""We need a culture change in offices and other workplaces that encourages healthy eating and helps workers avoid caving in to sweet temptations such as cakes, sweets and biscuits,"" Hunt said. A health survey for England carried out in 2015 found that almost two out of every three adults in England are either obese or overweight. The statement from The Faculty of Dental Surgery praised U.S. tech giant Google for its efforts to reduce calorie consumption among staff. It said that at Google's staff canteens, sweets were placed in opaque containers making them less visible and harder to reach, with healthy alternatives much more prominent. Another tactic employed was to reduce the size of plates in canteens. As a result, the faculty said, Google claimed in 2013 that its New York employees ate 3.1 million fewer calories over the course of seven weeks. ",Workplace ‘cake culture’ blamed for rise in obesity
Arjun Kharpal,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Samsung's upcoming flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone could give users the ability to plug it into a screen and turn it into a desktop personal computer, according to a media report. The All About Windows Phone blog posted a leaked slide from a presentation showing a Samsung smartphone being connected to a screen with a keyboard and mouse. The slide is titled ""Samsung Desktop Experience"" and shows a phone powering a screen to create a multi-tasking interface, presumably running on Google's Android mobile operating system. There is not much more information on the slide than a visual representation, but if this is true, it'd be an interesting feature that Samsung will tout as it launches its next flagship phone, one that is crucial to make up the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 which was subsequently recalled. Samsung usually releases its flagship Galaxy phone at Mobile World Congress towards the end of February and beginning of March, but sources told CNBC recently that it could be slightly later this year, to make sure that the S8 will not suffer the same fate as the Note 7. Meanwhile, Samsung is slated to release a full report into the Note 7 debacle later this month. The S8 is being released ahead of Apple's flagship iPhone, which is expected to be a special tenth anniversary edition. Both will be battling for smartphone dominance in 2017 looking to convince users with new features. By introducing a desktop mode, Samsung could appeal to customers looking for a device that will also be good for productivity, something that the now discontinued Note 7 did. By sticking with Android, users will also have access to all the apps available on the Google Play Store. Samsung was not available for comment when contacted by CNBC. It's not the first device on the market that carries this functionality. Microsoft's smartphones that have Windows 10 Mobile have a feature called ""Continuum"" which allows you to plug your smartphone into a monitor, turning it into a desktop PC too.

Sarah Whitten,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"As Domino's digital ordering technology helps power its industry-leading growth, competitor Pizza Hut is trying to grab a larger piece of the mobile pie. In an effort to entice new and existing users, Pizza Hut is offering customers 50 percent off full-price pizzas that are ordered online. The deal is available on the company's website and through its mobile app from Jan. 2 to Jan. 9. ""Pizza Hut is constantly pursuing ways to simplify the ordering experience,"" Doug Terfehr, senior director of public relations and partnerships at Pizza Hut, told CNBC. ""Digital ordering continues to be our fastest-growing segment of purchase with mobile playing the largest role in that growth."" Like many of its competitors, Pizza Hut was an early adopter of digital and mobile ordering. Roughly half of the company's delivery and carryout orders are placed digitally, with 70 percent of its online sales coming from mobile devices. But the company has incentives to push these sales even higher. Not only do mobile orders offer customers an easier way to pay, but their average check is higher than those generated from in-store orders. Across the industry, mobile order checks could be as much as 20 to 30 percent higher than a traditional in-store check, according to Andrew Feinberg, a principal at consulting group Deloitte. That's because customers have more time to consider their options, and restaurants are better able to upsell. Upselling is a technique by which a chain can offer upgrades or add-ons to meals at regular or a discounted price, in an attempt to ring up a higher sale. ""This is not about digital. This is not about mobile order and pay. It's really about customer experience,"" Feinberg told CNBC, speaking about mobile ordering in general. ""Customer experience is the linchpin for all of this. And the best brands, the best restaurant companies, are thinking first about customer experience and choosing a road map of digital capabilities specific to their brand."" Feinberg noted that many restaurants are adapting to their customers' changing spending habits, allowing for cash transactions, credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Android Pay, Samsung Pay and other forms of mobile payments. ""Consumers want an easy-to-use and secure mobile payment solution,"" said Austen Mulinder, president and CEO of Ziosk, a technology company that produces tablets with a menu, ordering options, games and a payment system. The company's tablets can be found at Chili's Grill & Bar, Olive Garden and Red Robin. ""When a restaurant goes all in on mobile payment, they will also adopt a mobile wallet strategy too,"" Mulinder added. ""This means that guests can store their membership credentials and offers in their mobile wallet. So a guest can log in to [a loyalty program], earn and/or redeem points and offers, and pay by tapping their phone."" Digital orders have increased by 45 percent across the industry since 2014, according to The NPD Group, and now account for nearly 1.7 billion in food service visits. Last quarter, digital ordering, improved product quality and the ""Piece of the Pie Rewards"" loyalty program were driving factors for Domino's 13 percent jump in same-store sales. ""Mobile ordering and payment will grow exponentially,"" Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant analyst at NPD, told CNBC. ""Domino's is a prime example of the opportunity that exists with this technology. The chain has been on the leading edge of creating ways for customers to place their orders using numerous platforms. This is convenience at its best. Look for many restaurant operators to follow suit and capitalize on this growth opportunity."" ",Pizza Hut slashes mobile ordering prices in a bid to entice diners
Anita Balakrishnan,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"The Consumer Electronics Show (CES), an annual event that often sets the tone for the year in tech, hits Las Vegas the first week of 2017. It's usually dominated by gadgets like phones, cameras and TVs, but those aren't expected to be this year's headliners, said Vivek Wadhwa, distinguished fellow at Carnegie Mellon University's college of engineering and a director of research at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering. Instead the event is more likely to be dominated by automakers showing off self-driving cars, even if the average consumer is more likely to see changes in the kitchen than the garage this year, Wadhwa said. Here are three trends to watch. Alongside phone-makers like Huawei and Samsung, car companies like Toyota, Hyundai and Nissan are expected to announce major news. Competition from the likes of Alphabet and Uber has made CES as crucial as the Frankfurt Motor Show for companies show their chops around artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. BlackBerry, for instance, is expected to reveal more car technology, in a bet to revive the company's waning influence. The company recently pledged $75 million toward its efforts over the next few years. Among the juiciest offerings of January's show could be a reveal from Faraday Future. The rumor mill has speculated that the Chinese-backed start-up may be unable to pull off its outlandish vision. The company plans to respond to those claims at CES. Tweet: Skepticism and negativity only strengthens our conviction to redefine sustainable mobility. Decide for yourself on Jan 3rd. #CES2017 Despite the unprecedented hype among techies, the car is just one example of a larger trend: Rather than adding to your arsenal of gadgets, technology companies are trying to improve and connect the ones you already buy, said Wadhwa, author of the upcoming book ""The Driver in the Driverless Car: How Our Technology Choices Will Create the Future."" Cars aren't the cheapest, easiest gadget to swap out, Wadhwa said. But companies are betting eventually a ""smart"" car could be one of many connected devices. ""Cars are still two or three years away,"" Wadhwa said. ""There's more focus on home appliances. The internet of things ... was big last year. Now we're going to see the integration, using the bots. Apple, Microsoft and Google are putting AI into everything. ... That's what 2017 will hold."" Amazon's Alexa and Google Home are examples of interfaces that connect disparate gadgets and services into a single interface. Alexa has a robust presence at CES this year, with sessions on using the Echo for games, the home and yes, cars. This is an area where Samsung, wounded by last year's Galaxy Note 7 recall, could get back its mojo, Wadhwa said. Samsung is already the maker of ""smart"" devices like refrigerators, and it has recently waded deeper into this area with two acquisitions. One is Harman, which develops for connected cars, and the other is Viv, an assistant by the makers of Apple's Siri. The way we now ask Siri for the temperature, we could soon be asking Viv or Alexa how much milk is left in the fridge, Wadhwa said. Like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Wadwha said he still sees the mobile phone as a central hub for these activities, as opposed to wearables like smart glasses or watches. ""The phone is going to be here for [a] long time,"" Wadwha said. ""Augmented reality is when you're sitting down, for entertainment."" Still, the breakout trends of years past — virtual and augmented reality, drones and wearables —  remain a big focus at CES. A vice president at Intel and a senior advisor to the Federal Aviation Administration will speak about drones at the conference, while speakers from Mattel, Imax, HTC and Sony Pictures all plan to riff on virtual reality. Despite plateauing sales among consumers, wearables and 3-D printing are also on the agenda this year, with a dossier of speakers ranging from Reebok to Fossil. The sessions will come after eMarketer slashed its forecast for wearable-device adoption this year. MakerBot, a 3-D printing company, has suffered a slew of layoffs. While these trends may have faded from the limelight, Mark Cavender, founder and managing director of the Chasm Institute, said these products could leverage strong adoption among businesses to bridge the gap between technology enthusiasts and more conservative consumers. ""Often I've seen with consumer products that they first cross the chasm with business,"" Cavender said. ""If you think of when TVs went from CRT to flat screen, and when they went to high definition, the first people that bought them were wealthy technology enthusiasts. You also saw some business technology enthusiasts, to just learn about them. But the first visionaries were, for instance, sports bars in a city. All of the sudden sports bars, in the period of about a year, went to high-definition TVs."" A simple device, like a low-cost fitness tracker, might catch on more quickly, Cavender said. But consumers might need to see more from drones or VR before they make the leap. Amazon drone delivery or surgeons training on VR might move the technologies beyond core groups like gamers this year, he said. ""The wearables that I think showed a lot of potential were B2B,"" Cavender said. ""A glove that's got sensors to help Mercedes-Benz have better quality on the assembly line by noticing a mistake. Or building a set of clothing that miners can wear underground that monitor their environment."" ","CES trends to watch in 2017: Self-driving cars, bots and internet of things"

Tens of millions of Americans have to file federal tax returns, and many of them expect to get refunds from the IRS. Yet in all but a small handful of states, taxpayers also have to file returns with state tax authorities. State tax refunds can add to your total haul at tax time, but the rules governing when you'll actually receive those state tax refunds can vary greatly from state to state. Below, we'll take a look at why you might get a state tax refund and what timing you can expect once you do file. Image source: Getty Images. In general, states that have income taxes generally get the bulk of their tax revenue through withholding from workers' paychecks. Just as you'll see with federal taxes, most employers have to withhold money toward your state income tax liability. Although you have the ability to modify your withholding in order to match it more precisely to your actual tax liability, most workers leave the default rules alone, and that can often result in a refund. The other situation in which a refund is likely is if you have tax benefits that aren't related to your job. For instance, some states have their own versions of federal tax breaks like the earned income credit, child and dependent care credit, or educational credits. Since your withholding at work typically can't account for that, you'll usually have too much money withheld once you claim that credit, resulting in a refund. Different states have different guidelines when it comes to how quickly you can expect a refund. However, there are some general rules that you can count on wherever you live. In general, using electronic filing results in a much faster refund than if you use paper filing. As a result, it almost always makes sense to use e-filing whenever it's available. Moreover, if you're already planning to file electronically for your federal return, some tax packages allow you to make a state filing electronically at no additional charge. Below, we'll look at some of the most populous states to give you a sense of how long it typically takes to get a refund there. Finally, it's essential not to rely on your refund coming at any particular time. Numerous problems can arise to throw off a predicted refund schedule, including errors on your return or issues in getting it processed. Again, electronically filed returns tend to be more accurate and process more easily than paper returns, but even with e-filing, there's no guarantee that your refund will be in your account on any particular day. If you're expecting a state tax refund, look at your own state's tax agency website to get details on how quickly it believes it will be able to process refunds. That way, you'll know what timeframe is likely and be able to inquire further if your refund is late. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) has seen its stock price fall 26% over the past 12 months. Some of that decline can be attributed to investors reacting too harshly to mediocre earnings reports or analysts' downgrades. But long-term investors are looking to the semiconductor company's augmented reality (AR) technologies as the company's saving grace. The Taiwan-based company certainly looks like it could be a key component provider to AR device makers, and Himax is betting that most of its future growth will come from this market. The company made 21.5% of its total revenue from its non-driver business (which includes AR tech) in the third quarter of 2016, and is expecting more growth in 2017 and 2018. There are plenty of reasons why augmented reality might become a major computing platform in the near future, but Himax's focus on market could end up being risky. Here's why: The AR market is expected to be worth $90 billion by 2020, according to research by Digi-Capital. Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Snap, and other major tech companies are all pursuing AR with both hardware and software, but even as businesses invest in this growing market, there's certainly no guarantee that it will be as transformative or lucrative as they expect. As a consumer technology, augmented reality is still in its early stages. It's likely still five to 10 years away from becoming mainstream, and even Digi-Capital (which is very bullish on AR) says that it could be 2025 before the technology is pervasive to the degree that smartphones are now. The augmented reality market is growing, but even by 2018, there is only expected to be an installed base of 100 million AR and virtual reality (VR) headsets worldwide. As Digi-Capital notes, that's just a small fraction of the size of the  installed base of smartphones and tablets. In short, even if AR does turn out to be the next big computing platform, it still could take a long time for it to grow to the same level that mobile has reached today. Now, to be fair, just because augmented reality might get off to a slow start doesn't mean it'll be a failure. Nor does it mean that Himax won't benefit in the long run from its bet on the platform. The company is already working with 30 AR customers, and says that new hardware will go into production in late 2017 for a major one. That was three years ago, and today, none of us are wearing AR glasses, and most consumers still scoff at the idea of wearing them. Sure, there are examples of AR headsets being used for medical training, engineering, design, industrial maintenance, etc. But these are still niche uses, and not exactly good indicators of mass augmented reality adoption. I've been a bit critical of AR's potential in this article, but I do think it could become a transformational technology. The point I'm trying to get across is that Himax appears to be betting a lot on AR's growth -- and if consumers don't respond to it as Himax hopes, then the company will suffer. Himax Technologies has said that AR will increase its liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) and wafer-level optics (WLO) revenue, and says that it ""believes this is just the beginning of a long-term growth story."" That might be true, but if the AR market takes too long to ramp up, or ends up fizzling out before it really gets started, then that long-term growth story might end up getting cut short. ","

Adam Levy,01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Amazon. In CEO Jeff Bezos' annual letter to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders from April 2016, he highlighted the company's three pillars: Prime (its $99-a-year membership), Marketplace (where it sells items), and Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing business). All three have been instrumental to Amazon's success over the past decade-plus and Bezos wrote, ""I assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth [pillar]."" It looks like that fourth pillar could be the Echo smart speaker featuring the Alexa digital assistant. It's been two years since Amazon unveiled the Echo, which can serve as a hub for other smart-home devices like thermostats and lightbulbs, and its functionality has been extended through third-party ""skills,"" which function like voice-controlled apps. Amazon has the scale and infrastructure necessary to grow the Echo and Alexa into its fourth pillar. Nobody expects using voice-activated digital assistants will replace using smartphones or desktop computers, not even Bezos. However, there's clearly a growing trend toward using voice search and interacting with digital assistants. Google recently released a device similar to Echo, Google Home, in order to take advantage of the trend. Additionally, the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary said voice searches tripled over the last two years. As the artificial intelligence (AI) powering these devices improves, their usefulness increases. And as they're used more, the AI improves, creating a virtuous cycle. Amazon has a first-mover advantage in the smart speaker category, and its success with its Kindle line gives consumers confidence in its brand. But Amazon's biggest advantage with the Echo and Alexa is how it can integrate its existing Prime and Marketplace pillars into its Echo business. One of the primary ways Google is considering monetizing voice searches is through commerce. It recently released a development kit for retailers and service providers to create apps for Google Assistant -- the AI powering Google Home and found in several other Google apps -- to connect with potential customers. Eventually, Google plans to take a cut of sales made through these apps. But Amazon already has a direct line to customers and a huge marketplace of items -- one of its three pillars. Customers can order products using Alexa, and Amazon will use your order history to figure out what you want or choose an item based on user reviews and pricing. Of course, that feature is only available to Prime members -- urging more customers to sign up for the service. Non-members can still ask Alexa to add items to their cart for checkout later, but they'd have to finish ordering the old-fashioned way and using your fingers to buy stuff online is so 2014. As such, Alexa serves to support Amazon's Marketplace and Prime and vice versa. Similarly, Prime supports the  Marketplace business by increasing customer loyalty and attracting new third-party sellers to the platform. That, in turn, brings more Prime-eligible products to the Marketplace, increasing the value of Prime. Adding Alexa to the mix strengthens the other two pillars, making it another pillar. Amazon is putting a lot of money behind marketing Alexa. It's been running a television and digital video ad campaign over the last year, including a Super Bowl commercial starring Alec Baldwin. Amazon produced over 100 10-second spots for the campaign based on real-life use cases of the voice assistant. Most recently, Amazon struck a deal with Wynn Hotels to put an Echo device in each of Wynn's 4,748 Las Vegas hotel rooms. The device will be able to control the lights, temperature, drapes, and TV, with potentially more features to come. It's a clever marketing ploy that will introduce thousands of people to the Echo and allow them to have a firsthand experience using it. Behind the scenes, Amazon has over 1,000 employees working on Alexa, according to Bezos. He also said the current functionality of Alexa is ""just the tip of the iceberg."" It's clear from its investments that Amazon sees the huge potential of Alexa. It's not just a stand-alone product, but a potential pillar of its business that supports its other operations -- specifically, Marketplace and Prime. ","

The Internet of Things (IoT), which links mobile devices, wearables, home automation devices, cars, and other gadgets to each other and the cloud, is frequently considered the next big growth market for hardware and software makers. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) estimates that the number of connected devices worldwide will double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion by 2020. Image source: Getty Images. That's why chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm launched new low-power chips for IoT devices, and networking leaders like Cisco and Juniper Networks added IoT features to their networking hardware and software. Looking ahead into 2017, the battle over the IoT market will likely heat up as these companies expand their hardware and software ecosystems. Let's take a look at the four main trends investors should pay close attention to. The Mirai botnet and its variants recently hijacked unsecured IoT devices -- like IP cameras and routers -- to take down major websites with DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. Those attacks revealed that many IoT devices were poorly protected from a type of threat that was previously rendered obsolete on PC and mobile platforms. If additional attacks occur in 2017, many organizations and consumers could reconsider connecting everything to the Internet of Things. However, Cisco, Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), and other security giants are already developing new tools for securing IoT devices. Cisco's acquisition of IoT platform provider Jasper will help its cybersecurity tools reach more connected devices, and Symantec helps IoT device makers build more secure products. These efforts could eventually make IoT devices as secure as PCs or mobile devices. Another key concern about the IoT market is privacy. Back in 2015, several German automakers expressed concerns about letting Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google track their drivers' activities in connected cars. That's why Audi, BMW, and Daimler teamed up to buy Nokia's HERE Maps as a Google Maps alternative later that year. A recent murder case for which an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo might provide evidence also highlights the consequences of installing ""always on"" IoT devices in homes. Police and prosecutors believe that audio files from the device could help them crack the case, but Amazon has refused to turn over the files due to privacy concerns. Amazon Echo. Image source: Amazon. Privacy advocates believe that the case would set a precedent for letting law enforcement agencies access smart home devices. That would pose a problem for companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which thrive on ""learning"" more about their users to produce targeted shopping and advertising experiences. Bullish forecasts about the IoT market have fueled a land grab across the market. That stampede yielded some innovative products like Amazon's Echo and Google Home, but the market is also filled with oddball devices like smart water bottles, fitness trackers for dogs, connected umbrellas, and smart tampons. The proliferation of frivolous devices suggests that a big bubble in the IoT market is brewing, similar to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s in which websites were launched for all sorts of impractical purposes. And just like the dot-com bust of 2000, an IoT bust could purge the market of the weaker players and create a more refined field for leaders like Amazon and Google to expand their IoT ecosystems. But as Amazon, Google, and other companies gradually advance into our homes, their ecosystems will start overlapping. Amazon will leverage its market-leading position in e-commerce and prisoner-taking Prime ecosystem to push devices like the Echo, Dash buttons, Kindle Fire, and Fire TV into homes to widen its moat against potential challengers. Google will leverage its knowledge of your search, web browsing, location, and ad-clicking histories to personalize its smart home devices like Home. Its connections to Android, the most popular mobile OS in the world, make its smart home platform a practical extension of mobile devices for many users. But that's not all: Apple is trying to tether IoT devices to its HomeKit platform, and Facebook plans to launch its Jarvis home AI in the near future. This means that the same battle that was previously waged across websites, mobile apps, and hardware will rage on in your living rooms next year. The Internet of Things is a fascinating new market, but investors should take companies' lofty IoT promises with a grain of salt. Security and privacy concerns will still loom large next year, while hardware and software companies will clash over competing ecosystems. ","

The company founded by Sam Walton credits its extreme focus on low prices for helping it grow from a tiny regional player into a global retailing titan. The entire half-century trip -- with the exception of the most recent past -- has been enormously rewarding for shareholders. I'll touch on that slowdown in a moment, but first here's a look at how well early investors made out with a Wal-Mart stock purchase. Image source: Getty Images. Wal-Mart stock started trading on Oct. 1, 1970, when the company offered 300,000 shares to the public at a price of $16.50 per share. That $5 million initial market capitalization translates into about $31 million in today's dollars. Considering the company is now worth over $200 billion, it's fair to say that a Wal-Mart investment has outpaced both inflation and the broader stock market. WMT long-term stock history data by YCharts, But there's much more to the total-return picture than just capital appreciation. Wal-Mart has paid -- and boosted -- its dividend each year since 1974. The annual dividend most recently hit $2 per share, or just under half of the company's annual earnings. Wal-Mart's newest shareholders haven't enjoyed blockbuster returns. In fact, the stock has trailed the market over the past three-, five-, and 10-year periods, but adding dividends into the picture makes the stock a winner over the last decade. Investors turned especially bearish over the last two years as Wal-Mart suffered from a period of customer traffic declines that it responded to by boosting spending on the shopping experience through initiatives like raising wages and stocking more products on shelves. These changes helped traffic levels begin inching higher again -- at the expense of profit growth. Operating income last quarter slumped by 11%. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart still routinely lags rival Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which is enjoying about twice the retailing-titan's sales-expansion pace. The warehouse giant also focuses on offering the lowest possible price to customers, and its traffic growth only recently slowed after six-straight years of 4% or better gains. WMT 5-year stock history data by YCharts. While it fends off market-share threats from Costco and other discount retailers, Wal-Mart also must face major challenges from online competitors. Over the last decade, e-commerce has surged from accounting for 3% of the retailing industry to more than 8%. Much of that growth has come at the expense of traditional retailers like Wal-Mart. In response, the company is plowing investments into its online infrastructure, with $1 billion of spending slated for 2017. However, it's far from clear whether that spending will deliver long-term returns. E-commerce accounted for just 0.2 percentage points of Wal-Mart's 1% sales uptick in its most recent fiscal year. Investors considering a Wal-Mart purchase today are looking at a much different business than the one that went public 46 years ago. Most importantly, its growth options are limited by its massive size and by unfavorable retailing trends. On the other hand, Wal-Mart's scale gives it considerable benefits, too, including massive resources that it can devote toward improving its position with shoppers both in its stores and on the internet. The next half-century will no doubt involve vast changes to the retailing industry, but it's likely that Wal-Mart's approach of price leadership will still be resonating with customers decades from now.

Shares are collapsing in early-morning trading on Tuesday, falling more than 68% as of 10:05 a.m EST after the company reported results from a phase 3 study that failed to meet its primary endpoint. Inotek Pharmaceuticals announced top-line results of its MATrX-1 trial on Tuesday. This study was testing the company's lead compound -- trabodenoson -- as a hopeful treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). The MATrX-1 study was a placebo-controlled trial that was designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of trabodenoson over a three-month period. The study's primary endpoint was a reduction of intraocular pressure as compared to the placebo group when measured at four separate time points on days 14, 28, 42, and 84. The drug was also administered in three separate formulations: 3%/1,000 mcg once daily, 4.5%/1,500 mcg twice daily, and 6%/2,000 mcg once daily. Unfortuanlty, top-line results from the trial showed that trabodenoson failed to achieve clinical superiority to placebo at all of its measured time points. Inotek CEO David Southwell stated that he was disappointed with the results but noted that the miss ""was driven primarily by the unexpectedly stronger placebo response at the 8AM time point."" He later went on to say that the company is waiting for additional data from the trial before they will determine next steps. Given that this was the company's most advanced clinical program, it is no surprise to see that shares are tanking on the news. While this clinical result is very disappointing, management did point out that the 6% dose of trabodenoson did show a statistically superior result over placebo at days 84, 42, 14, and a marginally superior result at day 28. In addition, there were no significant safety or tolerability events reported and the study's discontinuation rate was only 2.2%. Those figures could suggest that there is still some hope for this program. Looking ahead, the company is planning to announce results from its phase 2 trial using trabodenoson in combination with latanoprost as a hopeful treatment for glaucoma later this year. If that trial shows more encouraging results, then it is possible that shares could start to bounce back from Tuesday's drubbing. Still, there's no doubt that this report casts doubts over trabodenoson's efficacy. For that reason, I'd recommend that potential investors look elsewhere for opportunities. ","

Nationwide, the average American under age 65 is earning $46,409 per year, according to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. However, average income varies significantly by age, and a more useful comparison for determining your financial preparedness may be your contribution rate to savings accounts. Are you on track for financial security? Read on to learn Americans' average income by age, and how much average Americans are saving for their golden years. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. As the following chart illustrates, our mean and median incomes start off low, build steadily into our 40s, and then begin declining up to and throughout our retirement: IMAGE SOURCE: CENSUS BUREAU, CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY 2016. If your income is above these figures, don't pat yourself on the back too quickly, because while the amount you earn has a big influence on retirement preparedness, an equally important figure is the percentage of income that you're saving. After all, a high income that's hardly saved at all won't guarantee financial security in the future. An individual earning $40,000 per year over a forty-year career who saves 5% of his or her income annually, or $2,000, and earns a hypothetical 6% interest rate, would end up with a nest egg valued at $310,142.98. Meanwhile, someone earning $30,000 who saves 9% of his or her income annually, or $2,700, would end up with a significantly higher $417,857.31 set aside for retirement. Therefore, it's most useful to focus on -- rather than how your income stacks up -- the percentage of your income you're saving compared to your peers. According to Transamerica, the average American worker is contributing 8% of income to employer-sponsored retirement plans annually. Baby boomers are socking away 10% per year, while Generation X and millennials are saving 7% of their income per year. Unfortunately, even at those contribution rates, average retirement savings levels suggest that many Americans will face a big gap between retirement income and retirement spending. Roughly 50% of baby boomers have saved less than $100,000 for retirement, and more than a third of baby boomers have saved less than $50,000, according to PwC's Employee Financial Wellness Survey. Typically, it's recommended that individuals withdraw no more than 4% of their savings annually in retirement, so those nest eggs aren't likely to kick off much in the way of retirement income. As a result, millions of Americans will rely heavily on Social Security. Currently, one quarter of married retired couples and 43% of singles count on Social Security for 90% or more of their annual income. Since the average Social Security check is expected to be only $1,360 per month in 2017, that's a worrisome statistic. Even more concerning, however, is the fact that more money is being paid out in Social Security benefits than is being collected in payroll taxes. Because that's forcing the Social Security Administration to draw down its trust fund, recipients could face steep cuts to their benefits as early as 2034, says Social Security's board of trustees. Boosting income can obviously have a substantial benefit on your retirement savings. However, you can still make up ground by maxing out your contribution rate to your retirement plan, if a raise or job change isn't in the cards. If your contribution rate is below average, then create a plan now to increase it. Even if your budget is too tight to increase your rate to double digits immediately, increasing it by 1% annually could get you on pace for success, without forcing you to make major changes to your lifestyle.

    Americans' Average Income by Age -- How Do You Compare? -- The Motley Fool

Maurie Backman,01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. We all love a good restaurant meal, and there's something to be said about feasting on delicacies without having to do an ounce of cooking or cleanup yourself. But while there's certainly nothing wrong with indulging every so often, it seems as though Americans are taking the concept of eating out to an extreme. From 2015 to 2016, for the first time in history, Americans spent more money at bars and restaurants ($54.857 billion) than they did on groceries ($52.503 billion). And while data from previous years still show grocery sales edging out restaurants and takeout, that shrinking margin points to a serious spending problem among consumers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2014, the average American household spent $2,787 on restaurant meals and takeout, compared to $3,971 on groceries. But in 2015, the average amount spent on restaurants and takeout jumped $221 to $3,008. Grocery spending, by contrast, increased just $44 per household to $4,015. What this tells us is that dining at restaurants and ordering takeout aren't just luxuries anymore. Rather, they're becoming the norm. And our finances are hurting as a result. Image source: Getty Images. Recent data reveal that 69% of Americans now have less than $1,000 in a savings account. These findings are consistent with a report from the Federal Reserve Board confirming that almost 50% of Americans don't have $400 on hand to cover an unplanned expense or emergency. And while our dining habits aren't necessarily to blame for our collective lack of savings, they certainly don't seem to be helping matters. Of course, we all need to eat, which means food must account for a portion of our monthly spending. But there's a big difference between buying groceries and paying for restaurant meals and takeout. Most food establishments charge a 300% markup on the items they serve. This means that any time you spend $15 on an entree, the food you're eating only costs $5 to make. The fact that the average American family spends just over $3,000 a year on prepared food means we're all cheating ourselves out of an annual $2,000 -- money that could be instrumental in padding our emergency funds, getting out of debt, or saving for the future. Let's get one thing straight: If you earn more than enough money to cover your monthly bills, have plenty of cash in savings, and are on track for retirement, then by all means, spend what you want on restaurant meals. But unless you're in a great spot financially, dining out multiple times a week could have serious consequences. First of all, no matter how much you earn, it's crucial to have an emergency fund so you're prepared for the unexpected. Most people need three to six months' worth of living expenses in an accessible savings account, but if you have variable income or multiple dependents, it pays to aim even higher. If you're behind on emergency savings, cutting back on restaurant and takeout meals could be an easy step to help bridge that gap. Secondly, if you're carrying credit card debt, lowering your dining costs could help you pay off your balance sooner -- and that's a move that can save you money on interest charges over time. Imagine you owe $2,000 on a credit card with 20% interest, and it takes you three years to pay it off. By the time that debt is wiped out, you'll have wasted $675 on interest charges. On the other hand, if you cut back on dining out so that you're able to repay that balance in half that time, you'll spend almost $350 less on interest. Finally, think about what that extra money might do for your retirement savings. Imagine that instead of wasting $2,000 a year on restaurants and takeout, you invest that money and generate an average annual 8% return. After 20 years, you'd have an extra $91,000 for retirement.

    Here's What the Average American Spends on Restaurants and Takeout -- The Motley Fool

Dan Caplinger,01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Few stocks have as strong a reputation for innovation as 3M (NYSE:MMM). The Dow component has come up with many popular products over the course of its history, ranging from well-known consumer items like Post-It Notes to more specialist products with applications in areas from healthcare and manufacturing to energy. Yet despite a strong long-term record of good returns for investors, 3M hasn't split its stock since 2003, and many shareholders think that the company is long overdue for a stock split. With that in mind, let's look more closely at 3M to see whether 2017 might be the year that investors' wait will finally be over. Image source: Getty Images. Here are the dates and split ratios for the stock splits that 3M has done in the past: Date of Split Split Ratio Dec. 24, 1920 2 for 1 Dec. 16, 1922 2 for 1 Nov. 13, 1945 2 for 1 Jan. 8, 1951 4 for 1 May 18, 1956 2 for 1 May 15, 1960 3 for 1 May 23, 1972 2 for 1 May 22, 1987 2 for 1 March 15, 1994 2 for 1 Sept. 29, 2003 2 for 1 Data source: 3M investor relations. 3M's stock split history goes way back, and it's tough to get pricing information for its shares going back beyond the past half-century or so. However, looking at the more recent moves can still give us some insight into when 3M has been amenable to doing stock splits in the past. In 1972, 3M declared its first stock split in more than a decade. Prior to the move, 3M shares had traded in triple digits for quite a while, defying the popular convention of executing splits to keep share prices in line. Nevertheless, when the stock climbed almost to $160 per share, 3M didn't hesitate to make a move, sending the share price back into the mid-$70s. The subsequent bear market lasted throughout much of the remainder of the decade, keeping 3M's share price contained. It took until the mid-1980s for 3M shares to top the $100 mark, and the company once again didn't rush to make a move. Instead, the stock continued to climb, and by 1987, share prices at roughly $130 to $140 were enough to spur another 2-for-1 split to send the stock down to around $70 per share. The 1987 stock market crash had a minimal impact on 3M, and it only took until 1992 for the stock to regain the $100 per share mark. 3M then got faster about stock split decisions. The shares were only at $110 when 3M did its next split. After that, the stock hit the $100 level briefly on a couple of occasions, but it wasn't until 2003 that the company decided that those gains were sustainable. From a level of between $140 and $150 per share, 3M made its decision to do its final two-for-one split. Interestingly, 3M hasn't followed its previous playbook in considering a stock split in recent years. After the financial crisis, 3M shares hit the triple-digit mark in early 2013, and it went on to hit $150 per share by late 2014. Yet the conglomerate didn't make any moves to do a stock split, and a subsequent run to $180 per share still hasn't led to any serious discussion of a future move. One reason might simply be that industry practice governing stock splits has changed over the past decade. Many companies have allowed their share prices to climb not only well into the triple digits but also above $1,000 per share in some cases without doing a split. The emergence of discount brokers allowing odd-lot purchases of as little as a single share has made such decisions feasible, and some even see high share prices as a mark of success rather than a barrier to investor purchases. That said, the fact that 3M is a member of the Dow Jones Industrials could eventually spur a split in the future. 3M currently makes up about 6% of the Dow because of its price-weighted methodology, and that's almost double the weighting it would get in an equal-weighted index. Moreover, at just over $100 billion, 3M's market cap is far from being in the top two -- as its share price would suggest. 3M has given investors no reason to bank on seeing a stock split in 2017. Nevertheless, longtime shareholders should be pleased with the conglomerate's solid total returns and dividend income -- regardless of whether the company decides to give investors a split this year or in the future.

The choppy action was the latest reminder of how the market has struggled in recent sessions with the Dow unable to break above 20,000, a key psychological milestone that some analysts see as a resistance level for the market. “Once you get closer to 20,000, historically it’s been hard to get through on the first pass,” said Kepner. Still, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion’s share of the market’s postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth. That thesis is still viewed as intact, although the size and speed of the recent rally could lead investors to take profits. “There are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump’s policies don’t come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising,” said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was “fairly optimistic” about U.S. stocks.

Jim Santos,01052017,MarketWatch,12292016,"Published: Dec 29, 2016 11:39 a.m. ET For one couple, it began as an escape from the cold — and then it became their home By Just four years ago, taking an early retirement on a Pacific beach in South America was not part of my plan. Yet here I am, 58 years old, retired and living happily with my wife, Rita, on the southern coast of Ecuador. We are living healthier lifestyles at a fraction of our previous expense, and, best of all, our retirement nest eggs remain untouched. When we first started looking at Ecuador, it was mostly as a place to escape East Coast winters. We were based in Maryland at the time but could work anywhere that had internet and cellphone service, so we traveled a lot. Every place we went — Hawaii, the Caribbean, Italy — we played the “Could We Live Here?” game. But there was always something that just did not fit. Ecuador began to grow on us practically from the moment we arrived, on an exploratory trip in February 2013. We were drawn to Salinas, a coastal resort city on the Santa Elena Peninsula. The climate here is moderate year round. The Humboldt current brings cool breezes and an abundance of sea life. Temperatures rarely exceed 90 degrees or drop below 70. Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, and the constitution guarantees foreigners the same property rights as citizens. We also liked that it is in the same time zone as the Eastern U.S., which, at the time, made it easier to conduct business remotely. The clincher came when we started looking at property prices. Good-quality beachfront condo units with three or four bedrooms in Salinas were available for less than $250,000. Single-family homes of the same size just a block or two from the Pacific Ocean were listed between $175,000 and $200,000. By the second month after our arrival, we had purchased a four-bedroom, four-bath apartment in a modern oceanfront high-rise, with great amenities, security and 24/7 staff, for just $220,000. And within weeks, we had stopped thinking of Salinas as a winter getaway and started considering it our new home. Living here has brought some profound changes. After a year and a half, our expenses had dropped so much that there was no reason for me to continue in my job as a computer and networking professional. Our living expenses averaged $1,500 a month, compared with $6,000 when we lived in the U.S. I support myself now as a freelance writer, not because we need the income but because I enjoy doing it. We have no car, no mortgage and pay less than $300 a year in property taxes. We earn some income from a house we continue to own in the U.S. But not only are we not touching my 401(k) or our IRAs; we can still afford to contribute to them. We walk to the bank, market, restaurants and convenience stores. In fact, we spend most of our lives in the fresh air, as restaurants have outdoor seating, our produce, fish and meat markets are open-air, and shops tend to set their merchandise out on the sidewalks as well. For longer trips, an excellent bus system will get us anywhere in the peninsula for 30 cents (15 cents for those over 65), and cabs charge $2 or $3 to most of the places we need to reach. In addition to fresh seafood, we are blessed with a year-round growing season. Our mercado daily features a bounty of fresh fruits and vegetables priced so low that between the two of us, we cannot carry home more than $20 in groceries. Fresh eggs, dairy products, chicken, pork and beef (all raised without steroids) are also to be found there. Evenings, we enjoy getting together in small groups with our expat and Ecuadorean friends for dinner and conversation. There is an active and growing expatriate community in Salinas and the neighboring towns. There are expat bars and restaurants, poker nights, book clubs, groups that do charity work and so on. Rita and I are part of a subset that tries to live more like the locals. Also read:  10 of the best places in the world to retire So far we’ve been very pleased with the health-care system. If your health is generally good, fees for most services are so low you may opt—as we have—to pay for health care on an as-needed basis. A visit to the doctor’s office runs between $20 and $60. Last year, I had arthroscopic shoulder surgery in nearby Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, at the Hospital Clínica Kennedy, a fully equipped, modern hospital—one of the best in Ecuador. My total costs for the procedure, which included consultations and follow-up visits, sonogram, MRI, X-rays, cardiogram, two surgeons, an anesthesiologist and an overnight hospital stay: $6,000. A state-sponsored health plan available to Ecuadoreans and expats alike costs less than $80 a month for a married couple. Under this plan, care is free if you use the state-sponsored hospitals and clinics. But this can mean longer waits for an appointment, little choice in doctors, and less-modern facilities. Private health-insurance plans offer more flexibility for $200 to $500 a month for a married couple. But if you are over 65, most of these private insurers will not cover you. Nothing is perfect, and Ecuador is no exception. Expats usually must stick to bottled water, and we wash our produce and meats in antibacterial wash before eating. You also don’t have to travel far to get to villages where you will see pigs and goats looking for food along the mostly dirt roads. Be willing to learn some Spanish, and to roll with the differences in lifestyles. We have found that Ecuadoreans generally are not too concerned with punctuality, for example. Working with the local utility companies can be time-consuming and frustrating, as any change involves a personal visit or three. But our impression is that many people here love to celebrate life, loudly. During high season in Salinas it is not uncommon to hear music and parties all night long. For us, the best part of living here is the adventure of travel. We have taken several road trips, armed only with shaky GPS maps and our even shakier Spanish. Everywhere we go, from the fish markets of Manta on the coast to the capital city of Quito, high in the Andes, the people are friendly. Soon, we will be adding the Galápagos Islands to our list of great Ecuadorean destinations. There is more of South America we want to see as well. We are walking 50 miles or more a week to get in shape for a trip next year to Cusco, Peru. There we will hike the Inca Trail to the fabled ancient ruins of Machu Picchu, considered by many to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Jim Santos is a writer in Salinas, Ecuador.

Comcast stopped carrying YES in late 2015 because of a contract dispute. Keeping Fox News is important for Comcast, one of the nation’s largest pay-TV distributors with over 20 million subscribers. The news network is coming off its best year ever in terms of ratings and has a loyal audience. Terms of the roughly four-year pact weren’t disclosed, but people familiar with the matter said Comcast’s monthly carriage fee for Fox News will exceed $1.50 per-subscriber initially, with annual increases. According to consulting firm SNL Kagan, Fox News trails only ESPN, TNT and Disney Channel in subscription fees. Although there is an accord on YES, it won’t immediately return to Comcast subscribers. The channel will likely not be back until after the baseball season starts in the spring, people with knowledge of the pact said. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

Each dollar invested at the IPO has compounded at 35% per year, which I’m pretty confident will not continue. If it did, its market value would exceed $5 trillion by 2025. Amazon (black) vs. S&P 500 (red) This massive outperformance has led to an explosion in hindsight bias, with investors fooling themselves into believing Amazon’s ascent was somehow obvious or inevitable. But the truth is this 38,000%-plus return was handed to nobody; it was earned through enormous dedication. Actually, lunacy might be a better way to describe it, being that you had to be some sort of sociopath — void of any human emotions — to earn these monstrous gains. Below is an incredible chart I’ve shared before, which shows that Amazon’s path to a 38,000%-plus return was filled with heartache, despair and nausea. Amazon’s gains (green) and losses (red) Some of Amazon’s losses have been totally insane. The stock fell 15% over three days 107 times. It has lost 6% in a single day 199 times. And it fell 95% from December 1999 to October 2001. People anchor to Jan. 1 for diets and exercise — as well as investment returns. Every year the clock resets. So below I show the maximum intra-year drawdown, i.e. how far the stock fell from its high in each calendar year. Amazon has had a double-digit drawdown each year since going public and a 20% drawdown in 16 of 20 years. The average is minus 36% (and the median is minus 30%). I wanted to provide a reference point of just how insane this is, so I included the Dow Jones Industrial Average

                                   (sue me) in black. You’ll notice that Amazon had far deeper drawdowns in every year except in 2009 and 2015. Amazon drawdowns (red) vs. Dow drawdowns (black) People waste way too much time looking for the next Amazon, but I get it, it’s part of what makes investing exciting. So if you’re going to search for a potentially life-changing investment, here are a few things to consider: • A lot of people spend their life looking for the next Amazon. Few people ever find it. • Sticking to a boring 60/40 portfolio is hard enough. Focus on getting the big things right. • If you can’t help yourself, limit yourself to a few speculative ideas a year. Two or three sounds about right. • Keep the amount you wager small. No more than 1% or 2% of your portfolio. • Earning 100% on a stock can be an emotional roller coaster. Earning 10,000% can lead to a lot of sleepless nights. • Let’s say you do find a unicorn; as the dollar amount you have invested grows, you become much more sensitive to drawdowns. • Just because you take big risks does not mean you’re entitled to big rewards.

Maria LaMagna,01052017,MarketWatch,12292016,"Published: Jan 4, 2017 11:03 a.m. ET Many shoppers didn’t save before spending this holiday season By Call it the most debt-filled time of the year. Not every shopper budgets for the biggest shopping holiday. As a result, many consumers took on debt during this holiday season. More than 65% of those who took on debt did so unexpectedly, according to a survey from the personal finance company MagnifyMoney. The company used Google Surveys to find a nationally-representative sample of more than 550 who said they took on debt this holiday season. They took on $1,003 worth of holiday debt on average, up from $986 in 2015, a 1.7% increase, MagnifyMoney found, and about half of those surveyed said they will be paying off their debt for four months or more. Although spending can be seen as an indicator of higher consumer confidence in the economy, taking on holiday debt still isn’t a good thing, said Nick Clements, the co-founder of the company. Roughly one-third of retail sales take place during the holidays, according to the National Retail Federation, the industry group representing retailers. Holiday shoppers came out in droves this year: 154 million people planned to shop during Thanksgiving weekend, up from 151 million in 2015, the NRF said. The biggest holiday shopping day was Dec. 17, when 156 million people shopped. The NRF expects sales in all of November and December — excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales — to hit $655.8 billion this year, including non-store sales of $105 billion, up 3.6% on last year. What’s more, Black Friday and Thanksgiving online shopping surpasses $5 billion for the first time this year, according to estimates from software company Adobe Digital Index. Some forms of debt, including mortgages, indicate hope for the future, but Clements is “less optimistic about excessive borrowing on credit cards,” he said, calling it “a bad habit.” Nearly 60% of those MagnifyMoney surveyed said they put their holiday debt on credit cards. And they’re not alone: American households with credit card debt have an average of $16,061, up from $14,546 10 years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “It’s so easy to spend an extra $5, $10 or $20 when you’re just swiping,” Clements said. Case in point: Paying interest on credit-card debt can put individuals in financial trouble, such as this family who racked up $89,000 on 11 credit cards and had to take on additional jobs and slash their spending as a result. For those who want to get their spending under control, during the holidays or any other time of year, Clements suggested going on an all-cash spending diet. Although those using only cash would miss out on credit-card rewards, tracking spending this way “forces you to pay attention,” Clements said. “You’re so much more careful.” Consumers should also force themselves to read their credit-card statements, instead of ignoring them because of regret and anxiety, he added. They should also check their credit scores and try to improve them in the New Year by paying bills on time and considering refinancing debt, he said.

Oh, yeah, he also served as commander of the International Space Station. Now, retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield is feeling the love over a year-end tweetstorm that put a positive spin on a bruising 2016. The social-media legend got the ball rolling with this New Year’s Eve tweet: With celebrity death and elections taking the media by the nose, it’s easy to forget that this year saw a great many positives. Let’s look. From there, courtesy of “memory and a substantial bit of help from google,” Hadfield rattled off 46 reasons to smile back on the past year, although, as he acknowledged, “there are countless more examples, big and small.” For now, let’s focus on the 10 developments that resonated most across Twitter: 1. “The Giant Panda, arguably the world’s second cutest panda, has official been removed from the endangered species list.” 2. “Tiger numbers around the world are on the rise for the first time in 100 years, with plans to double by 2022.” 3. “The Colombian government and FARC rebels committed to a lasting peace, ending a war that killed or displaced over 7 million people.” 4. “The number of veterans in the U.S. who are homeless has halved in the past half-decade, with a nearly 20% drop in 2016.” 5. “India’s dogged commitment to reforestation saw a single-day event planting more than 50 million trees, a world record.” 6. “Costa Rica’s entire electrical grid ran on renewable energy for over half the year, and their capacity continues to grow.” 7. “An Ebola vaccine was developed by Canadian researchers with 100% efficacy. Humans eradicated horror, together.” 8. “Juno, a piece of future history, successfully flew over 588 million miles and is now sending back unprecedented data from Jupiter.” 9. “Malawi lowered its HIV rate by 67%, and in the past decade have seen a shift in public health that has saved over 250,000 lives.” 10. “Finally — The Cubs won the World Series for the first time in 108 years, giving hope to Maple Leafs fans everywhere.

Michael Brush,01052017,MarketWatch,12292016,"Published: Jan 4, 2017 5:21 a.m. ET They’re among the best-performing investment-newsletter writers By Here’s a worthy New Year’s resolution for you: Stop paying so much attention to financial-market icons. You know who I mean. I’m talking about the likes of Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, George Soros and Bill Ackman. Instead, look beyond the media spotlight to a lesser-known group of successful gurus: investment-newsletter writers. After all, these unsung market heroes regularly perform well. And they are more open about their favorite stocks. One problem here is that you’ll have trouble identifying the best investment letter writers in the future. That’s because Mark Hulbert sadly pulled the plug on his long-standing letter-writer ranking service last year. Fortunately, a little secret to Hulbert’s system was that a small group of letter writers consistently dominated the performance lists. I’ve gotten to know this small group of elite performers because I’ve consulted with Hulbert over the past 15 years to tap the best letter writers for an annual New Year’s outlook and favored stock picks. Below is their take for 2017. These are all value investors who are normally loath to make market forecasts. But most of them were good sports about it, and went along anyway. And as money managers, they treasure the value of diversification to reduce risk. So, two stock picks is like fingernails on the chalk board for them. But that’s what I asked for, and they went along with that as well. As a stock-letter writer myself, it’s tempting to chime in here. But I’ve never been ranked by Hulbert, so I will stay out of this, other than to mention that Seattle Genetics

                                   was recently a top suggestion in my own letter, Brush Up on Stocks. Its stock was recently hit because it had to cancel some studies of one of its key cancer drugs due to patient deaths. But not all studies of the drug were halted, and Seattle Genetics has many other irons in the fire. So while the patient deaths are obviously a tragedy, the company should overcome this obstacle, which means the current weakness offers a good entry point. Now, on to the investment-letter gurus. Go with turnarounds George Putnam, a money manager who pens Turnaround Letter, expects modest market gains of around 3% in 2017. “The economy is still pretty strong, and I think earnings are going to be OK. But the S&P 500 has had a great run over last several years, and it may run out of gas,” says Putnam. Of course, the big unknown is President-elect Donald Trump. “He may be able to regenerate some optimism about business,” says Putnam. “The risk is he does something dumb that causes a real problem.” Now, for Putnam’s picks. Crocs 
CROX, +0.55%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                   Recent price: $6.85 People either love or hate Crocs’ weird rubber shoes. There’s not much in between. Ten years ago, Crocs lovers ruled the day. The company’s stock was a high flyer, trading above $70 in 2007. Then Crocs crashed and burned. It brought in new management. But they didn’t have the right experience, so the company had to reset again in 2013, with help from Blackstone Group

They’re now doing basic block-and-tackle work like closing unprofitable stores and revamping distribution networks. Crocs may never be a high flyer again. But Putnam is betting that as the overhaul continues, the stock will move significantly higher. “They are starting to get traction,” he says. Oaktree Capital 
OAK, -0.78%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                   Recent price: $37.50 Companies issued high-yield debt at record levels for much of 2010-2015. Now, a huge amount of it comes due over the next five years. With interest rates going up, it will be harder for many companies to refinance that debt. “Some fraction isn’t going to make it,” predicts Putnam, who follows this market closely. “It is going to have to be restructured.” That will play right into the hands of Oaktree Capital, which specializes in helping companies refinance and restructure distressed debt. “I think this is going to be a great opportunity for all kinds of distressed security firms and for distressed debt firms like Oaktree,” says Putnam. “The climate should be good for them.” Oaktree is well-positioned, because it has more dry powder, or funds available for this use, than it has ever had, notes Brian Frank, president of Frank Capital and manager of the Frank Value Fund

So if we have some relief with some of those things, there will be more bounce in everybody’s step.” Royal Caribbean Cruises

But this pastime isn’t just for the elderly. “It’s a great way to see the world, and more people are starting to realize that. People are getting interested in cruises at a younger age,” says Buckingham. Another favorable trend is the growth of the middle class in China. Meanwhile, the three main cruise companies — Royal Caribbean, Carnival

That’s left Amgen, one of the best in the space, trading at just 13 times earnings. To Buckingham, that’s too cheap to pass up, for a quality company with a strong balance sheet. Amgen has important drugs like Repatha, for controlling cholesterol. And it’s rolling out biosimilars like Amjevita, a copy of a blockbuster anti-inflammatory treatment called Humira made by

Buckingham also likes the 2.7% dividend yield. Give a “fool” his due Motley Fool Inside Value editor Richard Greifner unabashedly has no market view for 2017. “I have no special ability to call the market. I don’t know of anyone who can constantly do that, and certainly I can’t.” He does have favorite stocks, of course. Though like many of the best investment letter editors, he feels a little queasy about a one-year time horizon. He prefers to look at stocks as “holds” for three years or more, which makes a lot of sense. Starbucks 
SBUX, -1.01%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                   Recent price: $55.50 Like its coffee, Starbucks stock has never been cheap. At least by any of the yardsticks favored by value investors. It probably never will be. But after the December pullback that shaved about four points off its stock price, Starbucks now looks “attractively” priced, and that’s good enough for Greifner. “For a company of this caliber, if you can buy it at a good price, you should do very well over time,” he says. Starbucks stock has been weak because third-quarter sales growth slowed to 4%, after 25 consecutive quarters of 5% growth or more. But Starbucks still has a lot of growth left, especially abroad in places like China, India and Brazil. “I think people underestimate that,” says Greifner. “It has such a strong, beloved brand worldwide. The brand is the biggest thing the company has going for it.” Starbucks, for example, estimates it can increase its store base by almost 50% over the next five years. Priceline

                                   Recent price: $1,466 The key to this investment is to look beyond the cheesy William Shatner commercials — to Europe. There, Priceline’s booking.com is the top travel website. Unlike the U.S., where the hotel business is dominated by a few chains, Europe has a lot of smaller, independent hotels. “So they are more reliant on booking.com to bring in guests,” says Greifner. The website got into the business in Europe early. So it was the first to build up a network of hotels that is tough for competitors to replicate. This makes for a good barrier to entry. “They have a couple years head start over the competition, which turned into this insurmountable barrier,” says Greifner. Booking.com is a “tremendously profitable business” with solid growth prospects as more hotels come online, says the Motley Fool Inside Value editor. Use this little-known trick to spot value Near term, there could be market trouble because the Trump rally may fade, says Investment Quality Trends editor Kelley Wright. “There’s an awful lot of enthusiasm right now. I am not sure how long it will last, when the reality sets in on how hard it is to get through a legislative agenda.” Ultimately, though, greater infrastructure spending will spur jobs and wage growth, and help produce 8%-10% gains for the S&P 500 this year, says Wright. To find stocks that might do the best, Wright looks for financially sound companies with a long history of paying dividends. Then he favors those whose stocks have been beaten down to extreme lows. Wright doesn’t gauge this by looking for historically low stock prices on a chart. Instead, he looks for companies whose dividend yields have risen to historically high levels. As stock prices fall, dividend yields rise. Every company has a yield that has served as the peak over the decades. That’s the yield Wright looks for, to serve as a guide on when to enter a stock. Right now, companies in money management rank high by his methodology. Franklin Resources 
BEN, +0.29%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                   Recent price: $40 Take Franklin Resources, for example. Historically, it looks cheap whenever its stock has fallen so much that its dividend yield approaches 1%. But now it’s at 2%. “From a pure valuation standpoint, this is a layup the market is handing it to you. You have to go take it,” says Wright. Franklin Resources’ stock has traded down in part because it runs a lot of bond funds, which have been hurt by the selloff of bonds on worries about interest-rate increases. But money could flow back into bonds as rates rise, Wright says. Franklin Resources has also been hit by the recent investor preference for exchange traded funds (ETFs) over managed funds. But since Franklin Resources owns the prestigious Franklin Templeton family of funds, it should benefit nicely if this trend reverses. Eaton Vance 
EV, -2.11%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                   Recent price: $42 The repetitive high dividend yield for Eaton Vance over time has been 3%. It’s pretty close, with a current yield of 2.87%. Eaton Vance is plagued by the same problems Franklin Resources faces. Bond funds have recently performed badly, and investors favor ETFs over managed funds. But Eaton Vance recently bought Calvert Investments, a pillar in so-called sustainable investing. So, like Franklin, it is well-positioned if managed funds return to favor among investors. Will that happen? No one really knows for sure. But market trends tend to move in cycles. So if indices stall after years of steady, seemingly “easy” gains, stock pickers and managed funds could once again have their day in the sun.

That is up 17.6 cents from last month’s average and 36.6 cents higher than last year’s average. This chart shows the forecast breakdown for each month this year: GasBuddy forecasts a 2017 U.S. average price of $2.49 a gallon for gasoline. That would snap a yearly trend that has seen prices fall annually since prices averaged $3.60 in 2012. In 2016, prices averaged $2.13, down from $2.40 in 2015 and $3.34 in 2014. GasBuddy predicts that motorists will pay a total of $355 billion on gasoline in the U.S. this year—$52 billion more than last year. Motorists had saved $39 billion on gasoline in 2016 versus 2015 (see chart below). The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ “desire to boost oil prices from their two-year lull by cutting oil production is the major driver behind our forecast of higher [gasoline] prices,” said DeHaan. On Nov. 30, OPEC announced that it would cut output by 1.2 million barrels a day to a ceiling of 32.5 million barrels a day. Oil-producing nations not part of OPEC, including Russia, then agreed on Dec. 10 to cutback their output by nearly 600,000 barrels a day. Not long after the OPEC announcement, futures prices for gasoline

Last month’s average was $2.18, but last week’s average was $2.29. The OPEC deal is a “critical piece of the price puzzle,” according to GasBuddy’s Fuel Price Outlook 2017 report, written by DeHaan and fellow senior petroleum analyst Gregg Laskoski.

Both crude and retail-gasoline prices “have been on an OPEC upswing coming into 2017, and GasBuddy believes WTI oil prices, which traded above $53 a barrel on Wednesday, can potentially climb above $60 if oil producers stick to the pact. “The list of factors being mixed into the year forecast has never been larger,” said DeHaan. This year, the U.S. will also see Donald Trump’s administration take over and that is “perhaps the most oil-friendly in some time,” he said. Read: How Trump’s victory complicates OPEC’s oil output plans Taking all of that into consideration, GasBuddy reached its average price projection of $2.49 for the year. National gasoline prices are likely to peak at $2.67 a gallon in May as the seasonal switch to “summer-blend” gasoline as mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clean Air Act prompts a spike in the spring, GasBuddy said. Last year was “absolutely the year of cheap gas,” DeHaan said. But “2017 will not be a repeat of 2016, with prices notably higher,” he said. “While we’re unlikely to see record-setting highs, we will see more cities with gas prices rising to their highest in three years.” Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

Barbara Kollmeyer,01052017,MarketWatch,12292016,"Published: Jan 3, 2017 10:11 a.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By The new year is being greeted by gains across the board, with a whiff of good news from China seemingly helping out. “It’s all about markets going higher for 2017 — no matter the news, the math, or any consequences,” declares iBankCoin’s The Fly. “All those in front of the Dow train will soon be flattened out.” But much like following the best funds of 2016, investors might not want to play with any “best ideas for 2017” anyway. Our call of the day has another suggestion. In his letter to investors to kick off the new year, Sean D. Emory , founder of Avory Investments, says “performance chasing” is the main risk that his shop sees in 2017, as he blasts those annual “best ideas” lists. Investors should stop chasing and instead should always focus on big long-term plays. Here are the “high-conviction themes” that Emory likes for the long run: 1) Software companies that are vital to a business’s daily operations. Think payroll services, insurance products, financial services solutions and website creation that involves confidential information and in-depth training to use — i.e. investment that sticks around. 2) Shift from physical to digital. The digital revolution is taking place across video games

In short, he suggests paying it no mind. “If the ‘January Effect’ really were so predictable, wouldn’t market participants prepare for it by front-running it and buying ahead of time in order to benefit from it?” questions Richter, who surmises that everyone buying in advance basically eliminates the effect. Since 2006, he notes five positive Januarys and six negative ones. Back to the drawing board.

Krafcik said Waymo had reduced the cost of a single lidar unit by 90 percent, to about $7,500. Among major outside suppliers of this technology, Velodyne Lidar Inc and Quanergy Systems Inc both have said they are developing smaller solid-state lidar units that eventually would cost $200 or less. Waymo’s existing test fleet of self-driving cars, including some specially equipped Lexus RX450s and Google’s own “Firefly” prototypes, has accumulated nearly 2.5 million miles in less than eight years, mostly on city streets. Krafcik said Waymo planned to test the first self-driving Pacificas this month on public roads in California and Arizona. He did not say when the system would be ready to install in production vehicles. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google quickened the pace of its push into virtual and augmented reality this week as its hardware partners announced new devices featuring the company’s technology at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’s head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. “We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it’s for,” Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit. “By having options for both, they can cover the full potential market,” said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"The survey, conducted by consulting firm Accenture, found that among 32,715 people polled in 18 countries there was broad consumer demand for banks and insurance companies to use robo-advisory services, or software propelled by artificial intelligence or less human intervention. In Brazil, 50 percent of respondents said they would be willing to switch their personal accounts. In Indonesia and Italy, 47 percent and 42 percent of respondents, respectively, said they would switch accounts. But according to the survey, if the tech titans offered those services, 31 percent of global respondents would switch to Google, Amazon or Facebook for banking, and 29 percent would switch for insurance. Already a trend in the wealth management industry, Wall Street banks and investment firms are increasingly building or buying so-called robo-advisers to provide automated investment advice through web-based platforms at a lower cost than traditional financial advisers. “(Google, Amazon, Facebook) are setting the standards in terms of customer experience and personalization,” said Piercarlo Gera, senior managing director at Accenture Financial Services. Consumers look at banks and see a gap, Gera said. Google, Amazon and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While none of these companies currently offer bank or insurance products, Google and Facebook allow users to send payments to their contacts online. Amazon has a limited service providing loans to small sellers that it selects. It is unclear whether regulations in any of the countries in which the survey was conducted would allow these companies to have banking or insurance licenses. The survey was conducted from May to June in 2016, and respondents were asked to answer questions online. When it came to specific services, more than 7 in 10 respondents said they would use robo-advice to figure out what kind of bank account to open, and nearly 4 out of 5 said they would use it for investing. But 68 percent of respondents said they did not want a robot handling customer complaints, and 61 percent said they would prefer a human over an automated system for advice about complex products like mortgages. Accenture launched a partnership with Google in September for cloud, mobility and analytic strategies to clients in retail, healthcare, consumer products, energy and finance. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Messaging app Snapchat said it would make London the home of its international operations, delivering another vote of confidence in Britain’s tech standing as the country prepares to leave the European Union. The company, which has 150 million daily users globally, will book sales in countries where it has no local entity in Britain rather than routing them through lower tax jurisdictions like Ireland and Luxembourg as some other U.S. tech companies do. Snap Inc, which plans to go public this year in the biggest U.S. stock market debt since 2014, said the UK’s strong creative industries made the country “a great place to build a global business”. Despite the uncertainty sparked by the Brexit vote, London has remained attractive to global tech firms due to its pool of talent in the creative and tech sectors, many of whom have come from Europe and further afield. The city’s position as a global financial hub also provides access to funding for start ups and capital for larger companies. Since the referendum decision in June, companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon have increased their investment, to the delight of Theresa May’s government. “We believe in the UK creative industries,” Claire Valoti, general manager of Snap Group in the UK, said on Tuesday. “The UK is where our advertising clients are, where more than 10 million daily Snapchatters are, and where we’ve already begun to hire talent.” Snapchat started in 2012 as a free mobile app that allows users to send photos that vanish within seconds. It now employs more than 75 staff in London, up from just six a year ago. Google said in November it would hire another 3,000 engineers and other staff in a 1 billion pound investment in London. Facebook is expanding its presence by 50 percent, saying its engineers wanted to be in London, a city with an “amazing ecosystem” of technology and creative companies. The additional tech jobs may be dwarfed by the number of jobs that could go in the financial sector if banks relocate to remain in the bloc, and tech firms have expressed concern about how Brexit could affect them. Leading tech firms and start-ups say they need to attract the best people, warning that restrictions on the movements of people would make London less attractive in the long term. Major U.S. tech firms including Facebook, Google and Apple have been criticized for the way they handle their tax affairs, opting to locate their European HQ in Ireland to take advantage of one of the lowest corporation tax rates in the EU. Amazon’s HQ is in Luxembourg for the same reason. Snapchat is not following that well-worn path. A spokeswoman said it had taken the “commonsense decision” to align its finance structure with its business operations. The company raised $1.81 billion in May, giving it a valuation of about $20 billion, but it only started to generate revenue from advertising a little over a year ago. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc’s digital assistant appeared almost everywhere at the CES technology show this week in Las Vegas, even making an unexpected appearance on rival Google’s Android system. Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc’s Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,” he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company’s Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google’s messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. “It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services,” he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. “A huge part of an assistant is search,” he said. “Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s largest mobile social media network WeChat is offering its 768 million users a function which allows them to by-pass app stores such as Apple’s APPL.O. The launch of “Xiaochengxu”, which translates as “mini programs”, challenges Apple APPL.O founder Steve Jobs’ idea of an app store overseen by the maker of the iPhone, the device which marked its 10th anniversary on Monday. App stores run by Apple and Google generate billions of dollars in revenue globally for them and China is a key target market as its users rely heavily on their phones for daily tasks ranging from grocery shopping to booking nail appointments. These would in the past have been downloaded via app stores run by Apple or local companies such as 360 and Tencent’s own platform for Android apps. Tencent said it had seen an “encouraging response” from merchants including Didi Chuxing, Dianping.com, Meituan.com, 58.com, JD as well as airlines, travel agencies and hotels. “The quality of the content will decide if the user will adopt it massively and drop their current app store, which I don’t think they will do,” said Alexis Bonhomme, ‎co-founder of CuriosityChina, a Beijing-based marketing agency specializing in helping brands market on WeChat. Apple and Google did not respond to requests for comment on the launch of Xiaochengxu, which garnered a mixed response on social media from Chinese users. “I don’t feel like it’s of much use,” one Weibo user wrote. “I had hoped that it would allow me to delete some apps and free up some space in my antique 16GB phone...But it turns out that the WeChat app itself uses up the most memory!” Since it launched in 2011, WeChat has become China’s most popular mobile social media platform. Its users can send text, audio and video message for free, as well as a combination of Facebook, Instagram and ApplePay functions within the app. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Nintendo’s hit smartphone app, Pokemon Go, and other augmented reality games are unlikely to be rolled out in China any time soon, after the state censor said it would not license them until potential security risks had been evaluated. Although not yet available in China, the world’s biggest smartphone and online gaming market, the location-based game developed by U.S-based Niantic took the world by storm when it was released last year. In the game, players must walk around real-life neighborhoods to hunt and capture virtual cartoon characters on their smartphone screens. But Pokemon Go has been blamed for road accidents, some of them fatal, involving distracted players, while data privacy concerns over the geolocation app have also stirred controversy. Prompted by “a high level of responsibility to national security and the safety of people’s lives and property,” the censor, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, is coordinating with other government departments to evaluate the game’s risks, an industry body said. These risks include the “threat to geographical information security and the threat to transport and the personal safety of consumers”, a games panel of the China Audio-video and Digital Publishing Association, which is governed by the censor body, said in a posting on its website. Some Chinese companies have been developing similar games based on augmented reality and location-based services, prompting the panel to seek advice from the top licensing body, it said. The game relies on Google services such as the company’s Maps application, which are blocked in China. Representatives of Niantic did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside their working hours. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Online messaging services such as WhatsApp, iMessage and Gmail will face tougher rules on how they can track users under a proposal presented by the European Union executive on Tuesday which could hurt companies reliant on advertising. The web companies would have to guarantee the confidentiality of their customers’ conversations and get their consent before tracking them online to target them with personalized advertisements. For example, email services such as Gmail and Hotmail will not be able to scan customers’ emails to serve them with targeted advertisements without getting their explicit agreement. Most free online services rely on advertising to fund themselves. Spending on online advertising in 2015 was 36.4 billion euros, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB). The proposal by the European Commission extends some rules that now apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet, known as “Over-The-Top” (OTT) services, and seeks to close a perceived regulatory gap between the telecoms industry and mainly U.S. Internet giants such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft. It would allow telecoms companies to use customer metadata, such as the duration and location of calls, as well as content to provide additional services and so make more money, although the telecoms lobby group ETNO said they remain more constrained than their tech competitors. The proposal will also require web browsers to ask users upon installation whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers to deliver personalized advertisements. A previous version of the proposal would have forced browsers to set the default settings as not allowing cookies which are the small files placed on people’s computers when they visit a website containing information about their browsing activity. “It’s up to our people to say yes or no,” said Andrus Ansip, Commission vice-president for the digital single market. Online advertisers say such rules would undermine many websites’ ability to fund themselves and keep offering free services. “It will particularly hit those companies that ... find it most difficult to talk directly to end users and what I mean by that is tech companies that operate in the background and sort of facilitate the buying and selling of advertising rather than the ones that the user directly engages with,” said Yves Schwarzbart, head of policy and regulatory affairs at the IAB. But the CEO of advertising tech company Appnext, whose revenues come entirely from advertising spending, said the new rules would bring clarity and would not have a significant impact on business models or revenue. “There is no doubt that it is time for the entire ecosystem to become more transparent and fair to all of the stakeholders. Users want easy access to trustworthy sources of information while feeling safe with the data they share,” Elad Natanson said. Companies falling foul of the new law will face fines of up to 4.0 percent of their global turnover, in line with a separate data protection law set to enter into force in 2018. The proposal will need to be approved by the European Parliament and member states before becoming law. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An iconic photo of three-year-old Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi washed up dead on a Turkish beach had a greater impact on fundraising efforts for Syrian refugees than hundreds of thousands of deaths, a study has shown. The photo of Kurdi appeared in media across the world in the days after he drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in September 2015. His family were Syrian refugees of Kurdish origin, attempting to flee the war to Europe. “People who had been unmoved by the relentlessly rising death toll in Syria suddenly appeared to care much more after having seen Aylan’s photograph,” said the report, from science research institute ‘Decision Research’. The study used fundraising data from the Swedish Red Cross, which showed a significant increase in donations after news of Kurdi’s death, as well as data from Google Trends, which showed a major spike in searches for the terms “Syria” and “refugees”. Both the number of donors and the total raised increased after the photo circulated. In the week after Kurdi’s death, the study said the average number of daily donations to a Syrian refugee fund run by the Swedish Red Cross rose 100-fold. Before the photo circulated, the charity received fewer than 1,000 donations in a day; afterwards, it rose to almost 14,000. It said the average amount raised each day by the fund was 55 times higher, netting an extra 1.9 million crowns ($210,730) per day. While the surge in interest faded quickly, long term donations did rise. The study, authored by Paul Slovic from the University of Oregon, found the “newly created empathy waned rather quickly” after the initial burst of interest in Kurdi’s story, but Kurdi’s death prompted a 10-fold rise in those signing up for regular monthly donations. Only 0.02 percent of these donors had canceled by January 2016. “The main take-home message of this paper is that emotional reactions ... can influence actual donation behavior strongly,” Arvid Erlandsson, a contributor to the report, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Emotional reactions are ... prone to fade out quickly, thus resulting in sharp increases and decreases in helping behavior, despite the existing need being very stable.” Erlandsson went on to suggest that charities and governments could try harder to channel “emotional reactions” into their fundraising efforts. The image of Kurdi joins other iconic photos that have come to symbolise human conflicts and tragedies, including Sharbat Gula, or ‘Afghan Girl’, whose image on the front cover of National Geographic magazine in 1985 is among the most famous of the Soviet-Afghan War. Similarly, the 1972 image of nine-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc fleeing a napalm attack in Vietnam came to symbolise the horrors of the Vietnam War. Kurdi died in September 2015, along with his five-year-old brother. Their family had fled from their home in the northern Syrian town of Kobani. Shots of the small boy’s body being cradled by a Turkish policeman circulated worldwide and galvanized several governments into policy changes, with the German government agreeing to admit thousands of refugees then stranded in Hungary only two days later. Over 5,000 refugees were killed in 2016 while traveling across the Mediterranean, according to the Missing Migrants Project. ($1 = 9.0162 Swedish crowns) ","

Deborah DSouza,01122017,Investopedia,01052017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On Wednesday, the U.S. Labor Department released a statement saying it had filed a lawsuit against Google Inc. (GOOG) since the company has failed to provide data and documents about employees at its Mountain View, California headquarters. The information regarding Google's equal opportunity program was requested in September 2015 as part of a scheduled compliance review of federal contractors. The evaluation is conducted to ensure contractors do not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran. “Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation,” said Thomas M. Dowd, the acting director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, in the statement. “Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation.” (See also: Risks Associated With Government Contracts) The DOL has asked the court to ""cancel all of Google’s current government contracts and to debar the company from entering into future contracts"" if it doesn't comply. Google responded to the lawsuit in a statement of its own that called some of the Department's requests ""overbroad"" and involving confidential information about employees. “We’re very committed to our affirmative action obligations, and to improving the diversity of our workforce, and have been very vocal about the importance of these issues,” the company said. Since 2008, Google has received $49 million in payments from contracts with federal agencies. A large portion of the work in the last two years had to do with advertising services. The Department of Health and Human Services paid the company $352,200 last year to place HealthCare.gov ads on third-party websites and Google search results. While $49 million is a laughably small amount for a company like Google, annual government spending on the firm's services has been rising.

""Both Apple and Google continue to lead the (technology) sector in matching their growth with an equivalent or larger supply of renewable energy, and both companies continue to use their influence to push governments as well as their utility and IT sector vendors to increase access to renewable energy for their operations,"" the report's authors wrote. They also commended Facebook and Apple for providing transparency and ""regular and easy-to-access reporting of their data center energy footprint."" (See also: 4 Things To Know About The Future Of U.S. Energy.) On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc.'s (AMZN) cloud service leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) was criticized by Greenpeace for being ""completely non-transparent."" The foundation said lack of data about AWS's operations coupled with the service's foray into regions that are dominated by dirty power (such as Virginia) makes it unclear whether AWS is on a renewable energy path. Streaming video providers Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) and Amazon Prime also did not fare well in the report. Both services earned an F for energy transparency. Amazon Prime earned a D for Renewable Energy Commitment & Siting Policy, while Netflix earned an F in the same category. Their low grades are a cause for concern because streaming video is expected to be big in the future. As the report points out, video streaming traffic will be responsible for more than 80% of the total traffic generated on Internet platforms by 2020. A research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory concluded that streaming video in America was responsible for consumption of 25 petajoules of energy and 1.3 billion kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions in 2014. That amount could increase in the future without an explicit commitment to renewable energy from video streaming providers. (See also: Carbon Trading: Action Or Distraction?) ""Netflix has stated that 'It's important that our data center providers commit to 100% green power through RECs and that they continue to find new and innovative ways to become carbon neutral.'

At the North American International Auto Show, the company said it had created a sensor package that has slashed costs for the technology by 90% by building it in-house. The Wall Street Journal reports that the package consists of a 360-degree-view radar, eight vision modules and three types of Light Detection and Radar (LIDaR) sensors. Waymo is primarily a software services company that partners with car manufacturers. It unveiled a Chrysler Pacifica minivan with self-driving capability made in conjunction with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Inv. (FCAU) at the show. The minivan is expected to be out on public roads by the end of this month. (See also: Alphabet Spins Off New Self-Driving Car Technology Company.) Sensors are typically the most expensive components in self-driving hardware. For example, Waymo said a LIDaR sensor typically cost $75,000 in 2009. A massive reduction in sensor prices could pave the way for large-scale hardware commoditization for self-driving cars and bring down their price tag. It could open the floodgates for mass-market production of self-driving cars and, in turn, create a market for Waymo’s services. A 2015 report by research firm Boston Consulting Group estimated that a fully autonomous car would add an additional $10,000 to the original price tag. According to that report, even a price tag of $8,000 for LIDaR sensors was too expensive for Google's cars. Tesla Motor Co. (TSLA), which is already including hardware for fully autonomous driving on its production line, charges $5,000 for Enhanced Autopilot and $3,000 on top of that for ""Full Self-Driving Capability."" However, the company doesn't use LIDaR sensors; instead, it uses a Tesla radar to achieve the same effect as LIDaR. (See also: Qualcomm Joins Self-Driving Car Coalition.)

Apple, Google, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon and Netflix took the top six spots in the annual poll of 50 companies conducted by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which drew on responses from more than 1,500 C-suite leaders. Apple topped BCG's list for the 11th straight year, which isn't surprising given the massive amount it spends on research and development (R&D). The consumer electronics giant invested $10 million into R&D for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, 2016, its financial statement showed. Meanwhile, Google's problem solving tactics and its famous '20 percent rule,' which encourages employees to dedicate 20 percent of their time to passion projects, ensured the search giant stayed in second place for the third straight year. Two Asian firms managed to make it into the top ten rankings, with South Korea's Samsung Group at number seven, followed by Japan's Toyota Motor in eighth place. A total of six Asian players were on the list in total. Ten European companies were featured, including Bayer at number 11, BMW at number 14 and Daimler at number 16.

Cheang Ming,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Google's bid to target emerging markets now includes encouraging small and medium businesses (SMBs) in India to make the move online. ""Small businesses that are online actually grow significantly faster,"" said Rajan Anandan, vice president of Southeast Asia and India at Google. A study published by Google and KPMG this month found that small businesses in India with a web presence grow their revenues twice as fast as those that without one in 2016. Titled ""Impact of internet and digitisation on SMBs in India,"" the study also revealed that 51 percent of digitally enabled SMBs were able to sell to customers beyond city boundaries in comparison to just 29 percent of offline SMBs last year. SMBs with a web presence are able to hire up to 5 times more employees than offline SMBs. In addition, the report also found that increased digital adoption by SMBs would potentially increase SMB contribution to the country's GDP by 10 percentage points to 47 percent by 2020. ""This is actually a pretty significant multiplier to GDP when you can get a small business online,"" Anandan told CNBC's ""Squawkbox"" on Monday.'' However, to achieve those lofty economic goals, more needs to be done to get business owners digitally connected. ""India has 51 million small and medium businesses and they employ about 120 million people. (SMBs) account for 37 percent of India's $2 trillion GDP. Although we have a large number of small businesses, 68 percent of these small businesses don't have any web presence,"" Anandan said. One of the measures announced by the company to target the problem and help small business owners capitalize on digitalization has been Google My Business. The tool aims to provide greater visibility to small businesses in India by letting small businesses establish a web presence for free and with just their smartphones. The My Business tool allows business owners to edit information about their businesses, including contact information, photographs and operating hours. This information then appears to potential customers on Google Search, Google Maps and Google+. Google's push to get a larger proportion of India's 1.25 billion population online goes beyond targeting only small businesses.

Phil LeBeau,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Waymo, the subsidiary of Alphabet formerly known as the Google Self Driving Car Project, is poised to offer its autonomous-drive technology in millions of vehicles as it lowers costs for key components and improves the reliability of its self-driving. ""Our latest innovations have brought us closer to scaling our technology to potentially millions of people every day,"" said John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo. Later this month in California and Arizona, Waymo will start testing its technology in Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Minivans, modified through a partnership with Fiat-Chrysler. It's the next step in a six year journey that has seen the Google self-driving car go from limited drives in a small number of modified Lexus SUV's, to testing a fleet of vehicles on public roads across four states. Over that time, the cost of LIDAR technology, which gives Waymo vehicles a view of everything on and around a vehicle driving down a street, has dropped dramatically. In fact, Krafcik said the cost of a package of LIDAR sensors and radar in a car—which , used to run approximately $75,000—has fallen by more than 90 percent. In addition, Waymo said it has now developed short and long range LIDAR sensors that allow its vehicles to ""see small people and objects close to the car, and spot tiny objects far away, too,"" the CEO said. ""We're serious about creating full self-driving cars that can help millions of people,"" said Krafcik. ""To do that, we have to oversee both the self-driving software and self-driving hardware."" The company says the performance of it self-driving technology is working four times better today than it was a year ago. As a result, Krafcik says Waymo's test drivers now take control of the vehicle and disengage the autonomous-drive system approximately once every five thousand miles driven. To date, Waymo and its predecessor have logged more than 2.5 million miles testing autonomous-drive technology. Waymo is not alone in the race to develop autonomous drive vehicles. Several automakers and tech firms are also investing heavily in the technology. While some companies like Tesla already offer semi-autonomous technology—where the driver can take their hands off the wheel for brief periods of time—it is likely to be several years before people can turn over the majority of the driving to the ""brains"" in their vehicle.

Mike Juang,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Alexa, the voice assistant built into the Amazon Echo, is one of many artificially intelligent (AI) personal assistants being deployed by technology companies to help consumers manage their homes and schedules. Amazon's gadget, which is quickly emerging as a strong rival to Apple's Siri and Google's Assistant, was a big hit at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Yet as a recent murder case illustrates, AI assistants are creating thorny legal and privacy questions that legal and cybersecurity experts are scrambling to understand. Because virtual assistants rely on microphones that, in some cases, may be continuously recording and sending information, that trove of information creates a delicate balance between law enforcement requests, corporate strategy and individual privacy rights. In 2015, an Arkansas man was found dead in a hot tub, and investigators issued a warrant to Amazon, requesting the company turn over audio recordings and information captured by an Echo smart speaker owned by the suspect. Although the internet retailer declined to give authorities the requested information, at least a few experts say the case may be a foreshadowing of things to come. That is because the convenience of voice-activated devices, which passively listen for a ""hot word"" or a ""wake word"" in order to activate, may come at a cost of individual privacy. In order to function, the device must constantly record and process all sound all the time, hoping to pick up on the wake word. A big part of the onus lies on the companies manufacturing the technology, explained Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an interview. ""We can still insist that these companies protect our privacy when the government comes for that data,"" he said. The trade-off between privacy and convenience, including the range of information captured, is generally acceptable to users — as long as they clearly understand what those gadgets record and what they do with the information. ""All those things are important to know if you're going to make an informed decision to use a piece of technology like this."" Central to privacy fears is that many voice-recognition devices are ""always listening,"" as a recent research paper jointly authored by Ernst & Young and the Future of Privacy Forum, an advocacy group, pointed out. Among the various types of microphone-enabled devices, each has different privacy implications that consumers should understand, the paper argued, ""influenced in part by whether data is stored locally…or whether it is transmitted from the device to a third party of external cloud storage."" It's a scenario that created a stir for Samsung in 2015, when a little-noticed provision in its Smart TV's privacy policy suggested spoken words could be recorded and transmitted to a third party. Jules Polonetsky, CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum, says in an interview with CNBC that the distinctions between devices create misunderstandings among users. He said that companies should make it obvious when a device is recording (typically via a flashing light or other visual indicator), and when and how smart assistants handle voice recordings. It creates a bond of trust between the user and the device — with significant potential for  backlash if the trust is broken. ""These devices are designed to not be useful to law enforcement,"" Polonetsky told CNBC. The lawyer and advocate said it was ""incredibly and highly unlikely"" that an automated assistant could capture a crime in progress. Nevertheless, the Arkansas investigation ""is an important wake-up call, because it shows that people are really ready to get very upset if they think they are being spied on,"" he added. Polonetsky says the real danger lies in devices that constantly record. ""It's a good reminder here to companies that they need to be mindful of only collecting what most of us want collected, which is our actual commands and directions,"" Polonetsky said, adding that ""there will be a real privacy scare when the real 'always-on' devices, such as the remote video cams and Wi-Fi connected baby monitors and the like, become more prevalent."" That day may be closer than some think, as smart devices explode in popularity and heighten cybersecurity risks.  A 2015 Gartner study estimated that consumers around the world are adding a staggering 5.5 million smart devices to their digital arsenal on a daily basis, and companies are responding by creating even more sophisticated devices. At the 2017 CES expo, General Electric announced a futuristic lamp that integrates Alexa, while LG unveiled a robot that relies on the voice assistant. Even home appliances manufacturer Whirlpool is getting into the act, with Alexa-enabled washers and dryers. The increased ubiquity of these devices, however, means that there is the ever-present danger of them being used for nefarious purposes — like the sophisticated Denial of Service attack that briefly crashed the internet in October. All of which means connected technology may make our homes smaller — but it comes at the cost of privacy and could even set consumers on a collision course with law enforcement. Only time will tell if gadget holders fully appreciate the trade-offs. ""Our home is just too private of a place,"" Polonetsky said. ","Servant or spy? Law enforcement, privacy advocates grapple with brave new world of AI assistants"
Saheli Roy Choudhury,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Alphabet's reasonable valuation and growing market share across segments could see the tech giant outperform rivals this year, according to Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. analyst James Cakmak. Cakmak told CNBC's ""The Rundown"" on Tuesday investor expectations for Alphabet were still relatively modest, potentially setting the stage for the company's shares to outperform. The parent company of Google has a ""pretty reasonable valuation at 10 times EBITDA,"" said Cakmak. ""I can't say the same about Facebook and Amazon."" In a separate Jan. 3 note, he estimated Alphabet's 2017 EV / EBITDA at 10.9 times, versus 19.2 times for Amazon and 13.5 times for Facebook. EV / EBITDA is the ratio of a company's enterprise value over earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The higher the EV/EBITDA number, the more overvalued a company is. Alphabet's market capitalization as of Tuesday stood at $563.04 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. For 2017,  Cakmak expects the company's earnings per share to come in at $32.63, up from 2016's estimate of $27.78. From an operational standpoint, significant progress in optimizing search experiences and ads, capturing brand ad dollars through YouTube and Google's prowess in natural language processing underpinned the favorable outlook for Alphabet, Cakmak noted. Alphabet has also made ""genuine efforts"" in healthcare and education, Cakmak added in his note. Meanwhile, Cakmak said in his note Amazon was a crowded trade, where the costs associated with content, logistics and competitive pricing pressure to Amazon Web Services were unlikely to have been fully incorporated into expectations. Facebook, on the other hand, was battling increasingly challenging competitors and threats to engagement. It could also potentially invest in photo messaging service Snap. He concluded the expectations for both Amazon and Facebook were ""extremely high"" and suggested their performances may not live up to investors' expectations; he maintained a neutral rating for both companies. Meanwhile, on the political front Alphabet was one of the better-positioned tech companies in Silicon Valley that was in tune with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, Cakmak said Tuesday. In December, Alphabet's executive chairman  Eric Schmidt and CEO Larry Page were part of the group of top executives from the world's biggest tech companies that gathered at Trump Tower to meet the President-elect. Jobs, skilled immigration and China were the main topics on the table at the meeting. Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos were also in attendance. Domestic jobs growth, particularly in the manufacturing sector, is a key agenda for Trump. By contrast, Silicon Valley is known for hiring foreigners under the H-1B visa scheme and outsourcing low-skilled, labor intensive jobs to the developing world. ""You look at the H-1B issue, I think that's something that the administration and Silicon Valley can work together around,"" said Cakmak. To offset the rising cost of shifting manufacturing back to the U.S., Trump and his team have talked about providing both tax and regulatory relief to companies. Additional tax relief on cash repatriation from overseas has also been on the agenda which, Cakmak believes, many Silicon Valley companies are in favor of.

Marguerite Ward,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"As many financial planners will tell you, building wealth is a process made of many small actions that add up over time. So if you want to see your bank account grow over the next year, adopting new money and lifestyle habits now is a smart way to start. Tom Corley, an accountant and financial planner, spent years researching and interviewing self-made millionaires on their daily habits. He published the results in his best-selling book ""Change Your Habits, Change Your Life."" In a recent post on his website, Corley recommends people adopt several key habits in 2017: 1. Have more money automatically transferred into savings Setting up an automatic bank transfer every month from your checking account to a savings account is a great way to build wealth, Corley says. Put aside $100, $50 or even just $20 each month, he suggests. By not seeing it in your checking account, you're less tempted to spend it. ""The more you have in savings, the more options you have to make money,"" Corley writes. ""Having money set aside in savings allows you to take advantage of opportunities. Without savings, opportunities pass you by."" Some examples of this include having enough in emergency and retirement savings that you can invest money in the stock market, launch a side business or purchase real estate that could yield a profit. 2. Build a relationship with one successful person ""Wealthy, successful people are very particular about who they associate with,"" Corley writes. ""Their goal is to develop relationships with other success-minded individuals."" Surrounding yourself with goal-oriented people will more likely than not encourage you to follow your own goals. If you don't know have highly motivated people in your network, Corley suggests volunteering to connect with other driven people, or joining a professional group.  3. Devote 20 minutes a day to developing a new skill Wealthy people have share one important trait: They are dedicated to self-improvement, Corley's has found. Reading a book about an unfamiliar technique, taking a class or joining a local meet-up group are great ways to develop a new skill. In fact, learning a new skill could help you land a job, one former Google career coach says. ""When you do things that are outside your comfort zone and outside that circle, it causes discomfort,"" Corley writes. ""But each time you engage in a new activity that causes discomfort, you expand your circle; you grow as an individual.""  4.  Adopt a ""frugal mindset"" ""On its own, being frugal will not make you rich. It is just one piece to the financial success puzzle, and there are many pieces,"" Corley writes. ""But being frugal will enable you to increase the amount of money you can save."" To be more thrifty with your money, Corley recommends three steps. 1) Be more aware of how you spend your money. 2) Only buy quality products and services. 3) Spend as little as possible by shopping around for the lowest price.  5. Track every penny you spend for 30 days ""Do you know where your money goes?"" Corley writes. ""Some do. They're called self-made millionaires."" By taking one month to track all of your spending, you'll be able to see if you are  spending excessively or if you are getting charged erroneously by any vendor. ""At the end of the 30 days, review where your money went,"" he says. ""You'll be surprised what you may find."" Video by Mary Stevens.

Palihapitiya said Amazon is the most important company on the planet, so much so that he dumped all of his Facebook stock and moved it into the e-commerce giant. He's stated in the past that Amazon will reach a $3 trillion valuation in 10 years. ""There's a handful of exceptionally good companies but there's always one company that's the best,"" Palihapitiya said on Wednesday at the CB Insights Innovation Summit in Santa Barbara, California. ""It does something that is just so fundamentally utilitarian and does it incrementally better everyday."" Palihapitiya started his firm Social Capital in 2011, and has rapidly become a force in Silicon Valley, known for prescient investments in start-ups and for developing a broader strategy that also backs public companies. He recently even launched a hedge fund. He's also not shy about speaking his mind. Alphabet is Palihapitiya's second favorite company for reasons that go way beyond search and mobile. Rather, he's bullish on Google's Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which are processors built for machine learning. In short, they're pushing computing farther and faster on less silicon, and Palihapitiya sees Google as the way the world will get to artificial intelligence at scale. ""They're an order of magnitude ahead,"" he said. With regards to Apple, Palihapitiya said the company is going down the path of Microsoft. Apple CEO Tim Cook, like former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, succeeded an iconic founder who'd built one of the world's great franchises and has thus been hampered by ""the legacy of that person."" Palihapitiya said he's not an Apple shareholder now and doesn't expect to be in the near future. But eventually, the company will get a leader further removed from founder Steve Jobs and less afraid of taking risks, similar to the approach Satya Nadella has taken since assuming the top job at Microsoft. ""At some point Apple will become much more aggressive and much more daring in taking their brand and capital to really reshaping markets,"" he said. In the meantime, he's baffled as to why Cook hasn't spent some of the company's more than $200 billion in cash to purchase Tesla, Netflix or Spotify.

Josh Lipton,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Apple reported Thursday that developers raked in $20 billion on its App Store in 2016, a 40 percent jump since 2015. That suggests Apple reaped at least $8 billion in revenue from its App Store, an analyst said. ""2016 was an amazingly great year for the App Store,"" Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, told CNBC. ""We continue to advance what is available for developers to create. And our catalog of apps grew 20 percent to 2.2 million."" Schiller said the biggest drivers for the App Store included games such as ""Pokemon Go,"" which was the most downloaded app in 2016; ""Super Mario,"" which was the most downloaded app on Christmas and New Year's days; and subscription-based apps, such as Netflix, Hulu and Time Warner's HBO Go. The tech giant said its biggest day of sales on the App Store was on Jan. 1, 2017, when customers spent a record $240 million. The top grossing markets included the U.S, U.K., Japan and China, which saw 90 percent year-over-year growth. Investors pay close attention to the performance of the App Store, as Apple now emphasizes its role as a services company. The broad smartphone market is maturing, and the tech giant is highlighting recurring revenue streams that do not depend on new device sales. Some research suggests that the best days of growth in the apps market may have come and gone. Schiller disputed that, pointing to his store's recent performance. ""I will let the success of the App Store speak for itself,"" he said. ""The App Store is bigger than ever and growing faster than ever. There is a lot of success ahead for developers."" Based on Apple's traditional cut of 30 cents for every dollar that moves through the store, the revenue generated by the app sales totaled about $8 billion to $9 billion for Apple last year, according to Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. Digital stores represent big battlegrounds between Apple and rival Google. According to App Annie, which provides market data for the app economy, Google Play's worldwide downloads were 115 percent higher than Apple's App Store downloads in the third quarter, which is the latest data available. However, Apple maintained its advantage in revenue. In the third quarter, App Store revenue was 100 percent higher than Google Play's. ",App Store developers earned $20 billion in 2016
Arjun Kharpal,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Amid internet-connected hairbrushes and jeans at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, there was one big - but barely visible -winner: Amazon. Alexa – Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) voice assistant rival to Apple's Siri and Google Assistant – was everywhere. The U.S. e-commerce giant integrated Alexa with a number of devices and products including Ford cars, LG's new refrigerator, and Huawei's Mate 9 smartphone. Previously, Alexa was only on Amazon's own Echo speaker and just a handful of devices. But Amazon's Alexa push is the company's attempt to become an operating system (OS) for the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), just as Google Android and Apple iOS have done with mobile. ""The latest generation of IoT appears to require (AI-driven) voice-led OS ,"" Neil Campling, head of global technology, mobile, telecom research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, wrote in a note on Friday. ""Whereas Apple's Siri seems more a function within iOS and OS X perhaps Amazon's Alexa offers the best opportunity to provide an IoT operating system."" Amazon's push is significant because the company has struggled in the past with creating an ecosystem that can take on its rivals. Apple has customers locked into its iPhones and Macs while Microsoft dominated the PC space for years. Alphabet-owned Google meanwhile has a suite of software and services used by millions. But none of them have made a big move into the IoT like Amazon has so far. ""All those companies know voice is an important part of the future, but Amazon has spotted the opportunity, has executed well and has built an ecosystem strategy where they are building relationships so they can be bigger than Amazon could be alone,"" Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS Markit, told CNBC by phone. ""Amazon is saying we haven't got mobile, we failed there, we haven't got the PC space, we aren't in the web like Google, so we have to do something a bit different."" If Amazon can gain a strong foothold across devices, it could be huge for the company, given that the number of connected IoT devices and sensors are expected to reach over 46 billion in 2021, up 200 percent from last year, according to Juniper Research. A large market share could drive user's to Amazon's services across e-commerce and entertainment. ""If people have an Alexa-powered device in the home, buying things from Amazon is going to be one voice command away, which reduces friction and integrates Amazon even more into people's daily lives,"" Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, told CNBC by email on Thursday. But competition is already stiff in the AI voice assistant space. Google has recently refreshed its offering called Assistant, Apple is putting Siri across more devices such as its wireless AirPods, while Samsung last year acquired Viv, a voice assistant start-up from the makers of Siri, presumably to integrate into their own products. Google has also been making big progress in the AI space, driven by the acquisition of London-based firm DeepMind in 2014. But analysts said that none of these companies have yet to really make a big impact, allowing to Amazon to take the lead. But the threat is always present. Amazon is also in the early stages and still does not have the scale of its rivals. ""It is worth noting that in all this, Apple's Siri is in two orders of magnitude more devices than Alexa, so we shouldn't get too carried away in terms of the scale and reach. Many of the devices being launched at CES won't sell in large numbers either,"" Dawson said. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Brian Stoffel,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Currently, shares of the company make up a whopping 13% of my family's real-life stock holdings. But we're totally comfortable with that allocation. Here's why: Image source: Google Canada If you're sitting around the dinner table arguing about a provable fact, you resolve the dispute by simply ""Googling"" the answer. The fact that the name is so embedded in our lexicon speaks volumes to the search engine's dominance. But as you're probably well aware, Google is much more than just search. It has six other applications with over 1 billion users. These are Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and Google Play Store. ""Sure,"" you might say, ""but the company doesn't charge for most of those products. That's not great business."" Image source: Getty Images. While you'd be right, you'd be missing out on what's dubbed the ""oil of the information age"": data. With every user in all seven of those aforementioned apps, the company is able to collect gobs of data. In fact, I don't think it would be too hard to argue that Google has more data on the people walking this Earth than any other organization, at any other time in human history. Not so anymore. With Google's advertising platform, companies get real-time feedback on how efficiently their ads are being placed, and how much business they produce. Given the data hoard that the company has, ads placed through Google can be more targeted to the perfect customer than any other available source. That's a huge moat for the company. It also helps explain why Google advertising brought in $79 billion in sales last year for the company, or 88% of all revenue. If you think you've missed the boat, rest assured you haven't. A March 2016 report from eMarketer shows that there's still a lot of room for internet advertising to grow. Image source: eMarketer. And with TV estimated to still retain one-third of the global market share in 2019, I can only imagine that the runway for internet ad growth will continue for much of the next decade. This is what famed trader, academic, and thinker Nassim Taleb would call a barbell approach: having a large, reliable stream of revenue on one side while taking lots of small bets on the other. While the likelihood of any one moonshot succeeding is small, all it will take is one or two winners over the next decade to make a meaningful difference for shareholders. What are these moonshots? We probably don't know all of them, but the ones we do include self-driving cars, a connected home, a life sciences company, and lightning-fast internet connection. I'm a sucker for a good mission statement. When it is clear and powerful, it can be the compass that helps guide management and employees alike toward a common goal. Google's mission statement is: ""To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."" The mission of parent company Alphabet is multifaceted but can be broken down to: ""Getting more ambitious things done[,] ... empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish ... [and] as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can."" Those are both powerful and flexible enough objectives to keep the company relevant in a quickly changing world. Another angle that's often overlooked is a company's culture. If Page and Brin really do want to accomplish the ambitious goals they've laid out, they need a stable and motivated workforce to get things done. To get an idea for the company's approach, a 2010 filing with the SEC stated that ""[monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation before individual gain."" Based on anonymous employee reviews on Glassdoor.com, I'd say the company is doing pretty well. Image source: Glassdoor Finally, if you've got a company that's going to be taking lots of small bets that can be costly, it's good to know that management is sitting on a pretty expansive war chest. And that's what you get with Alphabet. Long-term debt: $3.9 billion Cash, short-, and long-term investments: $92.2 billion This, and the other nine reasons above, helps me sleep well at night knowing my family is invested in -- and likely won't sell for a long time -- such a company.

    10 Reasons to Buy Alphabet Inc Stock and Never Sell -- The Motley Fool

Dan Caplinger,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Many beginning investors make the mistake of thinking that whether a stock is cheap or expensive depends entirely on its share price. But just as low-priced penny stocks are the worst investments you can make, some stocks whose share prices are at nosebleed heights are actually good values. Below, we'll look at arguments about why Priceline Group (NASDAQ:BKNG), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) are actually good bargains despite their extremely high stock prices. Image source: Priceline Group. Priceline Group has the third-highest stock price of any company listed on U.S. stock exchanges, currently trading in excess of $1,500 per share. Priceline's gains have come from modest beginnings, and the stock price was as low as $1 per share -- $6 after adjusting for a subsequent reverse split -- in the aftermath of the tech bust in 2003. Yet since then, Priceline has stood out with an impressive growth strategy that hinged largely on becoming a worldwide player in travel and beating its rivals to extend their scope beyond the lucrative U.S. market. Even now, Priceline's growth prospects justify its price. Trading at nearly 40 times trailing earnings, most value investors would avoid the stock as being far too highly valued compared to the overall stock market. But most of those following the stock expect dramatic growth from Priceline, with projections for final figures of $65 per share in earnings for 2016 and more than $75 per share for 2017. That works out to a forward multiple of just 20. If you agree with many investors that Priceline will likely see revenue growth in the mid- to high-teens for the foreseeable future and even faster earnings gains, then a four-digit price tag for a share of Priceline looks a lot less expensive than it otherwise would. Alphabet's shares have been in the high-triple digits for a long time, and the only reason why the company doesn't have a higher share price than Priceline is that the company behind the Google search engine did an unusual stock split in 2014 that created a new class of stock. Even with that move, share prices of $800 to $825 rank Alphabet among the most expensive on major U.S. exchanges. Alphabet has impressive growth characteristics that belie its high current trailing earnings multiple of nearly 30. Alphabet's core business should generate about $35 per share in earnings for 2016 and more than $40 per share in 2017, especially if the recent introduction of the Google Pixel smartphone produces as much growth as some believe it will. Meanwhile, Alphabet believes its stock is a good value, having started a $7 billion buyback program that uses only a fraction of the free cash flow that the search giant produces each and every year. When you consider the longer-term, more ambitious projects that Alphabet has taken on, the stock's growth potential gets even larger despite its already-high share price. The auto industry has been on fire in recent years, with record sales for U.S. automakers in 2015 and with 2016 having held up quite well rather than giving way to typical cyclical pressure. AutoZone has also found itself a big beneficiary of favorable industry conditions, and the stock has climbed to almost $800 per share. That's an impressive run for a stock that traded in single digits back in the early 1990s. AutoZone's secular success has come from the fact that people are keeping their cars longer, and although increased reliability is one factor in that decision, the willingness to do ongoing repairs and maintenance also plays a key role. AutoZone has tapped into that market well, with a combination of new store expansion and strong same-store sales growth that has driven profits higher. Moreover, AutoZone is committed to buying back stock, which also boosts earnings per share. As a result, AutoZone already has a trailing earnings multiple of just 19, and expected double-digit growth in the years to come will reduce that figure even further. Don't let high share prices scare you into thinking that a stock is fundamentally expensive. As the history of these three high-flyers shows, sometimes you'll find the best bargains among companies that have already seen big gains in the price of their stock. ","
      
    These 3 High-Priced Stocks Are Actually Cheap -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're nearing retirement age or you're retired and simply haven't used your Medicare benefits yet, you may be confused about the different ""parts"" of Medicare and what each one covers. Medicare Part A is also known as Hospital Insurance, which obviously covers hospital stays but also includes skilled nursing facilities, hospice care, and more. Here are the details about what Medicare Part A covers and what it costs to have and to use it. Before we dive into a specific part of Medicare, the program has four parts altogether that all retirees and pre-retirees should be aware of: For the remainder of this article, we'll take a deeper look at Part A, Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI for short). Image source: Getty Images. Generally speaking, Medicare Part A covers the following healthcare costs. First, the good news, and if you already have Medicare, you already know this. The vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries pay no monthly premiums for Part A. If you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes for at least 40 quarters of work (10 years), Part A is free. For those who must buy Part A, the monthly premium can be as much as $413. For inpatient hospital stays, there is a $1,316 deductible per benefit period. A ""benefit period"" starts on the day that you're admitted to a hospital or skilled nursing facility, and ends when you haven't gotten any impatient hospital or skilled nursing facility care for 60 consecutive days. If this amount of time has passed, if you're admitted to the hospital again, a new benefit period begins, and you'll have to pay the deductible again. For stays beyond 60 days, you'll also pay coinsurance of $329 per day for days 61-90, and $658 for each ""lifetime reserve day"" for stays longer than 90 days, up to a maximum of 60 during your lifetime. Once you've exhausted all of your lifetime reserve days, you're responsible for all the costs associated with the hospital stay. For stays in skilled nursing facilities, there is no charge for the first 20 days of a benefit period, but there is a $164.50 coinsurance payment per day beyond that, up to 100 days in a facility. Beyond 100 days, the beneficiary is responsible for all costs. Beneficiaries who qualify pay nothing for home healthcare services or hospice care. There are, however, some incidental charges, such as 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for durable medical equipment, or a copayment of $5 or less for prescription drugs while on hospice care. When you hear in the news about Medicare's long-term funding problems, Part A is what they're referring to. While the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund currently has nearly $200 billion in reserves and the program is expected to run a surplus through 2020, that's where the good news ends. There are simply going to be too many people retiring compared to the number of workers paying into Medicare, and as a result, Medicare Part A is expected to completely run out of money in 2028. There are really only two ways to fix the problem and keep Medicare in its current form: raise taxes or cut benefits. Or Republican leaders in Congress have a plan to privatize Medicare by 2024. When and if Congress will act remains to be seen, but in one way or another, it's safe to say that some major changes may be coming to Medicare in the not-too-distant future. ","
      
    Here's What Medicare Part A Costs and Covers in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

"Evan Niu, CFA",01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: John Legere's social media account. CES 2017 is now winding down, but last week T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere held a press conference at the annual tech extravaganza. In it, Legere made eight bold predictions of what the telecommunications industry might have in store for 2017, and also subsequently penned a blog post on T-Mobile's site. Let's go through Legere's calls and see what they could mean for investors. Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which buy wholesale capacity from the major network operators and resell service under a different brand, have always occupied a tenuous place within the mobile value chain. Facing sluggish landline growth, many cable companies have looked toward establishing MVNOs for some exposure to wireless growth. For instance, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced plans late last year that it would launch an MVNO on Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) network in 2017, supplemented by Wi-Fi hotspots. Legere doesn't think these MVNO ambitions will play out well for anyone, and the Un-carrier will not ink any MVNO agreements with cable operators. There are a few candidates for tech giants that may look to jump into the wireless sector, but Legere thinks Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is the most obvious pick. Of course, the search giant launched Project Fi in 2015, which is a sort of hybrid MVNO that uses several networks (including T-Mobile's) in conjunction with Wi-Fi hotspots. Google is experimenting with and pioneering several interesting ideas, such as prorated data fees. Thus far, Project Fi has been limited to a small number of devices, mostly Nexus and Pixel phones, but Google has the groundwork in place if it wants to make a bigger impact. Over-the-top (OTT) streaming services are proliferating in lockstep with cord-cutting, and Legere sees the shift to mobile accelerating. The chief executive notes that a third of TV watching occurs on devices other than TVs. By the end of 2017, he believes that the majority of TV viewing will be delivered via mobile. Roughly 61% of mobile traffic is video, and this should jump to 77% by 2020, according to CTIA. T-Mobile delivers quite a bit of (downscaled) video for free via its Binge On program, so it only benefits financially from this increased usage if consumers pay extra for high-resolution streams or opt out of Binge On. DISH Network has been sitting on unused spectrum for years, fueling speculation that it would jump into the wireless world. Legere is calling for ""the end of DISH as we know it"" this year, saying it will cease to be a stand-alone entity. DISH's TV business has been on the decline, also a victim of cord-cutting, for quite some time. The company lost 116,000 net TV subscribers last quarter, and currently has about 13.6 million subscribers left. T-Mobile recently noted that it is already approaching gigabit LTE speeds, thanks to its ongoing investments in spectrum and LTE infrastructure. Other carriers are hoping for gigabit speeds on 5G, but Legere says T-Mobile will be there first using existing technologies. Of course, hitting peak theoretical speeds is quite different than what average consumers experience, and most users won't see gigabit speeds in real-world performance anytime soon. T-Mobile reached 979 Mbps in its labs, using a combination of technologies and an unreleased handset. Legere hosts a live-streamed video segment on social media every Sunday under #SlowCookerSunday. Currently, about 500,000 viewers tune in to watch him cook each week, and he predicts he'll have 1 million weekly viewers by the end of 2017. Legere uses his segment as an example of the rise of OTT content, which continues to threaten cable channels. This is a pretty bold one, but Legere predicts that three of the four CEOs of the current major wireless operators will be out by year's end. That's an ambitious forecast not only because that's a lot of CEOs losing their jobs, but also because of the ongoing consolidation speculation that T-Mobile isn't exactly downplaying. If T-Mobile ends up merging with Sprint, Legere would immediately score at least one point on this one. Pointing to the deterioration in both Verizon's and Comcast's core businesses, Legere says that the two telecom giants will be ""forced"" to entertain the idea of a blockbuster megamerger that would combine ""two of the most hated brands in America."" Note that Legere doesn't believe a deal will be officially announced or closed, but rather the pair would have ""discussions."" Seeing as how discussions of this nature often leak and spur speculation, Legere is essentially speculating on speculation. In fairness, the idea isn't out of the question altogether, given AT&T's recent moves. ","

Searching for a brokerage account? You've probably discovered there are many options, with varying commission schedules, investment availability, and account minimums. Today, though, we'll simplify the search and help you compare two popular discount brokers, Robinhood and TradeKing, to see if either choice is a good fit for your portfolio. Robinhood is an anomaly in the brokerage industry because it doesn't charge commissions, whereas every other broker (including TradeKing) does. But price isn't everything, and you'll see that discount brokerages of all types make investing much more affordable today than it used to be. Broker Stocks/Options ETFs Mutual Funds Robinhood Stocks: Free Options: Not available Free Not available TradeKing $4.95 per trade + $0.65 per options contract $4.95 per trade $9.95 per purchase Data sources: Company websites. Though the differences may appear stark, they're really quite small in simple terms of dollars and cents. Furthermore, a broker's published commission schedule is usually the highest cost you can expect to pay. Many brokers offer commission-free trades on select investments. In addition, we'd encourage you to explore special offers for brokerage accounts as well as offers for IRA accounts, which can actually result in a situation where your broker effectively pays you to open an account. These offers are always changing, but it's common to find special offers that can give you hundreds of free trades in addition to cash bonuses of $2,000 or more. Brokerages are increasingly using commission-free ETFs and no-transaction-fee (NTF) mutual funds as an incentive to sign up with their service. The value of these perks is not insignificant -- if you like funds, shopping for commission-free and NTF funds could save you thousands of dollars over time. Here's how Robinhood and TradeKing stack up on fee-free investments. Broker Commission-Free ETFs NTF Mutual Funds Robinhood All ETFs Not available TradeKing None None Data sources: Company websites. All trades (stocks and ETFs) are free on Robinhood. TradeKing doesn't currently offer any commission-free ETFs or NTF mutual funds, though it does have a comparatively low commission ($9.95) for mutual fund transactions compared to other brokerages. Depending how important funds are to your portfolio, you could make the case for either brokerage. Robinhood and TradeKing are no-minimum brokerages, meaning they allow investors to open an account without making a certain minimum deposit. That said, try to start with more than just the bare minimum -- you'll need to deposit enough cash to afford to buy stock, ETFs, or mutual funds to actually make your first investment. Ever since the dawn of the discount brokerage industry, traders have been arguing about which brokerage has the best trading platform. As long-term investors, we at The Motley Fool prefer annual reports and conference calls to candlestick charts and Bollinger bands, so we tend not to worry too much over trading platforms. We just don't think platforms are that important for long-term investing. From our perspective, the biggest difference between platforms is that Robinhood is a mobile-only service, whereas TradeKing offers mobile and desktop trading platforms. If a trading platform is of particular importance to you, then it's worth exploring each platform for yourself to see how it works for your needs. If you'd like to invest internationally, the differences between Robinhood and TradeKing may be of particular importance. Image source: Getty Images. The majority of online brokers allow you to invest in foreign companies, subject to some limitations. Robinhood and TradeKing both fall in line with the rest of the industry here. Investments Robinhood TradeKing American depositary receipts (ADRs) Some Yes International stock markets No No ETFs/Mutual funds of foreign stocks ETFs ETFs and mutual funds Data sources: Company websites. Let's start first with funds. Both brokerages offer the ability to trade American ETFs that hold foreign stocks, but only TradeKing offers the ability to invest in mutual funds made up of foreign stocks. As for individual companies, there are some important differences. Robinhood offers its clients the opportunity to trade some ADRs. Its website states that its clients can invest in ""companies domiciled in Canada and Israel that trade above $5."" TradeKing offers more support for trading in ADRs. However, neither brokerage currently enables their clients to trade directly on foreign exchanges. In fairness, only a few brokerages offer that capability. We tend to think that self-directed investors can benefit from being able to get insights and analysis and consider a wide range of investment opinions. TradeKing provides some fundamental screening tools, in addition to Breakfast Bell market reports and S&P stock reports. Robinhood doesn't currently offer research access for having a brokerage account, which is a trade-off that investors should balance with the fact that it doesn't charge commissions. If you have access to the internet on a phone or tablet, you can make a trade with Robinhood or TradeKing. Here's how each broker's users and clients rated their iOS and Android apps (as of Dec. 19, 2016). Broker Apple App Store Google Play Robinhood 4.5 stars 4.5 stars TradeStation 1.0 star 4.0 stars data sources: Relevant app stores. Depending on your particular portfolio, you could find either brokerage to be a good fit. Robinhood offers commission-free stock and ETF trades, but doesn't offer the ability to trade options or invest in mutual funds. TradeKing charges commissions, but offers a wider range of investment choices, in addition to free research capabilities just for having an account. Ultimately, there isn't a single brokerage that is the best broker for every type of investor. What really matters is how any broker fits with the needs of your investment style. To be clear: The Motley Fool does not endorse any particular broker, but we do have some resources that might help you in your hunt. Fool.com's Broker Center makes it easy to compare current special offers and features offered by several leading discount brokerages all on one page. The Fool.com IRA Center is tailored to retirement investors. ","

Image source: Getty Images. When will Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) split its stock again? CEO Mark Zuckerberg already ""owes"" shareholders a split: Back in April 2016, the company announced a plan to create a new share class that is equivalent, on an economic basis, to a 3-for-1 stock split. More than eight months on, Facebook has yet to implement that plan. So when will it happen? We could find out very soon. Facebook Stock Split Date Split Ratio October 2010 5-for-1 October 2007 4-for-1 July 2006 4-for-1 Data sources: Reuters, Bloomberg. Since its initial public offering in May 2012, however, Facebook has yet to split its shares. The only semi-legitimate reason for splitting a stock is to lower the stock price to make the shares more accessible to individual investors. This is the reason Apple invoked when it announced its most recent split, which it completed in June 2014. On an economic basis, the payment of the C shares as a dividend amounts to a 3-for-1 stock split -- the C shares will have the same economic rights as existing A and B shares. However, the C shares will have no voting rights. The point of the operation is to make it easier for Zuckerberg to maintain voting control over the company, all the while making good on his promise to give away 99% of his shares during his lifetime. The announcement of the plan probably had some sort of an impact on Facebook's share price back in April, but it's impossible to tease it out, since the news was part of the company's announcement of its first-quarter results -- important fundamental information that swamped any impact related to this plan. In fact, the release, which included much better-than-expected earnings per share, was issued after the close on April 27, and shares rose more than 7% the following day. When the split occurs, the price of Facebook's shares will decline by two-thirds, in line with the split ratio. In other words, investors will end up owning three times as many shares at one-third the price. Finally, we can expect some minor difference in price between the existing shares and the new Class C shares. The current plan to split the stock with the creation of an additional class of C shares was announced on April 27, 2016, and shareholders ratified the plan at the company's annual meeting on June 20. However, the board has yet to set a record date for the payment of the Class C stock dividend. The delay is probably linked to a lawsuit opposing the plan filed by a shareholder in the Delaware Court of Chancery two days after it was announced; the matter is scheduled for trial this month. In June 2013, Google announced that it had settled a similar suit, one day before the trial start date, paving the way for the distribution of its Class C shares, which took place less than 10 months later. I think there is every chance events will play out in a similar manner in this case, and I expect to see Facebook distribute its C shares sometime this year. ","

IMAGE SOURCE: Ascena Retail Group Inc. Shares of Ascena Retail Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ASNA) fell as much as 15.6% early Tuesday and then settled to trade down 11% as of 2:00 p.m. EST after the women's fashion retailer announced disappointing holiday results. For the 2016 holiday period from Nov. 19, 2016, through Jan. 2, 2017, Ascena's consolidated comparable sales declined 3.1%, as 2.7% growth in comps from the kids fashion segment and 1.6% growth from Catherines were more than offset by comparable sales declines of 8.2% at Ann Taylor, 1.8% at LOFT, 7.1% from maurices, 4.6% from dressbarn, and 5.1% at Lane Bryant. In addition, for the combined November and December fiscal periods, Ascena's consolidated comparable sales fell 4.4%. As Ascena Retail Group CEO David Jaffe said: We were disappointed by our overall Holiday performance. Outside of discrete peaks during the holiday season, we experienced stronger than expected store traffic headwinds. As a result, we were forced into a more highly promotional stance in order to move through inventory in the face of softer overall consumer demand. At this juncture, we are positioning our full year outlook assuming that the trend we experienced through Holiday continues. We continue to aggressively work our Change for Growth enterprise transformation, and are focused on expense management opportunities to help us navigate the challenging environment. ","

Adam Levy,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Amazon. In CEO Jeff Bezos' annual letter to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders from April 2016, he highlighted the company's three pillars: Prime (its $99-a-year membership), Marketplace (where it sells items), and Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing business). All three have been instrumental to Amazon's success over the past decade-plus and Bezos wrote, ""I assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth [pillar]."" It looks like that fourth pillar could be the Echo smart speaker featuring the Alexa digital assistant. It's been two years since Amazon unveiled the Echo, which can serve as a hub for other smart-home devices like thermostats and lightbulbs, and its functionality has been extended through third-party ""skills,"" which function like voice-controlled apps. Amazon has the scale and infrastructure necessary to grow the Echo and Alexa into its fourth pillar. Nobody expects using voice-activated digital assistants will replace using smartphones or desktop computers, not even Bezos. However, there's clearly a growing trend toward using voice search and interacting with digital assistants. Google recently released a device similar to Echo, Google Home, in order to take advantage of the trend. Additionally, the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary said voice searches tripled over the last two years. As the artificial intelligence (AI) powering these devices improves, their usefulness increases. And as they're used more, the AI improves, creating a virtuous cycle. Amazon has a first-mover advantage in the smart speaker category, and its success with its Kindle line gives consumers confidence in its brand. But Amazon's biggest advantage with the Echo and Alexa is how it can integrate its existing Prime and Marketplace pillars into its Echo business. One of the primary ways Google is considering monetizing voice searches is through commerce. It recently released a development kit for retailers and service providers to create apps for Google Assistant -- the AI powering Google Home and found in several other Google apps -- to connect with potential customers. Eventually, Google plans to take a cut of sales made through these apps. But Amazon already has a direct line to customers and a huge marketplace of items -- one of its three pillars. Customers can order products using Alexa, and Amazon will use your order history to figure out what you want or choose an item based on user reviews and pricing. Of course, that feature is only available to Prime members -- urging more customers to sign up for the service. Non-members can still ask Alexa to add items to their cart for checkout later, but they'd have to finish ordering the old-fashioned way and using your fingers to buy stuff online is so 2014. As such, Alexa serves to support Amazon's Marketplace and Prime and vice versa. Similarly, Prime supports the  Marketplace business by increasing customer loyalty and attracting new third-party sellers to the platform. That, in turn, brings more Prime-eligible products to the Marketplace, increasing the value of Prime. Adding Alexa to the mix strengthens the other two pillars, making it another pillar. Amazon is putting a lot of money behind marketing Alexa. It's been running a television and digital video ad campaign over the last year, including a Super Bowl commercial starring Alec Baldwin. Amazon produced over 100 10-second spots for the campaign based on real-life use cases of the voice assistant. Most recently, Amazon struck a deal with Wynn Hotels to put an Echo device in each of Wynn's 4,748 Las Vegas hotel rooms. The device will be able to control the lights, temperature, drapes, and TV, with potentially more features to come. It's a clever marketing ploy that will introduce thousands of people to the Echo and allow them to have a firsthand experience using it. Behind the scenes, Amazon has over 1,000 employees working on Alexa, according to Bezos. He also said the current functionality of Alexa is ""just the tip of the iceberg."" It's clear from its investments that Amazon sees the huge potential of Alexa. It's not just a stand-alone product, but a potential pillar of its business that supports its other operations -- specifically, Marketplace and Prime. ","

Daniel B. Kline,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. After eight seasons of the hit show, that's no longer the case. Herjavec has become one of the best-known venture capitalists in the world. As a Shark he has built his wealth investing in a diverse array of products including PupBox (a monthly delivery service for dogs), Mensch on a Bench (a Jewish version of Elf on a Shelf), and Happy Feet (a slippers company) among many others. Known as the nice Shark, Herjavec may have a lighter touch than Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary -- the harshest panelists on the ABC show -- but can be tough when needed. ""Do not mistake my kindness for weakness,"" he is quoted on his website as saying, and that describes how he handles the entrepreneurs who enter ""The Tank."" It's a formula which has served Herjavec well, making him very wealthy. The Shark, entrepreneur, and businessman had a more than $200 million fortune as of July, 2016, according to various sources, but that number does not take into account that Robert Herjavec's net worth likely took a hit in his divorce settlement with his ex-wife Diane Plese. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to Shark Tank and his ongoing involvement with Herjavec Group, which as a private company does not have to release financial statements, the Shark has been a serial entrepreneur. His first major success was a technology company, BRAK systems, a Canadian internet security company which was acquired by AT&T (NYSE: T) in 2000 for $30 million. He then worked for Ramp Network, serving as its vice president of sales, and likely scoring a payday when it was acquired by Nokia for $225 million shortly after. At that point, Herjavec returned to his entrepreneurial ways, founding his present company, which reportedly has $150 million in annual sales. While the details are not public, it's very likely that Herjavec lost a considerable portion of his fortune in the divorce. He likely did not lose half of his assets, because some of his fortune -- the part from selling BRAK Systems and whatever he made when Ramp Network was sold -- pre-dated his marriage. ","

John Ballard,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The mobile payment landscape is getting bigger. Major technology companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, along with big banks and credit card issuers, are jockeying for position in a fast growing market. As mobile payments adoption expands, the services that are easy to access and easy to use are in the best position to lead the race. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been leading the race for over ten years. Two competitors that could give PayPal a run for its money is a new peer to peer (P2P) payment service, ClearXchange, and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) own mobile payment service Apple Pay. Image source: Getty Images. ClearXchange is owned by Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One Financial, JP Morgan Chase, PNC Financial Services Group, U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo. Some of the top banks in the world are already in the ClearXchange network and reach over 250 million people. It is the banks' response to the popularity and growth of PayPal's P2P payment service, Venmo, which is growing rapidly and is on pace to process about $20 billion in annual transaction volume over the next four quarters. ClearXchange offers a very straightforward and convenient service. All you need to send someone money is an email address or mobile phone number. The money is sent directly from the senders' bank account to the recipients'. Even if someone holds a bank account not included in the ClearXchange network, they can still sign up to receive payments. On top of the convenience of transferring money directly in and out of bank accounts, the service is fee free. However, Venmo is also free for all transaction types except credit cards. While the ability to directly transfer money to and from bank accounts is attractive, it's not clear whether ClearXchange differentiates itself enough to persuade Venmo's core users, millennials, to use it. One reason for the growth of Venmo is that it is not associated or owned by traditional financial institutions, an aspect that appeals to a younger generation. Both PayPal and Venmo users can still send money or pay for goods even if there is insufficient funds in their account balance, making these services as easy and convenient to use as ClearXchange. Perhaps a more significant elephant to battle against is Apple Pay. Since Apple Pay's launch in 2014, Apple has been quietly signing up banks and credit unions worldwide to allow credit and debit cards to be enrolled in Apple Pay. Recently, Apple added support for 17 more credit unions and banks bringing the total to over 1,600 worldwide. Although Apple doesn't disclose specific numbers, the service seems to be enjoying growing adoption. In 2016, CEO Tim Cook reported that 75% of all contactless payments in the U.S. were through Apple Pay.  Apple Pay transactions increased nearly 500% year over year in the most recent quarter. More transactions were completed in September 2016 than the entire fiscal 2015. Apple's major partners reported that Apple Pay has the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet, and management expects two-thirds of the top 100 retailers to support Apple Pay in 2017. Apple Pay was launched for the Safari web browser for the first time in September 2016, opening up another avenue for users to engage with the service. This success is not surprising. Apple is one of the most recognized brands in the world and has sold over one billion iPhones since the launch of the original in 2007, giving Apple a huge installed base. Of course, some of these purchases are upgrades for existing users, and some people may not even use an iPhone anymore. One analyst estimates the total installed base of Apple's iPhone is around 400 million. By comparison, PayPal had 192 million active customer accounts at the end of September 2016. Whatever the exact number for Apple's installed base, it's reasonable to assume Apple has a potential customer base that rivals PayPal's. The important distinction for Apple is its control over both hardware and software. Since Apple designs the hardware and software, it can control access to hardware components and software functionality inside an iPhone. Because of this closed system, only Apple can program software to access the Near Field Communication (NFC) chip inside iPhones and Apple Watches. The NFC chip in an iPhone 6 or later model connects wirelessly to a NFC chip reader in a retail store, for example, to share payment data. The NFC chip enables Apple Watch users to simply turn the crown or wave their wrist in the air, wait for a beep, and, voila, payment sent. Third-party app developers, such as PayPal, do not have the luxury of allowing its users to wave their wrists in the air to send payment. Although Apple does not disclose specific operating metrics for Apple Pay, the statistics CEO Tim Cook discloses on conference calls are enough to assume Apple's total payment volume (TPV) is growing along with the mobile payments industry. The good news for PayPal is that its own TPV has been growing consistently at 20% or more since the launch of Apple Pay. The parallel growth of these two services along with the continued growth of credit card issuers, Visa and MasterCard, highlights the size of the opportunity for all payment solutions. PayPal management puts the company's addressable market at $100 trillion. Over the last four quarters, PayPal's TPV is $336 billion, so there is a very long runway of growth, not only for PayPal, but its competitors as well. ","

Hannah Karp,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Published: Jan 12, 2017 5:23 p.m. ET NFL abandoning San Diego after 55 years; L.A. now home to 2 teams By After two decades of arguing that the league didn’t need Los Angeles, the NFL is doubling down on Tinseltown. The San Diego Chargers on Thursday said the team is heading up the coast to Los Angeles, the country’s second-biggest market and a city that only last year welcomed the Rams from St. Louis. The move caused an outpouring of grief in San Diego, where the team was based for 55 years, and capped a tumultuous 12 months for the NFL in which three of its franchises either moved or took steps to do so. In a big gamble, the NFL has now tethered the futures of two struggling franchises to the sprawling Los Angeles metropolitan area that previously failed to support professional football and features a bevy of other entertainment options. And it could get even more crowded: League officials have argued for the Oakland Raiders planned move to Las Vegas in part because the team still has a strong fan base in southern California, where residents are accustomed to making quick jaunts to Las Vegas. More than anything, the Chargers decision to abandon a market where they have little competition, a half-century of goodwill, and hundreds of thousands of fans is a reflection of how teams assess their value in the modern NFL. Loyal fans are far less valuable than state-of-the-art stadiums surrounded by real estate opportunities, nine-figure naming rights and sponsorship deals, and television exposure.

Ahead of a presentation at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference, Ford revealed that it will pay a special dividend of 5 cents a share in the first quarter, along with its regular dividend of 15 cents a share, which is the same as last year's regular payment. Ford maintained guidance for ""somewhat lower"" pre-tax profit in 2017 than 2016, due to investments in technology, but said it expected profitability to improve in 2018. Ford said it still expects $10.2 billion in pre-tax profit for 2016, with an adjusted effective tax rate in the low 30% range.

Greg Robb,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Published: Jan 6, 2017 4:49 p.m. ET Will strangle the innovation the U.S needs, Phelps says By CHICAGO (MarketWatch) — President-elect Donald Trump’s “bullying” of private companies is an expansion of “corporatist” economic policy not seen since the fascist governments in Italy and Germany in the 1930s, said Nobel Prize-winning economist Edmund Phelps on Friday. In a speech at the American Economic Association meeting, Phelps said that the U.S. economy is suffering from stagnation due to waning innovation, and not unfair trade deals as the Trump team has alleged. In fact, innovation in America has been on the wane since the late 1960s, said Phelps, as the U.S. government has exerted more control over much of the private sector. Insiders benefit from this government control because it effectively blocks them from competition. “Restoring innovation” should be the focus of the new administration, said Phelps, who is the director of Capitalism and Society at Columbia University. However, the early policy steps of the president-elect is “just the opposite and dangerous,” he said. Trump has been “bullying” U.S. companies primarily on Twitter. For instance, he has urged auto makers not to manufacture cars in Mexico that they intend to sell in the U.S. “There is the assumption that by bullying corporations, such as Ford, and stepping into aid other corporations, such as Google, the Trump administration can achieve various objectives that will widely boost output and employment. But this is an expansion of corporatist policy of a kind not previously seen since the German and Italian economies of the 1930s.” “If history is a guide, by expanding protection and interference in the business sector, the Trump administration may very well block the innovation of outsiders and newcomers more than it would stimulate the innovation among the innovators,” Phelps said. As a result, “the Trump government is threatening to drive a silver spike into the heart of the innovation process.” “Hitler, I can’t refrain from mentioning, by controlling the economy, caused productivity growth to stagnate in the second half of the 1930s,” he added.

South Dakota also attracted those looking to live closer to family and retire, according to the 40th annual moving study by St. Louis-based moving company United Van Lines.

High demand jobs with high wages in South Dakota include registered nurses, accountants and auditors, general and operations managers, elementary school teachers, secondary school teachers and management analysts, according to the South Dakota Dept. of Labor & Regulation. “There are more pull factors than push factors,” Stoll said. The unemployment rate in South Dakota was 2.7% in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared with the U.S.’s unemployment rate that same month of 4.6%. The median home in South Dakota is about $170,000, according to real estate website Zillow’s home value index. The top inbound states after South Dakota were Vermont, Oregon, Idaho, South Carolina, Washington state, then Washington, D.C., North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona. See:  How to write off your moving expenses Moving for a new job or a job transfer was most common for those relocating, alongside establishing a household, in 2015, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. There are some states, like South Dakota, with a fair amount of inbound and outbound movers relocating for jobs, including California and Massachusetts, Stoll said. There are benefits to moving for a job, experts said. “People who have the best career experiences are willing to relocate,” said Chad Oakley, chief executive officer of global executive search firm Charles Aris in Greensboro, N.C, adding that individuals who relocate for work are likely to see a bigger jump in compensation than those who stay where they are. See also: How much is your paycheck worth in another city? Try the MarketWatch cost-of-living calculator Relocating also shows an employer that you’re flexible, and provides you with new skills and experiences, such as working with a new group of people and learning new standards, practices and approaches to your job, Oakley said. Of course moving for a job is not for everyone, including the family members of those wanting to relocate for work. If you’re considering relocation, consider the needs of your family members, such as a spouse who might be looking for a new job for the next three to six months or kids and their education and hobbies. “You can really negatively impact your family by blindly making that move,” Oakley said. As South Dakota and other states take in more residents, others are naturally losing out, primarily in the Northeast and Midwest. The top 10 states losing residents are New Jersey, Illinois, New York, Connecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Utah and Pennsylvania. For employees whose companies are perhaps doing poorly and asking them to move away to a rural area, there could be consequences — if the job were not to work out, there might not be many other prospects, Oakley said. The South, for example, has seen less movers coming in for jobs, likely because of how hard hit the locations were in oil and gas, Stoll said.

Jurica Dujmovic,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Published: Jan 6, 2017 8:16 a.m. ET Can we grow food beneath the waves in a safe, self-sustainable way? By The world’s population is constantly growing, and with it the demand for water, shelter, better quality of life — and, above all, food. We consume so much of it that all the farmland required to feed humanity would create an area almost the size of North America if put together. Farming creates its own set of problems. As farms proliferate and expand, they push against ever-shrinking wildlife habitats. Since many new fields used to be dense forests, deforestation is a major concern because it tips the natural balance, resulting in landslides, extinction of animal species, animal attacks on humans, and more. What if , instead of growing our food on the surface, we start utilizing the vast area below the waves? This is exactly what two very different projects are trying to do: Nemo’s Garden is a project that uses underwater transparent bubbles (biospheres) that house edible plants. The idea is to expand agricultural efforts in areas where surface-farming would be difficult due to economical, geographical or natural factors. The system is almost fully self-sustainable. No pests can wander in, nor can disease spores be brought in by the wind. Fresh water is available 24/7 through desalination. All biospheres have a dome-like structure where only the bottom part is immersed in seawater. This design ensures much-needed fresh water for the topmost area with plants: When salt water evaporates within the biosphere, it condenses on top of the dome, then trickles back down, salt-free, and nurtures the herbs and vegetables. As for sunlight, domes are transparent, and the sun’s rays increase the internal temperature. Before the project can reach commercial sustainability, more testing is needed to determine the optimal setup of depth, plant diversity, biosphere conditions and the possible use of algae as a fertilizer (instead of liquid fertilizer produced on the surface that is currently used). This would mean fewer maintenance trips by divers and would render the pods even easier to maintain and reap. Ocean Reef Group, the company behind Nemo’s Garden, has seven pods of different sizes containing various types of plants, ranging from oak to turnip tops, that it has plopped in the Mediterranean off the coast of Noli, Italy. Nemo’s Garden does seem awesome, but at its current state and capacity, it won’t solve the world’s food problems. Bren Smith, an American entrepreneur, has a different solution. He calls it “3D ocean farming.” A 3D ocean farm is basically a vertical underwater garden. Kelp and mussels grow on ropes floating above oyster and clam cages located at the bottom of the sea. This simple setup is capable of truly impressive yields. By using the entire food column, the farm, located in the Long Island Sound, has the capacity to grow 20 tons of sea vegetables and 500,000 shellfish per acre every year. Going a step beyond Nemo’s Garden, 3D farming requires no pesticides, fertilizers (Nemo’s Garden still depends on fertilizers from surface) or fresh water, making it the most sustainable form of food production on planet. According to Bren, a “network of seaweed farms the size of Washington State could produce all of the dietary protein needs of the human population.” But what would be on the menu? Kelp, for the most part. It protects oceans from turning more acidic; it also absorbs carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous from the water. This makes waters rich with kelp safe for shellfish and some other aquatic creatures, such as crabs and shrimp. In an article published on Popular Science’s website, Bren admits it’s difficult to sell the idea of kelp as food, mainly because it’s not particularly tasty. He even went as far as hiring professional chefs, tasking them with creating kelp-based dishes. Even if it may taste bad, kelp is chock full of nutrients. It contains more protein and iron than red meat, and more calcium than milk. But there’s one more thing kelp is good for: biofuel. Its sugars can be processed into fuel, and Bren’s website states that “according to the U.S. Department of Energy, a network of (3D ocean) farms totaling an area half the size of Maine could grow enough biofuel to replace all of the oil used in the U.S.” Aside from growing food and supplying biofuel, 3D ocean farms are home to a wide variety of marine and bird species. Kelp soaks up more carbon than any land-based plant, while its nitrogen-absorbing properties provide safe harbor from algae blooms and resulting low-oxygen dead zones that form after their decomposition. Would you consider switching to a kelp-mussels-oyster diet for the rest of your life if you knew it would help the planet? Please let me know by posting your comments below.

Hiroyuki Kachi,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Published: Jan 6, 2017 3:13 p.m. ET Fewer jobs added in December than expected By The dollar rallied against its major rivals on Friday, turning firmly higher for the week as the latest reading on the labor market underscored the belief that inflation could be poised to return to the market. The U.S. added 156,000 jobs in December, according to the closely watched payrolls report, and while this was below the 180,000 that had been expected, it still pointed to improving conditions in the labor market. In separate reports, factory orders fell 2.4% in November while orders for durable goods lost 4.5%. Trading in currencies was volatile following the release of the data, echoing some of the sharp moves the currency has seen over the past several weeks, though the dollar added to its advance throughout the session. “We wobbled a bit the moment the data hit, but even though the headline was a little soft the guts look solid. This instill confidence that the inflation story is still intact and puts people back into that frame of mind after some profit-taking,” said Brad Bechtel, managing director for currencies at Jefferies.

With the day’s advance, the index, which gauges the greenback against six rival currencies, turned slightly higher for the week, erasing a 1.1% slump on Thursday. That drop came as market participants seem to have off-loaded their bets on a higher buck after dovish minutes from the Federal Reserve. Profit-taking after a recent dollar rally also contributed to the week’s selling.

Jordan Hill, 18, of suburban Carpentersville, Ill., and Tesfaye Cooper, 18, Brittany Covington, 28, and Tanishia Covington, 24, all of Chicago, face charges of aggravated kidnapping, hate crimes, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the Chicago Sun-Times and other local media reported. (If convicted, according to an MSNBC legal analysis, the four face up to 30 years in prison.) Hill also faces charges of robbery, residential burglary and possession of a stolen motor vehicle, while Cooper and Brittany Covington are also charged with residential burglary, the Sun-Times reported, citing the Cook County state’s attorney’s office. The four individuals, who are black, allegedly held an 18-year-old special-needs man hostage and tortured him in an apartment on the West Side of the city, streaming the horrific ordeal on Facebook Live. The victim can be seen in the video bound and gagged as his attackers beat him and cut his scalp with a knife. In the video, in which the victim can be seen cowering in the corner on the floor, someone is heard urging the victim to say, “I love black people.” One of the suspects can be heard shouting epithets against white people and Donald Trump in the video, which was live streamed for roughly 30 minutes.

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"TORONTO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada is hiring a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI) as an advisor to a new research lab the bank is establishing as part of its investment in AI and machine learning, Canada’s largest bank said on Wednesday. The bank declined to say how much is being invested, but estimated that its ongoing investments in AI will total in the tens of millions of dollars over the coming years. RBC Research said it is looking into how AI can be applied in banking and it will be working with Richard Sutton, a professor of computing science at the University of Alberta. Sutton has made substantial contributions in the field of “reinforcement learning,” a type of machine learning that uses reward and punishment. It is a subset of the science of getting a computer to do something without programming it to do so, and is the technology behind self-driving cars and underpins Google’s AlphaGo, the AI program that last year beat the world champion at the ancient board game Go. The global financial industry has been grappling with the long-term implications of technologies that are radically transforming, or “disrupting,” the way customers bank, as well as the way financial institutions operate. Artificial intelligence and blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, are key areas of focus in the industry. RBC Chief Executive Dave McKay last week flagged artificial intelligence as the most transformative technology in banking. “There is a lot of investment discussion about AI creating new capabilities. And it is a tool that we are very excited about harnessing within our own organization,” McKay said at the RBC 2017 Canadian Bank CEO Conference. The new Edmonton, Alberta-based lab will also collaborate with the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) at the University of Alberta in RBC’s latest academic research venture. The bank last fall announced a partnership with the University of Toronto, launching two initiatives relating to research in machine learning and AI, and funding a mentoring program for AI-focused entrepreneurs and startups.

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"HAVANA (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce met with Cuban President Raul Castro and in separate meetings with members of Castro’s economic cabinet on Friday, as they prepare for the advent of a more hostile Trump administration next week. A brief government statement said chamber President Thomas Donohue and Castro discussed “issues of mutual interest.” “The goal of the U.S. business community has shifted from seeking more from Cuba to preserving what exists from the soon-to-be Trump administration,” John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said. “‎U.S. companies need the Cuban government to quickly and substantially expand its purchases of products and services and permit a highly visible presence of companies,” he said. Donohue was accompanied by Maurice Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of C.V. Starr & Co Inc, a major U.S. insurance company. The chamber has opposed the U.S. trade embargo for decades and is a strong supporter of the normalization process begun by President Barack Obama. That process has included the signing of 17 agreements between the two former Cold War foes and the use of executive orders to punch holes in the embargo, which can be lifted only by the U.S. Congress, now controlled by Republicans. Travel to the Communist-run Caribbean island from the United States has increased, with the start of direct flights and cruises and roaming agreements signed, but there have been no manufacturing or trade deals inked. Cuba and the Obama administration have been scrambling to deepen and cement their detente, through bilateral agreements and commercial links, since Trump’s election in November. Trump has said he will dismantle the still-fragile detente unless Cuba gives the United States a better deal, while providing no specifics. Trump is expected to review Cuba policy upon taking office and has named Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization executive and chief legal counsel, as negotiator for sensitive international issues, including Cuba.

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - After a marathon search lasting more than a year, Silicon Valley company DocuSign announced on Wednesday it hired a new chief executive. DocuSign, a $3 billion company that makes software to add legally compliant electronic signatures to documents, hired Dan Springer to take the top job. Springer has experience taking companies public and looks set to be tasked with preparing DocuSign for an initial public offering, which is widely expected for this year. Keith Krach, who has served as DocuSign’s CEO for more than five years, will stay on as board chairman, a position he has held for eight years, and plans to see the company through its IPO, Krach told Reuters in an interview. Springer, 53, worked as chairman and CEO of Responsys, leading the marketing software firm through its 2011 IPO. Responsys’ stock later took a nosedive and Springer helped orchestrate the company’s subsequent $1.5 billion sale to Oracle Corp in 2013. He said Responsys’ challenges were a good lesson in the importance of accurately forecasting quarterly growth. Otherwise, he said, “the market puts you in the penalty box.” Springer declined to offer a timeline for DocuSign’s IPO, but said: “I don’t think there is a barrier to doing it at any point.” DocuSign has more than 100 million users from industries ranging from construction to real estate, and has been embraced as a quick and secure way to sign contracts and other official documents using a finger on a mobile device. The company also added a payments feature so users can make a down payment when they sign a contract. However, the company has been on a bumpy road over the last year or so. Krach in October 2015 announced plans to find a replacement. In March of last year, DocuSign thought it had secured a new CEO, and went so far as to invite reporters to a  briefing to introduce him. Just before the event, DocuSign canceled. The candidate, Rick Osterloh, had decided instead to work for Alphabet Inc’s Google. And in May, adding to the leadership uncertainty, four top executives left at once. “That’s all behind us now,” Krach said. “As companies scale you need different talents at different stages. It’s a natural part of growing up.” DocuSign has raised more than $500 million, securing a $3 billion valuation at its latest financing round in early 2015. ","

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Financially speaking, Netflix has come to embody the title of one of its new hit shows: “Stranger Things.” The video-streaming service blew past quarterly subscriber expectations, as it celebrated a decade of being online. After burning through still more cash, its share price soared to a new high. Apparently growth can come at almost any cost. The $57 billion company led by Reed Hastings added 7.1 million new customers after many initially blanched at a price increase last year. Both in the United States and internationally, Netflix surpassed its own forecast, tallying nearly 94 million for the quarter ending Dec. 31. It was 10 years ago that Hastings disrupted his own groundbreaking DVD mailing service by making the big bet that people would watch movies and TV shows using an internet connection instead. That first-mover advantage helped initiate the so-called cord-cutting and cord-never movements. Netflix just reached another significant milestone, too. Four years ago is when it started investing billions of dollars to produce its own series like “The Crown” and “House of Cards.” The original programming accounted for five of the top 10 most searched TV shows in the world, according to Google. It also has inspired Amazon and others to give chase. The impressive expansion comes at a bigger and bigger price, however. Netflix generated negative free cash flow of $639 million in the fourth quarter, an increase from $506 million in the previous quarter and $276 million a year earlier. Netflix also is anticipating negative free cash flow of about $2 billion in 2017 compared to $1.7 billion last year. What’s more, it leaves the power of scale unclear. For the extra $2 billion in revenue that Netflix reaped between 2015 and 2016, it produced just $74 million of additional operating income. Even so, the company’s stock took another one of its trademark jumps, vaulting 8 percent in after-hours trading following the results on Wednesday, and is now valued at more than 140 times earnings.

              Aside from games like Pokemon GO, augmented reality - or AR - has struggled to find its place.
              Google Glass generated much excitement on launch, but stopped selling to consumers in 2015.

We have a temperature camera, we have depth camera, we have a forward-facing fish-eye lens camera for computer vision.

              The battery lasts 4 hours, though can be changed without stopping work.

 ,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team has been actively considering ways to revamp a temporary visa program used to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill high-skilled jobs, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Possibilities for reforming the distribution of H-1B visas, which are used largely by the tech industry, were discussed at a meeting last month with chief executives of tech companies at Trump Tower, said two sources, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to talk about the closed-door talks. DON’T MISS Pharma grapples with drug price backlash DOJ to examine FBI actions in Clinton email probe Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller proposed scrapping the existing lottery system used to award the visas. A possible replacement system would favor visa petitions for jobs that pay the highest salaries, according to the sources. H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in “specialty” occupations that generally require higher education, which according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 65,000 every year. Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics that say those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications. The top 10 recipients of H-1B visas in 2015 were all outsourcing firms, according to government data compiled by the IEEE-USA, a professional organization representing U.S. engineers. Sixty-five percent of H-1B petitions approved in the 2014 fiscal year went to tech workers, mostly from India, according to USCIS. In several high-profile cases, American workers were asked to train H-1B holders to do their jobs before being laid off themselves. The idea advanced by Miller in the tech meeting has also been pushed by the IEEE-USA. Miller previously served as a staffer for Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for attorney general, who has been an outspoken critic of abuses of the H-1B program. Trump, who has applied for H-1B visas to bring in foreign workers to his own businesses sent mixed messages about the program on the campaign trail. He assailed it for taking jobs from U.S. workers, but during a Republican debate last March said he was “softening” his position “because we have to have talented people in this country.” He later issued a statement on his website saying he would “end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program.” Trump businesses, like Trump National Golf Club and Trump Model Management, have received permission to bring in more than two dozen foreign employees on H-1B visas since 2011, according to Department of Labor data. During the meeting last month in New York, Trump seemed to be searching for middle ground, and members of his transition team raised specific proposals, the two sources said. A third source familiar with the talks said the Trump team has also discussed the plan to change the lottery system internally. Trump seemed open to modifying the H-1B program, the sources said. He said he wanted to stop “bad people” from immigrating to the United States, not “great people,” according to one account of the meeting. Among proposals the group discussed was raising the cost of applications from large companies as a way to discourage bulk filing for the visas. Asked by Trump if they would object to that, none of the tech CEOs said they would. “In our view, the president-elect is not hostile to H-1B visas,” said one of the sources familiar with discussions at the meeting. While Trump could initiate some changes to the visa program with executive action, significant shifts would likely need to go through a lengthy formal rulemaking process, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration expert at Cornell Law School. Major changes would likely be subject to court challenges, he said. Other reforms, like changing the visa cap or offering more green cards to high-tech workers, could require Congressional action, Yale-Loehr said. ","

Rakesh Sharma,01192017,Investopedia,01122017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is the latest company to jump onto the self-driving car bandwagon. A report in tech publication Recode states that the Seattle-based company has been granted a patent to develop a ""roadway management system"" for self-driving vehicles to navigate reversible lanes. As the name indicates, reversible network lanes are lane systems that change directions based on traffic flow. They are widely used to manage rush-hour traffic as well as highway systems. For autonomous cars, which follow programmed routes, reversible lanes present a particularly important safety issue, as a change in lane direction could result in a crash with an oncoming vehicle. (See also: Baidu Makes Bet on Self-Driving Cars in China.) Amazon's solution uses a series of queries to determine the appropriate roadway management system for that route. Self-driving vehicles can query the roadway management system responsible for that lane to determine traffic flow and roadway assignment. Recode opines that Amazon's patent likely has to do with its ambitions in the logistics industry. The company has been on a shopping spree in the past couple of years and has purchased freight planes and fleets of trucks to expand its logistics fleet. (See also: Will Amazon's Logistics Ground FedEx and UPS?) The company has also invested in mobile technology to increase efficiency and streamline operations. In addition, it has launched Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA), a service that enables vendors on its site to fulfill their orders using its logistics service.

Based on an initial assessment of Amazon's patent, it seems that the roadway management system could be used by self-driving vehicles manufactured by other car manufacturers. If it does come out with self-driving vehicles in the near future, Amazon would enter a crowded field of competitors including established companies and startups. Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG) is the most well known.

The partnership will integrate map content from HERE into Baidu Maps for Europe and other countries. Baidu Maps is usually considered a Chinese mapping service, but the service actually has over 350 million active users worldwide and provides data for more than 150 countries. It's usually overshadowed by Google Maps in most of those markets, but it has made progress in countries that are frequented by Chinese travelers. HERE has mapped about 200 countries, and makes millions of daily changes to its maps based on data collected from vehicles, cartographers, and tens of thousands other sources. BMW, Daimler, and Audi acquired HERE for two key reasons: to further their driverless vehicle efforts, and to prevent Google from collecting data from their customers. Bruno Bourguet, SVP and head of sales and business development at HERE, stated that the company was ""excited that this extended agreement with Baidu will help a growing number of travelers and tourists, particularly from China, plan their trips and find their way to more countries and places than ever before."" Baidu's partnership with HERE will also help the tech giant expand its driverless vehicle efforts into other countries. It has been test driving autonomous vehicles in China, and formed a driverless tech center in Silicon Valley that will eventually test drive vehicles in the U.S. Baidu is currently outsourcing the production of the cars to Chinese automakers, and announced that its first commercially available driverless vehicle -- a shuttle bus that will travel on preset loops -- will arrive in 2018.

(TSLA) provided additional details about new charging costs yesterday. In a blogpost, the company stated that Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X purchased after January 15 will receive free 400 kWh (or roughly 1,000 miles) of free Supercharging credits. It arrived at this figure after analyzing usage of its charging stations. “We carefully considered current Supercharger usage and found that 400 kWh covers the annual long-distance driving needs of the majority of our owners. As a result, most owners will continue to enjoy the benefits of Supercharging on road trips at no additional cost,” it stated. (See also: Apple, Google, Tesla Are Most Innovative Companies: BCG) After 400 kWh, Tesla owners will pay a “small fee” at Supercharging stations to charge up their car. The company said the amount of the small fee would depend on applicable laws and policies in individual states and regions. For example, California and Virginia are among states that permit kWh-based charging. Within California itself, electric vehicle owners can also opt for time-based charging, which offers a lower rate for charging during certain windows. Tesla assured its car owners that they will pay per kWh in most regions. “We are only aiming to recover a portion of our costs and set up a fair system for everyone; this will never be a profit center for Tesla,” stated the company. As an example, the company has calculated the price for a road trip between major cities on the three continents. “Customers will pay about $15 for a road trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles, about $120 from Los Angeles to New York, about €60 from Paris to Rome, and about ¥400 from Beijing to Shanghai,” the company stated. Tesla has 795 Supercharging stations worldwide. It intends to double the number of stations by the end of this year. Tesla’s announcement comes as European car makers are mounting a serious challenge to the company’s charging stations in the continent. According to a Reuters report, BMW (BMW.DE), Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG, and Ford Motor Company (F) are planning to build 400 next-generation charging stations in Europe. These stations will take minutes, instead of hours, to charge an electric vehicle.

The settlement was entered into between Varco and the United States Bureau of Industry and Statistics, a division of the Department of Commerce. According to the settlement, Varco admitted that it violated portions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and will pay the Department of Commerce $25 million, as well as a separately assessed fine of $2.5 million. Although the trade was carried out by Canadian subsidiaries, the Department of Commerce made the case that Varco executives in the United States were “willfully blind” to the deals.

Anita Balakrishnan,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Alphabet buys its own ads to give its hardware top search spots, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Google told the Journal that it takes step to minimize conflict in the ad-bidding process, and that the results are based on ""the ad's quality and the price Google is willing to pay."" Google was second only to Facebook when it comes to 2016 display ad revenue worldwide, and is the leader in search ad spending. In a statement to CNBC, a spokeswoman for Alphabet said: We have consciously and carefully designed our marketing programs to not impact the ad auction. All our bids are excluded from the auction when determining the price paid by other advertisers, and we have strict rules and processes — set to tougher levels than our customers —to govern the use of our own ads products. The data comes amid accusations from the European Commission that Google skews results to favor its comparison shopping service.

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has been investing heavily in AI, acquiring companies such as Deepmind in 2014 and using the technology in the majority of its products from search to photos. While Brin was heading the Google X research lab from 2010 to 2015, it was working on a project called Google Brain — an AI platform that is used across the search giant. But Brin told delegates at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, that, at the time, he ""didn't pay attention to it all."" The Google co-founder told a story about a colleague who showed him a picture of cat created by this AI platform. ""Jeff Dean would periodically come up to me and say, 'Look, the computer made a picture of a cat,' and I said 'OK that's very nice, Jeff' … and fast forward a few years and now Brain probably touches every single one of our main projects,"" Brin said. ""This kind of revolution in deep nets has been very profound and definitely surprised me even though I was right inside there. … It's an incredible time. What can these things do? We don't really know the limits."" AI and its impact on society has been a big theme at Davos with business leaders and politicians discussing the topic.

Josh Lipton,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"President-elect Donald Trump's views on a range of issues, from immigration to climate change, alienated many left-leaning tech employees in Silicon Valley, but none more so than those working at Alphabet. During the presidential campaign, 33 employees at the tech giant donated $20,000 to Trump, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That was a tiny fraction of the 1,400 employees who donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign, for a total of $1.6 million. And it wasn't just political donations. The revolving door between the Obama administration and the company swung hard and frequently during the past eight years: 22 former White House officials left the administration to work for Alphabet, according to research from the Campaign for Accountability. Alphabet's support for Clinton was evident in its C-suite as well. WikiLeaks revealed that Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt  emailed John Podesta — Clinton's campaign manager — volunteering to fund, advise and recruit talent for her White House run. CFO Ruth Porat donated $2,700 to Clinton, the maximum amount of money an individual can contribute to a federal campaign. Like many tech companies, Alphabet has a range of potential political issues that it must consider, from immigration to privacy, taxes to encryption. There are also regulatory concerns. In Europe, it is under fierce antitrust scrutiny. To date, the U.S. has been safer ground though CNBC reported last summer that officials from the Federal Trade Commission had deepened their analysis of the company's practices at home. Regulators can have a real impact on Google, from forcing changes in its business model to blocking acquisitions. It remains an open question how the Trump administration will approach these sensitive issues. For his part, Trump took tough, unverified shots at the iconic company on the campaign trail. For example, he accused Google of manipulating search results to favor his Democratic rival. Despite this rocky history, both sides are now trying to find common ground as the inauguration approaches. Alphabet CEO Larry Page recently joined other tech leaders at a meeting with the incoming president. Meanwhile, Schmidt has been very visible at Trump Tower, visiting at least twice. Stuart Roy, a veteran political strategist who used to represent the company in Washington, said that kind of outreach makes sense. ""It is clear that Trump values personal relationships much more than holding a vindictive grudge,"" says Roy, who is now president of the communications firm Strategic Action Public Affairs. ""Google is clearly not starting from a strong position, but I do think there is a way they can build that relationship and build that trust."" While its relationship with the new administration is uncertain, Alphabet does have plenty of conservative friends on Capitol Hill. Its top lobbyist is Susan Molinari, the former Republican congresswoman from New York. Last year, the company's political action committee donated $1.5 million to federal candidates, with 56 percent directed to Republicans. Alphabet declined comment for this story.

Tonya Riley,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"After years of navigating grad school and having to leave one position because of sexual harassment, Allison Esposito finally landed a dream job working as a content manager at Google Play. Her hard work had paid off and she had the career to show for it. But even while making six figures at a company she says ""really takes care of their workers,"" she couldn't ignore the many obstacles faced by women in tech. Often, women weren't being hired at all. According to a study by the group HiringSolved, women comprise only 19.6 percent of the staff of the top 25 tech companies. Esposito, who describes always having had an ""entrepreneurial streak,"" knew she had to do something. The best way to start, she figured, was to bring people together. HOW IT BEGAN In 2014, she started a coffee meet-up that expanded out from dozens of friends and acquaintances to hundreds in just a week. With a rapidly growing number of members, including those outside of New York, the group developed an online presence including a newsletter and job board. Before Esposito knew it, Tech Ladies had grown to include over 6,000 women. WHAT IT DOES The group connects women so they can expand their networks and learn the kind of negotiation skills that women have traditionally been discouraged from using. ""There's a networking gap for women,"" Esposito says. ""If your network isn't strong, you'll suffer in your career."" The organization aims to get more women into tech jobs and, once they're there, get them the salaries and respect they deserve. Where the work world can pit women against one another, especially creating divisions between younger and older employees, Tech Ladies seeks to bring a diverse continent of female employees together in order to help them all succeed. ""This is what we're building with Tech Ladies. It's not just a job board, and it's not just a community. It's both, and that's our secret sauce."" Esposito can list countless stories of women who have turned to fellow members for advice and have gotten results. In one case a member who had never before asked for a raise got a $6,000 salary increase using negotiating skills she learned from Tech Ladies. ""I learn a lot myself from reading [about interactions between members],"" she says. There's still one big hurdle women in tech face that has nothing to do with negotiation skills or networking: Sexual harassment. An industry report last year found that 60 percent of women in tech have had to deal with it. ""Part of the reason I started Tech Ladies was because of the stressful work experiences I had in my career. The funny thing is most of this happened to me before I was in tech,"" says Esposito. ""I had to leave a past job because I was being sexually harassed by a boss."" Esposito hasn't publicly spoken about her experience with sexual harassment, but it informs the Tech Ladies mission. The group offers an anonymous forum to which members can submit questions about difficult situations and from which they can get advice. ""The reality is, this is happening to women all the time. It's way too expensive and career crushing to sue your employer, so what do most of us do? We suffer as long as we can, and then we move on,"" says Esposito. Tech Ladies attempts to fight these conditions on a micro level, both by increasing diversity at companies and giving women the connections they need to get out of bad situations. ""When you're in that position, a few things are key. You need to have a super strong network and you need to have access to great new job opportunities,"" says Esposito. WORKING WITH TECH COMPANIES The group asks tech companies to make a concrete commitment to their values by listing openings on its job board, HireTechLadies, and including a direct contact so members can avoid the HR slush-pile. Tech Ladies also tries to steer women into jobs that make them feel welcome, in which there's a company culture of gender equality and emphasis on benefits like family leave. Esposito says the group has seen interest from companies including The New York Times, Warby Parker, Jet and more. The most eager companies, however, are smaller start-ups committed to building a positive workplace from the ground up. ""A lot of what I see is smaller start-ups who are maybe just two guys who just got funded who are trying to build a diverse culture from the start,"" says Esposito. TURNING A SIDE HUSTLE INTO A FULL-TIME JOB While Tech Ladies started as a passion project, after launching the Hire Tech Ladies website six months ago, Esposito found that the project was taking up more free time than she had. ""I had so many [requests] coming in, I was working till midnight every night for three months,"" says Esposito. Esposito knew she was ready to make that leap once she found herself turning down opportunities she would have otherwise said yes to. Once she felt that the organization couldn't thrive without her full attention, she knew she had to make a change. ""It's definitely a big leap to make your side project a full-time job,"" says Esposito. ""Only leave your full-time job when you feel like your project can't live without you."" Esposito is bootstrapping the project in lieu of seeking out investors, but she says putting herself through grad school as a nanny prepared her for the hustling and sacrifice required to build her own company. ""On a daily basis, I see people making connections,"" says Esposito. ""It's really interesting when you see something become bigger than you.""

Dan Schawbel,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"When I speak to some of the largest employers in the world, they unanimously agree that their biggest challenge is retention. Many employees, especially Millennials, are unable to see a career path at their current company, so they look outside of their company for other opportunities to advance. I believe the solution to a high attrition rate is career mobility, which is the movement of employees across different roles, either vertically or horizontally, within an organization. In a study by Futurestep, 87 percent of companies believe that internal mobility programs would definitely help with retention, yet only one third have these programs. Even the companies that have mobility programs aren't good at effectively communicating their talent needs and fail to keep updated records of employee skills. Some managers worry about letting one of their employees move into a new role on a different team. Managers who try to block these employees frustrate workers. So, instead of looking at new roles within their company, workers search outside of it and leave when the next opportunity presents itself. As a result, the manager has to replace good, ambitious workers, which is costly and time intensive and affects productivity. Why not work with employees instead? The topic of career mobility is more important today than in years past because the competition for top talent is increasing as our economy has recovered. The BLS reports that the unemployment rate today is five percent, which is down from 9.5 percent back in 2009. 76 percent of employees are looking for or open to a new job. Companies that want to increase their retention rate need to become more fluid, help employees build internal career paths and create cultures where managers are supportive, not restrictive. A new study by Future Workplace and Cisco links career mobility to organizational success. The study found that companies that embrace internal career mobility increase employee engagement (49%) improve employee productivity (39%) and improve employee teamwork (39%). Companies that have mobility programs are also more likely to be considered a ""best place to work"" by their employees. In order to create an effective talent mobility program, you need to focus on three improvements: Internal hiring, flexibility and training by project. First, companies need to develop a culture that embraces internal hiring, where employees are given the first opportunity to apply for roles over external candidates. When employees feel that they are empowered to apply for other roles and advance within your company, they are more likely to choose that option. A study by Future Workplace and Saba found that 66 percent of employees would first look at open positions at their current company before looking elsewhere. By hiring internal candidates first, it boosts moral and gives talent a chance to grow, while saving you money from finding and training an external candidate. Second, it's essential to promote flexibility at your company in order to remain competitive as an employer. In a recent global study with Randstad, we found that the top benefit that Gen Z workers and Millennials want is flexibility. Employees are expected to be reachable outside of the office by phone or email and the 9-to-5 workday no longer exists. Aside from telecommuting and flexible schedules, more companies should allow employees to do work outside of their job description. An example of this is Google's 20% program, which prevents employees from having to do the same projects everyday and allows them to be more creative. Third, companies should focus on training employees by assigning them new projects so they are challenged and more engaged in their work. For instance, Intel boasts an employee development tool called DOT, which connects talent to short-term needs to match development goals. If you're in the accounting department but are interested in taking on a marketing project, you can apply for it without giving up your current job. This way, you can learn, and grow your network, in a different department with little risk to your manager. In the Randstad study, we found that both Gen Z workers and Millennials agree that the most effective training program is cross-functional projects. Career mobility will continue to become more relevant as the war for talent heats up in 2017 and beyond. Companies that create programs around it will increase their retention and employee satisfaction rates, while those that don't will suffer productivity and financial losses.

WPP started off 2016 forecasting clients would spend $30 million on advertising on Snapchat, the app owned by Snap Inc. Later in the year, WPP upped its forecast to $60 million and Sorrell said in December that clients were spending $70 million. But the boss of WPP told CNBC that 2016 spending on Snapchat by clients was actually $90 million. Based on this figure, Sorrell said forecasts about Snapchat's revenue last year are likely to be higher than what the market currently expects. Several media reports note Snapchat's revenue in 2016 was forecast to be $350 million, but Sorrell notes that if WPP clients spent $90 million out of that, it was likely that the social media company's figure would be higher. The WPP boss said that Snapchat could become a threat to  Facebook in the ad market. ""It does become a threatening alternative to Facebook and I think that's the big opportunity for them. We know Facebook have tried to buy Snapchat a couple of times, we know that they've made product changes as a result of Snapchat's products,"" Sorrell told CNBC. ""I think Facebook is concerned about the potential opposition."" Sorrell flagged up the ongoing debate over ""fake news"" as well as advertising measurement issues as opportunities for Snapchat to capitalize one. Internet companies including Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google have been criticized in recent months for not doing enough to combat false articles, particularly around the U.S. election in November. Facebook also admitted finding issues with their ad metrics in December. ""I think with the measurement issues, with the fake news issues, and the fraud issues that the internet faces, clients want to try and experiment,"" Sorrell told CNBC. But the WPP head also said that ad spend on Snapchat from clients is still small compared to $5 billion for Google and $1.7 billion for Facebook last year. Market research firm eMarketer expects ad spend on Snapchat to reach $935.46 million in 2017. Snap is reportedly preparing for an IPO this year that could value the company at $25 billion. The company has 150 million daily active users and has been trying to boost its ad offerings. One of the main ways companies can advertise on Snapchat is via lenses - filters that go over a user's snap. But the company has also introduced adverts in between Snapchat Stories too.

 ,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Executives from LinkedIn, Alphabet's Google, Facebook and other big tech companies are partnering with a private university to help train people in the skills needed to land new high-paid jobs in the digital economy, and plug a shortfall in qualified workers felt well beyond Silicon Valley. ISDI Digital University counts Gary Briggs, Facebook's chief marketing officer, Greg Petroff, Google's managing director for online and cloud, and Steve Cadigan, LinkedIn's former VP of talent, among its faculty and board members. Graduates of the program — which covers things like developing a user interface, social media, search engines and cyber law — receive a Master's Degree of Internet Business. This comes at a time when U.S. technology firms — which have come under fire for outsourcing jobs and hastening automation — face increasing pressure to show they are helping U.S. workers. ""Our position is going to be to open the eyes of what career possibilities there are going to be in the digital world,"" cofounder Cadigan told CNBC. Each module is taught by an expert in the field who will in turn pull in other experts from their companies to help teach the curriculum, says CEO Amir Mashkoori. For example, Facebook's Briggs will teach a social media module and Google's Petroff will teach courses on design and user interface. ""When someone learns how to do a website, they are learning it from someone who builds websites all day long, when someone learns how to do a Google AdWords campaign, they are learning from someone at Google,"" Mashkoori told CNBC. ""You're learning what's happening out in the world today."" While working at LinkedIn, which has since been acquired by Microsoft, Cadigan found that business leaders shared the same problem in trying to find workers qualified to drive digital growth in areas like e-commerce and digital marketing, he said. He was also repeatedly approached for career advice by people feeling left behind by the digital economy, he said. ""We couldn't find anything in the U.S. that was addressing this very, very acute problem,"" he said. ""People are freaking out, it's the right thing to do, this is going to make a difference."" Enrollment in the 9 month program is not cheap — it costs $27,500 — but students can begin to recoup their investment fast because the course is shorter than most master's programs, said Mashkoori. The first classes will take place at the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce starting in mid-March. ISDI is approved by California's Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education to run and offer a Master's Degree, a step towards becoming an accredited university. ISDI launched a similar program in 2009 in Spain, which has trained and graduated more than 1,000 students. ",How to get trained by Facebook's CMO for a job in social media
Gemma Acton,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"The leaders of major tech companies from Apple to Google have recently enthused about the enormous potential at the intersection of health care and technology for business and individuals alike. Such enthusiasm was discussed during a CNBC panel regarding the future of health care during the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday, where the head of SAP echoed the belief that the potential for technology-enabled healthcare solutions is immense. Speaking to the limitations of the world's existing, largely analogue healthcare infrastructure, SAP Chief Executive Officer(CEO) Bill McDermott emphasized that the possibilities available to enhance patients' experiences are exciting and evolving. ""I think it's wild that we're still in a world where you repeat what's wrong with you to several different people and you write what's wrong with you down on a piece of paper,"" McDermott commented. ""The patient wants more than that,"" he added. In McDermott's view, the biggest potential health care gamechanger is in the provision of personalized, precision medicine where exact solutions can be pinpointed for each patient.  Although the SAP chief says it is not an area in which his enterprise software company stands to make money for several years, he claims it has the power to truly transform lives and that from a longer-term perspective, ""that opportunity is limitless."" However, looking further out, fellow panelist Jonathan Adiri, founder and CEO of health care technology start-up healthy.io, which is the first company to turn a smartphone into a clinical grade scanner, talked to the longer-term opportunity looming. ""Health care in the U.S. alone is almost a $3 trillion opportunity,"" he claimed, adding that if a company is able to capture even only a sliver of that market, the potential for growth is tremendous. Indeed, Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet recently posited that it was highly likely that the next $100 billion corporation could come from the health care industry. Panelist Michael Neidorff, chairman and CEO of Centene, which focuses on providing health care solutions to the most vulnerable persons in the U.S., said using all available technology for all patients regardless of their circumstances was critical. ""That's what every person is entitled to in our opinion,"" he affirmed. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook. ",Tech set to transform $3 trillion health care industry
Anita Balakrishnan,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"There's less internal conflict inside Apple — and that's not necessarily a good thing, according to one former employee. Bob Burrough, a former Apple engineer, told CNBC that the invention of the iPhone came, in part, out of the chaos of Apple under co-founder Steve Jobs. ""At Apple in 2007, organizationally it was the wild west,"" Burrough said.  ""I was hired under a particular manager, but for the first two years worked on projects that had virtually nothing to do with that manager's core responsibility.  That's because the organization wasn't the priority, the projects were the priority. It was the exact opposite of 'not my job.'  It was 'I'm here to solve whatever problems I can, irrespective of my role, my title, or to whom I report.'  It was wild. But it was also very rewarding, because everything you did had maximal impact on the product."" But today, the ""dynamic has clearly and distinctly changed,"" and Apple is much closer to his job at Palm, said Burrough, who most recently founded a 3D printing company called Bilt It. ""Working at Palm, the teams were highly organizational, [hierarchical] and responsibilities were siloed,"" Burrough said. ""There was a clear sense that each person had a clear responsibility, and rarely deviated from it. When you went to someone for help solving a problem 'not my job' was a common response."" Tim Cook, who took over as Apple CEO in 2011, has made the company the richest in the world. Apple has nearly doubled its annual revenue under Cook, from $108.2 billion in 2011 to $215.7 billion in 2016. Cook has also replaced challenging leaders from the Steve Jobs era, such as Scott Forstall, who led the iOS platform used on the iPhone and iPad, but reportedly clashed with Cook and other Apple execs. But while Apple has pumped out money, it has also faced grumbles that it's been slow to innovate in areas like self-driving cars, TV and video, and the Internet of Things. Despite introducing new products like the Apple Watch, the iPhone still makes up the vast majority of Apple's sales each year. Entrepreneur Steve Blank has likened Cook's leadership to that of Microsoft's Steve Ballmer, who took over from Bill Gates and tripled Microsoft's sales. But under Ballmer, Microsoft missed major opportunities to retain its software dominance as companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon took the lead on mobile, search, social and cloud. Burrough said he endorses the comparison between Ballmer and Cook. He went on a tweet storm on Tuesday where he said apple was no longer a ""dynamic change-maker."" Tweet: @asymco @JohnKirk Steve would boast how the whole company could turn on a dime. Tweet: ""Question: If conflict comes from caring about a product, and Tim Cook eliminated conflict, did Tim Cook eliminate caring?"" But not all former Apple employees agree. Tony Fadell, a top-tier Apple engineer who later founded home-automation company Nest and sold it to Google, has said that ""there was never a competition"" at Apple. ""We, together, were searching for the best solution. Steve asked us to test all the possibilities,"" Fadell tweeted. Tweet: ""Wrong!!! There was never a competition. We, together, were searching for the best solution. Steve asked us to test all the possibilities..."" There's still evidence of plenty of competition between engineers at Apple, if not what it once was: Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that in the past few years, inside the Mac division ""Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision."" CNBC reached out to Apple for comment. ",Tim Cook made Apple 'boring operations company' - former engineer

Good luck finding a Pixel XL or one with more storage. Image source: Google. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages. That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around, we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report. While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course. The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge: We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis. Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders. The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels. How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product. ","

Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is best-known for its search engine, but is also home to some big moves in artificial intelligence (AI). In April 2016, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stepped in as the guest writer of Alphabet's annual founders' letter and noted: ""... the next big step will be for the very concept of the 'device' to fade away. Over time, the computer itself -- whatever its form factor -- will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world."" Let's take a look at what AI is and how Google is working to be at the forefront of the move to an AI-first world.  Most references to AI actually refer to machine learning, and more specifically, deep learning, a specific technique within AI. So what is deep learning? It's when a computer simulation of the human brain called a neural network is used to recreate our capacity to learn. It's fed a multitude of examples and complex algorithms that ""teach"" it to recognize similarities and distinguish differences. In the simplest terms, the computer learns to recognize patterns from massive quantities of data. Deep learning uses artificial neural networks to recreate our capacity to learn. Image source: Getty Images. Google systems are benefiting from deep learning. Image source: Getty Images. Engineers proficient in deep learning are currently estimated to be about 10% of the company's 25,000 engineers and a leader of Google's machine learning effort has said he'd like that number to be closer to 100%. To help spread machine learning, the company created the Machine Learning Ninja Program, which identifies talented coders and embeds them in its machine-learning teams. When the six-month program is over, they fan out across the company seeking new ways to apply machine learning to existing systems. This strategy is paying off. For instance, it freed employees from cataloging street addresses captured by Google's Street View cars updating its Maps service: Google Brain now completes the tedious and time-consuming task using image recognition. Google helped solidify its lead in deep learning in January 2014 when it acquired London-based AI company DeepMind for $600 million. It has since used machine learning technology to arrange its data centers more efficiently, based on how their power use had changed over time. Expanding on that success, Google now uses DeepMind technology to control the power consumption in those data centers. By manipulating servers and cooling systems and controlling over 120 condition-based variables, the company achieved a 15% improvement in power usage efficiency and a 40% reduction in cooling costs.  These hundreds of millions of dollars in savings over several years will help recoup the cost to acquire DeepMind and there are plans to roll this strategy out to other potential applications. DeepMind's technology is also available to help companies that run on Google's cloud to improve their own energy efficiency. Consumer products are seeing dramatic improvements. Image source: Getty Images. Google Assistant is where Google's AI most directly meets people. It powers the Google Home smart speaker and, in future, will be able to stream music, movies, and TV to the growing ecosystem of Google-branded devices including Android TV, Chromecast, and speakers.  It will also provide deeper personalization resulting from data located in Maps, Calendar, Keep, and other services. In several recent unscientific tests,  Google Assistant was found to be superior to its competitors. One key selling point is the ability to successfully answer follow-up questions. Other examples abound. Users of Google Translate saw a dramatic improvement in its usefulness and accuracy as applying advances in natural-language processing reduced error rates by up to 85%, making greater progress in six weeks than the service had seen in the previous 10 years. Google Photos now has the uncanny ability to locate a specific photo based on a description given by the user. Gmail's Inbox introduced a Smart Reply feature that suggests three potential responses to an email that users can choose with a tap, rather than having to type an answer. Google has been increasingly focusing its efforts on AI and planning for an AI-centric world.  While it typically does not release the terms of acquisitions, it is telling that Google has acquired 11 AI-related companies in the past five years and applying AI technology to increasing its competitive advantage and positioning for the future. While it will be difficult to quantify some benefits, we already know deep learning can increase revenue and efficiency, and make the ecosystem more productive and valuable to consumers. This moonshot will continue to pay dividends. ","

If you're considering an investment in the home automation segment, there are a mind-boggling number of choices. You can invest in individual component manufacturers, professional systems installation companies, or managed services. We will look at some of the best in each category. Home automation falls into three very broad categories. Let's look at a few potential investments in each: Home automation is reaching into every aspect of our lives. Image source: Pixabay. Professionally installed systems are integrated when the home is built or a retrofit is done. There are several such companies, but most are privately held. One exception, that's also a leader in the field -- is Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ:CTRL). This is the only pure play on the list. This company is extremely small, with a market cap of about $265 million, at the time of writing. It provides a wide variety of systems and options and serves both the home and business markets. It provides choices in all the major component categories including lighting and environment controls, entertainment, security, and networks to control them all. It also integrates with over 10,000 existing third-party products. On the operational side, the company has been growing revenue and earnings, up 27% and 49%, respectively, year over year in the most recent quarter. It has been expanding gross margin and investing in sales and marketing efforts, which Control4 believes will result in additional revenue growth. It has been developing internationally and acquired Pakedge Networking last year. Control4 believes that having its own networking solution will not only drive revenues but also help dealers identify issues in customer networks, leading to greater levels of customer satisfaction. The company is growing its network of dealers that install its products and increasing its addressable market by providing solutions for middle-income homeowners while still serving the luxury market. This company seems to be pursuing growth in a smart and measured way, and the stock will probably move higher. Image source: Comcast. Managed service systems offer a more limited range of offerings, centered mostly on security, while charging a monthly monitoring fee. The best way to play this segment may be an investment in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). Its service is security based but also provides lighting and environment controls, while already having an ""in"" with networks and entertainment from its cable and broadband offerings. It sees this market as a natural extension of its existing business. Having its own broadband provides distinct advantages, allowing it to control that portion of the equation. The company has consistently grown both revenue and earnings over the past five years, and the stock has increased 174% to the S&P's 73% over the same time period. The do-it-yourself market is much more cluttered and provides a variety of options to the discerning investor. Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Assistant, and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri all represent entries into the nascent virtual-assistant category, and all offer a multitude of products that integrate with their devices. Each of these virtual assistants responds to voice commands. Amazon Echo and Echo Dot. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon currently has the advantage of a yearlong head start with its Amazon Echo speaker system, powered by Alexa. It has meanwhile been integrating Alexa into its other products, including its Echo range, Tap, and Fire TV. This advantage should not be underestimated. Amazon released Alexa to third-party hardware providers that have been integrating Alexa into their products.  The list of products Amazon's assistant can partner with is quite extensive, including such diverse offerings as hubs -- which control and network the system -- lighting, and environmental, as well as a laundry list of big-name service partners. Not to be outdone, Apple recently released its HomeKit, which comes with its Siri pedigree and its own list of iCompatible device categories that include alarms and sensors, heating and cooling, and lights and switches. These are compatible across a wide swath of iPod, iPads, and, of course, iPhones. iPhone 7 powered by Siri. Image source: Apple, Inc. Google, though late to the party, wants to steal the show. The Google Assistant is the brains behind the Google Home smart speaker and is integrated into the majority of Google-branded hardware products, including Android phones, Chromecast, and Android TV. It will also network with Google's software programs, including Google Calendar and Maps. In a recent research report, analytics firm IHS Markit reported that it believes that Google Smart Speakers will overtake Echo's lead by 2020. Did I mention that these three companies also have other businesses? Image source: Google. No company is perfect, and each of these suggestions comes with its own potential downside. Amazon's dominance as an e-retailer is well known, and home automation is one of many additional revenue streams it's pursuing. Since it has a P/E of 187, investors need to understand that if home automation is what they're interested in, they're paying a premium for Amazon's projected growth in online retail and the plethora of ventures it's pursuing. Google's premium is much more reasonable, with a P/E of 30, but similar to Amazon, home automation represents only a small fraction of its business. Apple is the most reasonably priced of the three, with a P/E of 14, but be aware that its share price, along with the majority of its revenue and income, depends directly on the success or failure of its ubiquitous iPhone and its release cycles. While not inclusive, this list provides investors with a starting point to invest in the home-automation segment. There are many ways to play this burgeoning market, so maybe one should ask ""Alexa, what's the best home automation investment?"" On second thought, better not: Her answer might be biased.

If you're nearing retirement age, or if you're retired and simply haven't used your Medicare benefits yet, then you may be confused about the different ""parts"" of Medicare and what each one covers. Medicare Part B is also known as ""medical insurance,"" and it covers most medical services and supplies other than hospital stays. Here's a more detailed explanation of what Medicare Part B covers and what it will cost in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Before we dive into a specific part of Medicare, let's go over the four parts of the program: For the remainder of this article, we'll take a deeper look at Part B, medical insurance. In a nutshell, Medicare Part B, or ""medical insurance,"" is the part of Medicare that covers most medical services and supplies other than hospital or skilled nursing facility stays. More specifically, the coverage provided by Medicare Part B can be grouped into two categories: medically necessary services and preventative services. This is the part of Medicare you would use when you see your doctor or have surgery. It also covers supplies that are deemed medically necessary, such as a wheelchair or a walker. Medicare Part B also covers ambulance services, but only if other transportation could endanger your health. For instance, if you're having a heart attack, Medicare Part B would cover ambulance transportation. Preventative services covered by Medicare Part B include services like lab tests; screenings for conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer; and services intended to prevent diseases (such as your annual flu shot). The short answer is that the standard Medicare Part B premium is $134 per month. However, that's not what most beneficiaries actually pay. There are essentially three categories of beneficiaries, each with different premiums. About 70% of Medicare beneficiaries pay their premiums directly through their Social Security benefits. Because of a rule linking Medicare premiums with Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, premiums for this group have grown more slowly over the past couple of years. This group of beneficiaries will pay just $109 per month on average in 2017. The standard $134 monthly premium is paid by most of the remaining 30%. This includes Medicare beneficiaries who have not yet claimed Social Security, as well as all new Medicare beneficiaries in 2017, regardless of whether or not they intend to pay premiums through Social Security. Finally, if your income is above a certain amount, then your Medicare Part B premiums will be higher. This is based on your modified adjusted income from two years ago (that's 2015 for this year) and your tax filing status. Here's a chart from Medicare.gov that can help you determine whether you'll pay a higher premium in 2017. All income numbers refer to MAGI from 2015. Data source: www.Medicare.gov. For all beneficiaries, the Medicare Part B deductible is $183 per year, and after this deductible is met, you'll typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for services provided. You may have seen headlines about Medicare's financial troubles, so let's set the record straight. First of all, those headlines are referring to the part of Medicare that's funded by tax revenue -- Part A, or hospital insurance -- not Part B, which is funded mostly by premiums. Also, Medicare Part A is in decent financial shape -- for now. The program has about $200 billion in reserves and is projected to operate at a surplus through 2020. After that, however, deficits are projected, and the Hospital Insurance trust fund is expected to run out in 2028. So it's fair to assume that something will need to change in the coming years. This change may come in the form of a tax increase, benefit reductions, or privatization. If Republican leaders get their way, Medicare will be privatized by 2024 (which would definitely affect Part B). The exact changes that will ultimately be made are anyone's guest at this point, but the next few years could produce some big changes to Medicare. ","

Social Security offers surviving family members two types of benefits when someone dies. The official Social Security death benefit is just a small one-time $255 payment. But Social Security's survivor benefits are much more important, providing family members with monthly payments that in some cases last the rest of their lives. If you're a surviving spouse or child, you can receive a $255 lump-sum death benefit if you meet certain eligibility requirements. A surviving spouse who was living in the same household with the worker when the worker died automatically gets the death benefit. Even if they were living apart, the surviving spouse can still get a payment if he or she was already getting benefits on the worker's work record or became eligible to do so when the worker died. Image source: Getty Images. If no spouse is eligible for the death benefit, a child can get it if he or she was receiving benefits on the worker's record or became eligible to do so at the worker's death. If no one qualifies to receive the payment, then the death benefit goes unpaid. Qualified recipients who are already getting benefits will typically receive the death benefit automatically. Those who aren't receiving benefits right now need to apply for the payment within two years of the date of death. The official Social Security death benefit is just a token payment a family member can receive. By contrast, the survivor benefits that take effect at a loved one's death are substantial and last a lot longer. For survivor benefits to take effect, the deceased worker must have worked long enough to earn a certain number of Social Security credits. That number varies depending on the age of the worker at death, ranging from as few as six to as many as 40. For surviving spouses, survivor benefits are often a financial lifeline. To qualify, the spouses must have been married for at least nine months prior to death, with exceptions applying for those who have children together or in cases of accidental death or death during military duty. Benefits can typically kick in once a surviving spouse reaches age 60, and younger spouses can also get survivor benefits if they're caring for a child who is under the age of 16. For those spouses who qualify based on a child, benefits stop once the child reaches 16, but then start up again when the spouse chooses to take them after turning 60. Children can also be eligible for survivor benefits. To qualify, the child must be under 18, or in high school and no older than 19. Children who aren't disabled stop getting benefits once they no longer qualify due to age. However, disabled children have no age limit, as long as they became disabled before turning 22. Even divorced spouses can get survivor benefits if they qualify. The spouses must have been married for at least 10 years, and the surviving spouse must not have remarried before reaching age 60. Survivor benefits are based on the retirement benefit that the deceased worker either already received or would have received at retirement. The base amount is determined taking into account any addition to or subtraction from the worker's benefit resulting from the age at which the worker claimed Social Security. So if the deceased worker claimed Social Security early at age 62, then the base amount will be less than if the worker had waited until full retirement age. Once that base amount is determined, Social Security applies any reduction based on the surviving spouse's timing of when to claim benefits. Those who wait until full retirement age get the full base amount, but if survivors claim early, then reductions apply. A 28.5% reduction applies to those who take benefits at 60, so if you would have gotten $1,000 per month at full retirement age, you'd only get $715 per month in survivor benefits if you take them starting at age 60. Spouses who haven't yet turned 60 but are caring for a child under 16 get 75% of the base amount of the worker's benefit. Eligible child survivors also get 75%, subject to a maximum total family amount that typically ranges from 150% to 180% of the worker's base amount. One key element of survivor benefits is that you can file for them independently from your own retirement benefit. Once you've applied for both, you won't get the sum of both -- instead, you're only entitled to receive whichever is larger. But one lucrative strategy can be to take either your own benefit or your survivor benefit early, and then change to a larger benefit later on. That way, you can get the best of both worlds. The Social Security Administration website has more information about both of these benefits. There is a page that talks about the Social Security death benefit, while survivor benefits are discussed here. There, you'll get more detailed information about how to qualify, how much you'll receive, and how you can apply online for benefits. Social Security's benefits after death provide financial security to your loved ones. By knowing how they work, you'll be in a better position to manage your finances no matter what happens.

Cybercrime is an epidemic. Consider these statistics from Checkmarx: Cybercrime is expected to cost businesses over $2 trillion annually by 2019, four times as much as 2015. In the U.S., a breach costs a company an estimated $15.4 million on average. Some hacks can be resolved in days, while others can take weeks or months. These are more than mere statistics. Real-world examples abound. In December, Yahoo! revealed the largest known security breach to date, which compromised over 1 billion accounts, only months after it reported a separate breach involving 500 million users. These intrusions could take years to resolve and cost millions of dollars. Cybercrime is an epidemic; IBM's Watson has your back. Image source: Pixabay. One of the technologies behind Watson is an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline known as deep learning. A software model of the brain is used to recreate our ability to learn. By using a massive number of examples, combined with sophisticated algorithms, the system learns to discover similarities among the examples and find differences. This results in the program mastering pattern recognition when reviewing large data sets. IBM Watson is expanding its security protocol. Image source: Pixabay. IBM announced earlier this year that it was partnering with eight universities in a year-long research project to provide Watson with the requisite data necessary to expand its security protocol. These universities were chosen on the strength of their cybersecurity programs. According to an IBM press release in May, the system was ""learning the nuances of security research findings and discovering patterns and evidence of cyberattacks and threats that could otherwise be missed.""  Students and faculty input security data while Watson learned the peculiarities specific to cybersecurity. It planned to process up to 15,000 documents per month, building its database of threat intelligence reports, cybercrime strategies, and threat databases. And the work is paying off. IBM recently announced that 40 organizations are now part of the Watson Cyber Security beta program. This group hails from a wide array of industries including banking, healthcare, insurance, finance, travel, energy, automotive, and education.  IBM hopes that by increasing participation in the beta program, Watson will, over time, evolve into the next generation of cyberdefense. ""By applying intelligent technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, Watson can help security analysts make better decisions from structured data, as well as the massive amount of unstructured data that has been dark to an organization's defenses until now,"" IBM wrote in its press release. Mixing AI and cyber-security holds a lot of promise. MIT announced earlier this year that an AI system had achieved an 85% success rate at detecting threats. This system, called AI Squared, differed from previous attempts at using AI for cyberdefense.  Rather than simply referring all anomalies to its human counterparts, this experiment provided feedback from the analyst to the system, allowing it to learn from the input provided by its human counterparts.  This improved the system's assessments over time, increasing the accuracy of future predictions. This reduced the number of both false positives and false negatives, according to MIT. This is a quantum leap forward versus earlier outlier detection, which merely looks for anomalies that are then forwarded to a human technician for further assessment.  This video from MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory illustrates the process: Google neural networks created their own encryption! Image source: Pixabay IBM isn't the only player in this emerging field. While many big tech companies use varying degrees of artificial intelligence to help provide security for their cloud-computing operations,  some are taking it to another level. In a research paper, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) division Google revealed that two neural networks had learned to build their own form of encryption, while a third was unable to crack that code. This is significant because they weren't taught about encryption or given any examples of encrypted and decrypted messages. Two neural networks were instructed to send communications to each other, and keep that information secret from the third. This is likely an early development toward a dynamic system that learns to protect itself. In its conclusion, the paper states: ""Finally, neural networks may be useful not only for cryptographic protections but also for attacks."" With its massive data centers and cloud infrastructure, this development could further enhance Google's business and advance its already impressive AI credentials. IBM has been leveraging Watson in a variety of ways. In adding cybersecurity to its resume, IBM hopes to capitalize on the inability of companies to keep pace with the growing threat posed by cybercrime. Sandy Bird, chief technology officer of IBM Security was quoted as saying in a press release: Customers are in the early stages of implementing cognitive security technologies. Our research suggests this adoption will increase threefold over the next three years, as tools like Watson for Cyber Security mature and become pervasive in security operations centers. Currently, only seven percent of security professionals claim to be using cognitive solutions. If Watson can capture just a portion of that threefold increase, its training has not been in vain.

Just like last year, the 2017 federal tax return deadline doesn't fall on the usual date of April 15. Federal tax payments and personal income tax filings for the 2016 tax year are due on April 18, 2017. Those who file in two U.S. states, Maine and Massachusetts, score an extra day -- their filings are due on April 19, 2017. Taxes are traditionally due on April 15, but the IRS pushes off the due date if it falls on a weekend or holiday. IRS Publication 54 explains that ""when the due date for doing any act for tax purposes -- filing a return, paying taxes, etc. -- falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is delayed until the next business day."" Image source: Getty Images. In 2017, April 15 falls on a Saturday. The next business day, Monday, April 17, is a holiday in Washington, D.C. (Emancipation Day). Therefore, taxes are due on Tuesday, April 18, 2017. A similar thing happened in 2016, when taxes were also due on April 18 instead of April 15. Those who file in Maine and Massachusetts get an extra day due to Patriots Day. Therefore, if you file in either of these states, you'll have until Wednesday, April 19, to submit your taxes and make any necessary tax payments. I mean, really -- it's only right that a holiday named ""Patriots Day"" would push off a tax deadline. The last day to make a contribution to an IRA for any tax year is when taxes are due. Thus, since 2016 taxes are due on April 18, 2017, that's the last day to make a contribution to your individual retirement account for the 2016 tax year. Individuals who are 50 or older can contribute up to $6,500 to an IRA during a tax year, whereas younger savers can contribute $5,500. Making a contribution to an IRA before the tax deadline is a great way to catch up if you didn't maximize your IRA contribution during the last calendar year. It's not just a smart decision for your future; making a contribution to a traditional IRA can potentially reduce taxes you owe or result in a larger refund for the 2016 tax year. It's not always possible to get your tax returns filed before the April deadline. Some tax forms get lost in the mail, and your accountant might not have time to squeeze you in before the April 18 deadline. Life happens. But the IRS is pretty forgiving. You can file for an extension with Form 4868, which gives you until Oct. 17, 2017, to file your 2016 taxes. Importantly, an extension is only for paperwork. It doesn't extend the time you have to pay any taxes that may be due. For this reason, it's smart to make an estimated tax payment before the April deadline, to avoid penalties or interest on unpaid tax balances. ","
      
    When Are Taxes Due in 2017? -- The Motley Fool

Steve Symington,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) announced in late October that it will acquire Level 3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT), shares of the telecommunications giant plunged more than 13% over the next few days to flirt with a fresh 52-week low. And though the stock has partially recovered since then, CenturyLink is still well below the levels it stood at just before news of the acquisition broke. With shares now trading at just 11 times this year's expected earnings, have investors overreacted to CenturyLink's acquisition of Level 3? And more importantly, could the deal possibly be a smart, value-creating move for shareholders? I think so. Image source: Getty Images. Before we get there, however, I'll admit it's hard to blame the market for bidding shares of CenturyLink down. For one, recall that shares of both CenturyLink and Level 3 skyrocketed 18% and 13%, respectively, in a single day the previous week after reports surfaced stating the two companies were in ""advanced talks"" to merge. So CenturyLink's subsequent plunge wasn't quite as pronounced as it might have seemed at the time. And to be fair, when the dust cleared and the deal was formally announced a few days later, CenturyLink had agreed to acquire Level 3 for $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink stock for each Level 3 share. That equated to $66.50 per share at the time, valuing the deal at $34 billion, including the debt CenturyLink will assume. That's a big pill to swallow considering CenturyLink's enterprise value stands at ""just"" $33.5 billion as of this writing. More than anything else, then, this acquisition should be considered a merger of equals. And if there are any hiccups as these two enormous companies begin to integrate following the planned third-quarter 2017 closing of the deal, you can be sure CenturyLink shares will invoke the market's ire again. But those risks may be worth taking in light of the expected benefits of this deal. First, for those of you worried about CenturyLink's sky-high annual dividend of $2.16 per share (yielding 8.5% at today's prices) and disconcerting 127% payout ratio, note that CenturyLink anticipates maintaining its annual payout. But how? As fellow Fool Brian Stoffel pointed out a few months ago, CenturyLink's use of both earnings and free cash flow to fund capital returns was already enough to ensure that its lofty dividend could survive at the time. And now, with the help of Level 3's nearly $10 billion in aggregate net operating losses, the acquisition should substantially improve free cash flow, and in turn, according to CenturyLink, help to ""enhance the combined company's financial flexibility and significantly lower its payout ratio."" CenturyLink will also enjoy the massively increased scale of the two companies' combined fiber networks, increasing its network by 200,000 route miles of fiber and giving it a presence in more than 60 countries. On-net buildings should increase almost 75%, to 75,000 -- even after accounting for buildings already served by both Level 3 and CenturyLink -- including 10,000 buildings in Latin America and the EMEA regions. Moreover, CenturyLink anticipates significant cost synergies, as it will be able to focus capital investments on increasing capacity and extending the reach of its fiber network. And the company should be able to identify significant incremental revenue growth opportunities through its impending ability to deploy the combined product portfolios across the combined customer base. In particular, CenturyLink is excited to be able to offer its larger enterprise customers the benefits of Level 3's global footprint. If that wasn't enough, CenturyLink anticipates generating $975 million in annual run-rate cash synergies from operational efficiencies, systems consolidation, and removal of duplicate functions. To be fair, CenturyLink also expects that realizing these synergies and integrating the two networks will result in one-time costs of roughly $685 million, the majority of which will be incurred by 2019. In addition, the deal is still subject to federal and state regulatory approvals, as well as the approvals of both CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders. So there is plenty of room for hiccups along the way that could derail the process. But if the acquisition closes as planned later this year, and if CenturyLink is successful in the integration process, I think shareholders who opt to hang on despite the broader market's pessimism will probably be more than happy with their decision over the long run.

Any number of unexpected financial roadblocks can make setting aside extra money every year for retirement tough. While everyone's situation is different, it can be helpful to educate yourself about how peers are saving, especially if it leads you to make changes that can boost your financial security down the road. Are you contributing more to your retirement plan than the average American? Read on to find out how much American's are stashing away of their income in 401(k) and 403(b) plans every year. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Vanguard's ""How America Saves 2016"" report finds that contribution rates to defined contribution plans, including 401(k) plans, vary widely depending on age and income, and that the average worker set aside 6.8% of their earnings in these accounts in 2015. Data source: Vanguard. Author's chart. Overall, only 20% of 401(k) participants contributed more than 10% to their defined contribution plan that year, and while I didn't find that too surprising given tight budgets, I was surprised to learn that one-third of Americans are saving less than 4% of their income in these plans. Since the average income in America is $46,409, a significant number of workers are saving less than $1,856 annually. Contributing at that level over an entire 40-year career could produce a sizable retirement nest egg. However, total retirement savings data suggests that's not the case. For instance, contributing $1,856 per year over a 40-year career into an investment returning a hypothetical 6% annually results in retirement savings of $287,281.54. However, half of baby boomers have saved less than $100,000 for retirement, including 37% who have saved less than $50,000. Considering how close these Americans are to their golden years, those are hardly confidence-inspiring figures that suggest they'll reach that $287,281 level of savings. Overall, Vanguard finds that just 12% of plan participants are contributing the maximum amount they're allowed to contribute every year. In 2017, up to $18,000 of earnings can be deferred in 401(k) or 403(b) plans. If you're 50 or older, an additional $6,000 catch-up contribution can be made, too, yet only 16% of Americans eligible to make that catch-up contribution are taking advantage of it. 25% Data source: Vanguard. Author's table. Unsurprisingly, the contribution rate of 401(k) and 403(b) participants depends a great deal on annual income and age. On average, lower-income earners contribute far less to their retirement saving plans than high-income earners, and younger workers contribute less than older workers. In 2015, Americans earning less than $30,000 per year contributed an average 4.4%, which works out to $1,320, or less, per year. Alternatively, workers earning between $75,000 and $99,999 contributed an average 7.7% of their earnings to these plans, and workers earning $100,000 or more contributed an average of 8.3% of their income. The difference in contribution rates to 401(k) and 403(b) plans is also wide depending on how close workers are to retirement. Workers under 25 who are just getting started are contributing only 4.5% of their income to retirement, while Americans between age 55 and 64 are deferring 8.7% of their income into these plans. Data source: Vanguard. Author's table. Although total account balances in retirement accounts run the gamut, worker defined contribution rates studied by Vanguard reveals that participants have saved a median $26,405. That's unlikely to provide much financial security in retirement, because common wisdom is for retirees to withdraw no more than 4% of their savings annually to avoid outliving them. If you're contribution rates could use a booster shot, the best decision you can make is to sit down with your human resources department to see if they offer an auto-escalator feature on your plan. If they do, then enrolling can provide a simple way to ramp up your contributions over time, without busting your budget. ","

Image source: Getty Images. If you're new to investing, or even to the SaaS concept in general, think of Google Docs. You don't have to download any of the software to use the applications, and all of your data is stored on the cloud for you. SaaS companies simply have more complex and personalized solutions that they charge for. Once the set-up costs are realized, margins can be huge given such low maintenance and overhead costs. Below, our analysts discuss why savvy investors should consider investing in three of the best SaaS plays today: Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Paycom (NYSE:PAYC), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Brian Stoffel (Shopify): I'm a big fan of the business momentum Shopify has going right now. The company was founded in 2004 when CEO Tobias Lutke was trying to start a snowboard company in Canada. He couldn't find a single suitable platform to help sell his goods. So instead of sticking with snowboards, he designed a SaaS company that would work for him -- and countless others ever since. There's a lot to like about the company: It is founder-led, and insiders own 57% of shares outstanding. Further, there are high switching costs, as any small or medium-sized business would rather spend time on their primary product than figuring out a new platform to sell goods online. And with every additional merchant, the company collects even more data to better serve its customers. But perhaps the biggest sound-bite victory for the company is that Facebook and Amazon have given up on projects to develop their own e-commerce platform and are instead allowing vendors to use the Shopify application as the preferred solution. That's some serious street cred. While some might argue that an unprofitable business shouldn't be trading for the valuations Shopify fetches, I look at the company's rapid growth in customers and revenue and think that reinvesting in the business right now is absolutely the right move -- and it should pay off in years to come. Brian Feroldi (Paycom Software): One of my favorite reasons to invest in SaaS companies is that they benefit from a recurring revenue business model. As long as the company c an it loses to churn, its numbers will continue to head in the right direction. Paycom Software is a fast-growing SaaS company that has been knocking the cover off the ball for years. The company targets small and medium-size businesses that are looking for a better way to manage their basic HR functions like payroll processing, time and labor management, talent acquisition, training, and more. Unlike other payroll processors that only handle one of two of these processes at a time, Paycom's software combines all of these functions into a single, cloud-based system. That makes it far easier for HR departments and employees alike to get their jobs done. It is clear as day that the company's simple product offering is resonating with businesses everywhere. Paycom's revenue has been growing rapidly for years. So quickly, in fact, that the company has already become profitable. PAYC Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. The only knock against Paycom is that the markets are already paying up for the company's terrific growth and business model. Shares are currently trading hands for roughly 70 times trailing earnings, which is a quite a premium valuation. While that's pricey, I for one believe that this is such a high-quality company that it has more than justified its premium valuation. Keith Noonan (Adobe Systems): Adobe Systems has seen its stock price climb to new heights as a result of a successful transition to a subscription-based model, but it still looks like a worthy investment even in light of pricing highs. The company is most known for its Photoshop software, and it maintains a leadership position in the design space at a time when visual communication is becoming increasingly important thanks to the dominance of mobile advertising and the emergence of new mediums like virtual reality and augmented reality. Adobe's transition to a SaaS model has already proven to be successful, and it should continue pushing top- and bottom-line gains. The company's fourth-quarter report saw it grow sales 23%, while total fiscal year revenues climbed 22% and annual subscription revenues increased 42% to $4.58 billion -- or roughly 78% of annual sales. The shift to recurring revenue is also boosting in profitability. Diluted earnings per share increased roughly 87% from fiscal 2015 to 2016, and analysts are forecasting for roughly 25% growth in fiscal 2017 and 29% in 2018. While Adobe stock trades near lifetime highs, the company's forward earnings multiple of roughly 28 is actually low compared to where it's been over the last two years. ADBE data by YCharts. Adobe's core design, marketing, and project management solutions look poised to retain leading positions, and the company is just starting to see benefits from the growth of virtual and augmented reality technologies. The VR and AR markets are expected to be worth a combined $150 billion by 2020, and Adobe's forefront position in 3D design put the company in good position to play a core role in delivering content for the new formats. With a potentially huge growth driver in sight and the success of its transition to SaaS, Adobe stock looks like it can continue building on its incredible success. ","

But that optimistic prediction is nowhere near as bold as the one recently issued by prominent Georgia Tech engineer Henrik Christensen in an interview with the San Diego Union-Tribune: He went on to explain that while there will be some barriers to push through, the pros will outweigh the cons and propel the technology ahead faster than many expect. “I love to drive my car, but it’s a question of how much time people waste sitting in traffic and not doing something else,” he said. “With autonomous, driverless cars, we can put twice as many vehicles on the road as we have today, and do it without improving the infrastructure.” Read: 5 quotes that tell you everything you need to know about forecasting.

In a memo to employees, senior executives said that as of this quarter, employees must disable other text-messaging applications on work phones. Unapproved messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Google Talk can't be used for business purposes, including on personal phones, according to the note. ""We fully understand that the deactivation will change your day-to-day work and we regret any inconvenience this may cause,"" the memo stated. ""However, this step is necessary to ensure Deutsche Bank continues to comply with regulatory and legal requirements."" The memo was signed by Kim Hammonds and Sylvie Matherat, the lender's chief operating officer and chief regulatory officer, respectively. Both are members of its management board. The memo's contents, which were earlier reported by Bloomberg, were confirmed by a Deutsche Bank spokesman who declined to comment further. The bank has several approved corporate instant-messaging programs that can be used on bank- or employee-owned phones and tablets, according to the memo. It said other big banks already have adopted similar rules. The new restrictions take effect this quarter, according to the memo, which suggested email could replace some texting that employees do with external clients. Deutsche Bank has been criticized by regulators, and has paid hefty fines, in the past for allegedly lax communications controls and failure to retain electronic voice recordings and other records as required. The text-messaging restrictions were decided by the management board, according to Friday's memo.

Hannah Karp,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 12, 2017 5:23 p.m. ET NFL abandoning San Diego after 55 years; L.A. now home to 2 teams By After two decades of arguing that the league didn’t need Los Angeles, the NFL is doubling down on Tinseltown. The San Diego Chargers on Thursday said the team is heading up the coast to Los Angeles, the country’s second-biggest market and a city that only last year welcomed the Rams from St. Louis. The move caused an outpouring of grief in San Diego, where the team was based for 55 years, and capped a tumultuous 12 months for the NFL in which three of its franchises either moved or took steps to do so. In a big gamble, the NFL has now tethered the futures of two struggling franchises to the sprawling Los Angeles metropolitan area that previously failed to support professional football and features a bevy of other entertainment options. And it could get even more crowded: League officials have argued for the Oakland Raiders planned move to Las Vegas in part because the team still has a strong fan base in southern California, where residents are accustomed to making quick jaunts to Las Vegas. More than anything, the Chargers decision to abandon a market where they have little competition, a half-century of goodwill, and hundreds of thousands of fans is a reflection of how teams assess their value in the modern NFL. Loyal fans are far less valuable than state-of-the-art stadiums surrounded by real estate opportunities, nine-figure naming rights and sponsorship deals, and television exposure.

James Covert,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 19, 2017 8:05 p.m. ET Billionaire venture capitalist said to be in contention, decision could come soon By Tech billionaire Peter Thiel has been in talks to become U.S. Ambassador to Germany for the Trump administration, sources told The New York Post. The Trump team could fill the top diplomatic post in Berlin as soon as this week, sources said. It couldn’t immediately be confirmed, however, whether Thiel is still in the running. Rumors of Thiel’s candidacy for the cushy job have circulated from Europe to Silicon Valley since the holiday season, even as Thiel has repeatedly denied in interviews that he’s interested in a full-time government position. “No decisions have been made,” Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The Post, declining to comment further. A spokesman for Thiel didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment Thursday. Thiel’s talks for the diplomatic post come amid speculation he might run for governor of California. But one source downplayed the idea, opining that “he could never win.” Another said, meanwhile, that Berlin might be a “stepping stone” for such an ambition. Chatter that Thiel was “likely” to become German ambassador has rippled through tech and government circles in Berlin in recent weeks, according to a source. “At first I thought it was silly,” one Silicon Valley insider told The Post. “But maybe it’s a good way for him to get away, which somebody said he wouldn’t mind doing, given all the negative energy he faced.” Thiel got blasted for backing Trump during the election season by the left-leaning tech crowd, which has bristled at, among other things, the president-elect’s threats on immigration. The tone changed last month, however, when titans including Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Larry Page, Apple’s Tim Cook and Tesla’s Elon Musk flocked to a summit with the president-elect at Trump Tower that was organized by Thiel. Born in West Germany to German parents before he was brought to the U.S. as a toddler, Thiel also speaks German. Although he has mainly focused on US tech as an investor, Thiel has long warned U.S. tech companies about growing antitrust sentiment in Europe. Earlier this week, Trump ruffled feathers in Germany as he threatened border taxes for German auto makers who built cars in Mexico, called NATO “obsolete” and said the EU was just a “vehicle for Germany.” As talk has surfaced about Thiel’s possible assignment, some insiders have questioned whether it would be high-profile enough for the ambitious Thiel. Others, however, note that Trump has been aggressively cleaning house at U.S. embassies worldwide. Firings of all Obama-appointed ambassadors could portend a broader revamp, sources say. For example, the U.S.’s traditional hierarchy of ambassadorships, placing the U.K. at the top, with France and Japan traditionally the second and third most coveted posts, is in need of an overhaul, many agree. “Germany is running Europe now,” one source noted. On Thursday, Trump named Jets owner Woody Johnson as U.K. ambassador. This report originally appeared on NYPost.com. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

Saabira Chaudhuri,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 17, 2017 9:43 a.m. ET By LONDON-- British American Tobacco PLC on Tuesday said Reynolds American Inc. had agreed to its sweetened acquisition offer of $49.4 billion for the 57.8% of Reynolds that it doesn't already own, a deal that will create the world's largest listed tobacco company by revenue and market value. The acquisition, which brings together brands like Newport, Dunhill, Kent and Pall Mall and catapults BAT into a position of strength, is expected to lead to more consolidation in the tobacco market down the road as peers like Philip Morris International Inc. and Altria Group Inc. struggle against their bigger rivals. The deal gives BAT a strong No. 2 position in the U.S. with a 34% share of the cigarette market, adding to its existing footprint in emerging markets across South America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. BAT is paying $29.44 in cash and 0.5260 of an ordinary share, totaling $59.64, for each Reynolds share, valuing its U.S. peer at more than $85 billion. The deal comes after BAT said in October that it had made an offer for Reynolds valued at $56.50 a share, or about $47 billion for the stake it didn't own. After rising earlier, BAT shares were down 2.9% to GBP46.27 ($55.79) in Tuesday trading in London. Reynolds shares were up 3.8% to $58.10 in premarket trading in the U.S. BAT and Reynolds have a longstanding relationship. The London company has been a Reynolds shareholder since 2004, which had given it access to the profitable U.S. market without having a direct presence. At the time BAT first announced its proposed offer, the company was prevented by U.S. securities law from negotiating a deal before making the offer public because of its 42.2% stake in Reynolds. In most negotiated takeovers, the acquiring company completes its due diligence ahead of announcing an offer. On a conference call with analysts Tuesday, BAT Chief Executive Nicandro Durante said an ""open and constructive dialogue"" since then led to the agreement. The U.S. market has come a long way since 1998, when a landmark tobacco settlement hit cigarette makers with huge legal liabilities that led to $200 billion in costs over the years. More recently, tobacco companies have pushed through price hikes, and the industry's steady dividends have lured investors amid low interest rates. Follow-on litigation after the 1998 settlement hasn't been as damaging as expected. Tuesday, BAT highlighted the U.S.'s position as the largest tobacco profit pool outside of China, with affordable pack prices, high disposable income and a burgeoning market for e-cigarettes and other alternative products combining to create opportunities for growth. The agreed price represents a premium of 26% over Reynolds's closing price the day before BAT made its initial announcement in October. After BAT's initial offer, the British company gained access to Reynolds's books, allowing it to learn more about factors like the company's forecasts, regulatory concerns and its brand strategies, according to a person familiar with the matter. That gave BAT the confidence to raise its overall offer along with bumping up the cash portion to 49% from 43%, according to this person. More detailed information also led BAT to slightly increase its cost-savings forecast to at least $400 million in three years, up from the $400 million it reported as part of its initial announcement in October, the person said. Despite the prospect of the incoming Trump administration pushing corporate tax cuts, Mr. Durante told analysts it had been ""impossible to consider the potential impact"" of any change to the U.S. tax code and that the deal was based on the ""fundamentals of both companies and the prospects of both companies."" BAT on Tuesday said emerging markets will make up 60% of the new company's footprint by volume. Volumes have continued to climb across parts of the developing world, bucking the trend seen in developed markets and making these particularly lucrative for cigarette companies. BAT said revenue per pack from emerging markets has grown at more than twice the rate in developed ones over the past five years. Three new Reynolds shareholders--ones that haven't been nominated by BAT--will join the company's board once the deal closes, expected in the third quarter of 2017. The deal is subject to a breakup fee of $1 billion payable by either company should its board fail to recommend the transaction to shareholders or withdraw its recommendation. BAT could be forced to pay a $500 million breakup fee if antitrust authorities ask it to sell assets it doesn't agree to. Beyond tobacco, a combined BAT and Reynolds will also be the world's largest player in so-called next-generation products--largely e-cigarettes and other vaping products. BAT has been pouring money into alternative products in recent years, launching new heat-not-burn products in addition to its existing e-cigarettes such as Vype. Reynolds sells an e-cigarette called Vuse. Centerview Partners, Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG are advising BAT. Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Moore & Van Allen PLLC are lawyers for Reynolds American's transaction committee and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is its financial adviser. Jones Day is legal counsel for Reynolds American and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Lazard are financial advisers to the company. Denise Roland and Ben Dummett contributed to this article.

Michelle Coffey,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 15, 2017 4:55 p.m. ET By The outgoing CIA director sharply criticized Donald Trump on Sunday, warning “talking and tweeting” was not an option and such spontaneity posed a potential threat to national security. “What I think Mr. Trump has to understand is that this is more than being about him, and it’s about the U.S. and our national security,” John Brennan said on “Fox News Sunday.” Brennan, who will leave his post when Trump takes office, said the president-elect didn’t have a “full appreciation” or understanding of Russia’s power and intentions. He also said Trump’s signals in recent interviews that he may lift sanctions against Russia were worrisome. The feud between Trump and the U.S. intelligence community has intensified in recent weeks. Brennan’s remarks come a week after intelligence agencies released a report on Russia’s efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Trump acknowledged in a news conference that Russia was likely responsible for hacking the Democratic Party during the election. But he fired back at the intelligence community for leaking an unverified dossier that suggested Russia allegedly compiled damaging information about him, equating the spy agencies to Nazi Germany. Brennan called Trump’s comparison “outrageous.” Watch the full interview: ",CIA chief John Brennan has a stern warning for Donald Trump - MarketWatch

                                    NEU, -1.48% Rett syndrome is a rare condition affecting about one in 10,000 girls that’s caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. Symptoms include motor and cognitive impairments, seizures and anxiety, and many of those affected die young. Many in the Rett syndrome community are looking in the long term to gene therapy for a treatment. But having a drug that works across the broad spectrum of symptoms — as opposed to taking medications for each one — is a more near-term goal, said Gordy Rich, the Rett foundation’s chief operating officer. Rich is also a Rett parent. The prospect of a more comprehensive medication for his 22-year-old daughter is “life-altering,” he said. “When my daughter was diagnosed there was no known cause and no known cure,” Rich said. Five clinical trials being underway means “to all parents, this is really the most incredible time... We’ll have options for our girls that can improve their quality of life.” Related:  Anavex stock jumps after company says Biogen will test lead drug candidate Anavex 2-73, which was designated as an orphan drug for Rett syndrome last spring — which grants companies developing rare diseases various development and commercial incentives— may have that potential. The 12-week trial — which will cost about $1 million total and enroll between 50 and 80 patients — will measure the drug’s effect on seizure reduction, cognitive impairment, mood disorder, autistic behavior and anxiety, Christopher Missling, president and chief executive officer of Anavex, told MarketWatch. The drug was selected based on its results in mice, where it addressed a number of symptoms, Rich said. “To us that’s very exciting, and we want to move as many of the compounds into clinical trials so we can get treatments on the path to a cure,” he said. The trial is expected to begin this year, with data possibly coming out by the end of the year, Missling said. Anavex’s relationship with the foundation will also assist in enrolling patients in the trial, which should help hasten trial results, he said. Anavex 2-73 is also being tested in other areas, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism and more.

Beckie Strum,01192017,MarketWatch,01122017,"Published: Jan 13, 2017 1:13 p.m. ET Two-building complex formerly served as Textile Museum By Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is reportedly the buyer behind Washington, D.C.’s largest house, a two-building spread that used to house the city’s Textile Museum. The Washington Post, which Bezos owns, attributed the news to a source with knowledge of the sale. See: Where do presidents live after the White House? Combined, the two buildings add up to a massive, 27,000-square-foot property. The buildings sold Oct. 21 for $23 million to a buyer called The Cherry Revocable Trust, according to D.C. property records. The two historic brick buildings on S Street in the posh neighborhood of Kalorama would put Bezos a few minutes’ walk from Ivanka Trump and her husband, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, who recently bought a new home on Tracy Place. Bezos is also a few blocks from a house the Obama family will occupy until their youngest daughter, Sasha, is finished with high school. She is currently a sophomore at Sidwell Friends. Bezos, 53, has said in the past that he had no plans to move to the nation’s capital, despite buying the city’s iconic newspaper. But the new home offers more than enough space to entertain while he’s there. While extensive renovations are required to turn the long-time museum into a residential home, the combined buildings offer a total of 10 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms and 11 fireplaces, according to a listing with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage. Both buildings date back to the early 20th century. American forester and textile collector George Hewitt Myers built one of the buildings, known as the Myers House, in 1912, hiring Jefferson Memorial architect John Russell Pope to design the home, according to the National Register of Historic Places. Meanwhile, Myers was accumulating a variety rugs and other textiles from Eastern Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. To accommodate his growing collection, he eventually bought the house next door, known as the Tucker House, and turned it into a private museum. Architecturally, the two buildings, both on the National Register of Historic Places, are an eclectic mixture of Georgian Revival and Beaux-Arts styles. A limestone-faced bridge connects the two buildings. See: Luxury real estate goes to the dogs (and chinchillas) The Textile Museum operated out of the buildings for many decades after Myers’s death but in 2013 moved to George Washington University’s Foggy Bottom campus. The two buildings were packaged as one property and put on the market in June 2013 with Coldwell Banker. The property sold in 2015 for $19 million, according to the former listing, but returned to the market a year later for $22 million—meaning Bezos paid $1 million above asking price.

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Five teams have qualified to compete in a $30 million Google-backed competition to land and operate robotic spacecraft on the surface of the moon, the XPrize Foundation said on Tuesday. Contenders now have until Dec. 31 for their spacecraft to be launched, said the foundation, which is running the Google Lunar XPrize and eight other technology stimulus contests. Previously, competitors needed to complete activities on the lunar surface, such as having their vehicles travel 1,640 feet (500 meters) and broadcast high-definition video, by the end of the year. Since the contest was announced in 2007, interest in the Google Lunar XPrize has been high, with 33 teams originally signing up to compete for the $20 million first prize. Second place is worth $5 million and bonus money is available for accomplishing extra tasks, such as visiting an Apollo landing site or finding water on the moon. Google’s parent company, Alphabet has produced a documentary series about Lunar XPrize competition. Five teams remain in the running: Israel’s SpaceIL, Florida-based Moon Express, an international team known as Synergy Moon, India’s Team Indus and Japan’s Hakuto. SpaceIL plans to fly on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which recently returned to flight following a launch pad accident. Team Indus and Hakuto will share a ride on an Indian PSLV launcher. Moon Express is banking on a launch from startup Rocket Lab, which is developing a small rocket called Electron. Whether it wins the XPrize or not, Moon Express is building a business to provide lunar transportation and services, such as research and mineral extraction, Chief Executive Bob Richards said in an interview. Synergy Moon is counting on one of its partners, Mojave, Calif.-based Interorbital Systems, for its launch aboard a new rocket known as Neptune. “We’re thrilled to have five contenders that are working from all over the world on this one mission,” XPrize Senior Director Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer said in an email. The race to moon is among nine XPrize contests currently underway. The competitions are designed to make big technological leaps in aerospace, medicine, education and other fields by luring new participants and private capital with cash prizes. The original 2012 deadline for the Google Lunar XPrize has been extended three times, but contest organizers said they will stand by the current timeline which requires teams to launch on or before Dec. 31.

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Nintendo Co’s smash hit Pokemon Go was unleashed on South Korea on Tuesday, six months after it was released elsewhere in the world, a delay caused by security fears over Google Maps. The popularity of augmented-reality Pokemon Go around the world has generated crowds of people in parks and other public places as users search for monsters to train, but with temperatures well below freezing, there was no sudden, noticeable buzz on the streets of Seoul. “We have waited very long and worked very hard to launch Pokemon Go in South Korea,” said Lim Jae Boem, chief executive of Pokemon Korea. The game was jointly developed by Nintendo and Niantic Inc. Pokemon Go relies on Google Maps to work. But in most of South Korea those functions have been limited by the government, which is technically still at war with North Korea, for national security reasons. Neither Niantic nor Pokemon Korea specified how they managed to work around the Google Maps challenge. “We used various publicly accessible data sources,” said Dennis Hwang, art director of Niantic Inc. There was a slight hitch in the morning when the game was unavailable for download, but that was soon cleared up. One group of people had their eyes fixed to their smartphones near Seoul’s central Gwanghwamun Square where Pokemons are said to appear often. “It was sad that it came to Korea a bit late but I’m glad that I can play the fun game translated into Korean,” said Kim Ga-on, 10, who was playing separately with his mother and sister. “It’s good exercise and it’s fun to catch Pokemons.” South Korea is the world’s fourth-biggest gaming market after China, the United States and Japan, according to Amsterdam-based research firm Newzoo. In July, some impatient Pokemon fans rushed to Sokcho, a city close to the border with North Korea - an area where the game can be played as it has not been classified as South Korean territory in Google Maps data. Nintendo’s stock closed down 1 percent on Tuesday. Hysonic Co Ltd, the company in charge of the game release, rose 30 percent. ","

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"(Reuters) - With investment firms cutting costs and portfolio managers combating a barrage of information, financial research shops around the globe are looking for new ways to keep their product relevant. A raft of startups have launched to support that effort, offering tools that can use Google search data to get an edge on retail sales, deploy drones to examine oil supplies or allow investors to rank analysts and bid on their reports, like a Netflix or eBay of research. Whether these innovations will lead to smarter investments, or be used widely enough to prop up research budgets, is yet to be seen. But the startups are forming alliances with banks, brokerages and investors by the dozen. People who use and sell the tools say the trend is changing how research is financed, distributed and consumed for the first time in decades. “We are coming up on a very different age for equity research,” said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research. Investors now see research as a product that must stand on its own rather than a freebie offered as part of a broader relationship with an investment bank, Sokolin said. Technology can improve the quality and distribution of research, he said. A few factors are driving the changes. Asset managers are under enormous pressure to cut fees due to weak returns and competition from low-cost options like index funds. The fee squeeze is making firms more selective about how they spend research dollars. At the same time, the long-running practice of paying for research through trading commissions is being upended by new regulations in Europe, known as the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II. Part of the sprawling overhaul will force investors in the European Union to pay for research directly. Global asset managers are expected to “unbundle” payments in other regions as well. Perhaps most importantly, investors say they are sick of their inboxes piling up with run-of-the-mill reports each day. At a time when people share snippets of information through WhatsApp and Slack and a tweet can move a stock in seconds, sharing loads of PDF files through email is not only passé, but makes it hard to know what is worth reading, industry sources said. “There are 40 analysts just covering Apple: how do you find the insight?” said Alap Shah, chief executive of Sentieo, a San Francisco-based startup that aggregates information about publicly traded companies. Before launching Sentieo in late 2011, Shah was an analyst at Citadel LLC, where he received hundreds of research reports a day. It was difficult to search through documents for important information, collate those details into one place and access them when he was not in front of his office computer, he said. Those frustrations led Shah to set up Sentieo, which allows users to search reports by a stock ticker or hashtagged phrase like #revenuegrowth. They can also highlight key passages and access information remotely. Shah says 200 firms are now using Sentieo, including Longhorn Asset Management LLC and JNK Securities Corp. Other startups are going beyond aggregation. Customers of London-based StockViews can rate analysts with stars the way they might rate a show on Netflix, and request custom-made research “on demand.” Edinburgh-based Electronic Research Interchange (ERIC) allows fund managers to bid on analyst reports the way shoppers do on eBay. Another company, Orbital Insight, uses satellites and drones to collect data that can affect a variety of stocks, like how much oil is stored in tanks. In a recent report, JPMorgan Chase & Co telecommunications analyst Rod Hall drew on Orbital Insight research to tell investors there were fewer cars parked at large electronics stores following the U.S. presidential election, which might lead to lower smartphone sales. Wall Street banks say they are also using their own techniques to modernize research. In interviews, executives highlighted data-crunching as a particular focus to win more business from funds that rely on algorithms to make investment decisions. Morgan Stanley’s research team employs 30 data scientists in a unit called AlphaWise to support research from traditional stock analysts. Last year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc analysts used data from Google Trends and social media monitoring firm Crimson Hexagon to conclude that Nintendo Co Ltd’s Pokemon Go was so popular it would affect future games it releases. “Ten years ago, we would have interviewed consumers in a mall to figure out what the hottest fashion trends are,” said Simon Bound, head of research at Morgan Stanley. “Now we will also use big data techniques and machine learning.” For a graphic on equity commissions and ""unbundling"" click here ","

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla sued the former head of its Autopilot system on Thursday, alleging the executive tried to recruit Tesla engineers for his new venture with the ex-head of Google’s self-driving program while still working at the electric car company. The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court of California for Santa Clara County, underscores the competitive landscape in Silicon Valley’s automotive sector, where Tesla, established carmakers and unknown start-ups are all battling to be first to bring self-driving to the masses. Tesla has been at the vanguard of innovation. Its high-profile Autopilot allows cars to steer and stay in their lanes without hands on the wheel in certain circumstances. Telsa, citing what it called a “get-rich-quick environment” in the sector, listed in the complaint the recent acquisition by General Motors of Cruise Automation in July for nearly $1 billion, suggesting Anderson and Urmson sought the same goal with their new Silicon Valley company, Aurora Innovation. Urmson and Aurora Innovation are also named as co-defendants in the lawsuit, which alleges breach of contract and other civil claims. Tesla is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages. Aurora said the lawsuit was without merit and “reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition.” “This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business,” Aurora said in a statement. The lawsuit alleges that Anderson also downloaded “some of Tesla’s most competitively sensitive information” to his laptop, then erased and doctored files and wiped his iPhone of data “in an attempt to conceal his misdeeds.” Tesla said Anderson was terminated on Jan. 4.

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"The payments processor predicted its first-quarter revenue would be roughly in line with analyst expectations, with flat to slightly better operating margins for the full year. PayPal gave the guidance in reporting a 17 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue that mirrored Wall Street expectations. Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said fourth-quarter results were hurt by currency movements, and he expected those pressures to continue throughout the year. Paypal stock fell 2.4 percent in after hours trading to $40.49. Chief Executive Dan Schulman said competition is heating up in mobile payments, and investing in PayPal’s own offerings has become “increasingly important” to gain an advantage over rivals. “Payments are rapidly digitizing,” he said. “Mobile is redefining the face of retail.” Ant, the world’s largest financial-technology company, has been expanding at home and overseas as it prepares for a planned initial public offering later this year. To fend off competition, PayPal has been expanding its network of strategic partnerships and launching or acquiring new services. PayPal is also trying to improve its core offering by adding features like One Touch, which allows customers to pay with a single click. It now has more than 5 million active merchant accounts offering the tool. During the quarter, PayPal’s mobile payments rose 53 percent, to $31 billion. Payment volumes at Venmo, a mobile peer-to-peer payment platform popular with younger costumers surged 126 percent to $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter. PayPal’s total payments volume rose 22 percent to $99 billion. Active customer accounts rose 10 percent to 197 million, beating research firm FactSet StreetAccount’s estimate of 196.5 million. Schulman said growth in mobile payments and new customer accounts helped boost fourth-quarter revenue to $3 billion, up 17 percent compared with a year earlier, the same as what analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected. The company expects first-quarter revenue to land in a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.95 billion, on average. Net income rose to $390 million, or 32 cents per share, from $367 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 42 cents per share. PayPal operates in many geographic markets around the globe, with half of its revenue coming from overseas. It tries to hedge against currency-related losses using financial instruments. But in the fourth-quarter, declines in the euro and Australian dollar hurt PayPal’s results, Rainey said. The company expects more pain this year as it adjusts its currency positions, especially in the first half, he added. PayPal is on its second stint as a public company after separating from eBay in 2015. ","

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"PARK CITY, Utah (Reuters) - Attendees at the Sundance Film Festival can use augmented reality (AR) to hang out with “Mad Men” star Jon Hamm or assemble a human brain, as makers of the new immersive technology seek to engage independent filmmakers. The Sundance premiere of “Marjorie Prime,” a film starring Hamm as a hologram character, gave virtual reality (VR) startup 8i the chance create the ‘HoloHamm,’ an AR hologram of Hamm to drum up buzz for the movie. Viewers pan a mobile device across a room and Hamm will appear on their screens as if he is in that location, and interact using pre-recorded phrases. “This really opens up lots of promotional opportunities in entertainment,” said Linc Gasking, 8i co-founder. Niantic Inc’s Pokemon Go mobile game became the first mass market adoption of AR last July. Players used their mobile phones to capture animated characters that appeared in real locations. Unlike VR, where headset users can watch a 360-degree story, AR renders virtual images over real life settings and can be viewed on a smartphone other device. Tech advisers Digi-Capital issued a forecast this month that the AR market would be $83 billion by 2021. The Hamm hologram was created in a few hours using cameras to capture the actor in 360 degrees, Gasking said. It is more cost-effective to create than VR because it layers digital images over a real life set, as opposed to creating an entire virtual 3D world. The 10-day annual Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, has featured VR for the past five years at its New Frontier showcase, where independent filmmakers have created 360-degree stories viewed using a headset, like Google Cardboard or Oculus Rift. When Pokemon Go became an instant hit, New Frontier programmer Shari Frilot, who spent two years putting the AR showcase together, said “I thought this is definitely the year to do this because people will be looking for AR.” “Pleasant Places” digitally layers images of Vincent Van Gogh’s legendary Provence paintings over landscape videos. “Full Turn” sees two tablet screens spinning together to create a 360-degree animated sequence. “Journey to the Center of the Natural Machine,” by AR headset company Meta, allows two people wearing headsets to view and interact with the same experience through the human brain. The headsets feature transparent visors which become the screen. The company wants to create education entertainment pieces, said Daniella Segal, Meta’s head of experiences. The Meta 2 headset is priced at $949, a third of the cost of Microsoft Corp’s $3,000 Hololens headset, and is aimed at developers to create applications. “You can take something that may feel very cutting edge and very technological and make it something that every person can find the value in,” Segal said. (This version of the story corrects Gasking’s title to “co-founder” from “founder and president” in paragraph 4.

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - An Illinois man was sentenced to nine months in federal prison on Tuesday for breaking into the email and online storage of celebrities to obtain their private photos and videos, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office. Edward Majerczyk, 29, who pleaded guilty to felony computer hacking charges last year, will begin serving his sentence on Feb. 27, said Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Zach Fardon, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Majerczyk’s attorney, Thomas Needham, could not immediately be reached for comment. While no victims were named in court documents, the investigation began after Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence and other celebrities, including actresses Kirsten Dunst and Gabrielle Union and model Kate Upton, complained in interviews about having their private photos end up publicly disseminated online. “At the time of the offense, Mr. Majerczyk was suffering from depression and looked to pornography websites and Internet chat rooms in an attempt to fill some of the voids and disappointment he was feeling in his life,” Needham wrote in a sentencing memorandum filed on Jan. 19. Needham added that Majerczyk had “consistently expressed remorse,” for the hacking. Majerczyk pleaded guilty in September to federal computer hacking charges but, the Justice Department and Needham said investigators had not uncovered any evidence linking Majerczyk to the actual leaks. The hacked material was for Majerczyk’s personal use and his viewing, Needham said in the memorandum. According to a plea agreement signed by Majerczyk, he illegally accessed accounts on Apple Inc’s iCloud and Alphabet Inc’s Google Gmail accounts belonging to more than 300 people, using an email “phishing” ploy to obtain their user names and passwords. Through this scheme, Majerczyk was able to access full iCloud backups belonging to numerous victims, including at least 30 celebrities, many of whom reside in the Los Angeles area, the plea agreement stated. Majerczyk, who resides in Chicago and Orland Park, Illinois, was originally charged in Los Angeles, but his case was transferred to Illinois as part of his plea agreement. ","

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Some of Canada’s largest corporations and top executives launched two separate initiatives this week, investing millions of dollars into startup programs they hope will help stem a brain drain in fields like artificial intelligence and financial technology. NextAI, which was unveiled on Wednesday, and Diagram, announced on Tuesday, both aim to halt the loss of the country’s best technology talent by helping to launch new Canadian-based companies through seed funding and mentorship. Industry leaders are concerned that without capital, private and public sector support, Canada will be unable to attract skilled tech entrepreneurs, while existing workers and students will be pulled away by global tech giants. More than 300,000 Canadians already work in Silicon Valley. “A lot of people are looking to come back, but it’s hard to find the right backing and opportunity in Canada,” said Diagram Chief Executive and Founder, Francois Lafortune. “Canada must get this right. There’s are too many jobs at stake.” Diagram’s goal is to foster tech startups in insurance, financial services and healthcare, providing as much as C$5 million ($3.8 million) in seed financing for a venture. It is backed by fintech venture fund Portag3, as well as dozens of angel investors, including top Canadian executives from major banks, large companies and entrepreneurs. “The next generation of students coming out of school and coming out of graduate school around the world - we want them to lock on to an ecosystem here,” Royal Bank of Canada Chief Executive Dave McKay told reporters at the NextAI launch. “I think Silicon Valley does a better job of providing that (ecosystem) right now.” RBC, Magna International Inc, Bank of Nova Scotia and BDC Capital are the founding corporate partners investing in NextAI, which will provide up to C$200,000 to as many as 20 teams from Canada and abroad. The teams will work on commercializing their artificial intelligence (AI) research in Toronto, with access to experts and training from schools and tech firms including the University of Toronto, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Alphabet Inc’s Google, IBM and NVIDIA Corp. “We are an export economy. Today we’re exporting oil and gas, predominantly. We need to evolve to export AI technologies that we develop here in Canada,” said Anthony Lacavera, the co-chair of NEXT Canada, the organization behind NextAI. Lacavera is also a Diagram investor.

The report quotes varying estimates for the phone's sales from analysts and industry insiders, ranging from a top-end number of 1 million units down to 552,000 units. Google spokeswoman Iska Saric told Bloomberg that Pixel phone demand ""has exceeded our expectations."" (See also: Google Launches Pixel Phones.) However, the phone may not have exceeded all analysts' expectations. Research firm Morgan Stanley estimated that the Pixel would sell around 3 million units and generate $2 billion in revenue for the Mountain View, Calif.-based company this past quarter. According to a recent report by Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) owned Flurry analytics, Pixel phones also failed to crack into the list of new phones with the most activations. Apple Inc. (AAPL) topped that list, accounting for 44% of all activations, while Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (SSNLF) was second with a 21% share. (See also: Samsung Sees Surprise Sales Bump This Holiday Season.) Still, Google's performance is impressive when you consider that it is a relatively new entrant into the smartphone sweepstakes and was up against the likes of Apple's newly released iPhone 7. The Pixel phone had a strong start and was responsible for 0.5% of all U.S. phone sales within 11 days of its release, according to market research firm Kantar Insights. The Bloomberg report attributes increased sales during the holiday quarter to the company's ad spending, which shot up to $109.8 million for 12 Pixel ads last year from $45.9 million for two TV ads in 2015.

That growth will come on the back of an increase in advertising revenues from mobile and video as well as growth in its cloud service. The post, which is written by Jack Hough, projects that revenue for the digital ad industry will grow to $202 billion this year, accounting for 40% of all ad spend. Mobile advertising is expected to make up for more than half of all digital spending. Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG), which dominates online ad spend, is expected to be a major beneficiary of this trend. While mobile search was responsible for “powering” the company’s revenues and earnings last quarter, Google has had problems monetizing its search algorithm within mobile’s fragmented ecosystem. However, it has unveiled a bunch of new initiatives in recent times, including deep linking and accelerated mobile publishing to improve the reach and performance of its search results. (See also: Alphabet Powers To Third Quarter Profit, Thanks To Mobile And Video Search.) The Barron’s post identifies additional measures by Google that could result in a bounty. For example, Google’s new mobile ads are better in text and appearance, according to Hough. An increase in the number of paid results, promoted pins in Google Maps, and device bidding are also expected to play a major role in boosting Google’s mobile advertising revenues. Google’s video platform Youtube, which is estimated to have earned revenues of $9 billion in 2015, is also expected to boost its contribution to Alphabet’s revenues. Finally, the post also mentions Google Cloud, its cloud services division, which is trails Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), IBM Corp. (IBM) and Microsoft Inc. (MSFT) in the cloud sweepstakes to ramp up its share of the cloud market on the back of advances in artificial intelligence technology and coverage area.

(GOOGL) fell in after-hours trading after the company failed to beat analyst estimates for its earnings. The stock is currently 1.40% lower in pre-market trading. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company reported revenue of $26 billion, an increase of 22% from the previous year's figures, and earnings per share of $9.36. Analysts' expectations called for revenue of $25.23 billion and EPS of $9.64. The company's earnings took a hit from two primary factors. First, its cost of revenue as a share of total revenue increased by 3% to 41%. Second, Google's effective tax rate increased in the past year. According to Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat, the company's tax rate rose to 19% for the entire year from 5% in 2015. She said the tax rate was higher due to ""geographic mix"" and ""certain discrete tax changes in the U.S."" (See also: Will Google and Apple's Tax Problems Affect Their Bottom Line?) According to business website Marketwatch, ""discrete tax changes"" could refer to changes in laws relating to stock-based compensation, which cost the company almost $600 million in increased taxes. Alphabet has decided not to exclude stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP​ results starting with its next earnings results. Alphabet attributed revenue growth to its subsidiary Google's mobile search and video platform YouTube. With revenue of $25.8 billion, Google was responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet’s revenue. While the aggregate paid clicks on Google properties, which account for the bulk of its revenues, increased by 43% as compared with the previous year's figures, the average cost per click declined by 15%.

This past quarter was especially good – CIRP estimates that the Seattle-based company sold 3.1 million Alexa devices during that time period. The increase in sales was accompanied by a rise in awareness about Amazon's voice assistants. Consumer awareness of Amazon Echo speakers was 82% by the end of last year, up from 47% as of the same time in 2015. Echo speakers were first released in December 2014 and were a surprise holiday hit that season. They essentially kickstarted the voice-activated smart assistant industry.

For example, Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG) released Google Home, its take on the voice assistant, last year.

In a report on trends that will shape the voice speaker industry, VoiceLabs also predicted that a total of 24.5 million units of voice-activated assistants will be shipped by the end of this year. However, based on the report's findings, it would seem that voice assistants have problems with stickiness. For example, only 31% of Alexa's skills have more than one review. ""This indicates that many of Alexa's voice applications are 'Zombie Skills': they are accessible but not heavily used or appreciated,"" the report's authors write. That said, a bump in sales comes with several advantages for Amazon. For starters, it enables the company to mop up data about consumer tastes and shopping habits. Such data could prove to be invaluable for the e-commerce company to extend its reach into consumer homes as well as minimize the number of steps required to order a product from its website.

Based on statements at a recent media conference​ by Seth Dallaire, vice president of global ad sales at Amazon Media Group, the company may begin paid search queries sooner rather than later. At the conference, he outlined a number of examples in which Amazon's search functionality (which, according to some estimates, is favored over Google for product searches) could be useful to consumer product companies.

(FB) has made a huge bet on trying to own the next computing platform, virtual reality, as it seeks to usher in a new wave of connectivity and computing. With the company’s latest hire, the push could explode. In a post to his Facebook account, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that former Xiaomi executive, Hugo Barra, would be joining the company as Vice President of Virtual Reality. Barra is well-known and respected in Silicon Valley for a number of reasons, including his role as the public face of Android while at Google (GOOGL). However, it’s his role at Xiaomi Inc., the Chinese consumer electronics company, that may wind up being most critical. (See also: Facebook Hires Google Alum Hugo Barra As VR Chief (FB, GOOG).) While at Xiaomi, Barra has been credited with helping lead the company’s guerilla marketing efforts and turning products such as the Mi3 and Redmi smartphones into hits. Though Xiaomi has experienced some recent hiccups, it’s still turned itself into a company valued at $45 billion. In 2015, it sold more than 70 million phones and in the second-quarter of 2016, Xiaomi sold 15.5 million smartphones, good for fifth place worldwide. Those sales figures are due in part to Barra, who gave credibility to Xiaomi, as a product spokesman and for his ability to demonstrate great technology could be purchased cheaply. Xiaomi sells its phones nearly at cost and makes money on accessories, apps, smart-home products, videos and other products. By contrast, Oculus’s virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift, is expensive and often requires a customer upgrading their PC. In total, getting an Oculus virtual reality experience could cost as much $1,500, which has impacted sales. The company is working on a headset that doesn’t need to be connected to a computer and will be cheaper than the existing Rift, but in the meantime, companies like HTC Inc., Samsung Inc., Sony Inc. and others are leapfrogging Facebook and Oculus. The market, for both augmented and virtual reality, is expected to reach $162 billion by 2020, up from $5.2 billion in 2016, according to research firm IDC. That’s an enormous opportunity not something Facebook and Oculus can afford to sit back on. By hiring Barra and giving him such a public endorsement, it helps shifts notice back to Facebook. According to 01consulting, Facebook has lost the lead to Sony for VR headsets sales, owning just 11% of the market, compared to 30% for Sony. With cheap products, Samsung and HTC have managed to capture 13% of the market, with Google owning 8%, due in large part to its Daydream initiatives. Facebook can not afford to lose any more ground to these competitors and that’s before Apple eventually gets into the headset/glasses market. (See also: Zuckerberg Questioned in Trial Over VR Technology (FB).) With his past experience at Google and Xiaomi, Barra provides credibility for making Facebook’s offerings for the masses, not just the first adopters or the very wealthy.

But a Google representative told CNBC that YouTube has been slower to pick up the slack from Google's other advertising properties. The company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of $9.36, adjusted and excluding items, on revenues of $26.06 billion. Analysts expect Google-parent Alphabet to report earnings of about $9.64 per Class A share on $25.26 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.

Google's costs-per-click — the amount it gets from advertisers— fell 16 percent year over year, more than the 11 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates. ""The core of Alphabet's business is still about both Google's search and YouTube's revenues,"" Forrester analyst Thomas Husson told CNBC in a statement. ""The majority of these revenues derive from mobile, and the lower cost-per-click here should be compensated by a higher volume. I'd argue that the stability of Google's revenue in the next two to three years will depend on their ability to maintain the growth of mobile revenues. While there might be slower growth, the mid-term prospect looks good given the fact that advertisers will wake up to the mobile Web opportunity after having focused too much on mobile apps."" The results hinge on Google's new advertising formats, like promoted pins in Maps, and progress monetizing YouTube. Investors will listen closely to the quarterly conference call for any signs that YouTube, like rival Facebook, is closing in on the maximum number of ads its customers will tolerate.

Amit Singhal tweeted on Friday that he was ""catching the next ride of [his] professional journey"" at Uber. Singhal retired as the executive in charge of search at Google in February after 15 years at the company. His new role will be senior vice president of engineering, Uber said in a statement. ""As I dug deeper into how Uber works, it became pretty clear that this is one of the hardest — and therefore most fun — computer science and engineering challenges in the world today,"" Singhal wrote on his blog. Singhal created patented technology for Google's hallmark search engine, including ways to display more than one ""first"" search result, and ways to better detect filler words like ""a"" and ""the"" in a search query. Singhal was also a crucial to creating some of Google's newer search features, like the ability to search for flights and speech recognition. In addition to search, Google is also a pioneer in the online mapping industry. Singhal's move to Uber comes at a time when voice-activated searches and assistants are increasingly making their way into the car.

Arjun Kharpal,01262017,CNBC,01192017,"Google co-founder Sergey Brin said Thursday he was ""surprised"" by the advances in artificial intelligence after ignoring early projects in the field. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has been investing heavily in AI, acquiring companies such as Deepmind in 2014 and using the technology in the majority of its products from search to photos. While Brin was heading the Google X research lab from 2010 to 2015, it was working on a project called Google Brain — an AI platform that is used across the search giant. But Brin told delegates at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, that, at the time, he ""didn't pay attention to it all."" The Google co-founder told a story about a colleague who showed him a picture of cat created by this AI platform. ""Jeff Dean would periodically come up to me and say, 'Look, the computer made a picture of a cat,' and I said 'OK that's very nice, Jeff' … and fast forward a few years and now Brain probably touches every single one of our main projects,"" Brin said. ""This kind of revolution in deep nets has been very profound and definitely surprised me even though I was right inside there. … It's an incredible time. What can these things do? We don't really know the limits."" AI and its impact on society has been a big theme at Davos with business leaders and politicians discussing the topic. Earlier this week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told Davos attendees that AI could potentially kickstart weak economic growth. Brin said AI could free up people from doing mundane things to spend their time on more creative jobs, but admitted it is ""almost impossible"" to predict what the impact of the technology could be.

Tonya Riley,01262017,CNBC,01192017,"After years of navigating grad school and having to leave one position because of sexual harassment, Allison Esposito finally landed a dream job working as a content manager at Google Play. Her hard work had paid off and she had the career to show for it. But even while making six figures at a company she says ""really takes care of their workers,"" she couldn't ignore the many obstacles faced by women in tech. Often, women weren't being hired at all. According to a study by the group HiringSolved, women comprise only 19.6 percent of the staff of the top 25 tech companies. Esposito, who describes always having had an ""entrepreneurial streak,"" knew she had to do something. The best way to start, she figured, was to bring people together. HOW IT BEGAN In 2014, she started a coffee meet-up that expanded out from dozens of friends and acquaintances to hundreds in just a week. With a rapidly growing number of members, including those outside of New York, the group developed an online presence including a newsletter and job board. Before Esposito knew it, Tech Ladies had grown to include over 6,000 women. WHAT IT DOES The group connects women so they can expand their networks and learn the kind of negotiation skills that women have traditionally been discouraged from using. ""There's a networking gap for women,"" Esposito says. ""If your network isn't strong, you'll suffer in your career."" The organization aims to get more women into tech jobs and, once they're there, get them the salaries and respect they deserve. Where the work world can pit women against one another, especially creating divisions between younger and older employees, Tech Ladies seeks to bring a diverse continent of female employees together in order to help them all succeed. ""This is what we're building with Tech Ladies. It's not just a job board, and it's not just a community. It's both, and that's our secret sauce."" Esposito can list countless stories of women who have turned to fellow members for advice and have gotten results. In one case a member who had never before asked for a raise got a $6,000 salary increase using negotiating skills she learned from Tech Ladies. ""I learn a lot myself from reading [about interactions between members],"" she says. There's still one big hurdle women in tech face that has nothing to do with negotiation skills or networking: Sexual harassment. An industry report last year found that 60 percent of women in tech have had to deal with it. ""Part of the reason I started Tech Ladies was because of the stressful work experiences I had in my career. The funny thing is most of this happened to me before I was in tech,"" says Esposito. ""I had to leave a past job because I was being sexually harassed by a boss."" Esposito hasn't publicly spoken about her experience with sexual harassment, but it informs the Tech Ladies mission. The group offers an anonymous forum to which members can submit questions about difficult situations and from which they can get advice. ""The reality is, this is happening to women all the time. It's way too expensive and career crushing to sue your employer, so what do most of us do? We suffer as long as we can, and then we move on,"" says Esposito. Tech Ladies attempts to fight these conditions on a micro level, both by increasing diversity at companies and giving women the connections they need to get out of bad situations. ""When you're in that position, a few things are key. You need to have a super strong network and you need to have access to great new job opportunities,"" says Esposito. WORKING WITH TECH COMPANIES The group asks tech companies to make a concrete commitment to their values by listing openings on its job board, HireTechLadies, and including a direct contact so members can avoid the HR slush-pile. Tech Ladies also tries to steer women into jobs that make them feel welcome, in which there's a company culture of gender equality and emphasis on benefits like family leave. Esposito says the group has seen interest from companies including The New York Times, Warby Parker, Jet and more. The most eager companies, however, are smaller start-ups committed to building a positive workplace from the ground up. ""A lot of what I see is smaller start-ups who are maybe just two guys who just got funded who are trying to build a diverse culture from the start,"" says Esposito. TURNING A SIDE HUSTLE INTO A FULL-TIME JOB While Tech Ladies started as a passion project, after launching the Hire Tech Ladies website six months ago, Esposito found that the project was taking up more free time than she had. ""I had so many [requests] coming in, I was working till midnight every night for three months,"" says Esposito. Esposito knew she was ready to make that leap once she found herself turning down opportunities she would have otherwise said yes to. Once she felt that the organization couldn't thrive without her full attention, she knew she had to make a change. ""It's definitely a big leap to make your side project a full-time job,"" says Esposito. ""Only leave your full-time job when you feel like your project can't live without you."" Esposito is bootstrapping the project in lieu of seeking out investors, but she says putting herself through grad school as a nanny prepared her for the hustling and sacrifice required to build her own company. ""On a daily basis, I see people making connections,"" says Esposito. ""It's really interesting when you see something become bigger than you.""

Anita Balakrishnan,01262017,CNBC,01192017,"Google may dominate digital advertising now, but one Wall Street analyst said its unchallenged reign might be coming to an end. Products like Amazon Alexa — which allows purchases by voice — and digital payments like Apple Pay are likely to disrupt the advertising industry and provide new methods for businesses to drive consumer spending, James Dix, securities analyst at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report"" on Thursday. That could especially impact Google's hallmark business, search, Dix said. ""There's fundamental challenges to search's business model,"" Dix said. ""Search is roughly half of the digital ad market. Is that going to be more or less in five years? It would seem as though its going to be tough for it to go up in market share. Fundamentally, that's a very high margin advertising product.""

""The market needs more people who think the market is actually pricing in the expectations,"" Dix said. The company will report earnings Thursday after the bell, when Wall Street is expecting adjusted earnings of $9.64 per Class A share on revenue of $25.23 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. That would be up from a year ago, when the company reported $8.67 per share on revenue of $21.33 billion.

Good luck finding a Pixel XL or one with more storage. Image source: Google. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages. That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around, we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report. While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course. The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge: We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis. Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders. The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels. How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product. ","
      
    Google Has a Good Problem With Pixel -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,01262017,Fool,01192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google recently acquired most of Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) developer products for an undisclosed price. That package includes its mobile application development platform Fabric, the Crashlytics crash-reporting platform, mobile app analytics tool Answers, SMS login system Digits, and development automation system Fastlane. Image source: Getty Images. Does the sale indicate that Twitter will sell itself off in bits and pieces instead of as a whole company? Or does it mean that Twitter is merely streamlining its business by dumping its non-core assets? Let's take a closer look at Twitter and Google's plans to decide. Shares of Twitter currently trade well below its IPO price of $26 due to its stalled out user growth, sluggish revenue growth, and lack of GAAP profitability. Its monthly active users (MAUs) rose just 3% annually to 317 million last quarter as its revenue grew 8% to $616 million -- marking its slowest growth rate since its IPO. Its GAAP net loss only slightly narrowed from $131.7 million a year ago to $102.9 million, mainly due to high stock-based compensation expenses which gobbled up 26% of its revenues. Faced with these challenges, Twitter announced plans to slash 9% of its workforce and wind down non-core businesses like Vine and Fabric, while focusing more on its core ""Bluebird"" Twitter app. It shuttered Vine last year, but Fabric reportedly attracted the attention of several bidders, including Microsoft and Google. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claimed that the cuts could drive the company ""toward GAAP profitability in 2017."" By abandoning its developer tools, Twitter can no longer establish an app ecosystem tethered to its social network and back end services. But the retreat isn't surprising, since Facebook abandoned its comparable back end as a service (BaaS) platform, Parse, last year. That failure was attributed to the fact that Parse couldn't compete against similar app development platforms from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon's AWS. If Facebook couldn't compete, it's doubtful that Twitter could have fared much better. Investors should also have seen the writing on the wall when Twitter canceled its annual Flight developer conference last year. Google might seem like an 800-pound gorilla in internet-related services, but its cloud infrastructure platform -- which provides development tools, analytics, and computing power for developers and companies -- is much smaller than Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure. BaaS platforms play a key role in that battle, since they provide cloud-based apps with computing power while letting developers manage those apps, view usage data, and add push notifications and other features. To compete more effectively against Amazon and Microsoft, Google acquired Firebase, a BaaS start-up, in 2014. Firebase's developer base quadrupled since that acquisition to about 450,000 users by mid-2016, and Google added additional analytics capabilities and mobile development tools. Google plans to integrate Fabric directly into Firebase, while the other tools should be gradually integrated into the platform. Google's decision to buy Twitter's development tools instead of the whole company also indicates that the social network still isn't desirable as a single purchase. That's likely because potential suitors can't figure out how to address Twitter's slowing MAU and revenue growth and weak profitability. They also probably don't want to inherit Twitter's ongoing problems with bullies, trolls, illicit posts, and fake accounts. Twitter's eagerness to sell its non-core businesses raises interesting questions about its Data Licensing business, which sells ""firehose"" feeds of data to various companies. Its revenue rose 26% annually to $71 million, making it Twitter's fastest growing business unit. But it's also been blamed for spreading fake news and causing stock market ""flash crashes"" by rapidly sending bot-generated tweets to news organizations and high-speed trading firms. I previously speculated that Twitter was unwilling to purge its network of bots because they counted as MAUs and they fed the licensing unit's firehose feeds. If Twitter sells or spins off its data licensing business, it would generate some fresh cash and let it purge some bots and fake accounts to improve the quality of its social network. Twitter's sale of its developer tools to Google isn't a game changer for either company. But it reveals how aggressively Twitter is streamlining its business around its Bluebird app, and indicates that Google might need more acquisitions to keep up with Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud platform race. Therefore, investors should see if Twitter unloads any more non-core businesses in the near future. ","

Danny Vena,01262017,Fool,01192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In its annual mobile apps survey, Research firm Gartner predicted that by 2019 virtual assistants will account for 20% of all smartphone interactions. With that level of user engagement,  predictably all of the largest technology companies are invested in the segment and each brings a different strength to the field. Will 2017 be the year of the virtual assistant?  Image source: Pixabay. Amazon Echo powered by Alexa. Image source: Amazon.com. Many media reports  are calling Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa the hit of the Consumer Electronics Show.  In 2015, Amazon made a skills kit available to developers that allowed partners to incorporate voice commands. Fast forward to 2017 and Alexa can integrate with an estimated 5,000 third-party apps,  from refrigerators to TV's, from cars to vacuums, and lest we forget, the Echo smart home speaker.  The novelty of this device made it among the top selling items on Amazon's website during the holidays. This was a brilliant strategic move by a company without a smartphone as an installed base. Amazon does, however, have a roster of well-known companies in its corner including Ford, Samsung and LG to name a few. In addition to product integration, Alexa can be found in a dizzying number of bots that can order a pizza from Domino's, schedule an Uber, or check your Capital One balance. This gives Amazon the early lead in terms of reach and momentum, but the lack of a mobile device means that challenges remain. Apple's Siri. Image source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), represented in the category by Siri, hasn't seen much love. Her earliest incarnation could only answer correctly about 65% of the time,  and users complained that far too often she defaulted to Google rather than answering the question. Consumers tend to remember those early first experiences, and Siri still has a bad reputation. She shouldn't be counted out yet, though. Apple has been taking steps to improve Siri's understanding. In mid-2014, Siri's brain was replaced by an artificial intelligence (AI) based neural network and Apple claims that Siri now has a less than 5% error rate.  Apple argues that it isn't necessary to upload all of your data to the cloud in order for Siri to improve. It uses a technique called differential privacy, which keeps individual information at the local phone level and protects user privacy.  Though it currently doesn't have a, Echo-like voice-activated speaker, reports indicate that a prototype is currently in the testing stage. Google Home powered by Google Assistant. Image source: Google. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has introduced Google Assistant, which expands on the capabilities of Google Now and OK Google. This assistant is currently available on its Pixel phones and can be accessed on other smartphones via the Google Allo app. This virtual helper is more conversational and has produced impressive early results due to experiences gained from its predecessors. It was found to rival and in many cases surpass its nearest competitors. Assistant's greatest strength may be the ability to answer follow-up questions, a feature many of its rivals lack. Integration with Google Home smart speaker puts it squarely in competition with Amazon's Echo. Its strengths include entire home synchronized audio and grouping of smart-home commands. Some researchers believe that Alexa will cede its early lead in the category to Google Assistant by 2020. Microsoft Cortana. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Cortana is available across its Windows 10-based devices including phones, tablets and PC's. It has many competing features, but has exhibited difficulties responding to requests, reminiscent of Siri's early days. Microsoft announced late last year that it would open Cortana to third party integration, so expect a number of hardware integrations on the horizon. It has yet to introduce an interactive speaker, but its first hardware partner is Harman Kardon and one is expected sometime this year.  In a shrewd move, the kit used by developers is remarkably similar to that of Alexa, allowing them to piggyback off the work they have already done. This will accelerate the process of producing hardware that will integrate Cortana. ","
      
    Why 2017 Will Be the Year of the Virtual Assistant -- The Motley Fool

Millions of baby boomers are signing up for Social Security, and on average, retired workers were awarded $1,406.58 per month in benefits in December 2016. The amount received in Social Security income, however, varies significantly depending on your work history and the age at which you enroll. Therefore, that monthly amount may not be the best reference point for you if you plan on retiring at age 62. Read on to learn how much you can collect in Social Security benefits if you claim at 62 and what you can do to make the most of those payments. Image source: Getty Images. The Social Security Administration has made 2.9 million new awards to retired workers over the past 12 months, including 210,323 awards to recipients in December 2016 alone. Retired worker claiming benefits in December got awarded an average of $1,406.58, which was up from $1,341.77 in December 2015. Also, it could be helpful to know that across all 41.1 million currently retired workers, the average Social Security benefit today is $1,360.13, as of December 2016. For perspective, the following table shows the average monthly Social Security payment to all retired workers between 2006 and 2015. Data source: Social Security Administration. Table by author. In December, the SSA paid an average of $1,076.70 per month to people age 62. The amount you receive, however, could be much different than this, because Social Security calculates your benefit using a complex formula based on your personal work history. To calculate your age 62 benefit, the SSA subjects your highest 35 years of inflation-adjusted income to as bend points, or multipliers, and then reduces your payment by a fixed percentage. In 2017, your full retirement age benefit is the sum of 90% of inflation-adjusted income up to $885, 32% of inflation-adjusted income up to $5,336, and 15% of inflation- adjusted income above $5,336. That amount is then reduced by 5/9 of 1% per month for the first 36 months and 5/12 of 1% for each additional month that you claim prior to your full retirement age. The full retirement age for people retiring at age 62 this year is 66 years and two months, which is two months higher than the full retirement age in 2016. Therefore, if you claim benefits at age 62 this year, the amount you'll receive per month will be 25.83% lower than the amount you would otherwise receive if you wait to claim at your full retirement age. Here's a table that shows how much your Social Security is reduced when you claim at 62, depending on your birth year and assuming a $1,000 full retirement age benefit for the primary beneficiary, or a $500 benefit for a spouse. Image source: Social Security Administration. Because the amount you'll actually receive in Social Security benefits at age 62 will differ from your peers because of differences in income, the best way to determine your actual benefit at age 62 is to use this online calculator, or by creating an online user ID so that you can view your personal record on Social Security's website. Social Security rewards those who wait to claim benefits until after their full retirement age with delayed retirement credits that increase their payments. However, most Americans still claim benefits before reaching full retirement age, so if you're considering claiming early too, you're in good company. If do claim benefits at age 62, here are a couple of things to consider if you plan to continue working. First, if you have more than 35 years of income in your Social Security calculation, continuing to work could increase your future benefits if it replaces a low income year in your work history. Second, if you earn more than $16,920 in income, then $1 for every $2 earned above that limit will be held back from your Social Security check until you reach your full retirement age. Any money that gets withheld because of this rule will eventually increase your Social Security income. While working could expose some of your Social Security income to income taxes, working even part-time could allow you to use some of your Social Security income to create a bigger nest egg, particularly if you contribute to a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow workers with earnings to contribute to them at any age, and in 2017, people over 50 can contribute $6,500 ($5,500 base amount, plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution). Over time, a strategy that includes claiming early, working at least part-time, and contributing the maximum to a Roth IRA every year could increase the chances that you won't outlive your retirement savings.

    Americans' Average Social Security Benefit at Age 62 -- The Motley Fool

Rich Smith,01262017,Fool,01192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Well that was fast. It was only one month ago that we learned Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is sending up another batch of Earth-imaging ""Terra Bella"" satellites. The mission is slated to take place sometime in late 2017 -- but now, it turns out, by the time those satellites reach orbit, Alphabet may not even own them anymore. Planet Labs' satellites might not give the most hi-res images, but they still give a nice picture of L.A. and the condition of the reservoirs that water it. Image source: Planet Labs. In fact, Alphabet only just finished buying Terra Bella in 2014, paying $500 million for the business. As part of Alphabet, Terra Bella's seven orbital satellites have helped to improve the quality of Alphabet's self-built Google Maps, decreasing the company's reliance on outside satellite imaging suppliers such as DigitalGlobe (NYSE:DGI). But Alphabet has apparently rethought the advantages of owning its own photo-snapping satellites and decided it's better to focus on its core business -- and outsource sat-services work to others. After all, as satellite-research firm TMF Associates head Tim Farrar explains, it only costs Alphabet $10 million to $50 million a year to buy all the satellite images it needs from other suppliers. At those prices, the $500 million spent to acquire Terra Bella could keep Google Maps in pictures for anywhere from 10 to 50 years. Factor in the cost of maintaining, operating, and eventually replacing Terra Bella's satellites as they wear out over time, and it becomes even more economical for Alphabet to just buy its pics from outside vendors such as DigitalGlobe and Planet Labs. Speaking of outsiders, you probably recall that two years ago, Alphabet teamed up with Fidelity to invest $1 billion in SpaceX to assist with the latter's effort to build a constellation of broadband internet satellites. This project is a little closer to Alphabet's core internet search business, but it's still something Alphabet can easily outsource to other companies to handle. In fact, Alphabet recently announced that it is halting expansion of its Google Fiber rollout and laying off workers in that division. Soon after, the company pulled the plug on a plan to provide internet service via solar drone. The company is still looking into the possibility of using high-altitude balloons to beam internet service to earth, but given the rollbacks elsewhere, it appears Alphabet may lose interest in this effort as well and begin looking around for someone to buy out its stake in SpaceX. (The good news: If and when such a sale takes place, it would give us an up-to-date look at how the market is valuing SpaceX stock). Why might Alphabet be pulling back from its space investments? In a word: profits. For some time, analysts have been criticizing Alphabet's ""moonshot"" investments for blunting profit margins and causing the company to miss earnings targets. By reducing investments in non-core businesses, Alphabet may hope to get its margins moving upwards again. And Alphabet's moves may have follow-on effects elsewhere. Consider: Planet Labs already has more than 100 Earth-imaging microsatellites in orbit. Adding seven somewhat larger Terra Bella satellites to the mix won't grow Planet Labs' constellation very much. What it will do is remove a rapidly growing competitor from this industry -- and hand greater pricing power to DigitalGlobe and Planet Labs. With less competition, DigitalGlobe should become more profitable. And with less competition, the still-private Planet Labs will become a more attractive investment if and when it decides to IPO.

Social Security provides critical benefits for millions of retirees, but what many workers don't realize is that the age you claim Social Security can impact the amount you receive each month in benefits. Though you're allowed to start collecting benefits as early as age 62, if you want to receive your full benefit, you'll need to wait until your full retirement age to make that claim. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Your full retirement age is determined by the Social Security Administration based on when you were born. If your year of birth is 1943-1954, your full retirement age is 66. If you were born in 1960 or later, your full retirement age is 67. And if you were born between 1955 and 1959, your full retirement age falls somewhere in between. As long as you wait until your full retirement age to first take Social Security, you'll get the full benefit payments you're entitled to collect. Your Social Security benefit payments are based on your top 35 years of earnings. Once those earnings are averaged to establish a base payment amount, you have the power to raise or lower that benefit depending on the age at which you first claim Social Security. The earliest age you're allowed to collect Social Security is 62, but claiming early comes at a cost. If you take benefits before reaching your full retirement age, you'll lose 6.67% of your full benefit amount for up to three years and then 5% a year thereafter. So if your full retirement age is 66 and you claim benefits at 62, you'll reduce your payments by 25%. On the other hand, if you delay Social Security past your full retirement age, you'll raise your benefits by 8% each year up until age 70, at which point the incentive to hold off runs out. So if your full retirement age is 66 and you wait until 70 to take Social Security, you'll increase your payments by 32%. Keep in mind that whatever benefit amount you first lock in will be the payment amount you receive for life. If you're eligible for a full benefit of $1,500 a month at age 66 but claim Social Security at 62 to get your hands on that money sooner, you'll reduce your benefit to $1,125, and that's all you'll collect each month from that point on. Your benefit won't go back up once you reach your full retirement age. Because waiting until your full retirement age can help you maximize your Social Security payments, it's important to be aware of when you should be claiming benefits. Though the full retirement age for Social Security used to be 65, it has since increased due to changes in life expectancies. The following table shows what your full retirement age will be based on the year you were born: Year of Birth Full Retirement Age 1943-1954 66 1955 66 and 2 months 1956 66 and 4 months 1957 66 and 6 months 1958 66 and 8 months 1959 66 and 10 months 1960 67 DATA SOURCE: SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION. Since Social Security first began paying benefits in 1940, the average life expectancy for men reaching age 65 has increased almost seven years to 84.3. For women, it's increased almost seven years to 86.6. If you were born in 1960 or later, you should know that your full retirement age might change down the line if life expectancies continue to increase across the board. Similarly, the rules around claiming benefits early or late might also evolve over time, so it pays to keep tabs on Social Security changes that could eventually impact your payments. ","
      
    Social Security Full Retirement Age -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,01262017,Fool,01192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Facebook. That $2 billion Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) paid for Oculus -- the virtual reality company it bought in 2014 -- well, it was more like $3 billion. In a testimony during an ongoing lawsuit involving Oculus, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that his company paid an additional $700 million to retain Oculus employees and another $300 million for the team to hit certain milestones. What's more, he added that Facebook will probably invest another $3 billion in virtual reality over the next decade in an effort to get the technology into the hands of hundreds of millions of people. Zuckerberg is unabashedly a huge believer in virtual reality, calling it ""the next big computing platform"" after smartphones and tablets. But virtual reality device sales have lagged behind initial expectations. Should investors worry that the company is making a big bet that won't pay off? There was a lot of hype around virtual reality headsets going into 2016. Facebook was set to release the Oculus Rift -- its high-end standalone headset -- early in the year, and it would build on the success of Gear VR, its collaborative project with Samsung. HTC and Sony (NYSE:SNE) also entered the market with high-end devices. Google -- the Alphabet subsidiary -- entered the lower end of the market late in 2016 with its DayDream Viewer, which works with the new Pixel smartphone. But sales failed to live up to initial expectations. While Oculus products fared relatively well, the Sony PlayStation VR and Google DayDream did not. Research group SuperData initially expected Sony to sell 2.6 million PlayStation VR units in 2016 but revised that estimate down to less than 750,000. Likewise, Google Daydream sales estimates were slashed from 450,000 to 261,000. The PlayStation VR sales are most disappointing. The biggest gripe with high-end devices such as Oculus Rift or HTC Vive is that you need a relatively high-end computer to power them. Sony looked to take advantage of its existing PlayStation 4 user base to power PlayStation VR. Its low sales indicate that a powerful computer isn't the only thing holding back VR headset sales. Zuckerberg admitted that virtual reality isn't where he wants it to be yet. ""It's going to take five or 10 more years of development before we get to where we all want to go,"" he said in his testimony. That echoes comments he made during Facebook's first quarter earnings call last year: ""This is very early, and we don't expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right away."" Still, he added, ""Eventually we believe that VR is going to be the next big computing platform, and we're making the investments necessary to lead the way there."" If virtual reality is going to be the next great computing platform, it's going to take a lot of work to get it there. During the company's fourth quarter 2015 earnings calls, Zuckerberg said, ""VR has the potential to change the way we live, work, and communicate."" But right now, it's only changing the way we view videos and play a few video games. To that end, Facebook has already dedicated $250 million to developing new content. Comments from the company's third quarter earnings call indicate that most of that amount will go toward developing new software instead of videos. Oculus users already watch lots of video -- two million cumulative hours as of the first quarter last year. Whether that software is simply games or more social applications, as Zuck says VR has the potential for, remains to be seen. While $3 billion sounds like a lot, consider that over a decade, that's just $300 million per year. Facebook's free cash flow over the past four quarters totaled $8.7 billion, and it has $26 billion in cash and liquid investments on its balance sheet. Also worth noting is that Facebook's core ad revenue is already so large that investors probably won't notice any material impact from Oculus sales in the near term. CFO Dave Wehner told analysts at the beginning of last year that VR is ""not going to have a material impact on revenue in 2016."" I'd expect a similar sentiment in 2017. But if Facebook's investments in Oculus pay off, and it truly does become ""the next big computing platform"", the revenue from VR could eventually make a sizable contribution to the company's top and bottom lines.

Steve Symington,01262017,Fool,01192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) announced in late October that it will acquire Level 3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT), shares of the telecommunications giant plunged more than 13% over the next few days to flirt with a fresh 52-week low. And though the stock has partially recovered since then, CenturyLink is still well below the levels it stood at just before news of the acquisition broke. With shares now trading at just 11 times this year's expected earnings, have investors overreacted to CenturyLink's acquisition of Level 3? And more importantly, could the deal possibly be a smart, value-creating move for shareholders? I think so. Image source: Getty Images. Before we get there, however, I'll admit it's hard to blame the market for bidding shares of CenturyLink down. For one, recall that shares of both CenturyLink and Level 3 skyrocketed 18% and 13%, respectively, in a single day the previous week after reports surfaced stating the two companies were in ""advanced talks"" to merge. So CenturyLink's subsequent plunge wasn't quite as pronounced as it might have seemed at the time. And to be fair, when the dust cleared and the deal was formally announced a few days later, CenturyLink had agreed to acquire Level 3 for $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink stock for each Level 3 share. That equated to $66.50 per share at the time, valuing the deal at $34 billion, including the debt CenturyLink will assume. That's a big pill to swallow considering CenturyLink's enterprise value stands at ""just"" $33.5 billion as of this writing. More than anything else, then, this acquisition should be considered a merger of equals. And if there are any hiccups as these two enormous companies begin to integrate following the planned third-quarter 2017 closing of the deal, you can be sure CenturyLink shares will invoke the market's ire again. But those risks may be worth taking in light of the expected benefits of this deal. First, for those of you worried about CenturyLink's sky-high annual dividend of $2.16 per share (yielding 8.5% at today's prices) and disconcerting 127% payout ratio, note that CenturyLink anticipates maintaining its annual payout. But how? As fellow Fool Brian Stoffel pointed out a few months ago, CenturyLink's use of both earnings and free cash flow to fund capital returns was already enough to ensure that its lofty dividend could survive at the time. And now, with the help of Level 3's nearly $10 billion in aggregate net operating losses, the acquisition should substantially improve free cash flow, and in turn, according to CenturyLink, help to ""enhance the combined company's financial flexibility and significantly lower its payout ratio."" CenturyLink will also enjoy the massively increased scale of the two companies' combined fiber networks, increasing its network by 200,000 route miles of fiber and giving it a presence in more than 60 countries. On-net buildings should increase almost 75%, to 75,000 -- even after accounting for buildings already served by both Level 3 and CenturyLink -- including 10,000 buildings in Latin America and the EMEA regions. Moreover, CenturyLink anticipates significant cost synergies, as it will be able to focus capital investments on increasing capacity and extending the reach of its fiber network. And the company should be able to identify significant incremental revenue growth opportunities through its impending ability to deploy the combined product portfolios across the combined customer base. In particular, CenturyLink is excited to be able to offer its larger enterprise customers the benefits of Level 3's global footprint. If that wasn't enough, CenturyLink anticipates generating $975 million in annual run-rate cash synergies from operational efficiencies, systems consolidation, and removal of duplicate functions. To be fair, CenturyLink also expects that realizing these synergies and integrating the two networks will result in one-time costs of roughly $685 million, the majority of which will be incurred by 2019. In addition, the deal is still subject to federal and state regulatory approvals, as well as the approvals of both CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders. So there is plenty of room for hiccups along the way that could derail the process. But if the acquisition closes as planned later this year, and if CenturyLink is successful in the integration process, I think shareholders who opt to hang on despite the broader market's pessimism will probably be more than happy with their decision over the long run.

Right now, one of the hottest trends in the semiconductor industry is the emerging market for autonomous vehicles. It is generally accepted that to do proper autonomous vehicles, a lot of computing power is going to be needed inside of the cars to give them the required ""intelligence."" Image source: NVIDIA. Two companies that have made public their intentions to aggressively pursue the market for the ""brains"" inside of self-driving cars are microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both companies have announced major partnerships and deals with automotive makers and suppliers. Intel, for instance, announced last year that it would be collaborating with Mobileye (NASDAQOTH:MBBYF) and Delphi Automotive to build platforms for use by automotive manufacturers. Intel has also said that, in 2016, it booked self-driving car deals collectively worth more than $1 billion in lifetime revenue. Last year, NVIDIA and Audi announced that they would, together, try to bring self-driving cars to market by 2020. NVIDIA's components are also found inside of Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) new vehicles, as well. So, both NVIDIA and Intel both look well-positioned to capitalize on a potential self-driving car boom. Which stock is the better way to play it? It's important to understand that self-driving car platforms aren't either of these companies' core revenue drivers today -- they're adjacent businesses. Intel's core business is microprocessors and related components for personal computers and data centers, and NVIDIA's core businesses are graphics processors designed for gaming, workstations, and data centers. An Intel chip designed specifically for automotive use. Image source: Intel. For Intel, autonomous vehicles are just one (potentially significant) part of the company's Internet of Things business (though the company did recently announce that it'd be forming an autonomous driving group within its Internet of Things group). NVIDIA specifically calls out automotive as a key long-term growth segment. The reason that both companies look well-positioned to play in the self-driving car market is because the technology that they've developed for other markets (high-performance computing technologies) look to be applicable to self-driving cars. However, there is additional technical and sales/marketing work required to succeed in self-driving cars, and both companies appear to be making the required incremental investments to capitalize on these opportunities. Here's the thing: Both NVIDIA and Intel have an opportunity to make some real money from the self-driving market. Furthermore, the market for significant computing capabilities inside of self-driving cars could be quite substantial, especially if many (if not most) cars over the long term are endowed with such computing capabilities. However, I think that the self-driving car market could be much more interesting for NVIDIA than for Intel by Intel's sheer size relative to NVIDIA. However, if NVIDIA -- which has generated about $6.1 billion in revenue over the last 12 months -- generates an incremental $2 billion in automotive-related revenue from self-driving cars over time, then that's not only going to significantly boost the company's top line, but its bottom line as well.

I bought a new-to-me car recently, and I realized that by the time I'm in the market for another one, we'll likely be knee-deep into the driverless car transformation. That's because IHS estimates that there will be 76 million partially to fully autonomous vehicles on the road worldwide by 2035. That's not as far away as it may seem and this shifting automotive market -- which will be worth $77 billion less than 20 years from now -- leaves plenty of opportunity for long-term investors to benefit. If you're looking for top driverless car stocks that are leading the pack, you many want to consider Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA). Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's self-driving team was recently spun off into its own company and now goes by the name of Waymo. To date, Waymo has logged nearly 2 million miles of self-driving on the road and 1 billion miles of simulated driving in 2016. That makes Waymo a leader in the driverless car space, because one of the most important aspects of letting cars drive themselves is giving them direct experience in handling the myriad of situations they'll encounter in the real world. And Waymo proved recently that it's much more than just an Alphabet side project when it announced that it's developed its own LIDAR technology that is 90% cheaper than the previous system it was using. LIDAR sends out light signals that bounce off objects around it in order to tell self-driving vehicles what things (cars, buildings, pedestrians, etc.) are around it. Though the new technology is much cheaper, Waymo says it's accurate enough to tell which direction a pedestrian is looking (which is helpful when a driverless car is trying to determine where a person might walk). Waymo is setting itself up to benefit from the driverless car market by selling its hardware and software as a service. Some of the details are still unknown, but Waymo showed its hand recently when it announced a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to test self-drivng car services starting this year. Waymo's president and CEO, John Krafcik, said recently that the company will have its next prototypes on public roads some time this year, further solidifying the company in the driverless car space. Self-driving vehicles get a lot of attention in the U.S., but China could end up being one of the biggest users of driverless car tech -- and Baidu might benefit the most. The company is often called the Google of China, because it controls everything from countries largest search engine, earns most of its revenues from advertising, and has some of the world's most advanced self-driving technologies as well. Baidu is already testing its technology in cities across China and plans to release more driverless vehicles on the road next year, with the goal of bringing mass-produced driverless cars to market by 2021. The company benefits from China's relaxed position on self-driving regulations and the country's need to improve transportation its famously large cities. It's still unclear how Baidu will make money from its driverless car pursuits, but it wouldn't be surprising to see the company go the same route as Waymo and strike up a partnership with an automaker to launch a self-driving service or sell its technology directly to automakers. Investors shouldn't make the mistake of overlooking Tesla's driverless car opportunities or the huge strides the company's already taken. Tesla began adding all of the necessary hardware to make all its vehicles fully autonomous just a few months ago, something no other carmaker is even close to doing. All of the hardware isn't turned on right now, but it'll use the technology to collect driving data to improve its semi-autonomous software. When enough information has been collected in real-word situations, Tesla will then offer owners the option to activate the hardware. Tesla also recently posted a video of its semi-autonomous Autopilot technology driving a person around town in the fog while navigating intersections, pedestrians, traffic, and even bicyclists. Tesla has already talked about plans to let its owners rent out their vehicles to others when they are not utilizing it, and CEO Elon Musk says the time frame for fully autonomous Teslas could happen by the end of this year. In a move that further proves the company's commitment to self-driivng technology, Tesla recently announced that it'll be using technology from another driverless car tech leader, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA). Tesla will use NVIDIA's supercomputer in its new cars to help them process all the visual information collected and give the vehicles optimal image recognition capabilities through NVIDIA's GPUs. While driverless cars may still seem like a long way off, automakers are continually adding incremental self-driving tech to their vehicles and the U.S. government is providing new opportunities (and much-needed rules) for making these technologies a reality. Investors looking for a new technological shift to bet on should look no further than driverless cars -- and consider any of the companies listed above. ","

 ,01262017,MarketWatch,01192017,"Supported by By Daisuke Wakabayashi SAN FRANCISCO — It is almost boring how predictably good Alphabet’s earnings are these days — a trait not always shared by the company’s tech conglomerate peers. Apple is wildly profitable, but its results hinge on the fickle preferences of smartphone buyers who may or may not be moved by the iPhone’s latest design. Amazon seems prepared to abandon quarterly profits to invest even more in faster delivery times or in another huge data center. Facebook is still young enough that a little volatility is not out of character. But fourth-quarter results announced on Thursday from Alphabet, Google’s parent company, proved once again that the company is the model of moneymaking consistency. Alphabet’s revenue in the quarter rose 22 percent to $26.06 billion, beating analysts’ expectations. Net income was $5.33 billion, up from $4.92 billion a year earlier. The heart of Alphabet’s consistent earnings remains the company’s search engine. While a consumer can delay an iPhone purchase or shop somewhere other than Amazon, Google’s search engine is an indispensable tool for anyone using the internet. The shift to mobile devices, once considered a threat to Google’s search business, has only strengthened it. Google’s market share on desktop search is around 78 percent, but it is above 90 percent on mobile devices, according to research from NetMarketShare.com. What is more, on smaller mobile displays, Google’s ads occupy a large portion of the screen — making it more likely a user will click on them. Clicks on Google ads increased 36 percent in the quarter, but what advertisers paid for each click decreased 15 percent. Google is also sitting on many of the internet’s most valuable properties — the places where people go to stay in touch on email, find driving directions or seek out entertainment. While clicks on Google’s ads across the internet are rising, they are growing faster on its own websites like YouTube. Alphabet does not break out results for YouTube, but the site continues to amass a huge audience. Google said more than a billion people watched YouTube every month, viewing hundreds of millions of hours of its videos every day. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said company assets like search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play, constituted “prime time in the mobile era.” Even Alphabet’s unexpected hiccups are a little dull. The company’s earnings per share were $7.56, or 11 cents below analysts’ estimates. It said the reason for the shortfall was that it paid more in taxes. The company’s effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 percent, compared with 5 percent in the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet said it paid more in United States taxes but did not explain why. Alphabet shares were down 2 percent in after-hours trading. The stock reached a record high on Wednesday. While the dominance of the Google search engine seems unassailable today, Alphabet is investing heavily in new technologies that may threaten its stronghold. Devices like the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart speaker, portend a future where artificially intelligent digital assistants fetch information without needing to access a search engine directly. During the quarter, Google introduced a smartphone called Pixel and Google Home, an Echo competitor. Both devices are vessels for the Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligence system. To promote those devices, Alphabet said it spent more on marketing during the quarter. Alphabet said its cost of revenue — an indicator of its spending which also included other costs like operating data centers — rose 30 percent during the quarter from a year earlier. Google did not provide figures for how those products sold, but the “other revenue” category, which included hardware sales along with revenue from Google Play, rose 62 percent to $3.4 billion. Part of the company’s financial stability came from Google’s creation of Alphabet in 2015. The reorganization into a holding company split the company’s core search business from a growing list of fledgling operations, like the newly minted Waymo — what used to be Google’s self-driving car project until it was spun off as an independent Alphabet company in 2016. This move raised the pressure on the company’s so-called other bets, including its life sciences unit, Verily, and its home electronics unit, Nest, to prove that they could be profitable without the support of mother Google. In a sign of the independence of Alphabet companies, Verily announced on Thursday that Singapore’s sovereign fund, Temasek, will acquire a minority stake in Verily for $800 million. Under the watch of Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, the company has scaled back costs and — in some cases — the ambition of its speculative investments into new technologies. During the quarter, Alphabet said quarterly revenue from “other bets” rose 75 percent to $262 million, while operating losses narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.

Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to report adjusted profit of $9.64 a share, compared with $8.67 in the year-earlier period. Contributors to Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expect Alphabet to report adjusted earnings of $9.76 a share. The company has surpassed both consensus estimates in four of the past five quarters. Watch:  Google’s self-driving cars equipped with new sensors Revenue: The company is expected to report revenue of $20.6 billion, compared with $17.3 billion in the year-earlier period, according to the FactSet and Estimize consensus estimates.

The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average 12-month price target is $960.59, according to a FactSet survey of roughly 30 analysts. Shares of Alphabet closed $858.45 at Wednesday. They traded down 0.4% to $854.79 Thursday afternoon. What to watch for: This will be the first quarter to highlight Pixel smartphone sales, the company’s iPhone rival that sells at a similarly premium price point. In a note to clients last week, Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi raised his estimate on Alphabet’s Pixel phone to 1 million units for the quarter. The Pixel outlook prompted Mizuho to raise its revenue estimate slightly, to $20.5 billion from $19.9 billion. However, Doshi, who has a buy rating and $1,025 target on the stock, said he’s “somewhat skeptical that the Pixel can gain material near-term share,” particularly since Verizon is the only wireless carrier that sells the phone to its customers. The global smartphone industry has decelerated significantly in recent years as customers wait longer to upgrade their phones and purchase unlocked and refurbished phones from third-party retail sites. Meanwhile, Google continues to face advertising pressure amid declines in its core search product. The growth of paid clicks on ads across its sites is expected to increase 26.2% this quarter, according to the FactSet estimate. That would mark a deceleration from 33% last quarter and 31% in the year-earlier period.

In 2017, YouTube is expected to introduce a multichannel video programming distributor service, enabling Google to provide cable-like television services. “Momentum in other businesses with large opportunities will likely be important to maintaining sentiment around Google as the core search business slowly decelerates over the near to medium term,” he said.

Ciara Linnane,01262017,MarketWatch,01192017,"Published: Jan 20, 2017 7:06 a.m. ET Panera is upgraded to buy in an otherwise gloomy outlook for the fast-casual category By Goldman Sachs on Thursday upgraded Panera Bread Co.’s stock to buy from neutral and said it expects the fast-casual restaurant chain’s new delivery service to drive growth. The analysts downgraded Bloomin’ Brands Inc. stock to neutral from buy on concerns about margins and wage pressure, in a note on the restaurant sector that struck an overall cautious tone for the sector in 2017. Read: Domino’s is rewarding customers with stock, but experts say it may not boost loyalty Sales are expected to be challenged by weak spending as consumers continue to cut back and eat more at home, analysts led by Karen Holthouse wrote in a note. Casual-dining restaurants have been struggling for at least the past year as their customers deal with higher prices for everything from rent to prescriptions to gasoline. A survey by restaurant tracker TDn2K earlier this week found that same-store sales at U.S. restaurants fell 2.4% in December, their worst performance in more than five years. Overall sales fell 4.3% to mark their worst performance in more than three years.

                                  has become somewhat of a star in the sector in the past few months, with the majority of analysts on FactSet rating it the equivalent of buy. Those analysts have an average stock-price target of $237.32, equal to about 11% upside from its current trading level. Goldman is expecting the company’s Panera delivery service to become a strong competitive tool in an increasingly crowded part of the restaurant market. Google search trends for the service rose steadily through 2016 as the platform moved into new markets, said Holthouse. “Comscore data also suggests steady momentum for to-go, catering, and/or rapid pickup as ordering options,” said the note. “Although month-to-month trends remain choppy for unique visitors, the two-year trend has showed steady growth averaging [about] 50%.” After muted comments at a key December retail conference, Goldman is lowering its fourth-quarter outlook for Panera by 1%, putting it below consensus, but it believes investors reset their expectations after that event. “We would also note that our forecast continues to show improving momentum in the 2-year gap to Knapp, which in our view can continue to drive credibility around new sales verticals as idiosyncratic growth drivers,” said Holthouse. Knapp Track is a casual-dining index. The stock is also looking cheap, trading within 0.2 times its postrecession lows relative to its group and the broader S&P 500, even as sales trends improve. Shares have gained 13% in the last 12 months, underperforming the S&P 500

Brian Acton,01262017,MarketWatch,01192017,"Published: Jan 26, 2017 8:48 a.m. ET The IRS found 70% of taxpayers are eligible to file their federal tax return for free By If you bristle at the idea of having to pay to file your taxes, you’ll probably be happy to know that the IRS found 70% of all taxpayers are eligible to prepare and file their federal tax return for free. In fact, a wide variety of free federal and state tax solutions can help qualifying taxpayers file their 2016 tax returns without paying a cent. (Check out 10 ways you’re filing your taxes wrong.) Some of these solutions are offered by tax software providers in partnership with the IRS through the Free File Alliance, while others are a standard product offering. Many have strict eligibility requirements, but are perfectly suitable for straightforward tax returns. (Note: Most solutions with income restrictions have special eligibility requirements for active duty military members. If you were an active duty service member in 2016 and had an adjusted gross income, or AGI, of $64,000 or less, you may qualify even if you don’t meet the civilian income requirements listed here — make sure to check the provider’s website for details. Also, certain free file offers must be accessed from the IRS website.) Paying taxes isn’t fun, but it’s something we all have to do. And not doing so can do more damage than you may think — unpaid taxes can result in a tax lien, which can damage your credit. (Not sure where your credit stands? Viewing it is another thing you can do for free. In fact, you can see two of your free credit scores on Credit.com.) With that in mind, we’ve compiled the ultimate guide to filing your taxes for free — a list of almost 20 ways you could file your federal and/or state taxes at no cost. We include Free File Alliance solutions available through the IRS website and solutions offered independently. Want to find the right one for you? Check out each solution in detail below. IRS paper forms The most basic option available is to fill out the IRS paper tax forms and file them by mail. (Note: While the forms and filing are free, this method does require you pay for postage.) You can find your appropriate tax return form on the IRS website or at public locations like post offices and libraries. “If your taxes are relatively straightforward, you can always print the appropriate documentation from the IRS website and send them back completed,” Jayson Mullin, founder of Top Tax Defenders, a tax debt relief service in Houston, said. “This can be great for single filers with one job and not a lot of itemized deductions.” Remember, if you do your taxes on your own, you’ll be responsible for any mistakes and won’t get the benefit of software that hunts down tax credits and deductions on your behalf. IRS Free File Fillable Forms If you’re comfortable completing your taxes yourself, but paper forms aren’t your thing, you can use Free File Fillable Forms. These forms are accessible from the IRS website and come with basic guidance. You’ll need your 2015 tax return, and this option will not include state tax preparation. There are no income restrictions. TurboTax You can use TurboTax’s Federal Free Edition software to file your 1040 EZ and 1040A federal tax returns and state tax returns. State tax returns may cost extra. You can upload your W-2 as a file or just snap a photo, and the TurboTax software can automatically populate the right fields. You’ll answer TurboTax’s questions to work through your return and electronically file (e-file) when you’re done. TurboTax experts and other online contributors are available to answer questions 24/7. To qualify, you’ll need to have made less than $100,000, have no substantial medical bills and not claim any rental, investment or business income. TurboTax Freedom Edition, available through the Free File Alliance, can e-file both federal and state tax returns for qualified taxpayers at no cost. Freedom Edition supports most federal and state tax forms. To qualify, you’ll need to have an AGI of $33,000 or less or be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Anyone who meets these requirements will also qualify for free state filing. H&R Block Free File With H&R Block’s Free File program, you can file both federal and state tax returns for free. Users can import their tax returns from any competing software, directly upload tax documents and prepare and file their returns using any device. Help is available through H&R Block’s online help center. To qualify, you must have an AGI of $64,000 or less and be between the ages of 17 and 50, or be eligible for the EITC. efile.com With eFile.com, you can file your 1040EZ federal tax return free. You can file single or jointly with your spouse. Both e-filing and print filing are supported, and efile.com provides free online support, including a team of “Taxperts.” State return filings are available, but do cost $19.95. There are several restrictions: For instance, you can’t claim dependents, have a mortgage or make over $100,000. TaxAct TaxAct provides free filing of 1040EZ and 1040A federal returns and state returns. TaxAct has both an online and desktop version of their software, which uses a Q&A format to guide you through your return. There’s unlimited phone and email support for both tax and software-related questions. Once you’ve filed, you can track your refund status directly through TaxAct. Importing last year’s return will cost an extra $5. There is also a free file version of TaxAct through the Free File Alliance that may support more complex returns, but has stricter requirements. You can qualify for this version if your AGI is $52,000 or less and you’re 56 or younger, or you are eligible for the EITC. eSmart Tax eSmart Tax offers a free version for simple federal 1040EZ and Schedule B returns, plus free chat support. You can easily import your W-2 and last year’s tax return from competitors. You can also file amendments for free if you need to make a last-minute change. They even provide free audit assistance from Liberty Tax Service in the event of an audit. You can file with your state, but in most cases it will cost you at least $29.95. Just like with TaxAct, eSmart offers a free file edition through the IRS website that provides cheaper state returns but has stricter requirements. To qualify, your AGI must be $64,000 or less and you must be between the ages of 18 and 54. Filing most state returns will cost you $19.95. TaxSlayer TaxSlayer uses a step-by-step guided tax process to file free 1040EZ, 1040A and 1040 federal returns. You get W-2 and PDF imports and free email and phone support. While these filings are free, state returns will cost $19.99. Again, you can use TaxSlayer’s free file version through the Free File Alliance that could support more complex returns but has stricter requirements. You can qualify for this version if your AGI is $63,000 or less and you’re 52 or younger. Qualifying Georgia state returns are also free. 1040.com 1040.com offers interview-style tax preparation, a free update from your prior year (if you used 1040.com last year) and an auto-completed state return. Simple 1040EZ federal tax returns are filed for free. To qualify, you’ll have to claim no dependents, have a taxable income less than $100,000 and fit other eligibility requirements. State returns will cost an additional $9.95. There is a free file version of 1040.com accessible from the IRS website that might support more complicated returns, but it comes with stricter requirements. To qualify, your AGI must be $58,000 or less and you must be 52 or younger. State returns will cost you $14.95. Even if you do end up having to pay a bit to file, 1040.com is a service you can feel good about. It donates $2 to clean water projects for every completed tax return, including free ones. FileYourTaxes.com FileYourTaxes.com offers free federal returns with the Free File Alliance. Most basic tax return forms are free, but customer service is limited to Q&A web pages and email notices. FIleYourTaxes.com does file free state returns for Iowa, Idaho, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Vermont. The free version is available to taxpayers with an AGI between $9,000 and $64,000 who are between the ages of 15 and 65. 1040Now.NET Available through the Free File Alliance, 1040NOW provides federal tax preparation and filing for taxpayers who make $64,000 or less each year. Your age and the state you live in can affect your ability to qualify. Residents of certain states qualify for free state filing. FreeTaxUSA FreeTaxUSA’s software provides free federal returns and supports more advanced tax situations such as investments, small businesses, rental property income and itemized deductions. Free filers will get free customer support, but priority support, amended returns and audit assistance will require upgrading to the paid version. State returns will cost you an additional $12.95. Just like many others we’ve mentioned, FreeTaxUSA.com also offers a free file version provided through the Free File Alliance. You can qualify for this version if your AGI is $51,000 or less and you’re between the ages of 17 and 60. State returns are free for residents in 22 qualifying states; all others will cost an additional $12.95. Free1040TaxReturn.com A Free File Alliance solution, Free1040TaxReturn.com’s free offering provides federal filing and unlimited customer support. Federal extensions are also free.

Using the free file offer available through the IRS website, you can also potentially file free federal and state returns. You can qualify with an AGI between $13,000 and $64,000. ezTaxReturn.com ezTaxReturn provides free federal tax returns through the Free File Alliance for taxpayers who make $64,000 or less and live in one of 20 states. According to their site, the average taxpayer completes their return in 30 minutes, and ezTaxReturn promises a simple and straightforward experience. That said, the support offered after you file is limited — if you need audit or amendment support, you’ll have to pay for the privilege. Jackson Hewitt Jackson Hewitt offers several tiers of tax software, including a free version for federal and state returns. There are no specific income requirements, but their free version will only support basic tax returns that include a W-2 income, interest income and all unemployment income. For returns that include student loan interest, self-employment, dependents and many other scenarios, you’d have to upgrade to a paid version. Jackson Hewitt will even complete free simple federal returns on location with a Jackson Hewitt tax professional, but this option requires that you receive your tax refund on an American Express Serve Card. State government solutions As you’ve probably noticed by now, many free federal tax return solutions either don’t offer free state returns or limit the eligible states. However, many states provide free tax filing services for their residents. For instance, Maryland residents can receive free income tax assistance and even free electronic filing in person or over the phone. If you’ve found the perfect free federal tax tool but still need a free state solution, you may want to check on the resources available through your state’s government website. Free tax assistance programs For certain individuals with qualifying circumstances, federal and state programs can provide free tax assistance, including tax preparation and filing. The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program provides basic income tax return services to qualified individuals with disabilities or limited English fluency who make $54,000 or less. With this program, IRS-certified volunteers can provide free basic federal tax return services, including tax preparation and e-filing. The Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) offers free tax help to all taxpayers, especially those 60 years of age and older. “There are many sources of free help, with many organizations offering free tax preparation for non-English speakers, the elderly, and taxpayers who make less than $54,000 per year,” Mullin said. “Check your local library and you’ll most likely find a list of these organizations and who qualifies for their free help.” How to choose the right tax solution for you Choosing the right tax solution depends on your specific needs. Of course, the chief concern is that the solution supports your specific income and tax scenarios. Beyond that, you’ll need to make sure the features you require (W-2 upload, prior year tax return imports, etc.) are supported. You may also want to look for 100% accuracy guarantees with a pledge that any fees or costs associated with mistakes will be covered by the solution provider.

Fortunately for Trump, he has Twitter. But it’s a mistake to pay too much attention to whatever Trump may be tweeting about at any given moment. In fact, the best thing for all of us — the media included — is simply to unfollow the president’s @realDonaldTrump Twitter account and stop turning every Trump tweet into a major story.

John Lewis  for questioning his legitimacy while Lewis, in Trump’s words, represents a “crime-infested” congressional district that is “in horrible shape” and “falling apart”. The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before. Trump’s smear of Lewis and his district was not true.  Trump has also used Twitter to raise the prospect of a nuclear arms race with Russia, threaten criminal punishment for dissent, provoke China, question the valuation of the U.S. dollar

As for the presidential transition itself, it’s been a rocky couple of months since Election Day, to put it mildly. Trump’s nominee for Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, has become a national joke after she bizarrely tried to explain why a school might need guns to protect against grizzly bears. Ethical concerns have also been raised about DeVos and other cabinet nominees. Even more seriously, reports about Russian interference in the election to help Trump’s chances have raised troubling questions about his presidency’s legitimacy.  Trump has not helped matters by taking positions regarding Europe and NATO that are music to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s ears. Trump’s business dealings have raised charges of corruption as foreign dignitaries rush to spend money at  the D.C. Trump hoteland the Trump family engages in business around the world.  Richard Painter, former chief ethics lawyer to George W. Bush, concludes that Trump has not actually separated himself from the business and, as a result, will receive benefits from foreign governments in violation of the Constitution. Indeed, every new Trump tweet seems to set off a new round of breathless commentary that dominates news cycles. Commentators wonder whether Trump’s words can sink or lift stock prices, undermine the strength of the dollar, or even drive Broadway theater-goers away from “Hamilton.” It’s easy to get caught up in this. Apart from anything else, it’s simply bizarre to see a president-elect who takes time to complain (repeatedly) about “Saturday Night Live” on Twitter.  It’s hard not to pay attention, simply because it is so weird and often, simply, embarrassing to see the U.S. Commander-in-Chief stoop to the level of publicly flinging around playground insults. .@NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television! But constant attention to Trump’s tweeting gives him too much credit and feeds his dangerous authoritarian tendencies.  The image of a man with the power to move markets with a tweet is not supported by the evidence. For example, after Trump suggested the dollar was too strong, its value briefly dropped by about 1%, but quickly recovered the next day.  Boeing stock sold-off after Trump’s tweet, but regained its value  later on that trading day. Commentator Kevin Drum describes the pattern: “(a) Trump says [tweets] something, (b) a related financial index reacts instantly, (c) by the next day [if not sooner] everything is back to normal.” Trump also uses tweets as a distraction. For example, when Trump smeared Lewis on Twitter, journalist Chancey DeVega observed that news coverage of Trump’s Twitter war could distract from concerns Lewis had raised about Russian interference in the U.S. election. The media too can be fooled by Trump’s tweets, incautiously taking him at his word. For example,   Trump grandly tweeted last November that he would hold a press conference on December 15 “to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country”. The promised December 15 press conference didn’t take place, and Trump has not, in fact, totally separated himself from his business. Oddly enough, some of the best advice about Trump and Twitter comes from China.  I am not typically inclined to look for guidance from an authoritarian regime, but China’s suggestion  that Trump ought to ease up on his Twitter activity makes sense. An inadvertent or poorly phrased presidential tweet can be dangerous. So stop hanging on Trump’s every tweet. Instead, watch what Trump does, not what he tweets. It’s impossible to completely ignore Trump’s tweets — especially if they address matters of international significance, , however ineptly. But one New Year’s resolution we all should make is to go on a serious Trump Twitter diet. Let the president furiously fire off personal insults and bullying attacks for the benefit of a significantly smaller audience.  Hashtag: #UnfollowTrump.

Not anymore. Ordinary investors now can buy shares in startups that are just getting off the ground, sometimes for just a few dollars. If, that is, they are willing to take on a whole lot of risk. It all started with the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act in 2012. Since the act’s Title III took effect in May 2016, people no longer have to be well-to-do “accredited investors” to buy into startups. Their stake can be as little as $10, or as much as they like, within Securities and Exchange Commission limits based on income. Investing is done through the soaring number of online “equity crowdfunding portals.” Ones that allow nonaccredited investors include Wefunder,SeedInvest and StartEngine. Well-known portals for accredited investors include EquityNet, Fundable, AngelList and Crowdfunder. But along with hopes of 100-fold gains come big downsides. Many of these startups fly beneath the radar of big venture investors who vet fledgling firms. Often, they aren’t promising enough to go public the traditional way, and they lack a track record, proven product and thorough financial disclosures. And since their shares aren’t publicly traded, it may be impossible to cash out until an exit event like an IPO or buyout, and the firm may tank while you wait. “Quite honestly, it’s as close to gambling as you can get. You are dealing with a level below penny stocks,” says Keith Hamilton, owner of Hamilton & Associates, a registered investment-advisory and wealth-management firm in La Jolla, Calif. When clients want to invest in startups of any kind, he says, “I tell them to call it their gambling account.” This new method of buying into startups is the latest and hottest development in the broader field of crowdsourcing. Money-lending sites like publicly traded LendingClub Corp.

                                   make loans from a pool of investor money and pass payments back to investors. Charitable sites like GoFundMe.com allow people to give to causes that may be too small for ordinary foundations, like helping an individual accident victim with living costs. Rewards portals such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow donors to contribute to specific projects such as an independent film, and offer perks like a prerelease showing. Equity crowdfunding—where contributors get actual shares in businesses—began with portals like MicroVentures that largely served accredited investors—people with at least $1 million in net worth excluding the home, or incomes over $200,000. (MicroVentures now serves both accredited and nonaccredited investors.) The 2015 Crowdfunding Industry Report by Crowdsourcing LLC’s Massolution.com, the latest industrywide data available, shows $16.2 billion raised through the various types of crowdfunding in 2014, up 167% from the year before. At the end of 2014 there were more than 1,250 crowdfunding portals world-wide, versus 850 in 2012. “The floodgates have been opened!” the Massolution report says, and industry experts think growth has continued at a fast clip since that report was written. Many predict more money will be raised in coming years as the number of platforms grows, with new players occupying narrow niches such as fundraising for specific industries and a few big platforms taking an ever-larger share of the market. “International expansion will accelerate,” the report predicts. For now, the lending, donation and rewards sites dominate crowdfunding. But the equity sector is only likely to grow, as more investors and entrepreneurs learn about it, says John Rampton, an experienced startup investor in Palo Alto, Calif., who has invested in a startups through DreamFunded. “In the future, a lot more startups will have a chance of being successful because of the funding they can get without [the help of] the institutional investor,” says Rampton, The Massolution report found that in 2014, before Title III flung open the doors, the average equity campaign in North America aimed to raise $175,000. Portals charge investors a percentage of the funds raised—for example, 5% for DreamFunded, which welcomes investments as small as $10. Currently, DreamFunded offers investments in startups like Aqua Blaster, a firm with a new hose nozzle for firefighting and pressure washing, and WorkCar, an Uber-like outfit planning to provide work vehicles. The portal supplies bios on startups’ management teams, a quick financial analysis and the firm’s business plan. DreamFunded’s co-founder and CEO, Manny Fernandez, says the screening also entails interviews with management, credit checks, and criminal and terrorist background checks. Though he thinks the industry will grow and provide valuable service to startups and small firms ignored by the venture-capital industry, he agrees the investor is more likely to lose money than to get rich. “I think this is ideal for the person that knows the person that’s raising the money,” such as the owner of a local business, he says. “I do not see it as a person thinking, ‘Hmm, I have a choice of putting my money in a CD or funding equity startups.’ If you want a safe, secure bet, this is not the way to go.” Because the industry is so new and startup investments often don’t pay off for a decade or more, it’s too early to tell how well investors can do. Generally, the portals highlight their fundraising record, not investor returns. But experts say it’s not to soon to see the risks. Marc Seward, principal of Enviso Capital, an investment-advisory firm in San Diego, says he wouldn’t put more than 15% of a client’s portfolio into alternative investments, with startups making up only a fraction of that, regardless of whether the investor uses equity crowdfunding or a more traditional way in. Seward says he worries that portals’ seal of approval makes a startup look less dangerous than it is. Though all these sites promote their due diligence, it’s not what you’d get with a listed stock that has met the listing standards of an exchange. “I see this lack of due diligence as a tremendous weak link in the new crowdfunding equity space,” says Thomas White, co-director of the entrepreneur incubator at American University’s Kogod School of Business. “I think a major red flag is that the company is looking to crowdfund for equity in the first place,” says John Torrens, professor of entrepreneurial practice at Syracuse University’s Martin J. Whitman School of Management, noting that “this would signal to me that more-sophisticated angels have looked at it and passed for some reason.” Skeptics and insiders urge investors to study up before taking the plunge. Specifically: Read everything you can, especially on the management, and don’t just rely on the portal. See how managers are compensated. It’s a problem if they can boost their pay out of the money raised by the crowdfunding campaign, Mr. Seward says, noting that the better deals divide the first profits among investors before the managers get anything. Know whether your shares will have voting rights. While private placements through friends and family or brokerages often do include voting rights, crowdfunding deals generally do not, and in fact portals use this as a selling point to startups. Investors are wise to find out if they’ll have any voice or recourse if they’re dissatisfied with management. Because of the risks, experts warn against dreams of riches. Be prepared to tie your money up for five to 10 years, and don’t bet the children’s college funds, Rampton advises, adding, “Nine out of 10 companies fail in the first five years.” Jeff Brown is a writer in Livingston, Mont.

James Covert,01262017,MarketWatch,01192017,"Published: Jan 19, 2017 8:05 p.m. ET Billionaire venture capitalist said to be in contention, decision could come soon By Tech billionaire Peter Thiel has been in talks to become U.S. Ambassador to Germany for the Trump administration, sources told The New York Post. The Trump team could fill the top diplomatic post in Berlin as soon as this week, sources said. It couldn’t immediately be confirmed, however, whether Thiel is still in the running. Rumors of Thiel’s candidacy for the cushy job have circulated from Europe to Silicon Valley since the holiday season, even as Thiel has repeatedly denied in interviews that he’s interested in a full-time government position. “No decisions have been made,” Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The Post, declining to comment further. A spokesman for Thiel didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment Thursday. Thiel’s talks for the diplomatic post come amid speculation he might run for governor of California. But one source downplayed the idea, opining that “he could never win.” Another said, meanwhile, that Berlin might be a “stepping stone” for such an ambition. Chatter that Thiel was “likely” to become German ambassador has rippled through tech and government circles in Berlin in recent weeks, according to a source. “At first I thought it was silly,” one Silicon Valley insider told The Post. “But maybe it’s a good way for him to get away, which somebody said he wouldn’t mind doing, given all the negative energy he faced.” Thiel got blasted for backing Trump during the election season by the left-leaning tech crowd, which has bristled at, among other things, the president-elect’s threats on immigration. The tone changed last month, however, when titans including Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Larry Page, Apple’s Tim Cook and Tesla’s Elon Musk flocked to a summit with the president-elect at Trump Tower that was organized by Thiel. Born in West Germany to German parents before he was brought to the U.S. as a toddler, Thiel also speaks German. Although he has mainly focused on US tech as an investor, Thiel has long warned U.S. tech companies about growing antitrust sentiment in Europe. Earlier this week, Trump ruffled feathers in Germany as he threatened border taxes for German auto makers who built cars in Mexico, called NATO “obsolete” and said the EU was just a “vehicle for Germany.” As talk has surfaced about Thiel’s possible assignment, some insiders have questioned whether it would be high-profile enough for the ambitious Thiel. Others, however, note that Trump has been aggressively cleaning house at U.S. embassies worldwide. Firings of all Obama-appointed ambassadors could portend a broader revamp, sources say. For example, the U.S.’s traditional hierarchy of ambassadorships, placing the U.K. at the top, with France and Japan traditionally the second and third most coveted posts, is in need of an overhaul, many agree. “Germany is running Europe now,” one source noted. On Thursday, Trump named Jets owner Woody Johnson as U.K. ambassador. This report originally appeared on NYPost.com. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

Jacob Bunge,01262017,MarketWatch,01192017,"Published: Jan 24, 2017 11:00 a.m. ET Farm groups had estimated the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership would have added $4.4 billion annually to the U.S. agricultural sector By Farm groups expressed dismay on Monday at President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from a Pacific trade agreement they were counting on to sell a glut of American agricultural products in new markets. “It is critical that the new administration begin work immediately to do all it can to develop new markets for U.S. agricultural goods,” said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. Farm groups estimated the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership would have added $4.4 billion annually to the U.S. agricultural sector, offering some relief to farmers during a multiyear slump in crop prices and farm profits. U.S. net farm income last year dropped to the lowest level since 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Many farmers backed Trump’s presidential bid, responding to his vows to roll back environmental and land-management regulations that many see infringing on their business. While Trump consistently criticized TPP on the campaign trail, farmers and agricultural groups hoped that he would renegotiate some aspects of it, or craft new and better trade deals in office.

The move has wiped £7.9 billion ($9.9 billion) off the company’s market capitalization, which is now around £30.18 billion, according to FactSet data. The plunge comes after BT issued a profit warning, saying a bigger-than-expected £530 million ($661 million) write-down related to accounting malpractices at its Italian business will hurt earnings for the next two years. BT first revealed details of its accounting errors back in October, estimating a charge of around £145 million. Since then an independent review by KPMG found that “the extent and complexity of inappropriate behavior in the Italian business were far greater than previously identified.” The misconduct led BT to overstate its Italian profit over a number of years. “The problem is that investors will fear that this is not the end — what else will be uncovered?

                                    NEU, -1.48% Rett syndrome is a rare condition affecting about one in 10,000 girls that’s caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. Symptoms include motor and cognitive impairments, seizures and anxiety, and many of those affected die young. Many in the Rett syndrome community are looking in the long term to gene therapy for a treatment. But having a drug that works across the broad spectrum of symptoms — as opposed to taking medications for each one — is a more near-term goal, said Gordy Rich, the Rett foundation’s chief operating officer. Rich is also a Rett parent. The prospect of a more comprehensive medication for his 22-year-old daughter is “life-altering,” he said. “When my daughter was diagnosed there was no known cause and no known cure,” Rich said. Five clinical trials being underway means “to all parents, this is really the most incredible time... We’ll have options for our girls that can improve their quality of life.” Related:  Anavex stock jumps after company says Biogen will test lead drug candidate Anavex 2-73, which was designated as an orphan drug for Rett syndrome last spring — which grants companies developing rare diseases various development and commercial incentives— may have that potential. The 12-week trial — which will cost about $1 million total and enroll between 50 and 80 patients — will measure the drug’s effect on seizure reduction, cognitive impairment, mood disorder, autistic behavior and anxiety, Christopher Missling, president and chief executive officer of Anavex, told MarketWatch. The drug was selected based on its results in mice, where it addressed a number of symptoms, Rich said. “To us that’s very exciting, and we want to move as many of the compounds into clinical trials so we can get treatments on the path to a cure,” he said. The trial is expected to begin this year, with data possibly coming out by the end of the year, Missling said. Anavex’s relationship with the foundation will also assist in enrolling patients in the trial, which should help hasten trial results, he said. Anavex 2-73 is also being tested in other areas, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism and more.

What to look for: PayPal is expected to beat earnings expectations, which James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt, attributes to growth in the company’s total payment volume, followed by slight growth in active accounts and in payments frequency per account. Still, analysts believe sentiment on the stock is mixed and may remain mixed unless there are clear signs of a catalyst, such as growth in PayPal’s payment app, Venmo, or in another of its acquisitions, payment processor Braintree. “While we believe PayPal can show margin expansion over time, management may need to definitively prove this if it wants to put bearish sentiment to rest,” said Paul Condra, an analyst with Credit Suisse. During the call, Cakmak said he will be looking for new opportunities such as an expansion of Pay with Venmo, which allows users to pay with the Venmo app within other apps and at select retailers, as well as new partnerships with card issuers and progress in offline payments with PayPal. Offline payments took off in 2016 when PayPal struck deals with both Visa and MasterCard, allowing consumers to use PayPal to pay at stores. Cakmak had upgraded PayPal to buy from neutral earlier this month on the belief that its estimates and valuation could increase thanks to an improvement in the regulatory environment as well as the potential for more deals with card issuers and a consumer trend toward cashless payments.

,02022017,Reuters,01262017,"SAN FRANCISCO - In less than a year, Amazon’s combination of the Echo speaker system and the Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant has come close to delivering on the elusive promise of easy-to-use technology that can control gadgets in the home with a few spoken words. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the “connected home” niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers’ lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. “When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed [software] for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn’t disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. “The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month,” she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple’s Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple’s approach. To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple’s system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an 50 cents to $2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can’t always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known “Star Wars” toys, but it couldn’t use that factory for HomeKit products. “They’re a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they’re not [Apple] certified,” said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren’t allowed to say publicly that they’re pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it’s worth it. “They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn’t find in our testing,” said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. “We know that after we have the certification that it’s rock solid.” Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the “Works with Alexa” label -which isn’t required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon’s website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the “Works with Alexa” label within 10 days. Apple’s approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you’re outside the house.) “It also makes for a better user experience,” notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. “You’ll experience some latency if you’re always having to bounce off the cloud” as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget’s companion app first, set up the device, then add a “skill” to Alexa in the Alexa app. Apple’s ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the U.S. “If that experience isn’t good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad,” said John Neilson, the company’s chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can’t guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it’s not clear whether Apple’s elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon’s widening lead. “The danger I see for Apple and the home is they’re assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare,” said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. “I wouldn’t say that’s certain yet.” ","

,02022017,Reuters,01262017,"Each of the two new orders, known as national security letters (NSLs), specifically request a type of data known as electronic communication transaction records, which can include some email header data and browsing history, among other information. In doing so, the orders bolster the belief among privacy advocates that the FBI has routinely used NSLs to seek internet records beyond the limitations set down in a 2008 Justice Department legal memo, which concluded such orders should be constrained to phone billing records. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI inspector general report from 2014 indicated that it disagreed with the memo’s guidance. In a blog post announcing the two NSL disclosures, Twitter said it did not hand over all the information the FBI requested. “While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice,” Elizabeth Banker, associate general counsel at Twitter, wrote. The identity of the accounts sought by the FBI are redacted in both of the NSLs. Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the orders disclosed Friday were among a small handful of those publicly released that show the FBI continues to ask for internet records despite the 2008 guidance. “This is an ongoing practice and it is significantly beyond the scope of what is intended,” said Crocker, whose organization is challenging the constitutionality of NSLs in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twitter has also sued the government to more freely discuss NSLs. National security letters are a type of government order for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. They have been available as a law enforcement tool since the 1970s, but their frequency and breadth expanded dramatically under the USA Patriot Act, which was passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Tens of thousands of NSLs are issued annually. In June of last year the U.S. Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-backed proposal to expand the kinds of telephone and internet records the FBI could request under an NSL to include senders and recipients of emails, some information about websites a person visits and social media log-in data. The legislation failed amid opposition from some major technology companies and civil liberties advocates, but lawmakers have said they intend to pursue the expansion again.

,02022017,Reuters,01262017,"(Reuters) - With investment firms cutting costs and portfolio managers combating a barrage of information, financial research shops around the globe are looking for new ways to keep their product relevant. A raft of startups have launched to support that effort, offering tools that can use Google search data to get an edge on retail sales, deploy drones to examine oil supplies or allow investors to rank analysts and bid on their reports, like a Netflix or eBay of research. Whether these innovations will lead to smarter investments, or be used widely enough to prop up research budgets, is yet to be seen. But the startups are forming alliances with banks, brokerages and investors by the dozen. People who use and sell the tools say the trend is changing how research is financed, distributed and consumed for the first time in decades. “We are coming up on a very different age for equity research,” said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research. Investors now see research as a product that must stand on its own rather than a freebie offered as part of a broader relationship with an investment bank, Sokolin said. Technology can improve the quality and distribution of research, he said. A few factors are driving the changes. Asset managers are under enormous pressure to cut fees due to weak returns and competition from low-cost options like index funds. The fee squeeze is making firms more selective about how they spend research dollars. At the same time, the long-running practice of paying for research through trading commissions is being upended by new regulations in Europe, known as the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II. Part of the sprawling overhaul will force investors in the European Union to pay for research directly. Global asset managers are expected to “unbundle” payments in other regions as well. Perhaps most importantly, investors say they are sick of their inboxes piling up with run-of-the-mill reports each day. At a time when people share snippets of information through WhatsApp and Slack and a tweet can move a stock in seconds, sharing loads of PDF files through email is not only passé, but makes it hard to know what is worth reading, industry sources said. “There are 40 analysts just covering Apple: how do you find the insight?” said Alap Shah, chief executive of Sentieo, a San Francisco-based startup that aggregates information about publicly traded companies. Before launching Sentieo in late 2011, Shah was an analyst at Citadel LLC, where he received hundreds of research reports a day. It was difficult to search through documents for important information, collate those details into one place and access them when he was not in front of his office computer, he said. Those frustrations led Shah to set up Sentieo, which allows users to search reports by a stock ticker or hashtagged phrase like #revenuegrowth. They can also highlight key passages and access information remotely. Shah says 200 firms are now using Sentieo, including Longhorn Asset Management LLC and JNK Securities Corp. Other startups are going beyond aggregation. Customers of London-based StockViews can rate analysts with stars the way they might rate a show on Netflix, and request custom-made research “on demand.” Edinburgh-based Electronic Research Interchange (ERIC) allows fund managers to bid on analyst reports the way shoppers do on eBay. Another company, Orbital Insight, uses satellites and drones to collect data that can affect a variety of stocks, like how much oil is stored in tanks. In a recent report, JPMorgan Chase & Co telecommunications analyst Rod Hall drew on Orbital Insight research to tell investors there were fewer cars parked at large electronics stores following the U.S. presidential election, which might lead to lower smartphone sales. Wall Street banks say they are also using their own techniques to modernize research. In interviews, executives highlighted data-crunching as a particular focus to win more business from funds that rely on algorithms to make investment decisions. Morgan Stanley’s research team employs 30 data scientists in a unit called AlphaWise to support research from traditional stock analysts. Last year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc analysts used data from Google Trends and social media monitoring firm Crimson Hexagon to conclude that Nintendo Co Ltd’s Pokemon Go was so popular it would affect future games it releases. “Ten years ago, we would have interviewed consumers in a mall to figure out what the hottest fashion trends are,” said Simon Bound, head of research at Morgan Stanley. “Now we will also use big data techniques and machine learning.” For a graphic on equity commissions and ""unbundling"" click here ","

,02022017,Reuters,01262017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A decade after its founding as a file-sharing business, Dropbox Inc is trying to become a new kind of company. On Monday, the highly valued digital storage firm unveiled two new products - file synch and content collaboration tools - as part of a years-long effort to build up its business offerings. The effort appears to have bolstered the company’s bottom line. Dropbox Chief Executive Officer Drew Houston said on Monday the company is projected to surpass $1 billion in annual  revenue. “We fundamentally redesigned Dropbox from the ground up,” Houston said. In its strategy switch, however, Dropbox continues to face stiff competition in an already crowded market, and must fight for hotly contested business accounts even as it tries to keep a foothold in the consumer market. “Dropbox is clearly moving in this direction but still has some catch-up to do,” said Forrester analyst Cheryl McKinnon. At an event in San Francisco on Monday, Dropbox unveiled Smart Sync, a feature that allows users to see and access all of their files, whether stored in the cloud or on a local hard drive, from their desktop. Smart Sync is part of Dropbox Business, which requires companies to pay a fee based on the number of employees who use it. Dropbox also rolled out Dropbox Paper - which allows groups to create, edit and collaborate on projects in a single workspace - to users globally and in 21 languages. “Where we see the most important problems to solve are certainly around workplace productivity and collaboration,” Rob Baesman, Dropbox senior product management director, said in an interview. “A lot of investments we make are to solve those challenges.” The company also announced an array of new features and upgrades all aimed at better employee collaboration and   efficiency. Dropbox says about 200,000 of its 500 million users are businesses that are paying customers, about double the number two years ago. Many of Dropbox’s users pay nothing. It remains to be seen whether Dropbox can serve both businesses and consumers well enough to justify its $10 billion valuation, based on the price tag it earned in its last round of private financing. Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, said it was “both massively important and massively hard” to make deals with large corporations and government agencies that provide substantial recurring revenue. “It only happens if you decide to fully focus on it,” Levie said. Sequoia Capital venture investor Bryan Schreier, who led the firm’s investment into Dropbox, said its business strategy was working. “This is the fastest growing SaaS (software-as-a-service) company we have ever worked with,” Schreier said. Dropbox has raised more than $600 million from venture capitalists and private investors, and some IPO advisers say the company’s public market debut could come as soon as this year. Public cloud computing companies are trading at 4.9 times   revenue, on average, according to data from Bessemer Venture Partners. According to that standard, Dropbox would have to reach roughly $2 billion a year in sales to justify its current valuation. With $1 billion in expected annual revenue, Dropbox is two-and-a-half times the size of Box, which has about $400 million in annual revenue. ","

,02022017,Reuters,01262017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla sued the former head of its Autopilot system on Thursday, alleging the executive tried to recruit Tesla engineers for his new venture with the ex-head of Google’s self-driving program while still working at the electric car company. The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court of California for Santa Clara County, underscores the competitive landscape in Silicon Valley’s automotive sector, where Tesla, established carmakers and unknown start-ups are all battling to be first to bring self-driving to the masses. Tesla has been at the vanguard of innovation. Its high-profile Autopilot allows cars to steer and stay in their lanes without hands on the wheel in certain circumstances. Telsa, citing what it called a “get-rich-quick environment” in the sector, listed in the complaint the recent acquisition by General Motors of Cruise Automation in July for nearly $1 billion, suggesting Anderson and Urmson sought the same goal with their new Silicon Valley company, Aurora Innovation. Urmson and Aurora Innovation are also named as co-defendants in the lawsuit, which alleges breach of contract and other civil claims. Tesla is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages. Aurora said the lawsuit was without merit and “reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition.” “This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business,” Aurora said in a statement. The lawsuit alleges that Anderson also downloaded “some of Tesla’s most competitively sensitive information” to his laptop, then erased and doctored files and wiped his iPhone of data “in an attempt to conceal his misdeeds.” Tesla said Anderson was terminated on Jan. 4.

The program, “Countering Violent Extremism,” or CVE, would be changed to “Countering Islamic Extremism” or “Countering Radical Islamic Extremism,” the sources said, and would no longer target groups such as white supremacists who have also carried out bombings and shootings in the United States. MORE For hardline West Bank settlers, Jared Kushner's their man Iranians fear attacks and economic isolation as Trump talks tough Republicans wrestle with effort to cut Obamacare Such a change would reflect Trump’s election campaign rhetoric and criticism of former President Barack Obama for being weak in the fight against Islamic State and for refusing to use the phrase “radical Islam” in describing it. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in several countries. Some proponents of the program fear that rebranding it could make it more difficult for the government to work with Muslims already hesitant to trust the new administration, particularly after Trump issued an executive order last Friday temporarily blocking travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries. WATCH Uber CEO quits Trump advisory board Still, the CVE program, which focuses on U.S. residents and is separate from a military effort to fight extremism online, has been criticized even by some supporters as ineffective. A source who has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the program said Trump transition team members first met with a CVE task force in December and floated the idea of changing the name and focus. In a meeting last Thursday attended by senior staff for DHS Secretary John Kelly, government employees were asked to defend why they chose certain community organizations as recipients of CVE program grants, said the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. Although CVE funding has been appropriated by Congress and the grant recipients were notified in the final days of the Obama administration, the money still may not go out the door, the source said, adding that Kelly is reviewing the matter. The department declined comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Some Republicans in Congress have long assailed the program as politically correct and ineffective, asserting that singling out and using the term “radical Islam” as the trigger for many violent attacks would help focus deterrence efforts. Others counter that branding the problem as “radical Islam” would only serve to alienate more than three million Americans who practice Islam peacefully. Many community groups, meanwhile, had already been cautious about the program, partly over concerns that it could double as a surveillance tool for law enforcement. Hoda Hawa, director of policy for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said she was told last week by people within DHS that there was a push to refocus the CVE effort from tackling all violent ideology to only Islamist extremism. “That is concerning for us because they are targeting a faith group and casting it under a net of suspicion,” she said. Another source familiar with the matter was told last week by a DHS official that a name change would take place. Three other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such plans had been discussed but were unable to attest whether they had been finalized. The Obama administration sought to foster relationships with community groups to engage them in the counterterrorism effort. In 2016, Congress appropriated $10 million in grants for CVE efforts and DHS awarded the first round of grants on Jan. 13, a week before Trump was inaugurated. Among those approved were local governments, city police departments, universities and non-profit organizations. In addition to organizations dedicated to combating Islamic State’s recruitment in the United States, grants also went to Life After Hate, which rehabilitates former neo-Nazis and other domestic extremists. Just in the past two years, authorities blamed radical and violent ideologies as the motives for a white supremacist’s shooting rampage inside a historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina and Islamist militants for shootings and bombings in California, Florida and New York. One grant recipient, Leaders Advancing & Helping Communities, a Michigan-based group led by Lebanese-Americans, has declined a $500,000 DHS grant it had sought, according to an email the group sent that was seen by Reuters. A representative for the group confirmed the grant had been rejected but declined further comment. “Given the current political climate and cause for concern, LAHC has chosen to decline the award,” said the email, which was sent last Thursday, a day before Trump issued his immigration order, which was condemned at home and abroad as discriminating against Muslims while the White House said it was to “to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals.” ","

,02022017,Reuters,01262017,"The payments processor predicted its first-quarter revenue would be roughly in line with analyst expectations, with flat to slightly better operating margins for the full year. PayPal gave the guidance in reporting a 17 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue that mirrored Wall Street expectations. Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said fourth-quarter results were hurt by currency movements, and he expected those pressures to continue throughout the year. Paypal stock fell 2.4 percent in after hours trading to $40.49. Chief Executive Dan Schulman said competition is heating up in mobile payments, and investing in PayPal’s own offerings has become “increasingly important” to gain an advantage over rivals. “Payments are rapidly digitizing,” he said. “Mobile is redefining the face of retail.” Ant, the world’s largest financial-technology company, has been expanding at home and overseas as it prepares for a planned initial public offering later this year. To fend off competition, PayPal has been expanding its network of strategic partnerships and launching or acquiring new services. PayPal is also trying to improve its core offering by adding features like One Touch, which allows customers to pay with a single click. It now has more than 5 million active merchant accounts offering the tool. During the quarter, PayPal’s mobile payments rose 53 percent, to $31 billion. Payment volumes at Venmo, a mobile peer-to-peer payment platform popular with younger costumers surged 126 percent to $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter. PayPal’s total payments volume rose 22 percent to $99 billion. Active customer accounts rose 10 percent to 197 million, beating research firm FactSet StreetAccount’s estimate of 196.5 million. Schulman said growth in mobile payments and new customer accounts helped boost fourth-quarter revenue to $3 billion, up 17 percent compared with a year earlier, the same as what analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected. The company expects first-quarter revenue to land in a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.95 billion, on average. Net income rose to $390 million, or 32 cents per share, from $367 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 42 cents per share. PayPal operates in many geographic markets around the globe, with half of its revenue coming from overseas. It tries to hedge against currency-related losses using financial instruments. But in the fourth-quarter, declines in the euro and Australian dollar hurt PayPal’s results, Rainey said. The company expects more pain this year as it adjusts its currency positions, especially in the first half, he added. PayPal is on its second stint as a public company after separating from eBay in 2015. ","

(GOOGL) fell in after-hours trading after the company failed to beat analyst estimates for its earnings. The stock is currently 1.40% lower in pre-market trading. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company reported revenue of $26 billion, an increase of 22% from the previous year's figures, and earnings per share of $9.36. Analysts' expectations called for revenue of $25.23 billion and EPS of $9.64. The company's earnings took a hit from two primary factors. First, its cost of revenue as a share of total revenue increased by 3% to 41%. Second, Google's effective tax rate increased in the past year. According to Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat, the company's tax rate rose to 19% for the entire year from 5% in 2015. She said the tax rate was higher due to ""geographic mix"" and ""certain discrete tax changes in the U.S."" (See also: Will Google and Apple's Tax Problems Affect Their Bottom Line?) According to business website Marketwatch, ""discrete tax changes"" could refer to changes in laws relating to stock-based compensation, which cost the company almost $600 million in increased taxes. Alphabet has decided not to exclude stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP​ results starting with its next earnings results. Alphabet attributed revenue growth to its subsidiary Google's mobile search and video platform YouTube. With revenue of $25.8 billion, Google was responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet’s revenue. While the aggregate paid clicks on Google properties, which account for the bulk of its revenues, increased by 43% as compared with the previous year's figures, the average cost per click declined by 15%.

Chris Ciaccia,02022017,Investopedia,01262017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Facebook Inc. (FB) has made a huge bet on trying to own the next computing platform, virtual reality, as it seeks to usher in a new wave of connectivity and computing. With the company’s latest hire, the push could explode. In a post to his Facebook account, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that former Xiaomi executive, Hugo Barra, would be joining the company as Vice President of Virtual Reality. Barra is well-known and respected in Silicon Valley for a number of reasons, including his role as the public face of Android while at Google (GOOGL). However, it’s his role at Xiaomi Inc., the Chinese consumer electronics company, that may wind up being most critical. (See also: Facebook Hires Google Alum Hugo Barra As VR Chief (FB, GOOG).) While at Xiaomi, Barra has been credited with helping lead the company’s guerilla marketing efforts and turning products such as the Mi3 and Redmi smartphones into hits. Though Xiaomi has experienced some recent hiccups, it’s still turned itself into a company valued at $45 billion. In 2015, it sold more than 70 million phones and in the second-quarter of 2016, Xiaomi sold 15.5 million smartphones, good for fifth place worldwide. Those sales figures are due in part to Barra, who gave credibility to Xiaomi, as a product spokesman and for his ability to demonstrate great technology could be purchased cheaply. Xiaomi sells its phones nearly at cost and makes money on accessories, apps, smart-home products, videos and other products. By contrast, Oculus’s virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift, is expensive and often requires a customer upgrading their PC. In total, getting an Oculus virtual reality experience could cost as much $1,500, which has impacted sales. The company is working on a headset that doesn’t need to be connected to a computer and will be cheaper than the existing Rift, but in the meantime, companies like HTC Inc., Samsung Inc., Sony Inc. and others are leapfrogging Facebook and Oculus. The market, for both augmented and virtual reality, is expected to reach $162 billion by 2020, up from $5.2 billion in 2016, according to research firm IDC. That’s an enormous opportunity not something Facebook and Oculus can afford to sit back on. By hiring Barra and giving him such a public endorsement, it helps shifts notice back to Facebook. According to 01consulting, Facebook has lost the lead to Sony for VR headsets sales, owning just 11% of the market, compared to 30% for Sony. With cheap products, Samsung and HTC have managed to capture 13% of the market, with Google owning 8%, due in large part to its Daydream initiatives. Facebook can not afford to lose any more ground to these competitors and that’s before Apple eventually gets into the headset/glasses market. (See also: Zuckerberg Questioned in Trial Over VR Technology (FB).) With his past experience at Google and Xiaomi, Barra provides credibility for making Facebook’s offerings for the masses, not just the first adopters or the very wealthy.

Anita Balakrishnan,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Google-parent Alphabet reported quarterly earnings that missed analysts' estimates on Thursday, as it earned less per click on its properties. The company's costs also ticked higher, as it invested in talent and the core business. Revenue topped expectations, led by YouTube and mobile search, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a statement. But a Google representative told CNBC that YouTube has been slower to pick up the slack from Google's other advertising properties. The company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of $9.36, adjusted and excluding items, on revenues of $26.06 billion. Analysts expect Google-parent Alphabet to report earnings of about $9.64 per Class A share on $25.26 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. Shares fell about 3 percent in after-hours trading. Cost of revenues rose from a year ago to 41 percent of revenues, up from 38 percent a year ago. The company's traffic aquisition costs hit $4.8 billion during the quarter, up from a year ago and higher than the $4.7 billion expected by a StreetAccount estimate. Alphabet also reporting a tax-charge related to stock-based compensation of $586 million, higher than the $316 million a year ago. Google's costs-per-click — the amount it gets from advertisers— fell 16 percent year over year, more than the 11 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates. ""The core of Alphabet's business is still about both Google's search and YouTube's revenues,"" Forrester analyst Thomas Husson told CNBC in a statement. ""The majority of these revenues derive from mobile, and the lower cost-per-click here should be compensated by a higher volume. I'd argue that the stability of Google's revenue in the next two to three years will depend on their ability to maintain the growth of mobile revenues. While there might be slower growth, the mid-term prospect looks good given the fact that advertisers will wake up to the mobile Web opportunity after having focused too much on mobile apps."" The results hinge on Google's new advertising formats, like promoted pins in Maps, and progress monetizing YouTube. Investors will listen closely to the quarterly conference call for any signs that YouTube, like rival Facebook, is closing in on the maximum number of ads its customers will tolerate. Google did not share specifics on the holiday season sales of the new Pixel phone and Google Home, its competitor to Amazon's Echo. Neil Doshi, managing director at Mizuho Securities, estimated that Google sold about 1 million Pixels during the quarter. CEO Sundar Pichai told investors that the company was thrilled with the reception of the Pixel, and that the Google Home was a very popular present for the holidays. Earnings are also a chance for chief financial officer Ruth Porat to share progress on reigning in the company's ""other bets"" category, which includes Nest home automation products, venture investments and self-driving car technology (recently renamed Waymo). The company reported ""other bets"" revenue of $262 million for the fourth quarter, much higher than the $150 million in the year ago period.

Arjun Kharpal,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Google, Amazon and Apple have touted the potential of voice assistants recently, but investors are still scratching their heads over how they will make money from the technology. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, offered a glimpse into the search giant's thinking during an earnings call on Thursday. In response to a question on how voice search can be monetized, he suggested that Google Assistant – its own voice feature – needs to be thought about as a part of a user's overall search journey. This will lock people into Google's ecosystem of services. ""I would encourage you to think about it as, from a user's standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of the total journey they are on. So when we think about something like the Google Assistant we think about it as an ongoing conversation with our users across different contexts,"" Pichai said. ""So they may ask a question on voice, later when they pick up their phone they want continuity, so we think of this as an end-to-end thing. And all of this means users engage more with us, more with computing, and look for more information and I think the trends we see are positive. So we think about it from a long term perspective, so I see more opportunity than challenge when I think about voice search."" Google Assistant was unveiled towards the end of last year and is currently integrated into the company's Pixel smartphones, as well as the Google Home device – a smart connected speaker similar to Amazon's Echo. No official sales figures about Google Home have been released but Pichai said it had a ""strong quarter"" and the search giant is planning ""to invest a lot"" in the device this year. The CEO admitted that it is ""very early days"" for voice search but offered a vision for how it would manifest across different platforms. ""I think it's a very natural way for users to interact. We think it will be one mode. Users will have many different ways by which they interact with computing. And for voice … We expect voice to work across many different contexts so we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and trying to drive that ecosystem that way and we want Google to be there for users when they need it,"" Pichai said. Google's strategy is very similar to what Amazon is looking to achieve with Alexa, its own voice assistant. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this month, Alexa stole the show  as Amazon announced integrations with a number of companies and devices from Ford cars to LG's new refrigerators. The tactic for Amazon is to almost become the operating system for the so-called Internet of Things (IOT) – the plethora of devices being connected to the internet. Even though Amazon doesn't make the devices, the fact that they are powered by Alexa allows the e-commerce giant to interact with customers and offer services. Google's advantage is that nearly 9 in every 10 smartphones run its Android operating system (OS), according to research firm Strategy Analytics, so it has a large user base to push Assistant to. Still, Pichai admits that there is still work to do when it comes to voice search, but he is bullish on the future. ""I think there's a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. This is the core area where we have invested in for the very long term and so I feel very comfortable about how this will play out in the future,"" Pichai said.

A person at the rally told CNBC that Google CEO Sundar Pichai and cofounder Sergey Brin spoke there, and Brin expressed gratitude for being admitted to the United States from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Here's a picture of Pichai and Brin speaking. The demonstration was organized by employees, and more than 2,000 attended, according to a person who was there. The demonstration came after a executive order restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority nations and indefinitely banning Syrian refugees spurred protests over the weekend at airports around the country. Google established a $4 million fund for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, International Rescue Committee, UNHCR and American Civil Liberties Union, (one of the main organizations fighting the ban). The keynote speaker at Google's Mountain View headquarters was Soufi Esmaeilzadeh, a product manager on Google Assistant, who was on a plane from San Francisco to Zurich when rumors began to leak that the executive order would be signed.

Alphabet, which had close ties to the Obama administration, has so far avoided antitrust charges, but faces greater risk under the incoming as yet unnamed FTC Chairman, said Seth Bloom, founder of Bloom Strategic Counsel on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" (Bloom counts Google rival Yelp as a client.) Google has at least 80 percent market share in search. Bloom, a former general counsel to the senate antitrust committee, says the FTC does have a case against Google for an antitrust investigation. In late 2012 FTC staff found Google was behaving like a monopolist but later dropped the case, he noted. Since then, the European Commission bought antitrust charges which accuse Google of unfairly prioritizing its shopping service in search results, blocking rivals in search advertising and using its Android mobile operating system to thwart the competition. ""Antitrust is highly discretionary and the antitrust laws in the U.S. are rather vague and it really depends on who is doing the antitrust enforcement, and that is the big unknown as we go forward,"" said Bloom. Bloom's advice to Alphabet's general counsel is to change its search practices, particularly in Europe, but also in the U.S. ""You ought to be concerned about who might be nominated to be Chair of the FTC, for example"" he said. ""Some of the people who have been floated have been people who have expressed concerns about Google in the past and we'll have to see how that goes."" But Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali is less concerned. ""As a user, you are literally a click away from switching to [Microsoft] Bing, you are literally a click away from switching to Yahoo search,"" Squali told CNBC. ""The fact that they have 80 percent of search revenues speaks more about the superiority of their search algorithm, of their search results and of their relevancy to the advertisers than anything else."" Google remains a top pick for Cantor Fitzgerald for 2017. The company's recent earnings report showed it pulled in revenues of $26.06 billion in the December quarter and is successfully diversifying its business, he said.

Last year the U.S. government made a historic ruling to allow the company to engage in peaceful commercial lunar exploration and discovery following consultations with the FAA, White House, State Department and NASA. The company's challenge now is to meet the XPRIZE requirement: Make a soft landing on the moon, travel 500 meters across its surface, and transmit high-definition video and images back to Earth. All tasks must be done before the end of this year. According to co-founder and chairman Naveen Jain, ""Moon Express now has all the capital it needs to land its small robotic spacecraft on the surface of the moon in November or December of 2017."" The company's goal is twofold: 1)  mine the moon for valuable resources, such as Helium-3, gold, platinum group metals, rare earth metals and water; and 2) help researchers develop human space colonies for future generations. The ability to mine Helium-3 could have a tremendous impact on Earth and the environment. Helium-3 is a clean, non-radioactive energy source that could potentially power nuclear fusion reactors. Theoretically, a relatively small amount could produce enough clean fuel to power entire industries, if not the entire planet. It's for this reason that the Chinese have also announced plans to mine Helium-3 on the moon. Another draw is tapping water on the moon's surface. Hydrogen and oxygen can then be separated to create rocket fuel for deep-space missions to Mars and beyond. Essentially, the moon can serve as a fueling station for spacecraft.

""Just before the presidential election, NASA released a call for concepts for payloads to the moon to be delivered by private companies. That shows a rising tide of interest in the moon by our nation's space industry."" Thanks to a unique public-private partnership with NASA, Moon Express has access to NASA engineering expertise. It has licensed space launch complexes 17 and 18 at Cape Canaveral from the U.S. Air Force. The six-year-old start-up with a team of 30 already has contracts for payloads from the private sector and scientific community. They include the delivery of the international lunar observatory on the moon, retroreflector arrays to test principles of Einstein's general relativity theory and lunar geology, and human remains and DNA samples for space burial from Celestis. In addition, Moon Express hopes to snare a contract for a payload from NASA for its first mission, said Richards. Moon Express has contracted five electron rockets from New Zealand-based launch provider Rocket Lab for its missions. In the future, it plans to be rocket agnostic and use a variety of rocket providers. European Space Agency has also expressed interest in partnering with Moon Express. ESA has plans to develop lunar colonies in the future. Now the race is on to see who will win the Google Lunar XPRIZE and what player will land on the moon first. Contenders include SpaceIL from Israel, Team Inus from India and international team Synergy Moon. At the same time, superpowers are busy preparing their own missions. China has unveiled plans to visit the moon's north and south poles late this year and return to Earth with rock samples. In 2018 it plans to send its Chang'e-4 lander to the dark side of the moon to carry out patrolling surveys. At the same time, Russia's Roscosmos is planning a manned space exploration base on the moon. As Naveen explains, ""he and his partners are just a group of entrepreneurs trying to move humanity forward. We want to leave a legacy for future generations.""

Harriet Taylor,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"After slamming Trump's actions and scrambling to protect their own employees, tech companies extended support to others impacted by President Trump's entry ban on noncitizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries, which remained in effect on Sunday. Tech giants, start-ups and many of the industry's power players have pledged support for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the order, and joined airport protesters in San Francisco and New York. Immigrants are part of the industry's life blood. They have co-founded some of the Valley's most successful companies including Google, Facebook, eBay and Yahoo and make up a significant portion of the Valley's workforce. The National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank, found in March that immigrants had started more than half of the current crop of U.S start-ups whose values topped $1 billion. Google co-founder and president of Alphabet Sergey Brin, who immigrated to the U.S. from the Soviet Union, joined protesters at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday night to show his personal support for refugees and immigrants and was snapped by Forbes writer Ryan Mac, whose tweet was widely shared. Ryan tweet Microsoft employees on Sunday urged each other on Twitter to take advantage of a reported offer by the tech giant to 100 percent match employee donations to the ACLU. Ride-hailing company Lyft co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years ""to defend our constitution,"" they said in a blog post Sunday. The company's New York City general manager Vipul Patel joined demonstrators at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Saturday night. At its peak, the JFK protest lined both sides of the passenger pickup lane at Terminal 4 and united travelers and drivers alike, he told CNBC said via email. ""Civil liberties matter to us a great deal,"" he wrote. Patel is a former lawyer and first-generation immigrant and rarely participates in public protests, he wrote. He joined the Women's March in Washington last week, his first march in over a decade, and joined a Manhattan rally on Sunday. The issues at stake matter to him both personally and professionally, he told CNBC. ""Our driver base in New York City is largely composed of immigrants, many of them Muslim,"" wrote Patel. ""I want to stand with them in whatever way I can."" Stewart Butterfield, chief executive officer of workplace app Slack, and investor Chris Sacca of Lowercase Capital were among a number of tech leaders matching individual donations to the ACLU. 
Tweet. Sacca, who in a December Recode story loudly criticized leaders from tech's biggest companies for meeting with the president, tweeted that he could barely keep up with the response and continued to increase the amount he said he would donate. Tweet Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, in a tweet and Facebook post Saturday night, said the home-sharing company would use its 3 million listings to help provide free housing to refugees and anyone outside their home country who is denied entry to the U.S. Tweet ""Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right, and we must stand with those who are affected,"" Chesky wrote on Facebook.

Anita Balakrishnan,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Google may dominate digital advertising now, but one Wall Street analyst said its unchallenged reign might be coming to an end. Products like Amazon Alexa — which allows purchases by voice — and digital payments like Apple Pay are likely to disrupt the advertising industry and provide new methods for businesses to drive consumer spending, James Dix, securities analyst at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report"" on Thursday. That could especially impact Google's hallmark business, search, Dix said. ""There's fundamental challenges to search's business model,"" Dix said. ""Search is roughly half of the digital ad market. Is that going to be more or less in five years? It would seem as though its going to be tough for it to go up in market share. Fundamentally, that's a very high margin advertising product."" Dix is the only analyst listed in FactSet with a ""sell"" rating on shares of Google-parent Alphabet. His price target, $700 a share, is well below Thursday's price of around $852 a share, and the average target price of $966.29, from analysts surveyed by FactSet. ""The market needs more people who think the market is actually pricing in the expectations,"" Dix said. The company will report earnings Thursday after the bell, when Wall Street is expecting adjusted earnings of $9.64 per Class A share on revenue of $25.23 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. That would be up from a year ago, when the company reported $8.67 per share on revenue of $21.33 billion. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said he, too, expects the ""device"" to fade away in the future, with new mediums like artifical intelligence taking over.

Robert Ferris,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Google's self-driving car project, now called Waymo, made some big strides during 2016, according to a report from the company published by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. California requires would-be self-driving car manufacturers to apply to the state's autonomous vehicle testing program and submit regular reports if they want to test their cars on public roads in the state. Several companies participate, including major car brands, suppliers, and hopefuls. Waymo has been submitting reports since at least 2015. The report published Wednesday lists the number of times a driver had to take over for the autonomous system while driving — these are known as disengagements. Waymo's total number of disengagements per 1,000 miles of driving went from 0.8 in 2015 to 0.2 in 2016 — a precipitous drop. Most of these disengagements are not accidents, but they often represent times when a driver would have had to shut the system down to make some kind of fix. The drop in disengages shows that drivers need to interrupt the system less often — in other words, the company is refining the technology. Waymo's self-driving technology head, Dmitri Dolgov, said in a blog post Wednesday that the company has 2.5 million miles of autonomous driving on public roads, and that Waymo has ""been able to make dramatic improvements to our technology because we use each of these disengages to teach and refine our car,"" noting that the new disengagement numbers represent a four-fold improvement over the previous year. But its drop in disengagements suggests the Alphabet unit is improving its system. Dolgov noted that Waymo does most of its testing in ""complex"" environments, such as busy city streets, or near construction zones. This is by design: Waymo is trying to replicate the sorts of environments actual drivers are likely to encounter. Ten companies in total submitted disengagement reports for 2016, including Tesla, which briefly ran some tests in October of last year. It is worth noting that while Tesla's participation is limited, the company tests its (not fully autonomous) Autopilot driver assistance system in other ways, such as drawing on customer data, and testing cars at private facilities.

Adam Levy,02022017,Fool,01262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Google. Consumers are doing more and more web searches just by talking. And they're not just asking the digital assistants on their smartphones; they're also buying all-new devices, such as the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo and Google Home, to answer random queries. For Google, the subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), the new trend in search is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides another point for users to interact with its product. On the other, Google doesn't have a stranglehold on the device market, and it isn't clear how companies can monetize voice search with ads. Even as Google navigated the shift to mobile, it still fundamentally followed the same business model -- display ads within search results. That's not possible with voice searches. But Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't concerned. ""I see more opportunity than challenge, when I think about voice search,"" he told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. I wouldn't be so sure he doesn't have that backward. Google didn't provide any exact figures on the sales of its new Google Home device. Pichai did say that ""Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning,"" but that was as detailed as he got. RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggests that Google is getting outsold 10-to-1 by competitors such as Amazon Echo. That presents a real challenge for Google, because without control over the hardware, it has no control over the user interface. That means all those potential voice searches will go to someone else. Pichai points out that it's the very early days for devices such as Google Home. And Google does have one big advantage over Amazon and other competitors -- it's much better at search. ""When I look at what it would take to voice search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play,"" Pichai said on the call. To his credit, Google Home has outperformed Alexa in many head-to-head search reviews. But smart-speaker hardware is about more than search, and Amazon's Echo is capable of integrating with more devices and services than Google Home is. Google is certainly capable of overcoming that through more strategic partnerships, though. It just released a development kit for businesses to integrate with Google Home last month. One area that will be harder to overcome is how well Amazon Echo works for Amazon Prime members. With tens of millions of Prime members around the world, it creates a pretty big moat for Google Home to cross. Even if Google closes the gap in hardware sales, it still has to find a way to turn voice search into a business. Hardware sales won't move the needle for Alphabet, which generated over $90 billion in revenue last year. What's more, Google has to sell the hardware near cost because its biggest competitor, Amazon, does the same. The margins on a Google Home device don't even come close to Google's 31% operating margin in the fourth quarter. If Google is going to make some real money off of voice search, it needs to go beyond just getting its devices into people's homes. Google's best idea so far is to facilitate commerce through voice search. But if there's one company that has Google's number in e-commerce search, it's Amazon. Google will not win a battle against Amazon in developing a personal shopping assistant, no matter how good its search capabilities are. The growth of voice isn't just a challenge for Google. The shift to voice represents a threat, as it could result in a decline in the amount consumers use Google search, the company's cash cow. Google is working to overcome the head start Amazon got in smart speakers, which accelerated the voice search trend. It plans to expand its hardware lineup and invest more in 2017. But as voice search continues growing and starts taking searches away from mobile and desktop, it will put pressure on Google to continue developing new higher-value display and search ads for its main desktop and mobile products.

With Google parent Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fourth-quarter report now behind it, the company's robust revenue growth and its promising traction in hardware and cloud-computing are getting some time in the spotlight. But there's one other item in the company's most recent quarterly report investors may want to take the time to consider: A key change in the way Alphabet will be calculating its non-GAAP results. Image source: The Motley Fool. In a surprising move, Alphabet explained in its fourth-quarter earnings call that it will no longer exclude stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP results. The change will weigh on non-GAAP earnings per share, but Alphabet believes it will give investors a better view of the company's regular operations. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat explained the change in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. [Stock-based compensation] (SBC) has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of all shareholders. Although it's not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock­-based compensation expense from non­-GAAP results. Non­-cash stock­-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non­-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits. The change sheds light on the growing cost of Silicon Valley-based talent for tech companies in the Bay Area. Stock-based compensation at companies such as Alphabet and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have grown consistently in recent years, so much so that the two companies have recently announced share repurchase programs seeming to simply aim at offsetting the dilutive impacts of expected stock-based compensation. To see what this growing stock-based compensation looks like, consider Alphabet and Facebook's stock-based compensation in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Company Q3 2016 Q3 2015 YOY Change Alphabet $1.86 billion $1.4 billion 33% Facebook $2.91 billion $2.86 billion 5% As one of the biggest tech companies in the world, Alphabet, with the change to its non-GAAP reporting, highlights how regular stock-based compensation has become in Silicon Valley, and it sets a new precedent for other companies to make a similar change. Image source: The Motley Fool. Facebook could very well be one of the next big tech giants to make a similar move. And if it's not planning on making the same change soon, it should. The social network appears to be on the same page as Alphabet when it comes to expecting significant stock-based compensation in the years ahead. Facebook CFO David Wehner said in the company's third-quarter conference call that he ""anticipates 2017 will be an aggressive investment year."" Wehner explained:  ""Adding top engineering talent remains one of our key investment priorities as we continue to execute on our three-, five- and 10-year roadmap. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology talent both in the Bay Area and beyond."" Almost certainly not a coincidence, Facebook announced a $6 billion repurchase program -- an authorization about equal to what the company will probably spend on share-based compensation in 2017 -- shortly after it said Bay Area hiring would drive an aggressive investment year for the company. The bottom line? Bay Area share-based compensation expenses are growing in tandem with tech company revenues, and it's time for companies to stop excluding stock-based compensation from non-GAAP results -- starting with Alphabet, and maybe Facebook soon after.

""2016 was simply a great year for us,"" said Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CFO Ruth Porat during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. And it would be tough to argue with her. In 2016, Google parent Alphabet's revenue and profits increased, its core advertising business, non-advertising initiatives gained significant traction, and it wrapped up the year with two very successful Google-branded hardware launches. Here are eight facts to help capture Alphabet's business in 2016. Google offices. Image source: Alphabet. Total revenue increased 20% -- a notable acceleration from 14% year-over-year growth in 2015. And growth even picked up throughout 2016, with the company reporting 22% year-over-year growth in its fourth quarter, or 24% on a constant currency basis. GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts. Alphabet cited mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising as key revenue drivers during the year. Other bets revenue soared 82%, driven primarily by its smart home Nest products, Google Fiber internet, and Google's life science organization, Verily. Still, other bets remain unprofitable. Indeed, the segment, which only represents about 1% of Alphabet's total revenue, lost $2.9 billion in 2016 when excluding stock-based compensation -- and this loss was on just $809 million in revenue. Including stock-based compensation, other bets operating loss was a whopping $3.6 billion. Alphabet spent $3.7 billion repurchasing its own shares. As part of Alphabet's $7 billion repurchase program, the company's share repurchases in 2016 climbed higher. But investors shouldn't expect the share repurchase program to meaningfully reduce the company's shares outstanding, as Alphabet's stock-based award activities are almost just as aggressive. In 2016, Alphabet paid $3.3 billion in stock-based compensation. Other revenue increased 41%. Not to be confused with Alphabet's much smaller other bets segment, the company's other revenue, which is made up of non-advertising Google products, was driven primarily by Alphabet's Google Play app store, hardware sales, and cloud businesses. Alphabet introduced Waymo. Buried in Alphabet's other bets business, Alphabet's self-driving car technology development became a stand-alone business called Waymo. ""Waymo may be a new company, but we're building on advanced self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,"" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a December blog post. Alphabet intends for Waymo to commercialize self-driving vehicle hardware and software, aiming to dramatically improve road safety. In October, Alphabet launched a smart speaker and a smartphone. The company's voice-activated Google Home speaker and its new Google Pixel phone were clear successes this holiday season. While the company doesn't provide specific sales figures on the device, management did say it was ""thrilled with the reception"" for these devices, and that their success looks promising. Google Home. Image source: Google. Alphabet made significant progress in its cloud business. Management said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that its cloud business is on a ""terrific upswing."" With the help of Alphabet's well-timed $625 million acquisition of API provider Apigee, Alphabet made particular progress differentiating its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by sharpening its offerings in data analytics, machine learning, security, and tools for application development. Further, in 2016, Alphabet's Google Cloud's G Suite product, which offers cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications, garnered more than three million paying customers by the end of the year. Going into 2017, Alphabet will be up against a strong benchmark: itself. With a tough year-over-year comparison of 20% revenue growth in 2016, the company will need to continue executing well across Google advertising and YouTube, as well as its smaller businesses like hardware and cloud. Further, while Alphabet's other bets are still too small to help overall revenue growth in 2017, investors should continue to look for promising signs from the segment this year. ","

Digital advertising is expected to surpass television advertising in the U.S. this year -- that is, if it hasn't already. The two main beneficiaries of the growth in digital advertising are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which owns Google. Image source: Facebook Indeed, the two companies completely dominate the digital advertising market, combining to take about 60% of the market. Both companies are growing rapidly, especially considering their size, but which is the better buy right now? Both Facebook and Alphabet trade for relatively high valuations, which would leave them off the buy list of many investors. But both companies arguably deserve their high valuations because of their rapid growth and the industry trend supporting them. Company P/E (forward) P/S (TTM) P/FCF (TTM) PEG Facebook 24.9 15.2 43.2 0.95 Alphabet 20.0 6.8 24.8 1.06 Source: Yahoo. Investors are valuing Facebook's expected earnings and earnings growth near the same levels as Alphabet, but that puts a premium on Facebook's trailing-12-month sales and free cash flow compared to Alphabet's. Facebook does sport a significantly larger operating margin compared with Alphabet (45%, versus 26% in the third quarter), which makes its sales more valuable, but no more than twice as valuable. Likewise, Facebook's free cash flow doesn't deserve to be given nearly twice the value as Alphabet's. For investors looking for a growth stock with a good valuation, Alphabet shares definitely take the title here. Image source: Alphabet A great growth stock, however, will produce significant earnings growth for its shareholders. You'll notice the one valuation where Facebook outshines Alphabet (albeit just barely) is in its PEG ratio -- the only metric shown that accounts for growth. Indeed, analysts expect Facebook to continue growing rapidly over the next five years, with a compound annual earnings growth rate of 35.5%. Analysts expect Alphabet to produce EPS growth of just 18.6% on average through 2021. That's nearly half the rate of Facebook's growth -- and that's what you get for the premium price you'll pay for Facebook. Facebook's management recently warned that advertising revenue growth on its flagship platform will slow about midway through 2017, but it still has several other major potential revenue drivers. Instagram is still in the early days of advertising, and analysts at Credit Suisse estimate it could generate $6.4 billion in 2017 (double 2016) and $12 billion by 2021. For reference, Facebook is expected to produce $27.3 billion in sales this year. Facebook's Oculus just started selling hardware a bit over a year ago, and Mark Zuckerberg expects VR to be the next big computing platform. Not to mention Facebook has 1 billion users for both Messenger and WhatsApp left to monetize. Meanwhile, Alphabet's growth will come mainly from the continued trend of growing digital advertising spend, which largely benefits Google. YouTube may also help drive revenue growth, but it's a much more mature advertising platform compared to Instagram and carries lower margins than Google's main ad products. While the company has several moonshots that could turn out to be huge profit machines in the future, even Alphabet's small wins are dwarfed by the size of Google. For investors looking for a growth stock with the most potential for growth, Facebook is a better buy than Alphabet. ","

If you've ever received a paycheck from your employer, you've probably felt a sense of accomplishment and disappointment all at once. The accomplishment comes in the form of the cash that'll be flowing into your bank account, whereas the disappointment comes from the realization that you may owe quite a bit of tax on the wages you've earned. Most of us are quite aware of the need to pay federal tax on our income. Even though a majority of Americans receive a federal tax refund each year, we expect a certain percentage of our wages to be withheld each pay period because of federal income taxes. The same can be said for residents in 43 states which also have a state income tax. Image source: Getty Images. However, we as workers also have control over the percentage of federal income taxes taken out of our paychecks via Form W-4. Employees have the ability to change their federal (and state) tax withholding on an as-needed basis. Adjusting your W-4 can come in particularly handy if you expect a big federal refund at the end of the year. Allowing the federal government to hang onto your money on an interest-free basis simply isn't smart. Instead, you can lower your tax withholding or claim a federal tax exemption and boost the size of your paychecks toward the end of the year. But, what might stand out on your paycheck and have you scratching your head is a tax column labeled ""FICA."" You might be wondering what this FICA tax is and why you don't have the same luxuries to control how it taken out of your wages as you do with federal and state income taxes. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. FICA stands for the Federal Insurance Contribution Act tax, which was passed in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act -- the piece of legislation that created the program responsible for paying monthly benefits to more than 41 million current retirees, and more than 60 million beneficiaries in total each month. FICA taxes help fund two critical federal programs that are predominantly designed to protect the financial and physical well-being of our nation's seniors. First, FICA taxes remove a percentage of your wages to help fund Social Security (which may show up on your paycheck as FICA OASDI, representing the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Trust). The official FICA tax on wages for Social Security works out to 12.4%, but thankfully not too many workers are exposed to the full brunt of this tax. If you're employed by someone else, the responsibility of the 12.4% payroll tax is split down the middle between you and employer, 6.2% each. If, however, you're self-employed, you'll owe the full 12.4% tax. But, Social Security's payroll tax only impacts a specified income range which changes most years based on wage growth. In 2017, all wages between $0.01 and $127,200 are subject to the payroll tax. Any wages earned above and beyond $127,200 are free and clear of the payroll tax. Image source: Getty Images. In total, the FICA tax rate works out to 15.3%, with most Americans responsible for 7.65% if they're not self-employed. Here's a handy bullet point that summarizes the above: According to data from the Social Security Administration, payroll taxes accounted for a hair over 86% of Social Security's revenue in 2015. Meanwhile, Medicare relied on FICA taxes in 2014 for 38% of its total program revenue. However, the Hospital Insurance Trust, which covers Part A (also known as hospital insurance), relied on FICA taxes to generate 87% of its annual revenue in 2014. In other words, if FICA tax withholding wasn't mandatory, Social Security and Medicare Part A could struggle to find adequate annual funding. Paying taxes may not be much fun for the average American, but those FICA taxes are ensuring that you and future generations of retired workers will have income and adequate healthcare during your golden years.

Last December, I highlighted MeetMe (NASDAQ:MEET) as a potentially undervalued growth play in a frothy market. The social networking app maker posted eye-popping numbers last quarter -- 32% annual growth in monthly active users (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and 30% non-GAAP earnings growth. Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trades at just 7 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings. Let's take a look at the five key reasons investors aren't buying MeetMe's growth story, despite its high growth figures and low valuations. MeetMe's mobile app. Image source: Google Play. MeetMe lets users find new people in their area to chat with, similar to Match's (NASDAQ:MTCH) Tinder. While there's nothing inherently sinister about the app, there have been multiple reports of MeetMe being used by sexual predators. In 2014, the City of San Francisco sued MeetMe for the unlawful publication of minors' profiles, photos, and geolocation data, and claimed that the app ""enabled"" sexual predators to find their victims. The city cited several cases involving adult men and minors in which MeetMe was used. MeetMe settled the case for $200,000 the following year, agreeing to clarify and simplify its user agreements and settings, and reducing the amount of data displayed on minors to their city and state. But the cases involving MeetMe didn't cease -- last February, a Buffalo man was charged with multiple counts of child pornography after using MeetMe to find minors. MeetMe's troubles raised red flags at Tinder, which hiked its age limit from 13 to 18 last June. Yet MeetMe still hasn't followed suit, presumably because it would lose a large portion of its users. You'd think that big companies would be reluctant to advertise on MeetMe, but plenty of big brands still advertise on the app. That's because MeetMe generates most of its ad revenues from programmatic ads delivered by Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) MoPub. This means that MoPub's customers simply pick a demographic -- in MeetMe's case, younger users and Millennials -- and the platform feeds the ads to various apps. This means that many companies probably don't realize that their ads are appearing on MeetMe. Therefore, a common bear thesis is that MoPub could decide to drop MeetMe due to violations of its terms of service, or advertisers could ask MoPub to pull their ads from the controversial app. There's no evidence either of these scenarios will occur, but it raises a troubling question -- if MeetMe's reputation worsens, can it still keep growing its ad revenues? In its 10-K filing for fiscal 2015, MeetMe admits that its business will suffer if it is ""unable to maintain a good relationship"" with Apple and Alphabet's Google. It notes that its app could be pulled from their app stores ""if we violate"" or the companies believe ""that we have violated"" their terms and conditions. The bulls might believe that's just a typical ""risk factor"" warning, but MeetMe admits in the same filing that ""on more than one occasion,"" Apple rejected its app ""because of user generated content and other concerns."" This indicates that another high-profile lawsuit could knock MeetMe out of the app stores and kill its business. MeetMe arrived before Tinder, which was initially launched in 2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetMe waned in correlation with Tinder's growth, as seen in this chart from Google Trends: Image source: Google. That decline also explains why MeetMe acquired its competitor Skout last October. That move boosted the company's MAU count from about 5 million to 8.5 million, and greatly inflated MeetMe's top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016. If MeetMe is as undervalued as the fundamentals suggest, you'd expect insiders to be loading up on shares. However, MeetMe CEO Geoffrey Cook just sold 250,000 shares (16% of his entire position) at an average price of $5.02. Including Cook's sales, insiders sold 1.96 million shares over the past 12 months, but only bought 334,000 shares. It's understandable that MeetMe's insiders would sell after the stock's 50% rally over the past 12 months, but it also indicates that its upside potential could be limited. The main lesson here is to always look beyond the valuations and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetMe looks like a rapidly growing social app maker trading at a discount to its peers. But dig deeper, and you'll see an app that's struggling to prove that it's not a tool for criminals while remaining relevant against Tinder, which dominates the space with over 50 million active users.

    5 Reasons I Don't Buy MeetMe's Growth Story -- The Motley Fool

Chinese search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is often dismissed as a slow-growth tech stock that has run out of room to grow. Its heavy investments in expanding its ecosystem into adjacent markets have weighed down its bottom line growth, making the stock seem like dead money. Despite those challenges, however, I recently started a new position in Baidu for four main reasons. Baidu Image Search. Image source: Author's screenshot. Baidu controls roughly 80% of the internet search market in China. That dominant position enables it to expand its ecosystem in the same way as Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Its sprawling ecosystem now includes Baidu Maps, video streaming site iQiyi, its Duer voice assistant, the Baidu Wallet payment platform, numerous portal sites, and various O2O (online-to-offline) services in its ""monolithic"" mobile app. While the profitability of these services varies greatly, they all help Baidu gather data from its users for targeted ads. Last quarter, Baidu's revenue per online marketing customer rose 10.6% annually. This indicates that Baidu still remains a top advertising pick in China, even as other popular apps -- like Tencent's WeChat -- tether more users to their ecosystems. Moreover, China still has an internet penetration rate of just 52%, which means that there may be plenty of room for all these companies to expand without stepping on each other's toes. Baidu fell out of favor with growth investors as its top and bottom line growth seemingly dried up. Last quarter, its revenue fell 0.7% annually, its core online marketing revenue slid 6.7%, and its non-GAAP net income rose just 6.3%. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 6% this year, but for its earnings to decline 9%. However, that slowdown was mainly caused by three temporary headwinds. First, Chinese regulators forced Baidu to remove misleading pharmaceutical ads following the death of a student who bought unapproved cancer drugs advertised on the site. Second, Baidu sold its stake in online travel agency Qunar to its rival Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP), essentially swapping its stake in Qunar for one in Ctrip but temporarily throttling revenue growth. Lastly, Baidu's heavy investments in R&D are squeezing its margins, but launching new services could boost its long-term growth and widen its moat against rivals like Tencent. That's why analysts believe that Baidu's revenue and earnings will respectively rebound 21% and 33% in fiscal 2017. Like Google, Baidu is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, driverless cars, and other ""next-gen"" technologies. Machine learning and AI have become increasingly important to search and advertising companies, since they help gather more data from users to create targeted ads that users are more likely to click on. Baidu has been hiring a lot of top talent in that field -- its chief scientist, Andrew Ng, previously led the Google Brain AI project, and its new augmented reality chief Qi Lu was a Microsoft exec specializing in AI. To showcase its AI efforts, Baidu pitted its AI robot against Google's AlphaGo AI in a battle of facial and voice recognition in early January. It partnered with NVIDIA and HERE Maps to develop mapping systems for autonomous vehicles, and plans to launch a driverless shuttle bus in China in 2018. It also partnered with smart remote maker Peel to establish a foothold in the growing smart home market. These projects won't generate meaningful revenue for years, but they could greatly expand Baidu's O2O ecosystem over the long term. Baidu currently trades at just 13 times earnings, which is much lower than Google's P/E of 31 and the industry average of 50 for internet information providers. But due to its projected decline in earnings this year, the stock has a forward P/E of 30. While that forward multiple doesn't seem cheap, we should remember that Baidu's earnings are expected to rebound in 2017. Baidu will likely remain weighed down by near-term challenges over the next few quarters, but it's still well-positioned to profit from the long-term growth of the Chinese internet market. Baidu may struggle to pull social users away from Tencent and shoppers away from Alibaba, but its dominance of the search-based ad market won't end anytime soon. ","

If Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) had simply waited a few more weeks, it might have been able to pick up the Craftsman brand for just pennies on the dollar, as it seems clear to everyone now that Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ) is caught in its final death throes. Following the ominous warning last week from Fitch Ratings about potential liquidity issues, shares of the ailing retailer have lost about a third of their value. Stanley could have simply waited for the coming bankruptcy declaration to buy the tool brand on the cheap. Image source: Craftsman. Anyone watching Sears at any point over the past couple of years should have known the end was nigh. Only able to subsist on recurring, one-time transfusions of cash from chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert, Sears is hemorrhaging sales and shedding assets in a last-ditch attempt to stay afloat. But it should have become immediately clear when the retailer made three deals in quick succession just how dire the situation was -- and how desperate Sears had become. Within a single week, Sears secured a standby letter of credit facility for up to $200 million with the potential for expanding it to $500 million, entered into a $500 million committed secured loan facility secured by mortgages on dozens of properties, and announced it was selling the Craftsman brand to Stanley for $900 million. Although investors have become accustomed to seeing Lampert inject cash into the retailer over the years, the Craftsman sale was unlike any of the other deals Sears had negotiated for its assets. Typically it spun off the business into a separately traded company, such as it did with Sears Hometown & Outlet Stores, Orchard Supply, and Land's End. Despite Lampert hinting at doing things differently with the remaining Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard brands -- he said he wanted to ""realize significant growth by further expanding the presence of these brands outside of Sears and Kmart"" -- most probably figured he'd agree to sell their products at other stores. While he did, in a way, do just that with Craftsman, and on the surface the deal theoretically was a good one for Sears also, but the nuts and bolts of it show that neither Sears nor Stanley Black & Decker might win with the way it was structured. On the one hand, Stanley bought the brand outright, allowing it to sell the tools in whatever retail channel it wants, just as it does with its other tool lines. But it also agreed to let Sears retain rights to manufacture and sell Craftsman tools in its stores, too, for a period of 15 years, plus receive annual payments of 2.5% to 3.5% on the new sales Stanley makes for a period of three years. Stanley says the deal is structured to insulate it from any possible implosion by Sears, which, after these past few days show, was a smart thing to do, but it also calls into question the wisdom for Stanley doing the deal as it did. The problem for Sears with the sale are legion. Customers were already not shopping in its stores and it just gave the handful that still do a very good reason to now stop. If they can get a Craftsman tool at Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), or Ace Hardware, why would they bother to step foot in Sears? Lampert's virtually assured that Sears sales will crater further. And it's yet one more quality brand it no longer owns. Image source: Craftsman. Yet Stanley isn't necessarily making out, either, as there's no guarantee Home Depot or Lowe's will want to carry Craftsman tools. As the house brand of Sears, Craftsman is still closely associated with the failing retailer and the tools will be competing directly against Home Depot's Husky brand and Lowe's Kobalt. While Stanley does make Husky hand tools for the big-box store, Home Depot and Lowe's might not want to introduce a direct competitor to their private label brands. Also, Stanley Craftsman tools will be competing against Sears Craftsman tools. It's hardly an ideal situation. A bankruptcy by Sears may just be the best thing for Stanley, and maybe it expected it all along because if it happens, then it wouldn't have to worry about Craftsman tools also appearing in Sears stores at potentially different price points creating consumer confusion. Ultimately, the Craftsman brand is probably better in Stanley's hands than in Lampert's, but if Sears does manage to linger on, clutching to life -- and Lampert has shown amazing resiliency with the retailer before -- Stanley Black & Decker may end up not winning any plaudits for crafting a deal that works against its best interests.

    Stanley Black & Decker's Purchase of Craftsman From Sears May Have No True Winners -- The Motley Fool

Todd Campbell,02022017,Fool,01262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're padding your returns by owning stock in dividend paying companies, you could be positioning your portfolio for great performance. Over time, investing in dividend-paying stocks has produced greater returns than investing in their non-dividend-paying peers. However, dividend stock investing isn't without its drawbacks. If you receive income in the form of dividends, you could end up with a bigger-than-expected bill at tax time. To avoid such an unwelcome surprise, it pays to plan ahead. So, with that in mind, here are the IRS' dividend tax rates for 2017. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The IRS considers dividend payments to be taxable income, and therefore taxpayers must include any dividend income on their tax return. How much you'll pay in tax on that income will depend on your overall income and whether or not the dividends are qualified or unqualified. Typically, the amount of dividend income you receive annually is provided to you by your investment advisor on form 1099-DIV. These forms are are sent out to investors prior to the April tax-filing deadline. Long-term investors will usually find that their dividend income is qualified if it's been paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation. The various types of dividend income that can't be considered qualified are listed here, but usually, as long as you've owned a stock for over 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the stock's ex-dividend date, it will be considered qualified. Once you've determined whether your dividend income is qualified, you'll need to do some guesswork regarding what your ordinary income will be this year. As a refresher, ordinary income is income that you receive that isn't capital gains -- like wages or rental income, for instance. If your level of taxable ordinary income places you in the bottom two income tax brackets, then you won't need to pay income taxes on your dividend income.  However, if your ordinary income places you in a higher income bracket, then you'll have to pay between 15% and 20% in income tax on your dividend income. Data source: IRS. Table by author. One of the best ways to reduce the impact of income taxes on dividend payments is to own dividend-paying stocks in tax-advantaged retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans and IRAs. Dividends paid by investments held in these accounts are not subject to dividend taxes. The upside is that due to compounding, the deferred taxation of dividend payments can help your portfolio grow bigger, because more money will remain in your account, rather than going into Uncle Sam's pocket. However, you should know that withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and those rates may be higher (or lower) than the dividend tax rate you would otherwise pay, depending on your ordinary income tax bracket in retirement. Because of this risk, a better way to own dividend paying stocks can be a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Unlike traditional accounts, Roth accounts are funded with after-tax money, and as long as withdrawal rules are followed, any dividend payments made to you in these accounts can be totally tax-free. While no one likes to pay taxes, income taxes on dividends shouldn't keep you from investing in dividend-paying stocks. Dividend investing can be a great way to maximize your returns and build a larger nest egg over time -- especially if you focus on top-quality dividend-paying companies with a track record of dividend increases. If your dividend payments are within taxable accounts, then plan ahead and set aside enough money to cover your tax bill. If you don't, you could be forced to sell your dividend-paying stock at precisely the wrong time in order to pay your taxes, and that's not a retirement-friendly move. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",02022017,Fool,01262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Social Security retirement benefits aren't just for retired workers. In many cases -- almost 2.4 million, as of the latest data -- spouses of retired workers get a larger benefit than they otherwise would. However, spousal benefits aren't well understood by many Americans. Here's what spousal benefits are, and what they could mean to your retirement. Image source: Getty Images. Essentially, spousal benefits are designed to provide retirement income to spouses who either didn't work, or earned significantly less than their spouses over their working lifetime. Stay-at-home parents are one good example of spousal benefit recipients, as many people who stayed home to raise children for years don't have as much in earnings over their lifetimes, and therefore wouldn't be entitled to much of a Social Security benefit based on their own work record. The simple way to describe Social Security spousal benefits is that if your Social Security retirement benefit isn't at least half of your spouse's benefit, a spousal benefit will be given to make up the difference. For example, if your spouse is entitled to a monthly benefit of $1,500 at their full retirement age, and your work record only entitles you to $500 per month, an additional $250 will be added to your benefit to make it half of your spouse's amount. When determining your eligibility for a spousal benefit, your own retirement benefit is calculated first. This is done by looking at all your lifetime earnings adjusting each year for inflation, and then considering your 35 highest-earning years. These are then averaged to determine your lifetime monthly average earnings, and applied to a formula to calculate your Social Security retirement benefit at full retirement age, also known as your primary insurance amount, or PIA. There are also a couple of rules regarding spousal benefits which have only been in effect for a short time that are worth mentioning: Just like with standard Social Security retirement benefits, you can collect a spousal benefit as early as age 62, as long as your spouse is collecting their own retirement benefit. However, also like standard Social Security retirement benefits, your spousal benefit can be permanently reduced if you claim it before your full retirement age. It's important to mention that the reduction percentages for early spousal benefits are slightly different than those for standard retirement benefits. And, there is no increase for delaying your spousal benefit beyond your full retirement age, unlike standard retirement benefits, which can continue to grow until you reach age 70. Social Security Retirement Benefits Spousal Benefits Reduction per month before full retirement age (up to 36 months) 5/9 of 1% (0.56%) 25/36 of 1% (0.69%) Reduction per month before full retirement age (beyond 36 months) 5/12 of 1% (0.42%) 5/12 of 1% (0.42%) Monthly increase for delayed retirement, up to age 70 2/3 of 1% (0.67%) None Data source: Social Security Administration. What this means is that if your full retirement age is 67, your spousal benefit can be permanently reduced by 35% if you claim it at age 62. Be sure that you take this into account when deciding the best age to claim your benefit. Up until about a year ago, there were some pretty lucrative loopholes in the spousal benefit program, such as the ""file-and-suspend"" strategy. Unfortunately for new retirees, Congress has done away with these. However, spousal benefits should still be taken into consideration when planning your own retirement strategy. For example, let's say you and your spouse are both 66 and are still working, so you are considering letting your Social Security benefit grow for another few years. However, if your spouse anticipates collecting a spousal benefit on your work record, you might be better off filing at your full retirement age instead of waiting. As I mentioned earlier, there are no delayed retirement credits for spousal benefits. And one of the requirements for collecting a spousal benefit is that the primary worker must be collecting his or her own retirement benefit. Therefore, it rarely makes financial sense to delay Social Security beyond your spouse's retirement age, if they expect a spousal benefit. This is just one example of how a spousal benefit can affect your overall retirement strategy. The bottom line is that Social Security spousal benefits will affect the retirement income of millions of American workers, so it's important to know what they are and how they work. ","
      
    Social Security Spousal Benefits in 2017: What You Need to Know -- The Motley Fool

 ,02022017,MarketWatch,01262017,"Supported by By Daisuke Wakabayashi SAN FRANCISCO — It is almost boring how predictably good Alphabet’s earnings are these days — a trait not always shared by the company’s tech conglomerate peers. Apple is wildly profitable, but its results hinge on the fickle preferences of smartphone buyers who may or may not be moved by the iPhone’s latest design. Amazon seems prepared to abandon quarterly profits to invest even more in faster delivery times or in another huge data center. Facebook is still young enough that a little volatility is not out of character. But fourth-quarter results announced on Thursday from Alphabet, Google’s parent company, proved once again that the company is the model of moneymaking consistency. Alphabet’s revenue in the quarter rose 22 percent to $26.06 billion, beating analysts’ expectations. Net income was $5.33 billion, up from $4.92 billion a year earlier. The heart of Alphabet’s consistent earnings remains the company’s search engine. While a consumer can delay an iPhone purchase or shop somewhere other than Amazon, Google’s search engine is an indispensable tool for anyone using the internet. The shift to mobile devices, once considered a threat to Google’s search business, has only strengthened it. Google’s market share on desktop search is around 78 percent, but it is above 90 percent on mobile devices, according to research from NetMarketShare.com. What is more, on smaller mobile displays, Google’s ads occupy a large portion of the screen — making it more likely a user will click on them. Clicks on Google ads increased 36 percent in the quarter, but what advertisers paid for each click decreased 15 percent. Google is also sitting on many of the internet’s most valuable properties — the places where people go to stay in touch on email, find driving directions or seek out entertainment. While clicks on Google’s ads across the internet are rising, they are growing faster on its own websites like YouTube. Alphabet does not break out results for YouTube, but the site continues to amass a huge audience. Google said more than a billion people watched YouTube every month, viewing hundreds of millions of hours of its videos every day. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said company assets like search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play, constituted “prime time in the mobile era.” Even Alphabet’s unexpected hiccups are a little dull. The company’s earnings per share were $7.56, or 11 cents below analysts’ estimates. It said the reason for the shortfall was that it paid more in taxes. The company’s effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 percent, compared with 5 percent in the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet said it paid more in United States taxes but did not explain why. Alphabet shares were down 2 percent in after-hours trading. The stock reached a record high on Wednesday. While the dominance of the Google search engine seems unassailable today, Alphabet is investing heavily in new technologies that may threaten its stronghold. Devices like the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart speaker, portend a future where artificially intelligent digital assistants fetch information without needing to access a search engine directly. During the quarter, Google introduced a smartphone called Pixel and Google Home, an Echo competitor. Both devices are vessels for the Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligence system. To promote those devices, Alphabet said it spent more on marketing during the quarter. Alphabet said its cost of revenue — an indicator of its spending which also included other costs like operating data centers — rose 30 percent during the quarter from a year earlier. Google did not provide figures for how those products sold, but the “other revenue” category, which included hardware sales along with revenue from Google Play, rose 62 percent to $3.4 billion. Part of the company’s financial stability came from Google’s creation of Alphabet in 2015. The reorganization into a holding company split the company’s core search business from a growing list of fledgling operations, like the newly minted Waymo — what used to be Google’s self-driving car project until it was spun off as an independent Alphabet company in 2016. This move raised the pressure on the company’s so-called other bets, including its life sciences unit, Verily, and its home electronics unit, Nest, to prove that they could be profitable without the support of mother Google. In a sign of the independence of Alphabet companies, Verily announced on Thursday that Singapore’s sovereign fund, Temasek, will acquire a minority stake in Verily for $800 million. Under the watch of Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, the company has scaled back costs and — in some cases — the ambition of its speculative investments into new technologies. During the quarter, Alphabet said quarterly revenue from “other bets” rose 75 percent to $262 million, while operating losses narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.

However, the company’s adjusted profit suffered a much wider miss at $9.36 a share, nearly 30 cents a share lower than analysts’ expectations of $9.64, which was likely a big factor in an after-hours decline for Alphabet stock. The reason for the discrepancy between the GAAP and non-GAAP gaps was hard to find, buried at the bottom of a table reflecting reconciliations between the two figures. Alphabet was forced to swallow a $586 million tax charge on the non-GAAP line related to its stock-based compensation, costing the company about 83 cents a share in non-GAAP earnings — the difference between a substantial miss and a huge beat. The tax charge is the result of a rule change in the U.S. targeting companies’ use of stock-based compensation to sweeten their adjusted earnings numbers. The Financial Accounting Standards Board last year implemented changes that force companies to account for the tax benefits of paying employees in stock instead of cash, and the charge reflected the benefit Alphabet had realized for the full year. See also: How the biggest U.S. companies use made-up earnings numbers Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat obliquely mentioned “certain discrete items affecting our U.S. [tax] rate” in Thursday’s conference call, but Alphabet later clarified to MarketWatch that she was not referencing this specific adjustment.

Claudia Assis,02022017,MarketWatch,01262017,"Published: Feb 2, 2017 7:12 a.m. ET Tech companies and traditional auto makers report miles logged by their self-driving cars to regulators By Tesla Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo, and traditional car makers such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. have accelerated the testing of their various driverless-car systems on California roads. The state released Wednesday its yearly “disengagement” report, a record of instances where human drivers had to take control of test driverless cars to avoid incidents or to test a feature in the car’s autonomous system. Eleven companies reported to the state. As Waymo put it, disengagements are how engineers learn. “They are “a natural part of the testing process that allow our engineers to expand the software’s capabilities and identify areas of improvement,” the company said in its report. Read also: Self-driving cars are all the rage in Detroit Each company varied the way it conducted its tests or how it reported the disengagements, with some noting weather conditions, some choosing to stay on suburban roads rather than freeways, etc. Here’s what some of the main players had to say to California regulators: Waymo Alphabet’s

As of November, Waymo’s self-driving cars had operated in autonomous mode for more than 2.3 million miles, including more than 600,000 miles on public roads in California between December 2015 and November 2016, the company said. Related: Nvidia sets high target for 2017 The “vast majority” of the miles logged in California were on surface streets in the typical suburban city environment of Mountain View and neighboring communities, Waymo said. It marked a 50% increase in total autonomous miles within California compared with the prior reporting period, which was two months longer than this reporting period, it said. The number of disengagements fell 75% to 124 last year from 341 in 2015, Waymo said.

The four cars drove a total of 550 miles, mostly on suburban roads. Most instances of disengagement occurred on wet roads, with only a handful on dry roads, Tesla reported. There were no accidents, emergencies, or collisions, Tesla said.

 ,02022017,MarketWatch,01262017,"Google has unseated Apple as the world’s most valuable brand, while locally Telstra holds onto its position as Australia’s most valuable brand. That’s according to the annual Brand Finance Global 500 report, which ranks brands by monetary values and calculates the most ‘powerful’ brand, as defined by the companies whose enterprise value is most positively impacted by the strength of their brand. Eight of the top 10 most valuable global brands are digital businesses. (The top 20 are listed below). After five years as the world’s most valuable brand, Apple’s brand value dropped 27 per cent in 2016 from  $145.9 billion to $107.1billion. Meanwhile Google’s brand value rose by 24 per cent in 2016 from $88.2 billion to $109.5 billion. “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached saturation point for its brand,” said David Haigh, CEO of Brand Finance. “The Chinese market, where Apple has enjoyed a dominant market share, is becoming far more competitive with local players entering the market in a meaningful way. Samsung has also been successful in taking market share and financial analysts are projecting declining revenues and margins.” Australia in focus While Silicon Valley takes the top spots on the global list, Australia’s most valuable brands are telcos, banks and retailers. Telstra, ranked 125th in the Global 500, is Australia’s most valuable brand for the second year running, with CBA overtaking ANZ to secure second place. Top 20 is listed below. Brand Finance Australia MD, Mark Crowe, comments, “It is testimony to Telstra’s brand strength that despite a decline of 18 per cent in enterprise value, Telstra’s brand value has only decreased by 2 per cent.” Optus was the 9th ranked Australian brand, recording a 12 per cent decline in brand value. Crowe continues, “Optus’ business performance worsened over the course of last year, with Optus’ brand value falling.” Supermarket giant Woolworths experienced another dramatic decline in brand value, falling again in 2016 to reside at fifth place. In contrast, rival Coles experienced the largest gain of any Australian company jumping to sixth place on the list. “Falling profits and a significant decline in brand strength, along with intense competition, will continue to put pressure on Woolworths brand value, unless in particular an improvement in customer metrics can be achieved,” Crowe said. Methodology To determine a brand’s value, Brand Finance evaluates factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation to determine the ‘strength’ or ‘power’ of a brand. Brand power determines the proportion of overall business revenue that is contributed by a brand.

 ,02022017,MarketWatch,01262017,"Supported by By David Streitfeld, Mike Isaac and Katie Benner SAN FRANCISCO — On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration. By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination. Mr. Trump’s executive order late on Friday temporarily blocked all refugees while also denying entry to citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other predominantly Muslim countries. The directives struck at the heart of Silicon Valley’s cherished values, its fabled history and, not least, its embrace-the-world approach to customers. Two worldviews collided: the mantra of globalization that underpins the advance of technology and the nationalistic agenda of the new administration. In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades. Netflix’s chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trump’s actions “are so un-American it pains us all” and that “it is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.” Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, made the same point. “We must stand with those who are affected,” he wrote on Twitter. Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged. “I’m here because I’m a refugee,” Mr. Brin said, according to a Twitter post by the Forbes writer Ryan Mac. The tech companies’ reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did. That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump’s order proclaimed that “the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States” and would be suspended indefinitely. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said that his great-grandparents had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam. “Like many of you, I'm concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Friday. Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump’s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was “not the best way to address the country’s challenges.” Mr. Musk was born in South Africa. Aaron Levie, chief executive of the data storage company Box, wrote on Twitter that “on every level — moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc. — this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America.” Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, “there was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is.” Beyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world. “Almost every company’s products — Google, Apple, Airbnb — has a global customer base,” Mr. Levie said. “These policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors.” The Trump administration is little more than a week old, but its relationship with Silicon Valley is already complicated. The tech industry did not like Mr. Trump the presidential candidate, despite his embrace of Twitter, and he returned the sentiment with caustic posts on the platform. Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, said in 2015 that “two-thirds or three-quarters of the C.E.O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia,” an incorrect statement that many in Silicon Valley perceived as racist. Yet a much-promoted December meeting between the incoming administration and numerous tech chieftains was decidedly upbeat. “We’re going to be there for you,” Mr. Trump promised to a room that included the leaders of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. By early last week, the companies sensed trouble. Murtadha al-Tameemi, 24, an Iraqi-born software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out. “It may be my naïveté about how politics and industries interact, but I don’t interpret the tech community’s opposition to the president as a political stance,” Mr. Tameemi said. “It seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them.” The larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was “concerned.” Apple said, “It is not a policy we support.” Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order “misguided and a fundamental step backwards” and said it would create “collateral damage to the country’s reputation and values.” Microsoft was not the only company to become bolder in a few hours. Around 10 a.m. on Saturday, Mr. Chesky of Airbnb posted a vague message on Twitter saying “open doors bring all of US together.” By 6 p.m., he was advocating open protest. Early Sunday morning, he wrote a memo to employees warning that Mr. Trump’s new policy was “a direct obstacle to our mission.” It was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. “It feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,” said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One. Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists. Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media. At Twitter, a number of workers felt frustrated with the disconnect between their company’s product — a platform for free speech — and the extent to which Mr. Trump has used it to attack those who question him and proclaim outright falsehoods to the American public. On Saturday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, posted and reposted numerous messages denouncing the travel ban. At Facebook, employees felt a similar sense of discord. Some complained about how long it took Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, to speak out. Others were upset at the continued presence of Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg’s, as a director on Facebook’s board. Mr. Thiel was a donor to Mr. Trump's campaign and has since become an adviser, and he issued a statement on Saturday evening that reaffirmed his support for the president. Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump’s economic advisory team. That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day. In an email to employees on Saturday titled “Standing up for what’s right,” Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday. As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers — largely immigrants — began a one-hour work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order. Uber did not follow suit. Instead, it posted on Twitter that it was suspending surge pricing at Kennedy Airport. That prompted accusations that it was trying to break the strike, which the company awkwardly denied in another Twitter post. On Sunday morning, its competitor Lyft said it was donating $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union over the next four years “to defend our Constitution.” On Sunday afternoon, Uber sharpened its criticism of the ban, calling it “wrong and unjust.” Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s most prominent start-up incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen. “After the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,” Mr. Altman said. “Now they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come.” Mr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.

A month-and-a-half later, Google employees are protesting his policies after a staged walkout and tech CEOs are expressing their opposition to a new executive order that places a 90-day hold on all migration from seven mostly-Muslim countries in the Middle East. Efforts to establish a productive working relationship between the White House and tech sector have significantly deteriorated, as the industry establishes itself as a clear corporate opponent to Trump’s ban.

I’ll have to get insights from filings about its model and strategies, growth rates, etc., before I can really analyze the app company. I will let you know every bit of analysis I do on Snapchat as it comes public. If I had to guess, I’d probably be a buyer of $SNAP when it comes public if its valuation is around $25 billion.

Snapchat has become its own de facto platform for advertisers and media companies because the app makes you consume media-rich stories on Snapchat — and it’s just so quick and easy to swipe forward, back, up and down. The key difference between Snapchat and other social networks is that it’s never been, and still isn’t, a web company. You can’t go to Snapchat.com to see someone’s profile or their stories. Go to Snapchat.com and you’ll learn that “On any given day, Snapchat reaches 41% of all 18 to 34 year-olds in the United States.” Snapchat was built as an app company first and foremost. And unlike Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, all Snapchat content lives only in app form. It’s truly an App Revolution company. Here’s an article from CBNC about an analyst’s projections that “We are at the tail end of the social media boom. Novelty is giving way to fatigue,” and that Snapchat won’t be worth $1 billion when it’s all said and done. That kind of pessimism made me think of this “Trading With Cody” report I wrote after we bought Facebook soon after it crashed in the immediate weeks following its IPO: “Google’s past illuminates Facebook’s future” June 27, 2012, by Cody Willard I remember a couple weeks after Google came public that Barron’s ran a cover article on how Google was doomed to fail and it quoted a couple analysts who said that they’d be interested in buying Google when it was at $10 a share. The stock was at $50 or so at the time. It never went below $50 again. As I wrote the other day when we first started buying Facebook at $26 a share, the same people who are so scared of Facebook’s potential to dominate the next phase of the Internet are probably going to love it when the stock is up a bunch and the future more clear to them. In the meantime, I think Facebook is a must-own and it is as large a position for me now as my long-held biggest positions, Google and Apple ... read on. Okay, Cody back in real-time 2017 here. I thought Snapchat was insane for not taking Facebook’s buyout offer a couple years ago for $4 billion. Now I think it’s insane that Facebook didn’t offer $15 billion or $20 billion for Snapchat when it had the chance. Snapchat’s come a very long way since its early adopters used it simply as a safer way to sext with one another. If you haven’t used Snapchat, I suggest you download it and check it out. My username is codylwillard, though I can’t say I’m terribly active on any social media these days, from Facebook to Twitter to Snapchat. Even better is if you know anyone under age 25, have them show you how they use Snapchat. As always, I’m interested to hear your thoughts. What are your experiences or insights on Snapchat?

Cody Willard,02022017,MarketWatch,01262017,"Facebook  is working on a video-focused app aimed at set-top boxes including Apple TV (and different entirely from its existing offering on Roku, which is essentially a variation on its current mobile app), according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. The plans focus on helping turn Facebook’s wellspring of video content into a destination on a platform that’s almost exclusively aimed at delivering video, in a bid to help it better tap into budgets that are currently going towards traditional TV advertising. The report also reiterates claims we’ve seen before that Facebook is looking to license quality original video content, similar to how Netflix and Amazon will often pick up the exclusive rights to shows for distribution on their own platforms. That would be a big draw for a dedicated video app, and help bring in audiences that might not necessarily join in if all that was available was user-generated content. Premium content means more premium ad dollars, too, which according to this report does seem to be the goal for Facebook with this endeavor. It also sounds like there would be opportunity here for Facebook to use this as a means to further its ambitions as a live video source, since users could broadcast to the TV app. Twitter uses its own Apple TV app as an endpoint for its live programming experiments in partnership with media companies and sports leagues, so this could indeed prove fruitful in helping it expand that part of its video strategy, too. Of course, this would also make Facebook look even more like a media company than it already does, which would put renewed energy into the debate around its responsibilities there and general role in disseminating information. But YouTube is already well on its way to being a broad replacement for traditional cable and satellite video delivery, so it would make sense for Facebook to press on with its own efforts to stake out some of that territory, and a dedicated app for set-top boxes including Apple TV and Android TV devices would be a relatively low-cost way to do that. We reached out to Facebook, but they had not responded as of publication time. ",Facebook said to plan set-top box app as a new venue for its video content – TechCrunch

                                   San Francisco flagship store could see digital images of themselves in different colors of the same outfit without taking their clothes off. But customers had to be in physical stores to use AR, while Gap’s DressingRoom allows customers to virtually try on clothes at home. “Customers five years ago weren’t using phones as primary devices [to buy] clothing. We’ve got to evolve,” says Krakowsky. “A lot of shoppers don’t realize that alterations go on during photoshoots for clothes,” says Kimberly Rosen, a New York City-based stylist, who thinks the app will help give customers a more realistic expectation of sizing. “The model who’s 5’10” and weighs 110 pounds may have a clamp in the back of the blouse if it’s too baggy.” In other words, seeing clothes on a tall and thin model isn’t necessarily helpful for all shoppers. To be sure, the app isn’t an all-out replacement for the fitting room. For now, the app will be limited to a relatively small audience: only smartphones equipped with Google

Additionally, the avatars are non-customizable, so customers with odd body shapes will find it of limited use. There’s no body-scanning capability, which allows for more precise measurements to be taken. “That would require a body scan with no clothing on and us keeping the data,” says Krakowsky. “I’m not sure all customers want that.” Instead, the app is currently just meant to give customers a general idea of how clothes they like might fit. “People have a general ability to say that if the model looks like this, I generally look like that,” says Krakowsky. Customers are most excited, he says, “to use it as an exploration device and see how tight the pants might be on the butt, or if white jeans go with a denim shirt.” ",Gap wants your phone to help you decide if your bottom looks big in that dress - MarketWatch

Nakamura reportedly came up with the name Pac for the popular 1980s videogame, which involved a yellow character gobbling dots while being chased by monsters. It was so popular that Guinness World Record called Pac-Man the most successful coin-operated videogame. The game lives on to this day — and by searching Google for “Pac Man,” you can still play a miniature version of the game that first appeared on the Google home page. It’s also the nick name of famed boxer Manny Pacquiao. These days Namco provides the Pac-Man intellectual property free to developers as long as the company is allowed to share in the profits. The company’s top-selling game shares little in common with the dot-gobbling character — it’s based on a Japanese anime series called “Mobile Suit Gundam.” Want news about Asia delivered to your inbox?

                                   Chief Executive David Taylor sent an internal memo to employees voicing his concerns regarding the executive order. He said they will work to ensure their voice is heard. “I am personally concerned with the overly broad scope, hasty implementation and unclear consequences of this policy change. The practical effect is that this new policy establishes blanket exclusion, which is fundamentally inconsistent with our core values,” Taylor wrote to staff in an email obtained by MarketWatch. “These changes in immigration policy impact employees, business partners and their families. Currently, there are dozens of P&Gers who are directly affected.” Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein sent an internal message in opposition of Trump’s immigration ban, saying, according to a Wall Street Journal report: “This is not a policy we support.” Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman also sent out a note to staff, according to the Journal. Along with saying the bank was closely monitoring the fallout from Trump’s ban, he wrote: “We value immensely the contribution of all our employees from all over the world. ... Continuing to draw talent from across the globe is a key element of Morgan Stanley’s culture.” Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky went so far as offering to house refugees for free. Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right, and we must stand with those who are affected. Airbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US.

,02092017,Reuters,02022017,"PARIS (Reuters) - Giant Internet firms Facebook and Google joined forces with news organizations on Monday to launch new fact-checking tools designed to root out “fake news” stories in France ahead of the country’s presidential election. Social networks and news aggregators came under fire during the U.S. presidential vote when it became clear they had inadvertently fanned false news reports. Facebook , said it would work with eight French news organizations, including news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP), news channel BFM TV, and newspapers L’Express and Le Monde to minimize the risk that false news appeared on its platform. Facebook, the world’s biggest social network, has 24 million users in France, more than a third of the country’s population. It will rely on users to flag fake news on its network so that the articles can then by fact-checked by its partner organizations. Any news report deemed to be fake by two of its partners would then be tagged with an icon to show that the content is contested, Facebook said. Facebook is also supporting a separate initiative launched by Google dubbed “CrossCheck” which calls on users to submit links to contested content to a dedicated website so that it can be investigated. Seventeen French newsrooms have joined the project, including AFP and the French public national television broadcaster. Facebook is also taking steps against fake news in Germany, where government officials have expressed concerns that false stories and hate speech online could influence a federal election in September in which chancellor Angela Merkel will seek a fourth term in office. In the United States, Facebook has said users would in future find it easier to flag fake articles as a hoax, and added that it will work with organizations such as fact-checking website Snopes, ABC News and the Associated Press to check the authenticity of stories.

,02092017,Reuters,02022017,"U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was “no meaningful interference” with the account holder’s “possessory interest” in the data sought. “Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” Rueter wrote. The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that U.S. investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On Jan. 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated. In court papers, Google said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces to improve its network’s performance, and did not necessarily know where particular emails might be stored. Relying on the Microsoft decision, Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States. Google receives more than 25,000 requests annually from U.S. authorities for disclosures of user data in criminal matters, according to Rueter’s ruling. The cases are In re: Search Warrant No. 16-960-M-01 to Google and In re: Search Warrant No. 16-1061-M to Google, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Nos. 16-mj-00960, 16-mj-01061.

The House passed the measure by a voice vote. But the legislation was expected to encounter resistance in the Senate, where it failed to advance last year amid opposition by a handful of Republican lawmakers after the House passed it unanimously.

Supporters of the bill passed Monday say it is needed to update an out of date law conceived and written before the rise of the commercial internet. But some senators, including No. 2 Republican John Cornyn, last year sought to use the legislation as a vehicle for amendments that would expand the FBI’s domestic surveillance capabilities, effectively killing the bill. Debate over law enforcement access to Americans’ electronic communications intensified last year when the FBI sought a court order to make Apple help unlock an encrypted iPhone linked to one of the shooters behind a deadly attack in San Bernardino, California. Privacy advocates have expressed alarm at President Donald Trump’s ability to expand government spying. The Republican campaigned on a “law and order” platform that included suggestions he may want to place some mosques in the United States under surveillance and maintain a national database on Muslims. Microsoft last year filed a federal lawsuit against the Justice Department over ECPA, alleging that the government’s use of the law violated the U.S. constitution. It argued that ECPA is too often used to prevent companies from notifying its users, sometimes indefinitely, when investigators pry into emails and other data stored on remote servers. ","

,02092017,Reuters,02022017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Snap Inc’s initial public offering filing seemed to show a company with a basic math problem: the company’s cost of revenue for 2016 - the amount it had to spend just to keep the messaging service running - was $47 million higher than its $405 million in sales. Snap revealed in its IPO prospectus, filed with securities regulators on Thursday, that it will pay Google at least $2 billion over the next five years. Further, while Snap’s cost of revenue was higher than sales on a yearly basis in 2016, the company drastically tightened up hosting costs over the course of the year. While costs were nearly double revenues at the start of the year, by the fourth quarter, when Snap hit 158 million users, the company eked out a small gross margin. Snap’s bigger math problem is how much revenue it generates per user. The $1.05 per user for the last quarter of 2016 was a massive increase from the 31 cents per user it drew in the same period in 2015. In its IPO filing, Snap said it hopes to increase its revenue per user by focusing on more lucrative advertising markets, like North America, where its revenue per user was $2.15 at the end of 2016, nearly double the global rate. But even those higher rates for Snap pale in comparison to the $7.16 in revenue per user that Facebook brought in in the fourth quarter. “Snap’s issue is not cost, but user growth and revenue per user,” said Ethan Kurzweil, a venture investor with Bessemer Venture Partners who backed startups such as Twitch and Periscope but has not backed Snap. “If they can get revenue per user into the kind of territory they think is possible, the cost of hosting will be a hit to gross margin but it’s not going to be an issue.” Facebook provides the example. Even though its cost per user rose 7.4 percent between the last quarter of 2016 versus a year earlier, its revenue per user grew at a much faster 27.5 percent, a difference that helped drive its $10.2 billion in profits for the full year. All of that does, however, mean that Snap has little leeway in delivering dramatic revenue growth in light of the high underlying cost of delivering all those pictures and videos. The cost of revenue figure, noted analyst Brian Wieser at Pivotal Group, “was notable for what it indicates about the expense of running Snap.” ","

,02092017,Reuters,02022017,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Silicon Valley is fighting for its life on immigration. Over 100 tech firms, including Google, Facebook and Apple, have joined the legal battle against President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily barring the entry of nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries. They argue that the restrictions interfere with hiring and business operations. For an industry dependent on immigrants, that truth is self-evident and worth defending. They point out in an amicus brief that immigrants play a disproportionate role in establishing companies, setting up over a quarter of all new U.S. businesses between 2006 and 2010. In medicine, technology and engineering, America remains a beacon for ambitious people from around the world. All six of the United States’ 2016 Nobel Prize winners in the sciences and economics are immigrants. Silicon Valley amplifies both trends. It’s a machine that mixes talented people, drive, ideas and capital and churns out companies. Over half of unicorns - private companies worth over $1 billion - were founded by immigrants, according to the National Foundation for American policy. This isn’t a new trend. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, eBay’s Pierre Omidyar and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang were all immigrants. The tech industry also depends on immigrants to keep companies humming. It uses well over half of all H1-B visas, which allow companies to bring specialty workers to this country temporarily. Although some companies undoubtedly use the program to import cheap workers and keep wages low, others rely on it to attract much-needed skills. This all explains why tech companies have come out hard against the order. Their brief cites the ban’s arbitrary and discriminatory nature, but the real motivation is to defend Silicon Valley’s business model. The travel ban is also a personal affront to many of the executives who now call the United States home. Moreover, the industry worries this is merely the first shot against immigration. After all, the ban could be extended to other countries, Trump has said he is studying changes to the H1-B program, and Republicans in Congress are drafting bills to restrict other forms of legal immigration. For these reasons, Silicon Valley has no choice but to fight. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

,02092017,Reuters,02022017,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland’s privacy watchdog has launched a bid to refer Facebook’s data transfer mechanism to the European Union’s top court in a landmark case that could put the shifting of data across the Atlantic under renewed legal threat. The move is the latest challenge to the various methods by which large tech firms such as Google and Apple move personal data of EU citizens back to the United States. The issue of data privacy came to the fore after revelations in 2013 from former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass U.S. surveillance caused political outrage in Europe and stoked mistrust of large technology companies and an overhaul in the way businesses can move personal data - from human resources information to people’s browsing histories - so as to protect Europeans’ information against U.S. surveillance. Ireland’s data protection commissioner, who has jurisdiction over Facebook as its European headquarters are in Dublin, wants The Court of Justice of the European Union to determine the validity of Facebook’s “model contracts” - common legal arrangements used by thousands of firms to transfer personal data outside the 28-nation bloc. Irish Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon has formed the view that some of the complaints against the model contracts are “well founded,” Michael Collins, a lawyer for the commissioner told Ireland’s High Court on Tuesday. “If you share her doubts - it doesn’t mean you have to be finally satisfied - then you must make a reference to the European Court... The Commissioner’s concern is simply to get it right, not to advocate for any particular result.” Collins said only the CJEU and not a national court or the Data Protection Commissioner has the jurisdiction to rule a European Commission decision invalid. He said that under EU law, a transfer of data can only be made to a country outside the EU if that country ensures an adequate level of protection. A ruling against model clauses could cause major headaches for companies that need to transfer personal data to the United States - be it for completing credit card transactions, hotel bookings or moving employee data between countries. The Irish commissioner’s office initially became involved after Austrian law student and privacy activist Max Schrems made a complaint in Dublin about Facebook’s handling of his data in the United States. Schrems and other privacy campaigners contend that alternative arrangements such as model clauses don’t offer Europeans any means of redress either. The court has since agreed to a request to allow the United States government to join the case, potentially giving the new U.S. administration a platform to lay out its views on surveillance laws. Facebook, which is due to speak in court during the case, said in May that it was one of thousands of companies that used model clauses and said it had a number of legal ways of moving data to the United States.

,02092017,Reuters,02022017,"(Reuters) - More than 100 companies, including most of high-tech’s biggest names, joined a legal brief opposing President Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban, arguing that it would give companies strong incentives to move jobs outside the United States. They argued that the executive order temporarily banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees “inflicts significant harm on American business.” Musk is among the few tech executives on Trump’s business advisory council. He has been forced to defend his participation in recent days, particularly since Uber Technologies Inc’s [UBER.UL] chief executive, Travis Kalanick, quit the group on Thursday following the travel ban. The new Republican president’s Jan. 27 executive order sparked protests and chaos at U.S. and overseas airports in the weekend that followed. Trump has defended the ban as necessary to ensure tougher vetting of people coming into the United States and better protect the country from the threat of terror attacks. On Friday, U.S District Judge James Robart in Seattle, ruling on a lawsuit challenging the order filed by Washington state and Minnesota, temporarily lifted the ban. The federal government appealed the decision, which was heavily criticized by Trump. In their brief, the companies argued that the order created uncertainty for companies depending on talent from overseas and global business travel to innovate and create jobs in the United States. “Highly skilled immigrants will be more interested in working abroad, in places where they and their colleagues can travel freely and with assurance that their immigration status will not suddenly be revoked,” the brief said. “Multinational companies will have strong incentives ... to base operations outside the United States or to move or hire employees and make investments abroad.” “Ultimately, American workers and the economy will suffer as a result,” the companies argued. A major theme of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was bringing back jobs he said had been moved to other countries. Responding to the lawsuit, the federal government argued in legal filings that the president was exercising his constitutional authority to control U.S. borders and that the law allows him to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners who “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” The brief hailed the contributions inclusive immigration policies have made to the American economy. It said that immigrants or their children have founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. Trump’s agenda on immigration, trade, cyber security, tax reform and other issues has caused deep consternation in the tech industry. Before the travel ban, most companies said they wanted to work with him and avoided any direct confrontations. But the immigration restrictions provoked a broad backlash in Silicon Valley, where foreign-born nationals are an integral part of the tech economy. There have been peaceful protests at Google and Facebook. Uber was the target of a boycott, and scrambled to reassure its many immigrant drivers that it was on their side. Partly because of pressure from their rank-and-file, big tech companies have separated themselves from much of corporate America in directly confronting Trump policies. Only a handful of non-tech companies joined the friend-of-the-court brief, though some of the lawyers involved said that was mainly because the group came together very quickly through personal contacts.

Bob Mezan reports. ▲ Hide Transcript Livestock are responsible for 44 percent of all human-caused methane - a gas that is a major contributor to climate change. The cows emit the gas mainly through belching, a side effect from the fermantation of the grasses they eat.
              
              But now researchers in Mexico have discovered a new approach to reducing the animals' methane emissions by supplementing their feed with tropical leaves and flowers.
              Researchers from the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico have found that leucaena trees and cosmos flowers - plants native to Mexico - both have a methane-reducing effect.  Containing an element called tannin, the plants kill bacteria and disrupt the fermentation process, resulting in 36 percent less methane emmission.
              SOUNDBITE: (Spanish): Octavio Castelan, Head of the Cattle and Environment Laboratory for the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico, saying:
              ""One of the important things with this diet is that it doesn't reduce the productivity of the animal. It is an important element because farmers could say with the diet it could reduce milk or less meat. We have demonstrated that it is not like this.""
              Scientists hope the cost-effectiveness of using locally-sourced leaves would mean that more farmers take up the new diet.

SoundHound, best known for its music recognition app, recently raised $75 million from backers like Nvidia Inc., Samsung Inc. and others to have device makers use tools that are built by SoundHound, rather then building the tools themselves. News of the funding was reported by Bloomberg and others. The $75 million funding round—which would be SoundHound's fifth according to Crunchbase—would value the company at roughly $800 million according to Pitchbook. SoundHound is trying to position its technology as being a gateway for device makers to add voice-enabled technology, allowing users to speak to their devices, similar to what Amazon has done with its Echo line of speakers and Google has done with its Google Home smart speaker. (For related reading, see: How Intel Is Betting on Artificial Intelligence.) SoundHound's platform, known as Houndify, powers the company's voice assistant app, Hound. Available on Apple Inc.'s App Store, Hound is described as letting users get ""lightning fast responses"" to queries by saying ""OK Hound..."" and getting responses. It can also give users access to SoundHound curated playlists, news, make phone calls and send text messages, search the Web, among other tasks. Built off of 10 years of research and development, SoundHound's speech AI allows the technology to work in real-time to identify words and decipher context, which is supposed to provide faster results, SoundHound CEO Keyvan Mohajer told Bloomberg. Other services, like those from Siri and others, figure out words from the audio and then a meaning is deciphered. Having already partnered with Samsung to integrate its software, SoundHound will also get information and access to companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Yelp Inc. as it continues to build out its application programming interface (API).

For example, this Vanguard growth ETF is higher by 4.2% to start 2017, a gain that is more than double that of the S&P 500, though MGK has slightly lagged the S&P 500 over the past year. Making MGK's ascent to a record high Friday impressive is that Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is faltering as investors digest what is being considered a disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report and guidance from the e-commerce giant. Amazon's fourth-quarter sales disappointed Wall Street, prompting a spate of estimate and price target cuts from sell-side analysts. Amazon's struggles are relevant to MGK because the stock was the ETF's third-largest holding at the end of the fourth quarter at a weight of 4%. MGK tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth Index and its sector lineup is reflective of what investors might expect from passively managed growth funds as technology and consumer cyclical stocks combine for 48.6% of the ETF's lineup. Other familiar names found among MGK's top 10 holdings include Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Facebook Inc. (FB). MGK includes some stocks that are not typically considered growth names, including the ETF's 11% tilt to the usually low-growth consumer staples sector. Some of the competing growth ETFs to MGK have been bleeding assets as investors depart for value funds, but MGK has been able to skirt that scenario. Since the start of last year, investors have added about $100 million in new assets to MGK, which is a solid total among growth ETFs. One of the primary sources of allure with MGK, as it is with many Vanguard index funds, is its low fee. After a December fee cut, MGK charges 0.07% per year, or just $7 per $10,000 invested. That makes MGK less expensive than 94% of competing funds, according to Vanguard data. Another interesting tidbit about MGK is its annualized volatility. Many investors associate growth stocks with being noticeably more volatile than value stocks. However, MGK's average annualized volatility over the past three years is 13.9%, which is not that far above the 13.1% seen on the S&P 500.

Shoshanna Delventhal,02092017,Investopedia,02022017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs President Donald Trump’s radical stance on restricting immigration in the U.S. brings to light a multi-faceted debate, including the importance of free movement for skilled tech workers. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, columnist Christopher Mims speaks with reporter Tanya Rivero regarding what may happen if skilled tech workers are unable to enter the U.S. Mims indicates that the policy wouldn’t work to boost U.S. tech jobs, instead shifting the centers of tech talent as U.S. startups work with remote infrastructure, moving outside the country and looking to Canada in particular. (See also: Cook, Zuckerberg, Bezos: Tech CEOs on Trump's Immigration Order.) As Trump takes extremist actions regarding immigration, he also puts at risk the number of high-skilled H-1B visas accepted into the U.S. Since tech giants rely on this talent, Mims says they will leverage a variety of strategies including technologies around remote work. With the digital economy, even a startup can be multinational, explains Mims. Historically, one of the reasons for a multinational presence was because companies needed to go where the talent was. Since startups are already accustomed to go outside the country, they will leverage existing infrastructure to move outside if they are afraid of moving people in and out. Mims indicates that a lot of skills are simply not taught in the U.S. anymore, using the example of analog circuits, in which no university in the U.S. has an expertise in anymore. Therefore, while some companies have abused the H1-B visas to replace U.S. workers, Mims says the U.S. is lacking native talents in certain areas. Due to the fact that tech giants such as Facebook Inc. (FB) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) need to bring in the best talent from around the world in a winner-takes-all business, the columnist says they are already thinking about moving headquarters outside the U.S. Mims indicates that companies are willing to restructure their company “on the fly” to deal with immigration issues, moving intellectual property and fundamental business outside the U.S. Regarding where talent will coalesce, Mims says there are startup hubs all over the world. In particular, Canada looks attractive as venture-capital investment explodes due to the emergence of an infrastructure that can finally support it. The columnist indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google, Facebook and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) already have huge engineering offices in Canada. He says companies such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) currently have engineers stationed in Canada, and have the ability to ship engineers there from over countries if they can’t get them to the U.S. Overall, the industry specialist says it’s not a question of tech hiring talent inside the U.S. or not, rather that tech firms are going to hire who they are going to hire and all that Trump’s immigration policies will do is alter how they do it.

It can be expensive or take a lot of time,"" says Swedish fashion blogger Kenza Zouiten, in a film on the H&M-backed Ivyrevel fashion website. But now the ""I have nothing to wear"" dilemma could be solved by a new app, which aims to create a customized dress design based on smartphone data showing someone's location and activity, as well as the weather. The ""data dress"" technology is a collaboration between Google and Ivyrevel, and is based on Android's Awareness API, which lets apps ""be aware of all aspects of a user's environment,"" according to a post on the Android Developers' blog. The new app – which is at trial stage – monitors what someone is doing every day for a week, to recommend and design a dress style for them. ""Where do you regularly eat out for dinner or hang out with friends? Are they more casual or formal meetups? What's the usual weather when you're outside?"" writes Google's group creative business partner Jeremy Brook in the post. This information – known as context signals – is passed through an algorithm to tailor the design of the dress, which can then be bought. ""Custom made designs for everyone.

Ari Levy,02092017,CNBC,02022017,"If you want to see why Snap's costs are so high, look to the clouds. Snap said in an updated IPO filing on Thursday that, on top of its previously disclosed deal to spend $400 million a year on Google's cloud services, the company is spending $1 billion over the next five years with Amazon Web Services. Snap broke out the spending per year with AWS, revealing that in 2017 it will spend $50 million on AWS, with the amount rising over time. Still, that means Snap's cloud hosting costs this year will total $450 million, or about $45 million more than the company generated in revenue in all of 2016. The AWS deal is ""for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations,"" Snap said. In other words, the company can't be entirely dependent on Google to quickly deliver videos and photos while also handling data storage. Cloud services have been instrumental in enabling young companies like Snap to get off the ground and grow rapidly without needing to bulk up on expensive servers, storage arrays and networking gear. But renting all that equipment gets costly for 158 million daily active users. So Snap also dropped this line in its update: ""In the future, we may invest in building our own infrastructure to better serve our customers.""

Four months later, Barratt has landed at Barefoot Networks, a maker of ultrafast networking equipment that's received a healthy dose of capital from his former employer. Barratt is joining as CEO, the company said on Tuesday, taking over from co-founder Martin Izzard, who's assuming the role of vice president of technology. At Alphabet, Barratt was running the Access business, which includes fiber broadband internet service. The company had aggressive plans to spread high-speed internet to a bunch of U.S. cities, but Alphabet's new emphasis on turning its other bets into real money-making businesses got in the way of that expansion. Access said in October that Barratt was stepping down and also announced that it was laying off employees and pausing its move into a number of cities, including Los Angeles, Dallas and Phoenix. He was one of several Alphabet leaders to leave in 2016, including GV's Bill Maris and Craig Urmson of the company's self-driving car business (subsequently renamed Waymo). In Barefoot, Barratt is taking over a company with plenty of Google DNA. In June, Barefoot announced a $57 million financing round led by Goldman Sachs and Google, and it previously raised money from Sequoia Capital, one of Google's major venture backers.

An amicus brief by 97 technology companies opposes Trump's recent executive order, which imposes a 90-day ban affecting citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day bar on all refugees. The ban was blocked by a federal judge in Seattle on Saturday, and the Department of Homeland Security has stopped enforcing it for the time being. The companies filed the brief to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is expected to rule on the ban in days. The Trump administration has defended the temporary order, designed to allow for more vetting of travelers from countries known to harbor terrorists. The legal brief — backed by companies including Apple, Airbnb, Google, Facebook and Intel — calls the ban abitrary and subject to ""inconsistency or abuse.""

""Amazon is going to grow 25 percent a year for the next three years,"" predicted the founder of Baltimore-based LMM. ""That's a big position and has been for a long time,"" he said, referring to his Amazon holding. Miller said he's betting on both Amazon Web Services cloud computing and e-commerce.

Amazon plans to invest about $1.5 billion in an air cargo hub in northern Kentucky, state officials said Tuesday, The company said it would aim to employ 2,000 people and eventually house 40 Amazon Prime Air planes there. ""Amazon would rather ship through FedEx or the post office, but they don't have the capacity, especially in the fourth quarter, to handle that surge,"" said Miller, pointing to Tuesday's earnings, revenue and outlook miss at UPS. Margins at UPS were squeezed because home deliveries result in fewer packages dropped per stop than businesses. Miller said he spoke to Amazon chief Jeff Bezos about a year ago, and asked him about the cash to set up logistics operations. Miller said Bezos responded by saying he's ""highly confident he could earn well above his cost of capital."" The LMM chief said he's taking Bezos at his word because of the many past successes Amazon has had in expanding its reach. On e-commerce, Miller said, ""Amazon's gross margins are now higher than Wal-Mart's, considerably higher than Wal-Mart's."" ""Wal-Mart is a good competitor. They're not going away,"" he said, but argued Wal-Mart is going to have a hard time catching up online while running the legacy brick-and-mortar stores, which have been diminishing in profitability. Miller also said Wal-Mart overpaid for e-commerce start-up Jet.com. The $3 billion deal that closed in September saw Jet founder Marc Lore join Wal-Mart as CEO of the retail giant's U.S. online shopping business. Before Jet, Lore helped start Quidsi, behind the e-commerce websites Diapers.com, Soap.com, Wag.com and more. Quidsi sold to Amazon in 2011 for $550 million.

Ari Levy,02092017,CNBC,02022017,"Three years after rejecting an acquisition offer from Facebook, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel is tossing some insults at the company's Instagram unit. ""Instagram, a subsidiary of Facebook, recently introduced a 'stories' feature that largely mimics our Stories feature and may be directly competitive,"" Snap said on Thursday in the ""Risk Factors"" section of its IPO filing. Stories are groups of snaps that are collected by users and can be viewed by friends. They started as tools for consumers and are now also used by advertisers. While Instagram Stories has grown fast, it hasn't cut into Snapchat's popularity, according to research firm AppAnnie, and ad buyers told CNBC they're still enthusiastic about Snapchat, which has some features for advertisers that Instagram still lacks. Additionally, Snap referenced an advertising report from September 2016, that ranked the top online ad platforms. The company said that in a comparison to Facebook, Instagram and other competitors like Google and Twitter, ""we ranked first in overall satisfaction,"" even if advertisers had plans to spend more money elsewhere. Overall, Snap is still way behind Facebook. According to eMarketer, Facebook will command 15 percent of the digital ad market this year, second to Google, which controls 32 percent. Snap is tied for 14th globally at 0.4 percent. While Facebook, Google and Twitter are obvious competitors to Snap, the company included a more surprising rival in its risks section: Apple.

Sameepa Shetty,02092017,CNBC,02022017,"This earnings season, the biggest tech companies clarified their paths forward over the next two years, and in the process explained what our tech future is going to look like. For Apple, it's about doubling down on the services business to position itself for a time when the smartphone becomes redundant as a computing platform. With augmented reality, virtual reality and the internet of things becoming more than buzzwords, Apple's future relies on recurring revenue from these shifts -- and that means services. Most of the Apple innovation debate centers around hardware -- the next great iPhone; an iWatch that does it all; Apple car; or perhaps a so-far un-thought of gadget. While that may still be a focus area for the company's research department, Tim Cook is now focused on doubling the services business over the next four years. For Facebook, ﻿""It's more than just the big blue app,"" says Eric Sheridan, UBS tech analyst. The company is a portfolio of brands -- including Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus, and the like -- and that's the way to value it. And a big value driver of that value is video. ""I see video as a megatrend on the same order as mobile. That's why we're going to keep putting video first across our family of apps and making it easier for people to capture and share video in new ways."" - Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO on the Q4 2016 earnings call. BTIG's Rich Greenfield raises an important question: does this mean allowing users to upload and share more video or does this mean offering video entertainment to Facebook users? The latter idea is made more interesting by the fact that Reed Hastings, Netflix CEO, sits on Facebook's board. Each path is a distinct strategy would take the company in different directions. Meanwhile, the company's ad service business continues growing from strength to strength. Strategic buys including Instagram and Whatsapp helped diversify Facebook's geographical and demographical bets. As for monetization, Facebook has many untouched levers, including using bots enabled commerce within Messenger and Whatsapp. And of course, virtual reality: ""We're going to keep making big investments in VR content, and I'm excited about what's coming in 2017, from new games to more immersive educational experiences."" - Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO on the Q4 2016 earnings call For Microsoft, the pivot to the cloud,continues. Its commercial cloud business, which include cloud products -- Office 365 and Azure – grew by 95% year-over-year in the most recent quarter. CEO Satya Nadella's strategic bets are paying off. Since Nadella's Feb 2014 arrival the stock's rallied 67%. Nadella's LinkedIn acquisition, further proof of his cloud-based services focus, continues integrating with the parent company with the announcement of Kevin Scott, former SVP of infrastructure at LinkedIn as its new CTO. Another nod to Nadella's sound management and stewardship of the 41-year-old American icon is his recent appointment to Starbucks' board of directors at a time when founder and CEO Howard Schultz is stepping away. For Amazon: The Amazon story has not changed: CEO Jeff Bezos continues building scale into the business through aggressive investments in Video, Fulfilment, Fresh, Alexa & India expansion. In the short term this implies quarterly earnings misses while the long-term continues to brim with hope and possibility. With exposure to over a third of the world's digital customers, you'd be hard pressed to find a company with bigger ambitions. For Alphabet: Google's parent company is betting its future on the power of artificial intelligence. Google looks at AI to drive its search, ad and computing capabilities. This is going to have an effect on the Google experience for users: ""Over time, the 10 blue search links will likely go away. That could cause a bump in the Google story in a few years, just like the shift from desktop to mobile had a near term negative impact,"" says  Gene Munster, co-founder of Loup Ventures and a leading tech analyst.

Market-intelligence firm CB Insights has compiled a list of the major acquirers of private artificial-intelligence (AI) companies over the last five years. This list reveals well-known tech giants making large investments to increase their capabilities in AI. It also provides insight into the evolution of the technology, and its direct uses. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is well known for its aspirations in artificial intelligence; it heads the list with 11 acquisitions. A number of these companies specialized in areas that led directly to recent improvements in the Google Assistant. They also tie to the launch of Google Home and its plans to take on Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa virtual assistant and the Echo smart-speaker home system. Image source: Google. The acquisition of Emu provided an assistant that used voice commands to schedule appointments, set reminders, and make reservations. Api.ai added tools for building conversational bots,  while Dark Blue Labs contributed natural-language improvements. Two companies helped personalize recommendations: Clever Sense learned about nearby coffee shops, restaurants and bars; Jetpac searched for visual cues in photos to improve recommendations. Timeful used priorities to add items to a calendar using smart scheduling. Three companies specialized in image recognition: DNNResearch focused on image search and facial recognition; Moodstocks technology improved image recognition for smartphones; Vision Factory worked to enhance accuracy and speed in object recognition. Each of the aforementioned technologies serves to improve specific functions in Google Home's ecosystem, and specifically within Assistant. This will compete directly in the virtual personal assistant market currently led by Amazon's Alexa. London-based DeepMind was one of the largest acquisitions, with a price tag estimated at $660 million. Google already boasted a significant investment in the area with its development of the Google Brain, a neural network developed in-house. Gains in AI research have been used to improve many areas of its current business. DeepMind is focused on improvements in general AI research, without any specific business objectives. That said, Google will use every opportunity to apply research gains to business uses. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has made a number of acquisitions as well. Saffron specialized in cognitive computing, combining data analytics with deep learning; this relates directly to Intel's efforts in the same area. Indisys provided natural-language recognition, gesture recognition, and virtual-assistant technologies, but also created user interfaces for unmanned drones. Itseez focused on software for the Internet of Things (IoT), cameras, drones, and autonomous driving. Movidius brought computer-vision hardware for drones and cameras; it also provided system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for accelerating computer vision, as well as deep-learning capability. These companies integrate directly into Intel's RealSense brand for drones and virtual reality, and bolster its IoT business. The most significant of Intel's acquisitions, however, may be that of deep-learning start-up Nervana Systems. With a reported price of $408 million, this company is attempting to reduce machine learning to the size of a computer chip. Intel competitor NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has seen its stock price triple in 2016, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) become the chip of choice for companies training AI systems. If Intel can succeed at reducing machine learning to a level that could reside on a processor, that would be a significant boost to its business and a potentially troubling development for NVIDIA. As the battle for AI supremacy continues, we will likely see more consolidation in the industry, as tech giants try to gain an edge in this nascent technology. Success in the field will likely depend on successful integration of these acquisitions into existing business lines. Alphabet and Intel are on the right track. ","

"Evan Niu, CFA",02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Earlier today, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) filed its first amended S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Companies often modify their initial registration statements leading up to their IPOs, prior to issuing a formal prospectus. Prospective investors already knew that Snap is a big spender at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, which it relies on for its cloud infrastructure needs. Snap is unique in its continued use of third-party infrastructure vendors at the scale at which it is operating; most companies invest in their own infrastructure once they grow to a point where it's warranted. To a lesser extent, Snap also purchases infrastructure services from Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. Image source: Getty Images. In the amended filing, Snap provided some additional detail on its relationship with the e-commerce giant. To be clear, Google Cloud is still Snap's main flame, but it never hurts to have backup. In fact, contingency planning is absolutely critical when your entire service relies on third-party infrastructure partners, and this is the role that AWS will play. The deal was inked just yesterday, which is what's triggering the S-1 amendment. In last week's version, Snap said: ""We are currently negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations."" That line was replaced in this week's version with: ""We have also committed to spend $1 billion with Amazon Web Services over the next five years for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations."" Snap says an existing agreement with AWS that was originally entered into in March 2016 was amended on Feb. 8, 2017. That $1 billion commitment will slowly ramp up, starting with $50 million in spending this year. That's a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the $12.2 billion in sales that AWS did in 2016. Snap is on the hook to spend $350 million with AWS in 2021. In contrast, the agreement with Google Cloud that was finalized on Jan. 30, 2017 calls for a flat $400 million per year for five years, with a little bit of leeway in shifting spending to subsequent years (up to 15% in each of the first four years). Data source: Snapchat amended S-1. Chart by author. Combined with its $2 billion commitment with Google Cloud, we're looking at $3 billion pledged between Google Cloud and AWS over the next five years. Snap's cloud strategy of relying entirely on third-party partners is risky for many operational reasons, but that's an awful lot of financial pressure for the start-up. In 2016, cost of revenue exceeded revenue, resulting in a negative gross profit of nearly $50 million, and infrastructure costs are the largest component of cost of revenue. Snap only recently rolled out its automated ad sales API in October, which exited beta just a couple weeks ago. The company will now need to ramp ad sales faster than its infrastructure spending commitments if it hopes to generate gross profit in the years ahead. And we haven't even started talking about operating expenses yet, which totaled $473 million last year. Hopefully, that API works pretty darn well. ","

Every year, the IRS lets you know well in advance what the tax brackets will be when you file your taxes. However, 2017 is an unusual case, because some believe that tax reform could change the tax structure between now and the end of the year. Nevertheless, the 2017 tax brackets are available as defined under current law, and especially because many think that any changes to taxes will apply only in 2018 or later, using these brackets as a starting point is a good move. So, without further ado, here are the 2017 tax brackets for planning purposes. Image source: Getty Images. Any unmarried person can file as single, and it's the only permissible option if you don't qualify for the more beneficial filing statuses as a head of household or a qualifying widow or widower. The brackets are as follows: Bracket Tax is this amount plus this percentage Of the amount over $0 to $9,325 $0 plus 10% $0 $9,325 to $37,950 $932.50 plus 15% $9,325 $37,950 to $91,900 $5,226.25 plus 25% $37,950 $91,900 to $191,650 $18,713.75 plus 28% $91,900 $191,650 to $416,700 $46,643.75 plus 33% $191,650 $416,700 to $418,400 $120,910.25 plus 35% $416,700 above $418,400 $121,505.25 plus 39.6% $418,400 Data source: IRS. If you're single but support a child, parent, or other relative who meets certain qualifications, then you're allowed to file as a head of household. Qualifying persons have to live with you more than half the year, and it's often necessary that you be able to claim them as dependents. As you can see below, the brackets are higher and wider than for single filers, resulting in tax savings. Bracket Tax is this amount plus this percentage Of the amount over $0 to $13,350 $0 plus 10% $0 $13,350 to $50,800 $1,335 plus 15% $13,350 $50,800 to $131,200 $6,952.50 plus 25% $50,800 $131,200 to $212,500 $27,052.50 plus 28% $131,200 $212,500 to $416,700 $49,816.50 plus 33% $212,500 $416,700 to $444,550 $117,202.50 plus 35% $416,700 above $444,550 $126,950 plus 39.6% $444,550 Data source: IRS. The vast majority of those who are married file jointly. The brackets below apply to them, as well as to qualifying widows and widowers. Bracket Tax is this amount plus this percentage Of the amount over $0 to $18,650 $0 plus 10% $0 $18,650 to $75,900 $1,865 plus 15% $18,650 $75,900 to $153,100 $10,452.50 plus 25% $75,900 $153,100 to $233,350 $29,752.50 plus 28% $153,100 $233,350 to $416,700 $52,222.50 plus 33% $233,350 $416,700 to $470,700 $112,728 plus 35% $416,700 above $470,700 $131,628 plus 39.6% $470,700 Data source: IRS. Married couples can choose to file separately, but it typically results in more tax. However, for some, there are special factors that make filing separately a smarter move. The brackets are below. Bracket Tax is this amount plus this percentage Of the amount over $0 to $9,325 $0 plus 10% $0 $9,325 to $37,950 $932.50 plus 15% $9,325 $37,950 to $76,550 $5,226.25 plus 25% $37,950 $76,550 to $116,675 $14,876.25 plus 28% $76,550 $116,675 to $208,350 $26,111.25 plus 33% $116,675 $208,350 to $235,350 $56,364 plus 35% $208,350 above $235,350 $65,814 plus 39.6% $235,350 Data source: IRS. Also, keep in mind that the starting point for these brackets is taxable income, and that's typically much different from your gross income from all sources. In particular, taxable income takes your personal exemptions into account, as well as either the standard deduction or your itemized deductions. ","

Adam Levy,02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In digital advertising there are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google, and then there's everyone else. But one company is starting to emerge as a potential contender to the two ad behemoths: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is starting to spread its wings as an advertiser. Amazon certainly has the user data to compete with Facebook or the big Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary. Although it has only 300 million active customers as of its last update, the shopping data it has on those users is invaluable. In fact, Amazon may be able to target advertisements better than Facebook or Google despite their huge troves of user data. After all, nothing speaks louder than how people spend their money. Image source: Amazon.com. During Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings call, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan asked about the ""other"" line item on Amazon's income statement. He pointed out that it's exhibited a lot of momentum over the past few years and wondered if that was due to growth in advertising. The other category includes ""certain advertising services and our co-branded credit card agreements,"" according to Amazon's quarterly report. While Amazon did just revamp its credit card offering, it's been around in some form in the U.S. since 2002 and in Canada since 2012. The vast majority of growth in the category is probably coming from advertising. And it's been growing. Last year, other revenue in North America increased 60%. That accelerated to 81% growth in the fourth quarter.  That makes it Amazon's fastest growing source of revenue, growing even faster than its cloud-computing service, Amazon Web Services. Granted, the other revenue Amazon brings in accounted for just 1.7% of its total North American sales -- $1.3 billion. So it's still working on a very small revenue base. Most of the ads Amazon sells are on its own websites. Search results on Amazon have an increasing number of sponsored products, with which third-party merchants pay to show up at the top of the page, not unlike Google's search advertising. Management described sponsored products as ""off to a great start,"" indicating they see a lot of room for expansion. A report from BloomReach last fall found that 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com. As more and more people search Amazon for products, the more ads it can show. In fact, sponsored products could start stealing ad budgets away from Google, which is why Eric Schmidt said it's Google's biggest competitor in 2014. But Amazon's advertising is starting to extend beyond its own websites, wading deep into Google's territory. Last year it developed a header-bidding solution. Header bidding allows publishers to take more offers for their ad inventory instead of wading through each offer one by one and taking the first decent one they find. (This is all done extremely quickly by computer algorithms.) Amazon's advantage in the space is that it can perform the complex algorithmic ad bidding process in its AWS servers, enabling publishers' websites to load faster than other header-bidding systems allow. Google has historically dominated the space that header bidding threatens. As mentioned, Amazon is one of the few companies with user data that can compete with the targeting capabilities of Facebook or Google. So if it continues to build out its advertising products on third-party websites, it could start to take a significant share of revenue from Google and Facebook. Google generated $15.6 billion in revenue from its network members' websites last year. Facebook's Audience Network reached a $1 billion run rate in the fourth quarter last year, but the company hasn't provided any updates since then. The digital ad market is huge. Advertisers spent $195 billion worldwide on online ads last year, according to eMarketer. That number is expected to grow to $335 billion by 2020. If Amazon can grab just a slice of the market producing high-margin revenue, it could provide a significant boost to its bottom line. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single taxpayers and $12,700 for married taxpayers filing joint returns. However, there's a chance it could change before next tax season, and no matter where it ends up, you may be better off not claiming it. Here's what you need to know about the standard deduction, and how it might change in the near future. Image Source: Getty Images. In a nutshell, you have two main choices when it comes to tax deductions. You can choose to itemize your deductions, which means to add up the dollar value of each tax deduction you're entitled to. Alternatively, you could go the simpler route and claim the standard deduction, which is the amount of income every taxpayer is entitled to exclude from their taxable income. It's also worth mentioning that some tax deductions can be taken regardless of whether you itemize or choose to take the standard deduction. Known as ""adjustments to income,"" or ""above-the-line"" deductions, these include such potentially lucrative tax breaks as: Under the current IRS law, the standard deduction has increased for the 2017 tax year (for which you'll file a tax return in 2018). There are three different standard deduction amounts, which vary depending on tax filing status. Because many people have yet to file their tax return for the 2016 tax year, here are the standard deduction amounts for both 2016 and 2017. Tax Filing Status 2016 Standard Deduction 2017 Standard Deduction Single $6,300 $6,350 Married Filing Separately $6,300 $6,350 Head of Household $9,300 $9,350 Married Filing Jointly $12,600 $12,700 Source: IRS. While the figures in the chart are the most current standard deduction amounts as of February 2017, there's a strong chance that these will change before you file your 2017 tax return. Tax reform was a cornerstone of President Donald Trump's campaign, and one of his proposals involved significantly increasing the standard deduction to $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for married couples filing jointly. The head of household status would be eliminated. The trade-off is that the personal exemption, which is currently $4,050 per person, would be eliminated under Trump's tax plan. So, depending on how many people are in your household, the increased standard deduction may or may not result in a tax cut. Finally, remember that President Trump's campaign tax plan is likely to be somewhat different from the finalized tax reform bill that Congress ultimately passes. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress mostly agree what direction the tax code should head in, but they aren't exactly on the same page, so it remains to be seen what will happen with things like the standard deduction. However, there is a very real possibility that the 2017 standard deductions listed in the chart won't end up being the actual 2017 standard deduction you might take when you file your tax return.

Having a baby is a life-changing experience in more ways than one. But while bringing a child into the mix might work wonders for your family dynamic, your finances might take a serious beating in the process. Fortunately, having a child means getting to take advantage of different tax breaks. Not only can you claim an extra exemption per child on your tax return, but you might be eligible for a number of credits that could collectively result in a refund. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The IRS lets you take a tax exemption for every child you can claim as a dependent. As a reminder, an exemption saves you money by excluding a portion of your earnings from taxes. For 2017, each dependent you have will give you a $4,050 exemption, but if you're a higher earner, you should know that those exemptions begin to phase out at $261,500 for a single tax filer and $313,800 for a married couple filing jointly. And exemptions phase out completely if you earn $384,000 as a single filer or $436,300 as a married couple filing jointly. Having a baby can also save you money on your taxes by opening the doors to certain tax credits. Unlike tax exemptions or deductions, which merely exclude a portion of your income from taxes, a tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your tax liability. The more credits you're able to claim, the more you stand to save. If you need to pay for child care to work after having a baby, you may also be eligible for the Child and Dependent Care Credit, which allows you to claim up to 35% of the cost of qualifying child care expenses, up to a maximum of $3,000 for a single child under 13 or $6,000 for two or more children under 13. This one's a bit trickier to calculate than the Child Tax Credit, but in a nutshell, your credit is equal to 20% to 35% of your child care expenses depending on how much you earn, and only lower earners will qualify for the full 35%. Finally, there's the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is a refundable credit designed to benefit low-income households. The credit is based on your income and the number of qualifying children in your household, but the more kids you have, the higher the value of your credit, and the more money you're allowed to earn in order to qualify. Eligibility for married couples filing jointly, for example, is limited to those earning $20,600 or less if there are no children involved. Throw one child into the mix, and that income limit climbs to $45,207. A new baby can turn your financial world upside down, so it pays to learn more about the ways having a baby can lower your taxes. At a time in your life when you're suddenly spending more money on diapers than you ever could have imagined, every little bit of tax savings counts. ","
      
    How Much Do You Get in Taxes for a Baby? -- The Motley Fool

The wheels look like they're coming off the merger between Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's (NYSE:CAB). It appears the hurdles for successfully navigating the regulatory landscape are more hazardous than originally believed. Not only has the Federal Trade Commission sought more information about the transaction, delaying the potential closing deadline, but the regulatory request has jeopardized the sale of Cabela's financial arm to Capital One. Still struggling with a changing retail landscape, Cabela's agreed last October to be acquired by privately-held rival Bass Pro Shops for $65.50 per share, or about $5.5 billion, including debt. It was a decent price for the outdoors retailer, representing a 19% premium to Cabela's closing price on Sept. 30, the day before the acquisition was announced. It was also a 40% premium to its closing price on Dec. 1 of the previous year, the day before Cabela's declared that it was exploring strategic alternatives. Image source: Getty Images. Those options, which had always included a potential sale of the company but were also thought to focus on selling its World's Foremost Bank division, were brought about by activist investor Elliott Management, which had taken a 11% stake in the company, saying it would push management to sell everything. When Cabela's share price is viewed from that perspective, the Bass Pro offer is almost double the price the stock traded at the time. And there didn't seem to be any doubt the deal would sail through. The transaction was obviously a good fit for the two since both retailers target the same customer and even offer a fairly similar retail experience. It would also allow Bass Pro to better compete against rivals like Dick's Sporting Goods, whose preeminent position was being bolstered by the shakeout occurring in the outdoor recreation space. City Sports declared bankruptcy, as did Eastern Mountain Sports, Sport Chalet, and of course, Sports Authority. Despite the similarities between Bass Pro and Cabela's, though, there were enough degrees of separation that should have allowed the deal to move forward with relative ease. Cabela's operates some 80 stores in 36 states, mostly in the West, with nine more locations in Canada. Bass Pro Shops has about 100 stores, mostly in the Midwest and East Coast. Moreover, Cabela's specialty is hunting while Bass Pro's is, as its name implies, fishing. But a deal of this size, even in the $76 billion hunting and fishing industry, invites regulatory scrutiny from an FTC that has not shown favor toward large mergers. Even so, the deal seemed to have a good chance of success, and it even brought in Capital One Finance to take over the banking operations of Cabela's. In a side deal from the merger, Capital One agreed to pay about $200 million to originate and service Cabela's co-branded credit card for 10 years while acquiring the credit card operations, which is one of the country's biggest issuers by volume. But the deal looks like it's unraveling. Although the FTC's request for more information is not a death sentence -- Anheuser-Busch also got a second notice request in its pursuit of SABMiller, which was ultimately approved -- it's going to be more complicated and may require divestitures that will delay any potential closing date for some time. Also, in Capital One's fourth quarter earnings conference call with analysts, Chairman and CEO Richard Fairbank said it was all but out of the running to get the credit card business. ""Within the next week or so, we expect to either withdraw our bank merger act application or have our application denied by the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]"". While a bank would normally just withdraw an application before it was denied, because Capital One's deal is tied up with the merger, it needs to get Cabela's permission to withdraw, which the retailer is apparently loathe to do. And because Cabela's credit card operation is chartered as a bank, the merger requires the approval of the comptroller. Image source: Cabela's. Regardless, with these delays, Capital One won't have time to refile an application. It is currently still operating under a consent order from the comptroller due to money laundering laws it violated a few years ago from a check-cashing business it once operated. And while Capital One hasn't updated the status of its application as of this writing, it's seems to be out of the running. While that could open up a chance for another card issuer to step forward, Bass Pro will probably have to manage the portfolio in-house for awhile, perhaps putting it up for sale later on -- if it gets the nod from regulators, of course. Bass Pro Shop's hunt for Cabela's is becoming stuck in a regulatory thicket and could ultimately fall apart, raising questions of whether investors will ever see that buyout premium they are hoping for.

    Bass Pro Shop's $5.5 Billion Deal for Cabela's Inc Is Falling Apart -- The Motley Fool

Todd Campbell,02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. After Merrimack Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:MACK) board of directors provided investors with a blueprint to its reorganization, its shares lost 23.8% of their value last month, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Last October, Merrimack Pharmaceuticals jettisoned its CEO and announced a 20% workforce reduction because of mounting expenses, and in December, the company was forced to shutter development of a once-promising breast cancer treatment after it failed to hit its mark in mid-stage studies. Following those events, it probably isn't surprising that its stock fell in 2016. However, shares continued to tumble in January, after the company announced a new CEO and a new deal that could be worth more than $1 billion. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Merrimack Pharmaceuticals plans to sell its only commercial product, Onivyde, to Ipsen for $575 million in cash at closing and up to $450 million in regulatory approval-based milestone payments. As part of the deal, Merrimack Pharmaceuticals also retained rights to $33 million in net milestone payments from Onivyde's licensee Shire plc. Management also streamlined its clinical-stage drug pipeline to focus on three cancer drugs that are in mid- or early-stage trials (MM-121, MM-141, and MM-310), and separately, the company hired Dr. Richard Peters as CEO. Peters was formerly the head of the global rare disease unit at Sanofi. Because Onivyde has the potential for expanded use into the first-line pancreatic cancer setting, investors are nervous that Merrimack Pharmaceuticals has sold its crown jewel. Onivyde's potential is compelling, but investors should recognize that Merrimack Pharmaceuticals was under significant financial strain, and this deal significantly improves its balance sheet. Furthermore, the deal allows the company to benefit somewhat from Onivyde's future success via milestone payments. Once the deal closes, management plans to pay a special dividend to shareholders worth at least $200 million, or roughly $1.54 per share. The company will invest $125 million into the development of MM-121, MM-141, and MM-310, and it will pay off approximately $195 million in long-term debt. Also, management intends to pass through to investors 100% of any future milestones from Ipsen ($450 million), assuming it's financially able to do so. Aside from the dividends, there's not a lot that's likely to move shares higher this year, because data from MM-121, MM-141, and MM-310 trials isn't expected until 2018. Nevertheless, the dividend could be enticing enough not to avoid this stock altogether, especially since the company estimates that it will have enough cash to go into 2019 once the Ipsen deal is completed. A shareholder vote on the deal is expected soon. ","

Wendy Connick,02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. If the two things that are inevitable in life are death and taxes, then it's probably no surprise that someone figured out how to impose taxes after the grave. In the U.S., there are actually two different kinds of ""death taxes"": the estate tax, which is levied by the federal government and certain states, and the inheritance tax, which is levied by only a handful of states. Read on to learn more about these ""death taxes"" and see if your assets may be subject to them. The estate tax is, as the IRS puts it, ""a tax on your right to transfer property at your death."" All the cash and property you own at the time of death is added up and subjected to some complicated calculations to arrive at the taxable value for the estate. It's unlikely you'll need to worry about the federal estate tax: The IRS offers an exemption on the first $5.49 million of the estate (as of 2017). So unless you think you'll have more than five and a half million dollars to leave after death, you can forget about the federal estate tax. Most states that levy an estate tax use the federal limit, but there are a few state estate taxes that use a lower amount. For example, both Massachusetts and Oregon have only a $1 million exemption for their estate taxes. That may sound like a lot, but if you have a house, some savings, investments, and a well-funded retirement account -- not to mention jewelry, furniture, and so on -- then your estate could easily be valued at over $1 million. The inheritance tax is only imposed at the state level. Six states have inheritance taxes: Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. If you're a resident of one of those states when you die, your beneficiaries will likely have to pay an inheritance tax on their bequests. The inheritance tax also applies against any real estate you own that happens to be located in one of these states, even if you're not a resident of the state. The states all have different inheritance tax rates, exemptions, and limits, so check with your state tax agency for details. If you're concerned about either of these taxes, you can take steps to minimize how much your estate or your beneficiaries will have to pay. One approach is giving the money or property in question to its intended recipient while you're still alive. You'll receive a gift tax exemption of $14,000 per recipient per year, allowing you to dispose of quite a bit of wealth tax-free. If you are married, you can both give out gifts and enjoy a doubled exemption of $28,000 per recipient per year in total. And you can give away yet more money tax-free by paying your intended beneficiaries' medical or tuition fees (you'll need to pay the medical provider or school directly to take advantage of this loophole). Another way to cut back on estate taxes is to create a trust for your property. This works especially well for your home, since you can keep living in the house even if you've given ownership in it away to the trust. However, for this to work it has to be an irrevocable trust – meaning you can't change your mind later and take the house back or give it to someone else. If you decide to go this route, consult a lawyer or tax professional; you'll need to configure your trust with estate taxes in mind. Choosing your beneficiaries with taxes in mind can have a big impact on how much you (or they) will pay the IRS. Anything left to either your spouse or a qualifying charity doesn't get hit by the federal estate tax. Most states charging inheritance tax also have exemptions for charity beneficiaries. Many charge greatly reduced tax rates to beneficiaries who are close relatives of the deceased (siblings, children, and so on -- check with your state to confirm), and all states exempt spouses from inheritance tax.

Just days after Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings release last week, the company raised a cool $10 billion in debt. Like prior bond sales, this one consisted of numerous tranches with maturities of up to 30 years, and included both fixed-rate notes as well as some floaters. There wasn't really much that was notable about the bond offering itself; it's comparable to the paper that Apple sells every year. Principal Fixed or Floating Rate Maturity $500 million Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 8 basis points 2019 $500 million Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 20 basis points 2020 $1 billion Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 50 basis points 2022 $500 million Fixed 1.55% 2019 $1 billion Fixed 1.9% 2020 $1.5 billion Fixed 2.5% 2022 $1.75 billion Fixed 3% 2024 $2.25 billion Fixed 3.35% 2027 $1 billion Fixed 4.25% 2047 Data source: Prospectus. However, it was done a bit earlier the usual this time around, and Apple is now approaching $100 billion in debt. Typically, Apple conducts these bond offerings shortly after providing updates to its capital return program, which is usually alongside its April earnings release. They usually occur in April or May. But Apple needed to sell the bonds slightly earlier this year for a few interrelated reasons. Image source: Apple. Apple entered into its ninth accelerated share repurchase program last quarter, and total share repurchases were $11 billion. That took a big bite out of Apple's domestic cash position, and the company exited the quarter with $15.9 billion in domestic cash. That's the low end of Apple's comfort zone; Apple usually keeps its domestic cash in the range of $15 billion to $25 billion for operational and strategic needs. Note how Apple's domestic cash has dwindled in recent years due to aggressive capital return activity. (This chart does not reflect the recent bond offering.) Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. The company simply blew through its domestic dollars a little faster than usual this year with share repurchases. Since debt largely funds Apple's massive capital returns, the debt load that it has taken on over the past five years is commensurately large. At the end of 2016, Apple had $87.5 billion in long-term debt (including the current portion) and commercial paper, which is just short-term unsecured debt. The recent $10 billion bond offering will now bring that figure up to around $97.5 billion. The offering was still able to fetch investment-grade credit ratings, but it goes without saying that the more debt that Apple takes on over time, the worse its credit rating profile becomes. Meanwhile, there's been a lot of talk about a potential tax repatriation holiday from the Trump administration. If Apple is able to bring home a meaningful chunk of the $230.2 billion that now sits overseas, it could theoretically extinguish some of that debt and strengthen the balance sheet. That could effectively give Apple a few more years to continue its debt-funded capital return strategy. Until then, Apple will just have to keep selling paper. ","

Claudia Assis,02092017,MarketWatch,02022017,"Published: Feb 2, 2017 7:12 a.m. ET Tech companies and traditional auto makers report miles logged by their self-driving cars to regulators By Tesla Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo, and traditional car makers such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. have accelerated the testing of their various driverless-car systems on California roads. The state released Wednesday its yearly “disengagement” report, a record of instances where human drivers had to take control of test driverless cars to avoid incidents or to test a feature in the car’s autonomous system. Eleven companies reported to the state. As Waymo put it, disengagements are how engineers learn. “They are “a natural part of the testing process that allow our engineers to expand the software’s capabilities and identify areas of improvement,” the company said in its report.

Related: Nvidia sets high target for 2017 The “vast majority” of the miles logged in California were on surface streets in the typical suburban city environment of Mountain View and neighboring communities, Waymo said. It marked a 50% increase in total autonomous miles within California compared with the prior reporting period, which was two months longer than this reporting period, it said. The number of disengagements fell 75% to 124 last year from 341 in 2015, Waymo said.

Mark Hulbert,02092017,MarketWatch,02022017,"Published: Feb 7, 2017 10:43 a.m. ET Snapchat slated to have the highest price-to-sales ratio of any major U.S. IPO By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Simple math is all you need to conclude that Snapchat’s upcoming IPO is an incredibly risky bet. That’s because the company’s sales will have to grow at a blistering pace in order to support the price at which it is currently slated to come to market. Though anything is possible, you probably should go to Las Vegas rather than Wall Street if you want to place that kind of high-risk bet. I base these comments on a simple valuation model that focuses on sales rather than earnings. That’s crucial for startups, since most of them—like Snapchat—have yet to produce any profit by the time they go public. Price-to-earnings ratios therefore are useless for valuing them. Price-to-sales ratios, in contrast, speak volumes. Snapchat parent Snap Inc.

                                   , for example, will at IPO have a price-to-sales ratio (PSR) of 55.6, assuming it comes to market at the midpoint of the $20 to $25 billion range reported by The Wall Street Journal. That would be higher than any other major U.S. IPO in decades—and maybe ever. (I base this on data from Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida and academia’s leading expert on the IPO market; included are all U.S. IPOs since 1980 that, when coming to market, had at least $200 million of sales in 2016 dollars.) PSRs almost always decline as a company grows, however, and that’s the Achilles' heel of a high PSR. In order for its stock price to not fall along with its ratio, revenue must grow just as fast as the ratio falls. How far does the typical company’s PSR fall over its first five years as a publicly traded company?

                                    fell from 25.3 to 11.1. In fact, according to FactSet, the median internet company’s PSR on its fifth birthday was 2.8. Regardless of which of these numbers we use, Snapchat’s sales will have to mushroom over the next five years. If we assume its ratio in five years will be equal to what Google (now Alphabet) had on its fifth birthday as a publicly traded company, Snapchat’s sales will have to grow more than 10-fold—just in order for its parent company’s stock price to stay even. That works out to an annualized five-year revenue growth rate of 63% per year. To put that in context, consider that U.S. IPOs that came to market between 1996 and 2007 had average five-year revenue growth rates of 26% annualized. (This according to research conducted by Ritter and two colleagues.) Of course, you wouldn’t bet on a company if you didn’t expect it to make money. So breaking even is nowhere good enough. That in effect means you have to bet that Snapchat’s sales will grow by even more than 10-fold over its first five years. A lot more. For illustration’s sake, let’s assume that you require a 15% annualized profit in order to compensate you for the high risk of Snap stock (higher than the overall market’s historical rate of 10% annualized, in other words). If so, then its five-year revenue growth ratio will have to be 87% per year. In other words, the company will have to nearly double its revenue every year for five years in a row. To put that in context, consider that Google’s five-year revenue growth rate after IPO was 57% annualized. Facebook’s was 47%. To repeat, it’s not impossible for Snap to jump over these higher barriers. As Professor Ritter pointed out to me in an interview, in the “winner take all” internet economy, a successful company could very well live up to the growth expectations embedded in a high PSR. But, by definition, there are far more losers than winners in a “winner take all” arena. How confident are you that Snap won’t be one of them? Don’t like the numbers I’ve used in this analysis? Be my guest and play around with other assumptions about how much you expect the stock price to increase over the next five years and what its PSR will be then. No matter how you slice and dice it, however, you will find that Snap is an incredible long shot.

All jokes aside, the auto industry finds itself struggling to remain in the driver’s seat as software-driven disruption upends the industry, just as it is doing to all our old-line industries. Indeed, as software continues to “eat the world,” traditional businesses need to ask themselves: “Are we in the software business? Should we be?” Perhaps no industry is struggling with this question more than automotive manufacturing.

                                   Spawned from the brain of tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, the luxury electric-vehicle maker is leveraging the business of software to redefine how the car business operates. The most recent example is a telling one: A frustrated customer tweeted about inconsiderate Tesla owners hogging spots at charging stations, leaving their cars parked long after their charge had been completed while they were off running errands or eating lunch. Musk saw the tweet and promised to respond. Six days later, Tesla released a new feature, implemented via the Tesla app, that would discourage parking at charging stations by imposing a per-minute fee on idle owners once their charge was complete. It would be easy to dismiss this story as simply a high-profile publicity stunt, except for this: For Tesla to respond this quickly required an impressive software operation capable of making and deploying changes quickly. This is not something that a CEO, no matter how remarkable, can do himself. It is the mark of a sophisticated operation built around production capabilities and product cultures that few non-software companies have developed. Indeed, more than any other operating tactic, the ability to sense a signal from the market and respond within days is what allows software companies to implement continuous improvement and deliver continuously increasing value. These rapid feedback loops could not be more different from the traditional rhythm of industrial companies, and is what sets software companies apart from their older siblings. Traditionally, car manufacturers use the “model year” as the marketing tool to spur new purchases, but they also accept this rhythm as the natural order of things. You want something better? Wait till next year’s model. This made sense when the only way to update a car was to roll a new design off the assembly line. Tesla, though, has created a software-first customer experience that allows them to solve customer problems as they discover them — whether it’s range anxiety or frustration with others’ behavior at charging stations — by updating the features in their vehicles overnight and over the air. This kind of continuous improvement is literally impossible with a Ford Explorer or Toyota Camry. How, then, do the traditional manufacturers of cars (and toasters and refrigerators and other devices) address this disruption? Unlike Ford and GM, which are attempting to create self-driving car technology themselves, Chrysler, one of the smaller U.S. automotive brands, in choosing to partner with Waymo, has chosen to outsource its technology stack: to look to tech leaders to provide critical subsystems for their vehicles, hoping for a relationship similar to other parts suppliers and OEMs. Google, via Waymo, and Apple

In return, the incumbents like Chrysler get a slick product experience that matches what their customers have come to expect from other digital interactions. The risk with this approach is not insignificant. Allowing other companies to control the user experience leaves you vulnerable to being displaced and commoditized. For an illustration, consider the case of Sonos, the maker of wireless-music systems. As much as the company was loved by customers for the quality of its speakers and the ease of use of a proprietary wireless-network system, customers struggled with its music-playing software. This year, Sonos partnered with Amazon

Sonos similarly partnered with Spotify to give Spotify users the ability to stream music directly to Sonos without using the Sonos app. A boon for Alexa and Spotify users, but at what cost to Sonos? Will giving up control of the user experience relegate Sonos to being a commodity-hardware vendor? Will the company become the Dell to Amazon’s Microsoft

                                   are building software teams and directing them to create systems that deliver their services in new ways, or enhance their products with new capabilities. The companies that are succeeding are the ones that are mimicking the kind of market-sensing and continuous response tactics that Tesla is so good at. These are not easy choices for an incumbent to make. The partner path offers short-term wins — allowing them to deliver modern, sophisticated customer experiences in a fraction of the time — but the long-term risk to corporate autonomy may be too much to ask. The alternative — building a software capability that can operate in modern ways — isn’t as simple as increasing IT spending. Instead, it means driving a path of major transformation, adding not just technology skills, but changing operational rhythms, creating a listening and learning culture, and imagining where and how you deliver value to customers. It’s a difficult road? Can the automakers drive it? Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden, technology experts and founders of the global Lean UX movement, are the coauthors of the new book, “Sense & Respond: How Successful Organizations Listen to Customers and Create New Products Continuously” (Harvard Business Review Press).

See also: How Snap stacks up against Facebook and Twitter Snap relies on Google for computing, storage and other bandwidth needs. It signed the five-year agreement on Jan. 30, 2017, three days before it filed to go public. Other costs of revenue include payments to content partners, costs of creating content and inventory costs for Spectacles, the company’s camera-enable sunglasses. The company notes that costs related to Spectacles are expected to be higher than revenue from the product, at least for the near future. Cost of revenue is just one item that contributed to Snap’s total losses of $514.6 million in 2016 and $372.9 million in 2015. In 2015, Snap reported cost of revenue of $182.3 million and revenue of $58.6 million, but those figures got closer in 2016: cost of revenue totaled $451.7 million while sales were $404.5 million. Cost of revenue is expected to rise as the company’s number of daily active users grow. Snap saw this between 2015 and 2016, when cost of revenue increased 148%, while DAUs rose 48%. The company said cost of revenue has increased in every quarter presented in the prospectus. As Bloomberg pointed out, in the fourth quarter of 2016, for every dollar Snapchat made, its cost of revenue was an average of 93 cents. Costs could weigh on the company in the future, as Snap needs to grow daily active users to remain competitive and bring in greater revenue. Advertising is Snap’s primary form of revenue. Revenue growth could save Snap, though. Snap saw an almost sevenfold revenue increase, up 590%, from 2015 to 2016. ",Why Snapchat is losing so much money - MarketWatch
Maricel Tabalba,02092017,MarketWatch,02022017,"Published: Feb 8, 2017 10:43 a.m. ET Increasing energy efficiency and making certain capital improvements can save you money By If you made any home improvements in 2016, you may be eligible for a tax break or two. Certain home improvements — or certain lines of credit that can be used for home improvements — qualify for a deduction or tax credit from good old Uncle Sam. As you prepare your taxes this year, keep these in mind. 1. Home improvement loans You probably already know that your property taxes are (usually) tax-deductible, but you can also deduct the interest on a home improvement loan. The interest can be fully deductible up to $100,000, according to the IRS. Similarly, it’s also possible to deduct the interest you pay on a home equity line of credit (HELOC) in most circumstances. 2. Increasing energy efficiency Making a home greener offers multiple incentives, including decreased energy costs and tax credits from federal, state and local governments. As noted by EnergyStar.gov, examples of improvements and equipment included in the federal tax credit group are: 3. Medical home improvements Improvements made for you, your dependents or your spouse can qualify for tax deductions if they help a person in a wheelchair or with a disability. These deductions must be itemized and cost more than 10% of your adjusted gross annual income. There is also currently an exemption that allows people 65 and older to deduct total medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of their adjusted gross income through tax year 2016. As outlined by the IRS, examples of medical expenses include: 4. Capital improvements Were you getting your home ready to sell? Some repairs can qualify as capital improvements. These include: Financing home improvements in 2017? Tax credits and deductions can help make certain improvements more affordable, but you’ll still want to carefully consider your funding, if you’re facing (or longing for) a major renovation. Cash is the “thriftiest” way to pay for home improvements, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), since you won’t be paying any interest or fees. But, if you find yourself facing emergency repairs or need some liquidity to get a carefully considered project completed, homeowners can use financing methods such as: Of course, you’ll want to come up with a plan to pay back any type of financing you take on — and be very careful not to overextend yourself when it comes to renovations. (Granite countertops, for instance, are certainly appealing in theory, but their sheen can wear thin if you can’t actually afford the expense.) Remember, too, there are other ways you can potentially drive down the costs of home repairs. Here are more tips for working some sorely-needed home improvements into your budget this year.

The Dutch are about to flounce off in a huff, the French are about to elect a fiercely nationalistic president, while the Greeks and the Italians are just biding their time before the peripheral eurozone crisis blows up again, and brings the whole house of cards crashing down. In the wake of both Brexit and Donald Trump, to many market pundits the European bond and equity markets were the next likely victims of a wave of populist uprisings. But here is something nobody expected. Come the autumn, the eurozone may have its most pro-Europe, reformist leadership for a couple of decades. The centrist Emmanuel Macron is getting closer to power in France, while the Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz looks to have a decent chance of replacing Angela Merkel in Germany. A Schulz-Macron alliance could finally re-boot the euro, creating the momentum for the genuine fiscal, monetary and economic union that the single currency needs to become if it is to have a genuine chance of success. It might not work in the long-term. But in the short-term, it would give the European markets a real lift. The script has 2017 marked down as a year of political upheaval across Europe. The Dutch were about to elect the Freedom Party’s Geert Wilders, while in France the National Front’s Marine Le Pen was running on a platform of bringing back the franc.

                                   has more than doubled in the past year, and it is now back to 2015 levels. It is a long way below the 6% level it reached at the peak of the eurozone crisis — but it is heading back up again. But that is not necessarily how it is going to play out. In fact, an alternative scenario is looking just as plausible —that Europe gets its most pro-European Union leadership in a couple of decades. Start with France. With the Republican Francois Fillon sinking deeper into a scandal over vast sums paid to his wife from the state, the centrist Emmanuel Macron looks more and more likely to make it into the second round of voting in early May. The basic rule of French politics is very simple. Whoever makes it into the second round again Le Pen wins the presidency: the National Front leader has huge support among her base, but 60% of the electorate would rather vote for lump of stale cheese. Macron looks a surer bet with every week that passes. Over in Germany, something just as dramatic is happening. Switching Martin Schulz from Brussels to Berlin has given the center-left Social Democrats a huge boost in the polls. One this week showed his party overtaking Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, while all of them have shown significant rises in support. Add in the Left Party and the Greens, and come September Schulz may have enough support to finally bring Merkel’s long reign to an end. Indeed, as this column predicted at the start of the year, with her support draining away, Merkel may well decide to stand aside, and let someone else lead her party into the election. If Schulz takes power, the Berlin-Paris axis, the most important relationship in European politics, would suddenly look very different. There would be the opportunity to accelerate economic integration — and give the euro a final chance to succeed. Far more than the leaders they would replace, both Macron and Schulz are passionate believers in the EU, and they are willing to sacrifice national sovereignty to make integration work. Merkel was always portrayed as a great champion of the EU, and on paper she was. But in practice, she didn’t do much about it. Greece was allowed to drift into limbo. Italy remained in the doldrums. France gradually became less and less competitive, while Germany racked up bigger and bigger trade surpluses. Moves towards a banking union were blocked. A fiscal union was dead in the water. Merkel allowed the eurozone to become a zombie economy — she would do just enough to stop it dying, but nothing to make it come alive. Between them, Macron and Schulz would agree on one thing. The eurozone, as Macron argued in a speech in Berlin last month, needs to radically change if it is to prosper. It needs to be turned into a fully functioning economic union. What would that look like? For starters, there would be a banking union, with a single regulator, and a bailout mechanism. Next, sovereign debt markets would be pooled, and common eurozone bonds issued, backed by all the member states. There would be a EU Treasury, with powers to raise taxes, harmonize rates, and spend money right across the continent. Over time, government offices would help redistribute wealth across the zone. Dutch tax returns would be processed in Portugal, and German cars would be certified in Sicily. In short, Brussels would look a lot more like the federal government in Washington. True, that might create intense political opposition. Lots of people won’t like it. But between them Macron and Schulz as president and chancellor would have the will and momentum to make it happen. They may be doomed to ultimate failure. In the short-term, however, it would lift confidence, and push the currency, bond and equity markets higher. There is a lot of political risk out there in Europe — but right now it might be on the upside, not the down. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

Matthew Lynn,02092017,MarketWatch,02022017,"Nordstrom will stop selling Ivanka Trump’s name-branded line of clothing and shoes, a company representative said Thursday. The change followed a weeks-long boycott campaign, organized by an anti-Trump activist group called “Grab Your Wallet.” The group demanded the department-store giant cease doing business with the president or his family. In a statement, the Nordstrom representative said that Ivanka Trump products were being dropped because of poor sales. Its statement did not mention the group’s boycott effort. “Each year we cut about 10% [of brands] and refresh our assortment with about the same amount,” the statement said. “In this case, based on the brand’s performance we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.” The retailer has some Ivanka Trump items in stock, a representative said, and will sell through that remaining inventory. On the company’s website Thursday evening, the only Ivanka Trump-branded items available were four styles of shoe, all being sold at a discount. Shannon Coulter, who helps run Grab Your Wallet, said that number is down sharply from early December, when Nordstrom had 71 Ivanka Trump items for sale. She celebrated Nordstrom’s decision as a milestone for the campaign, which began in October after The Washington Post obtained a video from 2005 that showed Donald Trump bragging about groping women during a taping of “Access Hollywood.” In that video, Trump boasted that he could “grab them by the p---y,” using a vulgar term for a woman’s genitals. Four days after The Post’s story, on Oct. 11, Coulter posted a message on Twitter criticizing Nordstrom for doing business with Ivanka Trump. She said the retailer should dissociate itself from her because she had continued to campaign for her father in the aftermath of the tape’s release. Weeks later, Nordstrom had remained a focus of the boycott group’s effort. On Thursday, in fact, her group had asked its followers to call the retail giant’s headquarters in large numbers. “The cause and effect here is very clear,” Coulter wrote in an email message Thursday evening after Nordstrom announced its decision. “Over 230,000 Tweets and who knows how many millions of dollars’ worth of missed purchases later, they finally heard us.” The “Grab Your Wallet” campaign has now targeted more than 60 companies — a group that includes Trump’s golf courses and hotels, those that sell Trump-branded goods, and other businesses whose leaders endorsed Trump or donated to his campaign. “The people who voted against Donald Trump may have lost at the ballot box, but they can win at the cash register,” Coulter said. The group has removed five companies from the list after they stopped selling Ivanka Trump’s merchandise. Ivanka Trump’s business began with a jewelry collection in 2007, and has grown to include clothing, shoes, fragrances, handbags and other products. A spokesman for Ivanka Trump’s company said Nordstrom initially purchased some clothing — though not shoes — from the Ivanka Trump brand for sale during the spring season. Nordstrom then changed its decision, the spokesman said, and chose not to sell Ivanka Trump items after all. Ivanka Trump intends to resign all management positions in her company and her father’s Trump Organization, attorneys for the Trump Organization have said. On Thursday, the attorneys told the news site ProPublica that the paperwork would be completed Friday. Ivanka Trump has moved from New York to Washington, where she has served as an adviser to her father. The news of Nordstrom’s decision was first reported by Bloomberg News. Earlier, the news site Racked.com reported the sharp decline in Ivanka Trump items for sale at Nordstrom. Read more: Robin Ghivan: Should designers dress Melania and Ivanka?

But the Nordstrom move does come against the backdrop of political backlash against some Trump family dealings. Shannon Coulter, cofounder of the anti-Trump Grab Your Wallet campaign, has been tweeting about Nordstrom’s decision for more than a week, since news reports began to appear. The issue is also referenced in a story on the fashion blog Racked about the possibility that the line could be pulled from another luxury retailer, Neiman Marcus. Criticism has centered in part on what some see as blurred lines between brand promotion and governing. “Neiman Marcus has a very small Ivanka Trump precious jewelry business which is [composed] 100% of consigned merchandise,” a Neiman Marcus representative told MarketWatch. “Based on productivity, we continuously assess whether our brands are carried in stores, on our website, or both.” Neiman Marcus, along with Macy’s Inc.

That, at least, is the clear implication of a nonpartisan report recently circulated to members of Congress. Trump stunned the world on Jan. 27 when he signed a sudden executive order suspending immigration for 90 days from seven mostly Muslim countries he deemed to have ties to Islamic terrorists, from Iran to Libya. But the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 grants “the President broad authority to bar or impose conditions upon the entry of aliens,” reports the CRS, a federal organization that provides authoritative, impartial and nonpartisan analysis of major issues for members of Congress. The law’s main limit on his powers is simply that “the President must have found that the entry of any aliens or class of aliens would be ‘detrimental to the interests of the United States.’” However, that’s not much of a limit at all, the CRS notes, because the law does not specify what is, or isn’t, detrimental. It’s up to the president to decide. Furthermore, the case law to date, while limited, “also supports the view that this provision of the INA confers broad authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens.” A 1993 ruling on the topic by the U.S. Supreme Court favored the president’s authority. The U.S. District Court for Northern California ruled in 1996 that “The exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty. The right to do so stems not alone from legislative power but is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation. When Congress prescribes a procedure concerning the admissibility of aliens, it is not dealing alone with a legislative power. It is implementing an inherent executive power.” The CRS report was published on Jan. 23, before Trump’s executive order, and is an overview of the principles involved rather than the specifics of this order or any other. Over the weekend close to 100 U.S. companies, most of them in the technology industry, filed a legal motion opposing the president’s immigration proposal. They argued it would harm their businesses. The companies’ amicus brief is long on political rhetoric and short on solid legal fundamentals. Yes, we are a nation of immigrants, and yes, many people are appalled by Trump’s executive order on political, moral, and economic grounds. But that cuts little ice with the law. Some parts of the brief are stronger than others. Will suspending immigration from, say, Yemen, or Sudan, or Somalia really hurt the ability of, for example, Apple, or Salesforce.com

                                   , to recruit talent? Will it interfere with top global technology conferences? The brief’s main legal argument may rest on a flawed premise. It argues that denying immigration visas based on “nationality” is unlawful. However, the CRS notes, distinctions between aliens based on nationality have usually been allowed by the courts subject only to a “deferential ‘rational basis’ review.” (In other words, the courts will defer to a president if he can argue some sort of rational basis for excluding certain nationals. He might have trouble banning immigrants from Finland, say, on the basis “I just don’t like them.”) Trump’s weakest terrain is on the subject of competence. The executive order was badly bungled. I doubt even Kellyanne Conway could make up a set of “alternative facts” to make it look otherwise. It wasn’t reviewed properly and the Keystone Cops in the White House apparently gave little thought to implementation. It brought chaos at airports. As some wit said, this was essentially a Tweet turned into a presidential order. The courts may decide it is overly broad or slapdash. Amazingly, Trump and his team either forgot to exclude U.S. green card holders from the ban, or couldn’t decide what to do about them and just left the issue up in the air for two days. That’s like forgetting to put gas in the car. It’s not a matter of debate, it’s just a screw-up. (There’s no plausible case for a blanket ban on green-card holders. And indeed, as permanent residents whose status is governed by statute, they may actually be immune from arbitrary presidential authority.) It would be a brave or foolish person who tried to predict with absolute certainty what the courts will do. But if the CRS is right, the betting would be on Trump to get his way.

His rationale is fairly simple. “I wanted to own some currency and no country wants its currency to strengthen,” He continued: “Gold was down a lot, so I bought it.” Check out: MarketWatch’s snapshot of the markets In fact, gold, viewed as a haven asset which often trades in the opposite direction of equities, has been on an upswing lately. Gold futures have climbed 2.8% in February and have gained about 7.9% year to date, according to FactSet data. April gold is trading at the highest level for a most-active contract since Nov. 10. Comparatively, the S&P 500 is up a meager 0.7% in February and about 2.5% so far this year. The Dow has gained 1% so far in February and 1.5% year to date. Only the Nasdaq Composite, on pace to register a 1.2% February climb and a 5.6% return this year, is even close to gold’s golden gains. So-called animal spirits were kindled when Trump won on Nov. 8, driving stocks higher on promises of a raft of pro-business policies. However, stocks which have crept into record territory in recent trade, have been mostly moving sideways amid confusion about the president’s legislative agenda. That includes his ability to prioritize tax cuts over controversial executive orders to ban travel from predominantly Muslim countries. Read: Fear in a time of Trump: How Wall Street thinks about risk The fact that gold is in ascendancy along with stocks is an oddity. But the precious metal is garnering some support from a number of factors. Inflation expectations are rising and gold tends to be used as hedge against inflation, or rising prices. Weakness in the dollar has also benefited dollar-priced metals, which tend to draw interests from buyers using other currencies. The dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar

                                   is down about 2% year to date after reaching a more than 14-year high in early January. Meanwhile, interest rates have been inching lower, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield at 2.349%—a three-week low. Shrinking yields can decrease the opportunity costs of owning assets with higher yields because metals don’t offer a yield. Geopolitical uncertainty, with elections in France and other parts of Europe threatening to destabilize the eurozone, also have played their part in lifting gold, which benefits in times of confusion and tumult. Some pundits and financial bloggers are forecasting big returns for gold, with Daily Reckoning blogger, Greg Guenthner, predicting a 20% rise for the yellow metal over the next several weeks as MarketWatch’s Barbara Kollmeyer points out in Need to Know. Investor takeaway: To be sure, it isn’t likely that a professional investor like Druckenmiller has all of his proverbial eggs in one basket. His Bloomberg interview doesn’t reveal the composition of his entire portfolio, but it may be worth noting that pros like Druckenmiller use commodities to hedge their bets. And, as he has demonstrated, he may not be eager to stay long gold for an extended period. But if Druckenmiller really wanted to make a play on metals he’d dump his dough in silver, gold’s sister metal.
